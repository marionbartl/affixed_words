Building Ejabberd Modules : A Build Tool Battle Won By Autotools
October 7 , 2008
I ’m building some new Erlang modules related to OpenMicroblogging and thought it would be good build them properly .
I wanted to be able to detect whether Erlang was installed , look for ejabberd header files , nsure that the ejabberd behaviors I needed were available , and compile and install the module .
Having recently written about various new build systems , I decided to explore these to find an acceptable solution to my problem .
The short answer is that it was n’t a very fun way to spend my time , and despite my strong dislike of autotools , I ended up using that in the end .
If you ’d like the gory details as well as example code , keep reading .
: EXTENDED :
First Attempt With Waf
Waf seemed quite promising when I looked at it before .
It used Python files to describe builds , had separate configuration and build steps , and it was even shippable along with the code .
I decided to start with waf .
The first problem I ran into is that the documentation for waf is either extremely out of date or much newer than the latest stable release .
Either way , the examples in the documentation failed completely because the API had changed .
I was able to get some very basic examples working after digging around for a while .
The second problem is that while waf is capable of building arbitrary things , there is essentially no documentation for how to set up custom builders .
The documentation assumes that everyone will be satisfied with the baked in languages .
Since I ’m compiling Erlang , and Erlang is n’t yet supported in waf , I was out of luck .
I made a half - hearted attempt to investigate the baked in builders in hopes of it being pretty easy , but I became frustrated and gave up .
Another thing I noticed about waf is that there does not appear to be a separate install step .
Installation seems to be part of the build step , and various options make it install happen or not while building .
This seems like a weird omission , although I am probably missing something .
Second Attempt With SCons
I ’ve used SCons before for Strophe .
It ’s not perfect , but I remember it working well enough and saving me from the horror of autotools .
In the three years since I first played with SCons , it has n’t changed much .
What it has gotten is bug fixes and documentation .
I was much more hopefully that SCons would work for me where waf had failed .
A Google search revealed that there was some 3rd party Erlang support for SCons .
The Web site is half broken , but I did manage to find and download the code .
It seems reasonable complete in that it supports building and dependency scanning for normal Erlang modules , Erlang applications , and EDoc documentation files .
There is a real problem with both SCons and the Erlang support though .
The issue is that SCons has to be installed for someone to build your package , and on top of that , SCons Erlang has to be installed as well .
SCons actually has a facility called site_scons for including extra build tools in your distribution so that they are available without having to install more stuff .
I think that SCons Erlang could be made to live in site_scons , but I ’m baffled why the author did n’t make this the default .
The SCons documentation on builders gives an example of this , and the custom builder examples in the SCons wiki follow suit .
I did make an attempt to write some simple Erlang builder rules in site_scons , but I could not get the code to function as the documentation suggested it should .
I suspect I was missing some small detail that is mentioned elsewhere in the manual than the examples I was following .
The final straw for me was the lack of a separate configuration step .
This needs an example to explain fully .
In order to find the ejabberd headers and modules , I need to pass in the path where ejabberd was installed .
In autotools , this would be done with an argument to configure like -- with - ejabberd= / path / to / ejabberd or -- prefix= / ejabberd / prefix .
SCons can take arguments but these have to be passed every time as there appears to be no built in facility for persisting the configuration for the build between invocations of SCons .
I think such a persistence facility could be written , or possibly has already been , but I could n’t find one and I was not in the mood to write my own .
After all , I already had the work of writing tests for finding headers and modules plus the work of getting SCons Erlang to work in site_scons .
Third Attempt With CMake
I did n’t spend much time with CMake .
I perused the documentation to see if it already supported Erlang or if it had examples on how to create custom builders .
My impression was that it supports C and C++ out of the box and not much else , and I could not find any examples of how to set up build rules for arbitrary languages .
I was left with a Win32 taste in my mouth due to the filename convention of CMakeLists .
txt as the build file names .
Since I did n’t see any examples for custom builders , and the syntax of the build description files was novel , I punted .
By this time I decided to give in and try autotools .
I managed to make it work eventually , but I ran into a lot of problems along the way .
Automake , You Suck
I first started with a basic configure .ac script which used automake .
Because automake is fairly hardcoded around C and C++ based development , you have to jump through some hoops to make it deal with Erlang at all .
Essentially you have to tell it that the Erlang files are data files derived from source files that automake should n’t care about .
Here is an example I found on the mailing list :
beam_DATA = netaccess.beam EXTRA_DIST = netaccess.erl CLEANFILES = $ ( beam_DATA ) .erl.beam : @ERLC@ - b beam $ @ $<
Sure this works , but it is a big , ugly hack .
Automake sucks for more reasons than not being very nice with Erlang files .
It creates a huge mountain of build steps .
It gets the job done , but the screen is filled with useless build output from all the intermediate steps .
I now that standard Makefiles can be simple and elegant , so I abandoned automake and crafted my own .
Autoconf Knows Erlang
One of the happy discoveries is that autoconf already understands Erlang .
In fact , it has numerous Erlang examples in the manual .
I added my AC_ERLANG_NEED_ERLC line and dived in .
My first job was to detect header files .
Autoconf does this for C type headers but does not include any support for Erlang headers .
I decided to write support for this building on top of the AC_COMPILE_IFELSE macro , which attempts to compile an Erlang problem when AC_LANG_ERLANG is effect .
This immediately fails because autoconf has a huge bug in its Erlang support .
It never defines $ ac_objext so ca n’t create BEAM files .
This is a known issue , but I do n’t understand how this code ever made it into autoconf in the first place if such a basic bit of functionality did n’t work .
This can be worked around , and here is my header checking macro , ERL_CHECK_HEADER :
# Check if we can find Erlang header files .
AC_DEFUN ([ERL_CHECK_HEADER ] , [ AC_MSG_CHECKING ( [ for $ 1 ] ) AC_LANG_PUSH ( Erlang ) ac_objext=beam AC_COMPILE_IFELSE ( [ AC_LANG_PROGRAM ( [ [ - include ( " $ 1 " ) . ] ] , [ [ ok ] ] ) ] , [ AC_MSG_RESULT ( [ok ] ) $ 2 ] , [ AC_MSG_RESULT ( [ not found ] ) $ 3 ] ) AC_LANG_POP ] )
I use this to detect ejabberd .hrl like so :
ERL_CHECK_HEADER(ejabberd.hrl , [ ] , [ AC_MSG_ERROR ( [ ejabberd.hrl is required . ] ) ] )
All is well and good so far .
The next problem is to detect whether specific modules are available .
Specifically , I want to know if autoconf can find the gen_mod module which any ejabberd module will need .
The location of this module will be needed during the compile stage .
Just like the header check , there is n’t much in autoconf ’s Erlang support to help us out .
It does have an AC_ERLANG_CHECK_LIB , but this only finds Erlang libraries , not modules .
Moreover , it ’s broken too .
There was a regression in autoconf 1.62 and later , still unfixed , which prevents AC_RUN_IFELSE from working .
This sucks , because AC_RUN_IFELSE is exactly what we need to write the ERL_CHECK_MODULE macro .
Patching this in aclocal .m4 fixes the regression , but we also need to pass in some options to erl when it runs the program .
This is , of course , not supported at all , and we have to patch this as well by passing in ERLFLAGS when erl is run so that it can hope to find the modules we ’re looking for .
The resulting macro is very similar to the one above except for the redefinition of AC_LANG_ERLANG that is needed to make it do anything useful .
I ’ve put up my basic ejabberd module autoconf project skeleton here others to study or enjoy .
A Note On Other Options
Notably missing from my attempts are plain Makefiles or Erlang Emakefiles .
Normal Makefiles work fine , but they do not provide any facility for configuration or detection of libraries .
Emakefiles are even worse , since there does n’t seem to be any standard way to include shell variables .
I did n’t want to hard code the configuration or require special environment variables like EJABBERD_HOME .
I realize autoconf is more than is needed for simple modules , but my goal was to explore build systems more than it was to do something practical .
That said , if you are going to package up a 3rd party ejabberd module , having configuration detection and support is very helpful for users .
Most people have no idea how to build C , much less Erlang .
The less we have to expose to them the better .
The benefit of autotools is that many users will already be familiar with ./ configure , make , and make install .
Several people suggested I check out zc.buildout , but this appears to be a meta system for configuring a bunch of dependencies along with a project that runs in the “ buildout ” .
This reminds me a lot of something like pbuilder a little more cleverly done .
It also seems very focused on Python .
Perhaps someone familiar with it can chime in as to how appropriate it is for something written in Erlang or C .
Thoughts
I was extremely disappointed in the non-autotools options .
Of the other three , SCons had the best documentation and examples by far .
Waf and CMake left a lot to be desired if one is not building a C project .
I ’d love to give the other systems another shot , and here ’s what I ’d like to see before doing so :
SCons -
I ’d love to see a way to include SCons with my distribution so that the only dependency is Python .
Waf does this very well , as does autotools .
Some improvements in the site_scons documentation would be nice as well .
- I ’d love to see a way to include SCons with my distribution so that the only dependency is Python .
Waf does this very well , as does autotools .
Some improvements in the documentation would be nice as well .
waf -
Waf really needs to get its act together documentation wise .
It ’s extremely frustrating to invest time in reading the documentation only to find out that it does not apply to the current version of the code .
Build systems like waf need to realize that they fill a great niche that is under - served by autotools , which is making custom build tools much easier to develop .
Lack of any examples in the documentation on how to do this make it harder than autotools .

I ’m willing to put up with arcane syntax as long as it works and is well documented .
If I have to read the code and pour through the build files of large projects to find information , I might as well read the source code for waf and solve the problem in a familiar domain .
As always , I ’d appreciate your comments .
Are you suffering with the un-fun , but reliable , autotools , or do you have a favorite alternative ?
An update on Shepherd Johnson , who lost 1,200 Flickr images over comments on White House photos : Yahoo said the activist 's pictures are gone forever , offered him $ 25 and blocked his messages .
And Flickr 's founder called him " a dick . "
Johnson , at least , has received a more clear explanation for why his account was summarily deleted with no warning : Heather Champ , Yahoo's VP of customer service , told him he had been " spamming " the White House photostream .
( Johnson has said he posted an initial batch of approximately 10 comments , then another 10 or so when those were deleted .
Yahoo has declined to address Johnson 's case directly with us . )
Champ also told Johnson the image he attached to his second batch of messages was too graphic .
The picture , which you can see here , was from the Abu Ghraib prison and was linked over by Johnson from another Flickr account .
Johnson , who has attended his share of political protests , was trying to draw attention to Barack Obama 's support for a controversial bill that would have suppressed government torture photos .
Champ broke out both the carrot and the stick .
She offered Johnson a $ 25 gift card he could use for a new Flickr Pro account .
" She tried to shower me with platitudes like " Oh I know you are passionate about this issue , ' " Johnson told us .
But she also told him there was no way to retrieve his old photos ; that seems unlikely , as it implies Yahoo has no backups of Flickr 's content .
Champ also blocked messages from Johnson 's new Flickr account on the internal FlickrMail system .
Following a phone conversation with Johnson , she had posted a picture indicating her day was n't going well , and Johnson had commented underneath the picture , " this is like watching a slow train wreck . "
She then blocked him .
So Johnson turned to Flickr founder Stewart Butterfield ( above ) , seeking help in reaching Champ .
Butterfield left Yahoo last year , but he said he could tell what was going on from a distance : Johnson must be in the wrong .
Their correspondence :
Yahoo's cuddly new head of PR , Eric Brown , might want to start exercising some message discipline over this situation .
Does the company regret its actions ( gift card ) or stand by them ?
Does it really have no backups of old pictures ?
What are the guidelines for commenting on the popular White House photostream ?
People will inevitably criticize Yahoo's answers to those questions , but at least they 'll have them .

UDC has been awarded a $ 750,000 contract from the US Air Force , to work on a non-glass , ejection - safe , flexible OLED display prototype for prospective use by pilots in tactical cockpit settings .
The idea is to provide pilots with a replacement for printed maps and checklists typically held on their knees .
The pilots will be able to ' wrap ' the OLED around a cylinder for easy storage during flight .
UDC are working on their flexible OLED together with L3 and LG Display , and have already shown some wearable ( bracelet ) prototypes before .
The displays are energy efficient , offer full - color video rate and have wireless communications capabilities .
UDC , LG and L3 will deliver four prototypes based on a bright 6 ” diagonal , full - color , low power consumption PHOLED display on flexible metal foil .
These displays will then be wrapped around cylinders containing power supplies and wireless communications electronics .
Mr Purnell called on Mr Brown to ' stand aside ' James Purnell has stepped down from the cabinet and told Prime Minister Gordon Brown to " stand aside " .
In a letter to several newspapers , the work and pensions secretary said Mr Brown 's continued leadership made a Tory victory " more , not less likely " .
It comes as Labour braces itself for bad results in English local elections .
Defence Secretary John Hutton said Mr Purnell had made " the wrong decision " and Mr Brown was " the right man to lead our party and our country " .
It is feared Labour may suffer badly in the elections from the MPs ' expenses revelations and doubts over Mr Brown 's leadership .
I firmly believe that Gordon Brown is the right man to lead our party and our country

Profile : James Purnell Purnell resignation letter
In quotes : Reaction as Purnell quits Purnell resignation leads papers
In the new Central Bedfordshire unitary authority Labour did not win a single seat , with 54 going to the Conservatives and 11 to the Liberal Democrats .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Purnell 's resignation was the first direct challenge to Mr Brown from a cabinet minister , and a message to the rest of the Labour Party to make up their minds about Mr Brown 's leadership .
He also said that , according to a Downing Street source , a reshuffle is likely as early as Friday morning .
Mr Purnell , who was one of the most prominent Blairites in Mr Brown 's top team , is the third cabinet member in three days to say they are standing down .
He added : " I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our party a fighting chance of winning .
As such I am resigning from government . "
The BBC understands Mr Purnell only came to his decision to resign on Thursday but is said to have been frustrated for some time .
' Undivided attention ' A Downing Street spokesman said : " The prime minister is disappointed by the resignation of James Purnell , of which he was informed shortly before 10 pm . "
He said Mr Brown 's focus over coming days would be " restructuring the government on the big challenges facing the country for the future " , tackling the global economic downturn , trust in Parliament and reforming public services .
" He will continue to give his undivided attention to addressing these great challenges facing our country and putting the interests of the British people first and foremost , " he said .
Mr Purnell , a former adviser and a current friend of Tony Blair's , has acted with the ruthlessness of his mentor
BBC political editor Nick Robinson Nick 's thoughts on James Purnell
Downing Street said Mr Brown was " disappointed " but would be getting on with the job but David Cameron said the government was " falling apart " .
Mr Brown was set to reshuffle his team within days as he fights to hang on to his tenure as prime minister .
Mr Purnell 's resignation comes as a BBC poll suggests fewer people consider the prime minister to be competent , decisive or tough than at any time in his leadership .
Only 29 % of the 1,005 adults surveyed by ICM for the BBC thought that Gordon Brown was in touch with ordinary people .
In contrast , David Cameron received his most favourable scores since he became Conservative leader .
' Fighting chance '
In his letter to Mr Brown , published in Friday 's newspapers , Mr Purnell said he owed it to the Labour Party to " say what I believe no matter how hard that may be " .
He said he was not seeking the leadership but wrote : " I now believe your continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more , not less likely .
That would be disastrous for our country . "
But Conservative leader Mr Cameron , repeating his call for an immediate general election , said : " In a deep recession and a political crisis we need a strong united government .
Instead we have a government falling apart in front of our eyes . "
Graham Allen , MP for Nottingham North , gave his backing to Mr Purnell .
He told Sky News he hoped Mr Brown would " take the honourable way out so that the party can progress with a leadership election " .
Meanwhile , other cabinet ministers have been rallying round Mr Brown .
Mr Hutton said Mr Purnell was a " good friend " but added : " I think he has made the wrong decision because I firmly believe that Gordon Brown is the right man to lead our party and our country . "
Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward also said he was " deeply disappointed " by Mr Purnell 's decision and that he fully backed Mr Brown .
' Ultra Blairite '
A source close to Justice Secretary Jack Straw said he was " very surprised and deeply saddened " by the news and " remained very supportive " of Mr Brown .
And the BBC understands Foreign Secretary David Miliband , who was touted as a possible challenger to Gordon Brown 's leadership last year , does not intend to resign and had said he did not agree with Mr Purnell .
Other Labour figures have strongly criticised the decision - former London mayor Ken Livingstone said it was no surprise as Mr Purnell had been " the most ultra-Blairite of ministers " .
" If you were going to get a knife in the back it 's where you would have expected it from , " he said .
MINISTERIAL RESIGNATIONS 4 June : James Purnell 3 June : Hazel Blears 2 June : Jacqui Smith 2 June : Beverley Hughes 2 June : Tom Watson
Allies of Brown go on offensive Cabinet falling apart - Cameron Backbencher Peter Kilfoyle , one of the few Labour MPs not to back Mr Brown for the leadership in 2007 , told the BBC : " I 'm very dismayed by the attitude of people like Purnell and indeed Hazel Blears . "
He said they had been " self serving " in backing Mr Brown for the leadership and the cabinet should back him now : " They have a wider responsibility than merely their personal careers .
It 's also about the future of the Labour Party , not just in government but in the country . "
The news comes as the polls closed across the UK for the European elections and , in England , 27 county and seven unitary council elections .
Secret ballot Senior Labour backbencher Barry Sheerman told the BBC there should be a ballot of Labour MPs to see if Gordon Brown still has the confidence of the party .
He said : " This goes far beyond just a few people , this is a large number of us who are really unhappy about the present situation . "
But Labour 's leader in the Lords Baroness Royall defended Mr Brown 's style of leadership on BBC One 's Question Time .

She said : " We have n't got a media star , we have got a person who works damned hard and is taking us through the economic crisis . "
There have been predictions Labour could be pushed into third or fourth place in the Euro elections behind the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) , following damaging revelations about expenses claims in the Daily Telegraph .
Mr Brown 's much anticipated reshuffle was pre-empted earlier this week with the news that Jacqui Smith had asked to step down as home secretary .
Fevered atmosphere
She later said she believed Gordon Brown was the right person to lead the Labour Party but was stepping down for her family - who had been " at the forefront " of expenses allegations against her .
Then Hazel Blears announced on Wednesday that she would be stepping down as communities secretary .
In her resignation statement she did not pay the customary tribute to the prime minister , who weeks ago had described her own actions on expenses as " totally unacceptable " .
Alistair Darling 's position as chancellor is also thought to be vulnerable after questions about his expenses .
Amid a fevered atmosphere at Westminster - where the expenses saga has dominated the agenda during the election - two junior ministers Beverley Hughes and Tom Watson have also said they are to step down .
Some Labour backbench
MPs say they are circulating a letter among MPs seeking support for a call on Mr Brown to go .
About 70 Labour MPs would be required to nominate a specific alternative candidate to trigger a leadership contest .

The Flying Hotel – Manned Cloud
This is an alternative project around leisure and traveling in all its form , economic and experimental , still with the idea of lightness , human experience and life scenarios as the guiding principles .
The spiral of Archimedes is the driving force of this airship in the form of a whale that glides through the air .
The airship is a floating hotel called the Manned Cloud , and according to its designers , it will be capable of circling the globe in a few days .
The 20 bedrooms will provide the ultimate room with a view as the airship cruises at a height of 18,000 ft , a capacity of 40 passengers and staffed with 15 persons , that on a 3 - day cruise in 170 km/h permits man to explore the world .
It has a restaurant , a library , a lounge and a gym on the first deck .
On the second level there will be 20 passenger rooms , terraces with panoramic windows , a spa and a bar room .
The airship is powered by a giant rear propeller and also has two further engines pointing downwards for vertical take - off .
The whale - shaped airship , developed with French national aerospace research body ONERA .
However , if you ’re thinking of checking in , you will have to wait until its expected launch date of 2020 .
I admit it I have become some what of a browse - aholic on a local TV stations classified ads board .

Suicide rate increasing in the land of happiness
In 1972 , the number one priority of new King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan was the country ’s Happiness .
It reads like the beginning of a children ’s story , but it ’s a real quantifiable concept .
A measure of overall personal satisfaction weighed against detrimental factors such as stress and depression , Gross National Happiness remains the pride of this Himalayan state today , considered even more important than the Gross National Product .
Recently , however , its high GNH has been called into question with an inexplicable surge in the suicide rate .
Kuensel , the country ’s main newspaper , investigated and found some shocking numbers .
BBC
News elaborates :
‘ In some villages , committing suicide has almost become a norm , ” [ Kuensel ] says .
Official figures show that the highest number of suicides was in 2001 , when 58 people killed themselves .
The lowest number was in 2006 , when 34 people committed suicide .
Bhutan ’s population is 682,000 people .
The figures have concerned the government - which is expanding a counselling service in schools to help teenagers who feel depressed .
Correspondents say that the figures are surprising , especially when the country ’s two main religions - Hinduism and Buddism - believe that a person who commits suicide will not be reborn as human being . ”
Secretary of the Gross National Happiness Commission Karma Tsheetem concludes , “ It means there has to be a better balance between spiritual and the material . ”
Hopefully this balance will be restored and we ’ll see a spike in the GNH soon .

When a webpage is designed to display large tables of data , a great amount of consideration should be dedicated to allowing the user to sort through the data in a structured manner .
In this article , I will go over four techniques : hover effects , zebra rows , filtering , and sorting .
Setting Up The Tables
There are some important notes we must address before looking at our Javascript code .
The HTML table markup will be like any other table you may have created , except we
require two tags that many people omit .
The head section of the table must be wrapped in < thead ></ thead >.
The body of the
table , where all the data we want to display is kept , must be wrapped in < tbody > </ tbody >.
This little caveat will make it easier for us to distinguish
between the data and table headers .
Zebra Rows
Zebra Rows are a very common data organization technique that are both easy to implement and have a powerful impact .
Zebra Rows in
essence is alternating the style of odd and even rows to make the data easier to read horizontally .
This is highly important with
multi -column data so that users can look at one column and easily read the associated data on the same row under other headers .
In the
examples that I will be using through out this tutorial , I have a list of people with four properties : first name , last name , city , and
state .
Notice how I have the row colors alternating as well as font color to maximize the effect .
Now on to the actual Zebra Rows .
The first place to start is an external CSS file linked to the document .
The first element to
target is the table .
This is fairly trivial ; we are telling the table background to be white , and to stretch to 100 % of the parent element 's width .
Next we will target
the cell elements < td > .
Now this might seem odd to some -- why would we target the cells , and not the entire row ?
Well it turns out that , in
terms of cross - browser adoption , it is more effective to target cells when applying background styles .
Here we are setting up a class for the " odd " table rows that sets an alternate background - color and font - color .
We also set a default style for all td
elements which will inherently apply to the " even " rows .
This is all the CSS that is required .
I told you it was simple !
Now let 's look at the jQuery code .
The
power of jQuery selectors makes this just as easy as the CSS code .
All we need to do is target the cells and use the addClassName function .
This code , while short , has a few gotchas to consider .
First off notice how we abstracted the implementation to a function ; this is ideal because if we change the
data in the table asynchronously , without a page refresh , then we will want to assure the rows are still alternating style .
For the same reason we also invoke the
removeClass function so that if a row is initially odd , but becomes even , we are assured that the odd class definition does not remain .
This may seem confusing right now ,
but when we look at filtering later on this will become more clear .
For the sake of reusable code we also require that the selector and class name are passed to
the function -- so it can be used in projects that have different class names or selector requirements ( i.e. a site that has multiple tables only one of
which you wish to target ) .
If you review the ready ( ) function , a jQuery function executed when the page is
finished loading , you 'll see our call to zebraRows ( ) .
Here is where we pass in the selector and class name .
The selector uses a special jQuery syntax
: odd , which will find all odd rows .
Then we look for all the child elements of the row that are cells .
This code
is fairly simple for anyone who has used jQuery previously , but the simplicity should make the code fairly readable to anyone .
Note :
While using jQuery to apply alternating row colors is a simple solution , it is not degradable if a user has JavaScript disabled .
I would
recommend applying the odd class on the server either in PHP code or the static HTML , though this is beyond the scope of this article .
Hover Effect
A really nice effect for users is to highlight the row they are currently hovering upon .
This is a great way to single out specific data that they might be interested
in .
This is dead simple to implement using jQuery , but first a little CSS .
This is all the CSS we need , basically when we hover over a row , we want to make all the cells in that row have a light blue background and a grey font color .
The
j Query to make this happen is just as simple .
We are making use of the hover ( ) function in the jQuery library .
It takes two arguments that are
functions we want executed when the mouse hovers over and when the mouse moves off the element , respectively .
When they hover over a row we want to find all
the cells within the row and add the hovered class to them .
When the mouse leaves the element we want to then remove that class .
This is all we have to do to
get the hover effect , go try it out !
Filtering Data
Now the meaty stuff - actually manipulating the data that is shown .
If a website calls for many records of data to be displayed , in my example 1000 rows , then it
is more than appropriate to offer the user a way to sift through the data .
One particularly effective way that has sprung up on the web in recent years as part of
the Web2.0 / AJAX movement is filtering .
This is also something that Apple pushes heavily in there applications such as iTunes .
The goal for us is to allow the user
to type a search query into a standard text input and live filter the table rows below only showing the ones that contain matching text .
This is arguably more
advanced then the alternating row styles , but in all reality requires minimal code , due to jQuery 's built - in functionality .
First we will write a generic function that takes a selector and a string of text .
This function will then search all elements matching that selector looking for
the string .
If it finds the string , it will show the element and apply a class name of visible to the element , otherwise it hide the element .
Why are we applying
the class of visible ?
Well once the items are sorted we will want to run the zebraRows function again , but we need to tell jQuery to ignore the hidden rows , and
the best way I have found to do that is apply a class of visible .
The actual searching is done by the JavaScript function , aptly named , search ( ) .
Though due to the way the DOM works , if we do n't employ the jQuery function ,
text ( ) , the box will also look at any HTML tags that happen to be in the table row , such as < td > .
We
will employ a little more functionality by not just searching for the exact string the user has typed , but rather if any of the words in the query are in a row .
This is ideal because it allows for " lazy searching " , the user is n't required to remember an exact string but rather just parts of it .
The search ( ) function takes
a regular expression as its parameter , and so we must strip all white space from the beginning and end of our query and put " | " characters in between each word to
achieve the OR functionality we desire .
Regular expressions are a very complicated topic , and so you will have to take my code at face value or I can refer you to
the Regular Expressions for Dummies video series on the ThemeForest blog .
The sixth line is where the magic happens , and probably requires a bit of explanation .
Starting at line 5 , we are telling the code to loop through all the elements
that match the selector , i.e. the rows , and then we want to execute the code on line 6 using each one .
Line 6 is a bit complicated if you are new to programming ,
but it is fairly easy to grasp if we split it up .
Think of everything before the question mark as being a question , if the answer to that question is true then
execute the code to the left of the colon , but after the question mark .
If the answer is false then execute the code after the colon .
This is essentially an if
statement but in a more concise form known as a ternary operator , and would be no different than writing :
The reason we ask if search ( ) returns " less than zero , we test that condition .
In theory there is nothing wrong with checking if it returns ( == ) - 1 , but it in practice it is safer to just assure it is
less than zero .
Alright now that we have a complete filter function , let 's use jQuery events to hook it up to the input .
To achieve the live effect we desire the event we want to
watch for is when user releases a key while they are focused on the text box , known as keyup in JavaScript .
It is important that we set the ID attribute of the
input so we can target it using jQuery .
Back in our ready function we need to add code after our call to zebraRows ( ) .
And the jQuery code :
This code is by far the most complex we have seen thus far so we will step through it line by line .
Starting at the addClass ( ' visible ' ) line we are adding a class
of visible to each row , because by default they are all visible .
The next line is your standard selector , which in my case is targeting my filter text box and says
each time a key is released to execute the following function .
Notice that we pass in a parameter called event which has various information about what the user
just did , like the key they pressed .
Consequently , the next line of code uses that event parameter , we have an if statement that is checking if the user pressed
the esc key .
It is important to note that each key is mapped to a number and that is how our code can determine which key the user pressed .
This is a nice feature
so that users can easily cancel the filter and see all the data again .
Many applications with filter boxes utilize this sort
of feature , and we want to be sure our application stays inline with what is expected .
In this same if statement we are also taking care of the special case when
the value of the filter box is empty ( they just hit backspace to remove all characters ) .
In this case we want the user to see all the rows which seems obvious , but
we have to explicitly provide for this because
the filter function we wrote earlier would look for a row that has no contents and we will hide all the rows that have any content , the exact opposite of what we
want !
If either of these conditions are met we want to set the value of the filter box to blank if they pressed esc , it is also executed if the value is blank
which does n't really matter to us .
Next we show all the rows as we wanted to and add a class of visible to all of them .
Again we are using the safe practice of
first removing any lingering visible class declarations to avoid double setting it .
If the value of the filter box is neither empty and the user did n't press
escape we want to actually filter the rows .
So after the else statement we call our filter function from earlier providing the rows in our table body to query
against .
Finally after we have hidden and shown the appropriate rows , we want to reapply zebraRows to the remaining visible rows .
First we remove any lingering
odd class declarations to take care of the cases where a row was odd and becomes even .
The call to zebraRows is the exact same as the first one on page load ,
except we only care about the ones that are currently visible and odd .
Note : A good note might be to use CSS to hide the filter box , and right above the keyup call to show it , so users with JavaScript disabled are not
confused when they attempt to sort the data , this would look like :
style.css application.js
Wow that was a lot of code , feel free to take a tea / coffee break before we move on to sorting ...
Column Sorting
Alright all ready ?
Good , lets go !
As the final task , we are going to allow sorting the table by any of the column headers .
This is very standard practice that users anticipate known as click to sort .
When the user clicks one of the headers we want to sort the table ascending and if they click again we want to sort descending by that column .
This code is quite
advanced and not for the faint at heart .
The initial concept came from
Learning jQuery 1.3 . I
have re-engineered it to better fit our needs of simplicity though , however if you desire more fine grain control I will refer you to chapter 7 of the book where
tables and jQuery are discussed in great detail .
Before we really dive into the actual code it is important that we discuss the concept of how we plan to tackle this problem .
We will use JavaScript 's internal
sort ( ) method that is designed to take an array and sort it
using a custom function supplied by the code .
In our case we simply want to sort alphabetically and numerically , so we will just compare the two items it supplies
and return which order the two should go in based on that design .
Because we want to sort both ascending and descending , we will use a CSS class declaration to see
what the current state of the sort by that column is and reverse it if necessary .
Once we have our array in order we will use the order to re-insert the rows
into the table one - by - one .
This sounds like a lot , but because of how blazing fast JavaScript is , it will be very seamless to the user .
All of
this will be tied to the click event of the column headers in the table .
As per usual , let 's get the CSS code out of the way , as it is the most straightforward .
All of our sortable headers will have a class of sortable , and the hover modifier in CSS makes it emulate a hyperlink for users .
We also are taking advantage of
the CSS class we mentioned about sorted - asc and sorted - desc so that we can show the user the current column that is sorting the table .
I did n't include it but
this would be a good place to put background images of arrows pointing up and down as a further visual cue to the user .
Now we move on the JavaScript code and the
complexity of sorting , thankfully made easier with jQuery .
The code below belongs in the ready ( ) function we started way back at the beginning .
Placing this right
above the end of the function is best .
Woo , that is a lot of code .
Let 's break that down into sizable bits .
The first bit of code is grabbing all the headers and looping through them .
The first thing
it does is add a class of of sortable , and starts to the click bind .
Note that this can easily be changed to allow only certain columns to be sortable by removing the addClass ( ) call and changing the selector from ' thead th' to
something like ' thead th.sortable ' .
Of course this requires you to manually specify which of your columns are sortable by adding class = " sortable " to the
appropriate headers in the HTML code .
The next bit of code is a function declaration tied to a variable .
This might seem a bit weird to those unfamiliar to programming , but it is common practice .
This
allows us to easily reference the function specifically in the context of the header we are working on .
That explanation probably is a bit confusing , but the
precise reasoning kind of oversteps the scope of this article .
The point of the findSortKey function is determine which column we are sorting by , we can do this
because we know the element they clicked on is the same index in the table for all the columns we will compare .
For instance if they click the third header we
want to look at the third column of each row to compare what order to place the rows .
After we declare this function we then determine the sort order , ascending
or descending .
This is done by looking for the class name of ' sorted - asc ' in the table header if it is there we know that it is currently sorted as ascending and
we need to make descending , otherwise use the default of ascending .
This takes care of the case where it is descending and we need to make it ascending again .
This bit of code returns 1 or - 1 , we will explain why later .
Now we want to get that specific column from each row and put it in an array , this is done using the jQuery method of
get ( ) which takes the rows and puts them in an array which the sort ( ) function can understand .
Because the current
selector was the table head we have to step back up the DOM tree 3 places to find table > tbody > tr>td .
Seems a little complex , but in reality it is simple .
After
that we loop through each of the rows we just found and find the column we want to using in sorting .
This is done by checking if its index ( the number of places
starting at 0 from the first column in the table ) is equal to the index of the clicked header .
This is then passed into the findSortKey function so we can
then set a custom attribute called sortKey that contains the column header we are sorting by and the text of the current column we are looking both of which are
set to uppercase so the sort is case - insensitive .
This is a way we streamline the sorting so that we make it more responsive for large amounts of data .
Next comes the actual sort ( ) function that I have been going on about .
This is called on the array of rows we created using get ( ) .
The only parameter we pass is the
function we want to determine the sorting .
That function receives two attributes to compare and returns 1 if the first is greater , - 1 if the second is great , and 0
if they are equal .
This is where the sortDirection variable comes into play because the way it works is that we set 1 or - 1 to it and then multiply either the
1 or - 1 the function should return by sortDirection , achieving the ascending / descending affect we desire .
The next bit of code simply adds each row from the now sorted array back into the DOM structure .
This is done with the append function which is nice because it
does not copy the row and place it at the end it actually removes it from the current place in the DOM and places where we tell it , in this case at the end of the
table .
After it has done this for each element in the array it will have moved each row to its new place .
Also to do a bit of cleanup we remove the sortKey
attribute we set earlier .
We are now moving in to the cleanup stage of our function since all the heavy lifting has been done .
Next we grab all the cells in the table body , remove any
lingering sorted attributes in the class declarations , and then filter out all but the columns that are the same index as our sorted header and apply the ' sorted '
class to them .
This is nice for CSS targeting if for instance we wanted to make the column we sort by a different color we could declare this CSS :
The final thing we do is remove any ' odd ' CSS declarations and reapply the Zebra Rows just like we did in the filter part .
That is how we do very simple sorting .
It is important to note that this will only sort items alphabetically or numerically and does not work with dates or currency
for instance .
That requires more specialized handling that is beyond our goals of simple table manipulation .
Wrap Up
In this article , we learned how to roll our own table manipulation code using jQuery .
This is
very convenient for both the user and us .
The user gets the expected controls for sorting and filtering the data and we have code that is both small and easy to
understand .
Because we wrote this ourselves , we can now extend it in our own ways .
Our method is great for simple manipulation , but if you require the kitchen sink , I recommend taking a look at the
Data Tables plugin for jQuery .

This much we know :
Hand evil a big , sticky gob of power , and it quickly becomes a feral monster , dangerous and cruel and willing to sell its own shriveled heart and the heart of its very remorseful mother for a shot at everlasting infamy , even more power and maybe some fresh , raw kitten blood , intravenously , just for the hell of it .
Oh , but take that same vile leviathan and suddenly strip away all its power and influence and capacity for wickedness , and watch it deflate like a wheezing circus tent , quickly turning into a trembling caricature of its former self , a tiny , elfin thing small enough to fit into a shoebox of panic and pathos and residual Godspit .
Behold , this delightful rule in full effect with the once portentous , now pitiable Republican party .
Watch in wonder as gaffe follows gaffe , astonishing pronouncement follows childish meltdown , ludicrous statement leads into pure comedy of errors followed by moderate 40 - year veterans of the party splitting for bluer , less abusive pastures .
What a scene .
There is much good news to be found in the ongoing GOP implosion ; their obsession with ' wedge issues ' like abortion and gay marriage , along with hilarious claims of socialism and fascism are proving to be the absolute best news for the nation as a whole .
Because as the GOP wallows in juvenile spectacle , Obama and the Dems are leaping headlong into one of the most ambitious , invigorating , nation - altering agendas in American history .
Of course , it ain't all flowers and candy .
This much unfettered movement for any party , left or right , can also be just insanely dangerous , could theoretically result in a blowback for the Dems exactly as destructive and apocalyptic as the horrendous Bush Era proved to be for the once - temperate Repubs .
Is it already heading that way ?
Will it happen ?
Not a chance .
But before we see why , let us enjoy a bit of the comedy .
Because really , who could 've guessed that , for example , former drug addict and all around bulbous , cigar - chomping radio jackal Rush Limbaugh would turn into the most influential conservative in the country , more powerful than , say , the GOP 's own chairman , Michael Steele , who was recently found kneeling to kiss Rush 's fat , sweaty ring ?
Ah , but even Rush can't match the genuine lump of crazy that is the latest bearded lady to step onstage at the Fox News freakshow , Glenn Beck , a truly insane hunk of weirdness who 's fun to watch not for any attempt at genuine insight or O'Reilly - esque pseudo - intelligence , but because of how he endears himself to viewers by acting exactly like your crazy uncle Ernie , the one who eats Miracle
Whip straight from the jar and hears voices in his armpits and stares just a bit too long at any 10 - year - old within range .
Weep on , Glenn !
But weep not for Miss California , who 's happy as a Prozac clam to take on the title as the new face of Republican hetero marriage .
Is n't she lovely ?
A skinny , fake - breasted blonde mouthful of air who does exactly as she 's told and never questions her scary Bible and does n't really like sex and you want to stick that thing where ?
Ewww !
She 's perfect .
What , too trifling ?
I understand .
Let 's get serious .
Let 's talk about the economy .
Let 's take a look at the Republican 's counter - proposal to Obama 's stunning , comprehensive $ 3.5 trillion budget .
Did you see it ?
Their little blue pamphlet , all 18 pages of it , which contained not a single dollar figure and was filled with bizarre little diagrams and wacky clip art circa 1988 , and looked like it was photocopied at a 24 - hour Kinko's by a very stoned senator 's aide , because it was ?
When the " Republican Road to Recovery " was passed around , reporters actually laughed out loud , thought it must be some sort of gag written by the guys over at The Onion .
It was n't .
Speaking of serious , what of those 17 Republican congressmen who seriously proposed a resolution to rename the Democratic Party the " Democratic Socialist Party ? "
So cute !
Of course , the name they really wanted , " The Boogerbrained Party of Doodylicking Stupidheads , " was nixed after they all rode their skateboards to John Boehner 's ' house and played Resident Evil V until their eyes bled and Boehner 's mom made them some sugar cookies and they totally forgot .
But for sheer freakshow fun , nothing tops Fox News furiously masturbating itself raw over the biggest imitation news story it could possibly invent this year : the Great Tea Bag Uproar of 2009 , featuring a few thousand very confused taxpayers protesting ... well , they were n't exactly sure what , waving tea bags in the air and threatening to secede and then talking hotly about " teabagging " the president , as Jon Stewart nearly fell out of his chair , laughing .
Delightful .
The list , as they say , goes on .
Witness every utterance of Michele Bachmann , see the new GOP promotional video featuring a burning Pentagon and Obama touching Hugo Chavez , or tremble in fear at a special Fox News report on how the SuperDevil is currently terrorizing Christian children with adulterous marmalade .
I am so not kidding .
Ah , but we must acknowledge the potential downside .
Because it was n't that long ago that the Dems were much like the Repubs are now , the meek , humiliated party of desperation and pathos , begging for scraps from the freakishly empowered GOP of 1998 .
Remember ?
Of course , you might ( rightly ) understate that the current Obamafied agenda is just slightly different than the toxic plan the GOP vomited up under Bush back then , which was perhaps the most abusive , insular , self - serving hunk of political devastation in our short history , and therefore the GOP fully deserved to go from all - consuming , unstoppable force to adorable punch line in the blink of a Kansas creationist 's eye .
But that 's not really the key difference .
No , this time the Dems just so happen to be blessed beyond human comprehension with something very unique indeed , a true golden ticket , a magic death - ray force field of intellectual virtuosity even they do n't seem to fully comprehend or know how to keep up with .
They have Barack Obama himself .
Truly , the man outpaces and outshines even his own party .
At nearly every turn , Obama often seems to be merely tolerating the whole two - party system , the whole D.C. dance he 's forced to waltz , all of it merely a distraction to getting things done .
It 's as though he's an entirely new political mechanism , and the Dems just happen to be lucky enough to be the party that 's most aligned with it .
Meanwhile , it 's all apparently driving the opposition party -- quite literally -- insane .
And really , is n't that just that the most delightful thing to watch ?

BAGHDAD  A bomb placed in a motorbike exploded at an outdoor market in Baghdad on Friday , killing about a dozen people and wounding scores .
It marked the third straight day of violence in the capital before the Tuesday deadline for American combat troops to withdraw from Iraqi cities .
After another similar bombing outside a billiard hall in Baghdad later on Friday that killed two people and wounded seven , the authorities ordered all motorbikes off the streets indefinitely .
Nearly 200 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in attacks over the past week in Baghdad and elsewhere in the country , with the deadliest attacks aimed at Shiites .
The violence has raised fears of a new bout of sectarian warfare of the sort that ripped Iraq apart in 2005 , and that could lead Iraqis once again to seek the protection of militias and armed groups instead of government forces .
The reaction by Shiite leaders echoed those concerns .
The bombing on Friday ripped through a market for new and secondhand motorbikes held each week under a bridge in the working - class neighborhood of Nahdha in central Baghdad .

Seaside Moon Mirage
Credit & Copyright : Jean - Marc Audrin
Explanation :
This surprising view of the Full Moon rising on June 7 was captured with a telephoto lens from a seaside balcony near Nice , France .
The orange Moon 's dark markings and odd shape put the photographer in mind of an alien creature 's face staring down at the passing ship .
Of course , the Moon 's distorted appearance is due to the unusual bending ( refraction ) of light rays creating multiple images or mirages , similar to sunset and sunrise mirages .
The effects are most pronounced when temperature layers in the atmosphere produce sharp changes in air density and refractive index .
Acting over long sight - lines to the rising and setting Sun or Moon , the refraction significantly alters the path of light rays creating merged , distorted images .
Such mirages are also associated with the Green Flash .
Picture this :
You ’re shopping for a larger home , dropping by open houses on a weekend .
Each house you visit has an easy - to - understand disclosure about something that ’s typically unknown today -- its energy - guzzling costs per year .
The Obama administration ’s top housing official -- Shaun Donovan , secretary of Housing and Urban Development -- thinks consumers deserve more information on the energy efficiency of the houses they buy , both resale and newly built .
And he thinks mortgages should come with lower rates or better terms to encourage purchases and retrofits that save energy .
“ When you buy a car , ” he said , “ you know very clearly what the energy efficiency of that is because there ’s a number on the window .
It says : Here ’s the gas mileage .
We do n’t know that for housing . ”
A Harvard - trained architect who ran New York City ’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development for four years before coming to HUD , Donovan said his agency was in the early stages of discussions with federal energy officials to develop “ a relatively simple scoring system for housing that would allow you to understand what you ’re buying and at the same time allow lenders to factor that into their mortgage .
Ultimately , if your energy bills are going to be lower , there ought to be some [ mortgage ] benefits to that . ”
The system might also factor in transportation costs to employment centers in some way , he said , because “ most people do n’t realize that the average American family spends over 50 % of their income on a combination of housing and transportation . ”
Even with far - flung suburbs ’ lower prices for houses , “ their transportation costs are huge ” -- and metropolitan sprawl itself represents a massive energy - consumption inefficiency .
Mortgage terms -- higher loan amounts for buyers to make energy - conserving improvements , lower mortgage rates for energy - efficient homes -- “ can be a very powerful tool ” in residential energy conservation , Donovan said , and the booming Federal Housing Administration insurance program would be a good place to start .
“ If in the long run there ’s a cost of $ 5,000 to upgrade a house that will produce $ 10,000 in savings over time for utilities , the perfect tool to realize those savings is a mortgage , ” he said .
Although Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the FHA all have had versions of “ energy - efficient mortgages ” on the books for years , their programs have been poorly marketed and little used .
Donovan wants to revive and improve the concept .
In a wide - ranging discussion , Donovan also touched on a variety of other issues .
On national housing policy , he believes that although “ homeownership is a very important national goal , ” federal policy is “ imbalanced ” -- overwhelmingly favoring single - family ownership over rental housing options , which tend to allow greater density and more - efficient land use .
Rather than try to limit federal tax breaks that are heavily skewed to ownership , Donovan would prefer to expand and improve the FHA ’s apartment - financing programs and produce more rental housing options in general .
On tax issues , Donovan believes that there are millions of potential buyers of houses who do not itemize deductions and would not now qualify for money - saving write - offs for mortgage interest and property taxes .
In his view , they should receive some form of federal tax break , as proposed by Obama during his campaign .
Donovan also believes that there has been a misperception about the administration ’s budget proposal to limit deductions for upper - income households earning $ 250,000 or more .
This “ was n’t targeted at the mortgage interest deduction , ” he said , but rather “ was really about deductions more broadly , ” because taxpayers in higher brackets get far greater benefits for making charitable contributions or owning a home than households in the middle and lower brackets .
On the FHA , Donovan is “ absolutely concerned ” by its explosive growth -- from less than a 3 % market share during the boom years to more than 30 % today .
That sort of rapid expansion increases the potential for fraud and bad loans slipping through , which is why he is pressing congressional appropriations committees for money to upgrade the FHA ’s computer systems and monitoring ability , plus adding staff .

" Never , ever mess with a diva who wears stilettos and diamonds , " said Lisa Gutierrez in The Kansas City Star .
On her new single , " Obsessed , " Maria Carey " throws some mean musical punches at — everyone assumes — Eminem , " in retaliation for his jabs at her in one of his latest songs .
It could also be " shrapnel from a long - standing battle between the two , who disagree on whether they got romantic a few years back — Eminem says they did , she says they did n't . "
" Could this be the first time a diva trumps a rapper in a hip - hop beef ? " said Glenn Gamboa in Newsday.com .
Carey goes for the jugular on " Obsession , " referring to Eminem 's " Napoleon complex " and delivering lines like , " You 're a mom - and - pop , I 'm a corporation . "
And even while she " throws some elbows , " she still " coos confidently . "
Eminem has been " torn down by Mariah " — this round goes to her .
This is certainly " a feistier Mimi than we 're used to , " said Todd Martens in the Los Angeles Times .
" Obsessed " features " put - down after put - down , " but " the high road would have been " for Mariah to " ignore " Eminem 's attacks against her .
" But the sophisticated route does n't always generate hype , " which is clearly all she 's trying to do here — and it seems kind of desperate .
JibJab does eCards , but they 're probably best known for meme worthy videos , a prime example being their election video ditty in 2008 .
And if history is any indication , these guys will create quite a stir with their latest video , He 's Barack Obama .
The head honchos at JibJab , brothers Gregg and Evan Spiridellis , are debuting their latest creation in front of the President himself .
The duo are showing off their soon - to - be viral video hit in front of Barack Obama at the 65th Annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner tonight .
He 's Barack Obama follows our new President as he tackles the challenges of the world at large in super hero form , suit and all .
The video is set to a heavy metal interpretation — far from the banjo - style we 've come to love — of the historic song , When Johnny Comes Marching Home .
The Spiridellis ' used their reputation as web video superstars to tap composer John Frizzell to direct the extra special composition .
The rock star lineup includes Chris Shiflett and Taylor Hawkins ( Foo Fighters ) , Chris Chaney ( Jane 's Addiction ) , Roger Joseph Manning Jr. ( Jellyfish , Beck ) , and Jess Harnell .
The video has just hit the Web and was sent straightaway to us , so without further ado , here 's He 's Barack Obama :
The endocrine system includes all of the glands of the body and the hormones produced by those glands .
The glands are controlled directly by stimulation from the nervous system as well as by chemical receptors in the blood and hormones produced by other glands .
By regulating the functions of organs in the body , these glands help to maintain the body ’s homeostasis .
Cellular metabolism , reproduction , sexual development , sugar and mineral homeostasis , heart rate , and digestion are among the many processes regulated by the actions of hormones .

Anatomy of the Endocrine System
Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus is a part of the brain located superior and anterior to the brain stem and inferior to the thalamus .
It serves many different functions in the nervous system , and is also responsible for the direct control of the endocrine system through the pituitary gland .
The hypothalamus contains special cells called neurosecretory cells — neurons that secrete hormones :
Thyrotropin - releasing hormone ( TRH )
Growth hormone - releasing hormone ( GHRH )
Growth hormone - inhibiting hormone ( GHIH )
Gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH )
Corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH )
Oxytocin
Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH )
All of the releasing and inhibiting hormones affect the function of the anterior pituitary gland .
TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release thyroid - stimulating hormone .
GHRH and GHIH work to regulate the release of growth hormone — GHRH stimulates growth hormone release , GHIH inhibits its release .
GnRH stimulates the release of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone while CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone .
The last two hormones — oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone — are produced by the hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary , where they are stored and later released .
Pituitary Gland
The pituitary gland , also known as the hypophysis , is a small pea-sized lump of tissue connected to the inferior portion of the hypothalamus of the brain .
Many blood vessels surround the pituitary gland to carry the hormones it releases throughout the body .
Situated in a small depression in the sphenoid bone called the sella turcica , the pituitary gland is actually made of 2 completely separate structures : the posterior and anterior pituitary glands .
Posterior Pituitary
The posterior pituitary gland is actually not glandular tissue at all , but nervous tissue instead .
The posterior pituitary is a small extension of the hypothalamus through which the axons of some of the neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus extend .
These neurosecretory cells create 2 hormones in the hypothalamus that are stored and released by the posterior pituitary :
Oxytocin triggers uterine contractions during childbirth and the release of milk during breastfeeding .
Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) prevents water loss in the body by increasing the re-uptake of water in the kidneys and reducing blood flow to sweat glands .
Anterior Pituitary
The anterior pituitary gland is the true glandular part of the pituitary gland .
The function of the anterior pituitary gland is controlled by the releasing and inhibiting hormones of the hypothalamus .
The anterior pituitary produces 6 important hormones :
Thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , as its name suggests , is a tropic hormone responsible for the stimulation of the thyroid gland .
Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulates the adrenal cortex , the outer part of the adrenal gland , to produce its hormones .
Follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) stimulates the follicle cells of the gonads to produce gametes — ova in females and sperm in males .
Luteinizing hormone ( LH ) stimulates the gonads to produce the sex hormones — estrogens in females and testosterone in males .
Human growth hormone ( HGH ) affects many target cells throughout the body by stimulating their growth , repair , and reproduction .
Prolactin ( PRL ) has many effects on the body , chief of which is that it stimulates the mammary glands of the breast to produce milk .
Pineal Gland
The pineal gland is a small pinecone - shaped mass of glandular tissue found just posterior to the thalamus of the brain .
The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin that helps to regulate the human sleep - wake cycle known as the circadian rhythm .
The activity of the pineal gland is inhibited by stimulation from the photoreceptors of the retina .
This light sensitivity causes melatonin to be produced only in low light or darkness .
Increased melatonin production causes humans to feel drowsy at nighttime when the pineal gland is active .
Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is a butterfly - shaped gland located at the base of the neck and wrapped around the lateral sides of the trachea .
The thyroid gland produces 3 major hormones :
Calcitonin
Triiodothyronine ( T3 )
Thyroxine ( T4 )
Calcitonin is released when calcium ion levels in the blood rise above a certain set point .
Calcitonin functions to reduce the concentration of calcium ions in the blood by aiding the absorption of calcium into the matrix of bones .
The hormones T3 and T4 work together to regulate the body ’s metabolic rate .
Increased levels of T3 and T4 lead to increased cellular activity and energy usage in the body .
Parathyroid Glands
The parathyroid glands are 4 small masses of glandular tissue found on the posterior side of the thyroid gland .
The parathyroid glands produce the hormone parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which is involved in calcium ion homeostasis .
PTH is released from the parathyroid glands when calcium ion levels in the blood drop below a set point .
PTH stimulates the osteoclasts to break down the calcium containing bone matrix to release free calcium ions into the bloodstream .
PTH also triggers the kidneys to return calcium ions filtered out of the blood back to the bloodstream so that it is conserved .
Adrenal Glands
The adrenal glands are a pair of roughly triangular glands found immediately superior to the kidneys .
The adrenal glands are each made of 2 distinct layers , each with their own unique functions : the outer adrenal cortex and inner adrenal medulla .
Adrenal cortex
The adrenal cortex produces many cortical hormones in 3 classes : glucocorticoids , mineralocorticoids , and androgens .
Glucocorticoids have many diverse functions , including the breakdown of proteins and lipids to produce glucose .
Glucocorticoids also function to reduce inflammation and immune response .
Mineralocorticoids , as their name suggests , are a group of hormones that help to regulate the concentration of mineral ions in the body .
Androgens , such as testosterone , are produced at low levels in the adrenal cortex to regulate the growth and activity of cells that are receptive to male hormones .
In adult males , the amount of androgens produced by the testes is many times greater than the amount produced by the adrenal cortex , leading to the appearance of male secondary sex characteristics .
Adrenal medulla
The adrenal medulla produces the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine under stimulation by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system .
Both of these hormones help to increase the flow of blood to the brain and muscles to improve the “ fight - or - flight ” response to stress .
These hormones also work to increase heart rate , breathing rate , and blood pressure while decreasing the flow of blood to and function of organs that are not involved in responding to emergencies .
Pancreas
The pancreas is a large gland located in the abdominal cavity just inferior and posterior to the stomach .
The pancreas is considered to be a heterocrine gland as it contains both endocrine and exocrine tissue .
The endocrine cells of the pancreas make up just about 1 % of the total mass of the pancreas and are found in small groups throughout the pancreas called islets of Langerhans .
Within these islets are 2 types of cells — alpha and beta cells .
The alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon , which is responsible for raising blood glucose levels .
Glucagon triggers muscle and liver cells to break down the polysaccharide glycogen to release glucose into the bloodstream .
The beta cells produce the hormone insulin , which is responsible for lowering blood glucose levels after a meal .
Insulin triggers the absorption of glucose from the blood into cells , where it is added to glycogen molecules for storage .
Gonads
The gonads — ovaries in females and testes in males — are responsible for producing the sex hormones of the body .
These sex hormones determine the secondary sex characteristics of adult females and adult males .
Testes :
The testes are a pair of ellipsoid organs found in the scrotum of males that produce the androgen testosterone in males after the start of puberty .
Testosterone has effects on many parts of the body , including the muscles , bones , sex organs , and hair follicles .
This hormone causes growth and increases in strength of the bones and muscles , including the accelerated growth of long bones during adolescence .
During puberty , testosterone controls the growth and development of the sex organs and body hair of males , including pubic , chest , and facial hair .
In men who have inherited genes for baldness testosterone triggers the onset of androgenic alopecia , commonly known as male pattern baldness .

Ovaries :
The ovaries are a pair of almond - shaped glands located in the pelvic body cavity lateral and superior to the uterus in females .
The ovaries produce the female sex hormones progesterone and estrogens .
Progesterone is most active in females during ovulation and pregnancy where it maintains appropriate conditions in the human body to support a developing fetus .
Estrogens are a group of related hormones that function as the primary female sex hormones .
The release of estrogen during puberty triggers the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as uterine development , breast development , and the growth of pubic hair .
Estrogen also triggers the increased growth of bones during adolescence that lead to adult height and proportions .
Thymus
The thymus is a soft , triangular - shaped organ found in the chest posterior to the sternum .
The thymus produces hormones called thymosins that help to train and develop T - lymphocytes during fetal development and childhood .
The T - lymphocytes produced in the thymus go on to protect the body from pathogens throughout a person ’s entire life .
The thymus becomes inactive during puberty and is slowly replaced by adipose tissue throughout a person ’s life .
Other Hormone Producing Organs
In addition to the glands of the endocrine system , many other non-glandular organs and tissues in the body produce hormones as well .
Heart :
The cardiac muscle tissue of the heart is capable of producing the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) in response to high blood pressure levels .
ANP works to reduce blood pressure by triggering vasodilation to provide more space for the blood to travel through .
ANP also reduces blood volume and pressure by causing water and salt to be excreted out of the blood by the kidneys .

ANP works to reduce blood pressure by triggering vasodilation to provide more space for the blood to travel through .
ANP also reduces blood volume and pressure by causing water and salt to be excreted out of the blood by the kidneys .
Kidneys :
The kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) in response to low levels of oxygen in the blood .
EPO released by the kidneys travels to the red bone marrow where it stimulates an increased production of red blood cells .
The number of red blood cells increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood , eventually ending the production of EPO .

The number of red blood cells increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood , eventually ending the production of EPO .
Digestive System :
The hormones cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , secretin , and gastrin are all produced by the organs of the gastrointestinal tract .
CCK , secretin , and gastrin all help to regulate the secretion of pancreatic juice , bile , and gastric juice in response to the presence of food in the stomach .
CCK is also instrumental in the sensation of satiety or “ fullness ” after eating a meal .
Adipose : Adipose tissue produces the hormone leptin that is involved in the management of appetite and energy usage by the body .
Leptin is produced at levels relative to the amount of adipose tissue in the body , allowing the brain to monitor the body ’s energy storage condition .
When the body contains a sufficient level of adipose for energy storage , the level of leptin in the blood tells the brain that the body is not starving and may work normally .
If the level of adipose or leptin decreases below a certain threshold , the body enters starvation mode and attempts to conserve energy through increased hunger and food intake and decreased energy usage .
Adipose tissue also produces very low levels of estrogens in both men and women .
In obese people the large volume of adipose tissue may lead to abnormal estrogen levels .
Placenta :
In pregnant women , the placenta produces several hormones that help to maintain pregnancy .
Progesterone is produced to relax the uterus , protect the fetus from the mother ’s immune system , and prevent premature delivery of the fetus .
Human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) assists progesterone by signaling the ovaries to maintain the production of estrogen and progesterone throughout pregnancy .

Human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) assists progesterone by signaling the ovaries to maintain the production of estrogen and progesterone throughout pregnancy .
Local Hormones : Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are produced by every tissue in the body ( except for blood tissue ) in response to damaging stimuli .
These two hormones mainly affect the cells that are local to the source of damage , leaving the rest of the body free to function normally .
Prostaglandins cause swelling , inflammation , increased pain sensitivity , and increased local body temperature to help block damaged regions of the body from infection or further damage .
They act as the body ’s natural bandages to keep pathogens out and swell around damaged joints like a natural cast to limit movement .
Leukotrienes help the body heal after prostaglandins have taken effect by reducing inflammation while helping white blood cells to move into the region to clean up pathogens and damaged tissues .
Physiology of the Endocrine System
Endocrine System vs. Nervous System Function
The endocrine system works alongside of the nervous system to form the control systems of the body .
The nervous system provides a very fast and narrowly targeted system to turn on specific glands and muscles throughout the body .
The endocrine system , on the other hand , is much slower acting , but has very widespread , long lasting , and powerful effects .
Hormones are distributed by glands through the bloodstream to the entire body , affecting any cell with a receptor for a particular hormone .
Most hormones affect cells in several organs or throughout the entire body , leading to many diverse and powerful responses .
Hormone Properties
Once hormones have been produced by glands , they are distributed through the body via the bloodstream .
As hormones travel through the body , they pass through cells or along the plasma membranes of cells until they encounter a receptor for that particular hormone .
Hormones can only affect target cells that have the appropriate receptors .
This property of hormones is known as specificity .
Hormone specificity explains how each hormone can have specific effects in widespread parts of the body .
Many hormones produced by the endocrine system are classified as tropic hormones .
A tropic hormone is a hormone that is able to trigger the release of another hormone in another gland .
Tropic hormones provide a pathway of control for hormone production as well as a way for glands to be controlled in distant regions of the body .
Many of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland , such as TSH , ACTH , and FSH are tropic hormones .
Hormonal Regulation
The levels of hormones in the body can be regulated by several factors .
The nervous system can control hormone levels through the action of the hypothalamus and its releasing and inhibiting hormones .
For example , TRH produced by the hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce TSH .
Tropic hormones provide another level of control for the release of hormones .
For example , TSH is a tropic hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4 .
Nutrition can also control the levels of hormones in the body .
For example , the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 require 3 or 4 iodine atoms , respectively , to be produced .
In people lacking iodine in their diet , they will fail to produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormones to maintain a healthy metabolic rate .
Finally , the number of receptors present in cells can be varied by cells in response to hormones .
Cells that are exposed to high levels of hormones for extended periods of time can begin to reduce the number of receptors that they produce , leading to reduced hormonal control of the cell .
Classes of Hormones
Hormones are classified into 2 categories depending on their chemical make - up and solubility : water - soluble and lipid - soluble hormones .
Each of these classes of hormones has specific mechanisms for their function that dictate how they affect their target cells .
Since 2005 , a Brazilian senator has been pushing for tough new ' cybercrime ' legislation which would include measures against file - sharing .
However , before thinking of unleashing new laws on the public , the government should look closer to home , since the senate 's intranet is loaded with an impressive amount of warez .
Since 2005 , Brazilian senator Eduardo Azeredo has been proposing new ‘ cybercrimes ’ legislation .
Unlike many European proposals , this one is n’t restricted to copyright issues but encompasses all “ dangerous ” activities online .
From cellphone cloning to pedophilia , from creating a virus to file - sharing – the proposal is to criminalize it all and back it up with arrests and jail time of up to three years .
The current wording of the proposals have strong opposition in Brazil and an online petition against the legislation has more than 148,000 signatures .
There has even been opposition from other politicians , with the secretary of legislative affairs Peter Abramovay commenting , “ This surveillance could turn everyone on the Internet into a criminal .
The Internet is a space of freedom par excellence , and should not be a place of fear , ” he said .
However , the senator pushing for the legislation should look closer to home , since an investigation by Congressoemfoco has turned up something of significant interest on the Brazilian senate ’s intranet , which runs counter to their mission statement shown below ;
To provide and manage solutions for information technology and communications for the Senate , and improve work processes , contributing to the excellence and ethics fulfillment of its institutional role for the benefit of Brazilian society
To Congressoemfoco ’s surprise , what they discovered on the government servers was a small mountain of copyrighted movies , music and games in several folders .
These folders are available to the Senate ’s staff and the senators themselves , including Eduardo Azeredo , the senator pushing for tough legislation against pirates .
Warez on the Senate ’s Intranet
Accessing the material proved easy enough .
Anyone on the network could make a few clicks to get access to the folders .
One of them around 6.4Gb in size contained music from Nelly Furtado through to albums by Megadeth , along with Brazilian acts and more well known groups such as Pink Floyd .
Other folders included many top - rated PC games .
Movies did n’t escape either , with Hollywood movies such as Iron Man , a DVD screener copy of Gran Torino and Happy Feet , all available for download by those running the country .
Once the government found out about this situation , they took steps to remedy it , promising an ‘ internal investigation ’ although sources suggest that this will likely amount to little more than a quick band - aid application .
“ A network with more than ten thousand users is not easy [ to monitor ] , ” they said .

The main gate to Paramount Pictures Studios , a division of Viacom , Inc. is pictured in Los Angeles , California July 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Hollywood studio Paramount Pictures , which suffered the first big bomb of the summer last weekend with an Eddie Murphy comedy , has fired its top production executive after barely 18 months in the job .
The Viacom Inc-owned studio said on Friday it would replace Paramount Film Group president John Lesher with former DreamWorks production chief Adam Goodman .
Also out is production president Brad Weston .
Paramount , which is struggling to regain its momentum after a lengthy reliance on co-productions led to a major shakeup four years ago , did not cite a reason for the latest personnel shift in its statement .
The studio has the top film of the year so far in North America with “ Star Trek , ” but its slate has otherwise been boosted by films from partners such as DreamWorks Animation ( “ Monsters vs. Aliens ” ) .
The unrelated DreamWorks Pictures has also been a major supplier , but it quit Paramount last year , leaving Goodman behind at Paramount .
Murphy ’s “ Imagine That , ” which Paramount said cost $ 55 million to make , has earned $ 9.2 million after eight days .
Paramount will likely top the worldwide box office next weekend with “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” although the sequel is a legacy of its DreamWorks partnership .
Goodman becomes the third executive to oversee all of Paramount ’s film production since studio chairman and CEO Brad Grey arrived at the studio in January 2005 with a mandate to produce more films in - house .
Lesher , who had been closely involved with such Oscar - winning arthouse fare as “ Babel ” and “ There Will Be Blood , ” took over as head of the film group in early 2008 .
Firearms Freedom Act Introduced in Florida
Posted on 10 July 2009 – tenthamendmentcenter.com
Introduced in the Florida House on July 6 , 2009 , the “ Firearms Freedom Act ” ( HB - 21 ) seeks to provide “ that specified firearms , firearm accessories , and ammunition for personal use manufactured in state are not subject to federal law or regulation ” in the State of Florida .
The bill is sponsored by Florida State Reps O’Toole and Plakon .
They follow in the path of Montana , and Tennessee who have already passed such legislation .
And they join with Utah , Texas , South Carolina and others who are considering it in an effort to limit federal regulation of guns , and specifically invoke the 9th and 10th Amendments as restrictions on federal power :
“ the regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in the states under the ninth and tenth amendments to the United States Constitution , particularly if not expressly preempted by federal law .
Congress has not expressly preempted state regulation of intrastate commerce pertaining to the manufacture on an intrastate basis of firearms , firearms accessories , and ammunition ”

Epicurean Dealmaker highlights one of my chief fears right now :
Meanwhile , the cleverboots in the banking industry have already picked themselves up and dusted themselves off from the 50 - car pile - up they drove the economy into .
They are sending an army of lobbyists and campaign contributors into the halls of power to make sure any new rules imposed on them are both toothless and rigged in their favor .
Congressmen and women , most of whom could n’t balance a checkbook if you gave them a fucking jeweler ’s scale , are no match for smooth - talking operators purring about the need to preserve “ innovation ” and “ efficiency ” in the market .
This is not even to mention the inevitability of regulatory capture , when underpaid government bureaucrats try to supervise their former and future private sector employers who make , on average , about fifty gazillion times more money than they do .
So I am with Bob Teitelman , who worries that all this CNBC advertising budget - driven drivel about “ green shoots ” in the economy is letting a once - in - a - generation opportunity to craft a robust , long - lasting regulatory regime for the new financial reality slip away , and against those who urge slowness and caution .
These latter argue that we should not rush into anything , since we are likely to make mistakes in forming a new regulatory system in haste , and generate all sorts of unintended consequences .
I say fuck it .
Kill ‘em all and let God sort ‘ em out .
Wipe the slate clean and start over with some broad principles and some smart , well - paid technocrats and ex-investment bankers who can figure it out on the fly .
Let them hire killers and mercenaries who are smart enough not only to enforce existing rules , but also anticipate those areas and practices that will require regulation in the future .
How do you think the financial sector itself manages its own business ?
U.S. senators on Thursday struggled at a committee hearing to understand AT&T 's explanation for how exclusive deals for phones like the iPhone stimulate innovation .
The hearing was called by the Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation to study the effect that long - term exclusivity deals have on the wireless market and particularly on people living in rural areas .
It was called partly in response to a filing that the Rural Cellular Association made last year to the Federal Communications Commission , arguing that exclusive handset deals turn rural customers into second - class citizens because in some cases they have no option to buy the latest and most popular phones .
An executive from AT&T , which has a multiyear exclusive deal to sell the popular iPhone , said the agreements are good for the market .
" I believe consumers benefit from exclusive deals in three ways : innovation , lower cost and more choice , " said Paul Roth , president of retail sales and services for AT&T .
But the senators found it difficult to see why a phone maker would n't prefer to sell to all customers of all the carriers .
" I accept the benefits you articulated but I 'm having a difficult time trying to envision why an innovator , given the size of the market and the number of outlets , is not going to innovate to produce a product that is equally competitive [ to an exclusive phone ] ... because it wants to appeal across different providers , " said Senator John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat .
In response , Roth argued that exclusive deals enable innovation because the operator and manufacturer share the risk .
He suggested that operators will ask manufacturers for certain features on phones but manufacturers will often only do so if the operator agrees to buy a certain number of phones , he said .
" Manufacturers want someone to share the risk , " Roth said .
He pointed to the Samsung Propel as a successful example of a phone that was developed in close partnership between the operator and the manufacturer .
However , most of the discussion at the hearing revolved around the iPhone , which most people agree was independently developed by Apple , without input from AT&T .
Even Barbara Esbin , senior fellow and director of the Progress and Freedom Foundation , who defended exclusive deals , noted that the iPhone was not co-developed .
" It was Apple , a new entrant with a single handset , that sought exclusivity and tightly controlled product development rather than AT&T , " she said .
The Progress and Freedom Foundation counts many large telecommunications and media companies among its supporters .
In addition , Apple has created a new scenario in the wireless industry by forging a very long exclusivity deal .
The rural operators said they could live with the exclusive deals when they covered a matter of months .
" This is years , not months , " noted Jack Rooney , president and CEO of U.S. Cellular , referring to the iPhone deal .
AT&T would only confirm that its deal with iPhone is multiyear .
AT&T has been selling the iPhone exclusively in the U.S. since mid-2007 .
Some of the panelists said they believed the agreement is for five years .
That means that customers in rural areas , who want the same things as customers in urban centers and who may not have AT&T coverage , ca n't use the iPhone , said Hu Meena , president and CEO of Cellular South .
A senator from Meena 's home state put that idea into a real - life scenario for someone living in a rural area .
" That 18 - year - old kid hunting in the woods ... he might like to have an iPhone , but if he does n't have the coverage , that consumer is then prevented from having the consumer choice , " said Senator Roger Wicker , a Republican from Mississippi .
" If he has an iPhone but no AT&T coverage there , it 's not going to do him a lot of good out on the deer stand , " Meena agreed .
One panelist argued that the Carterfone precedent should apply to this issue .
More than 40 years ago in a landmark case known as Carterfone , the FCC decided that network operator AT&T must let people own their own phones and attach other devices to the network .
The result spurred innovations such as the fax machine .
" We take for granted the right to own and attach telephones to the wired network .
That freedom should extend to wireless networks , " said Robert Frieden , professor of telecommunications and law at Penn State University .
He noted that TV broadcasters do n't restrict people from watching cable or DVDs and computer makers do n't regulate which ISP people can use or what services they can access .
Wireless customers should have the same freedoms , he argued .
Senator Amy Klobuchar , a Democrat from Minnesota , agreed .
" If we had done this in the past with the computer area , it would be like Microsoft and IBM having exclusive deals and you would actually never have had a Google because who would have wanted to make deals with some of these startup companies that might not have had much promise .
So I have a big concern about innovation and the long - term effect this might have on pricing , " she said .
The Commerce Committee is inviting public comments about the issue over the next week .

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael
Steele sent out a fundraising appeal today asking party faithful to help counter a prime - time appearance President Obama will be making next week on ABC TV .
Steele is seen here giving a speech to GOP state party chairs in Baltimore earlier this month .
As we reported earlier , the president and the news network are co-hosting a town hall meeting that night on health care .
In a statement about the one - hour telecast , ABC said Obama will be taking questions from an audience representing " divergent opinions " on the big debate , but Steele is n't buying that .
In his fundraising letter , the RNC chair said ABC has " turned over its entire programming " to " promoting Obamacare . "
Steele writes that the party is trying to raise $ 100,000 to buy airtime for a response .
Steele 's letter comes one day communications strategist Keith Appell told reporters that ABC News is refusing to accept paid advertising from one of his clients , Conservatives for Patients Rights .
The group opposes Obama 's health care proposals ; we 've already told you about the ad campaign they 've mounted on cable TV .
CPR chairman Rick Scott called the network 's decision " unfortunate and unusual . "
We 've called ABC for a response and will keep you posted .
Update , 12:29 p.m. ET : ABC has posted a response to the Republican National Committee 's charges , which the network says are based on " false premises . "
Far from promoting the president 's position , next week 's prime time news event will be " devoted to exploring and probing the President 's position and giving voice to questions and criticisms of that position , " writes ABC senior vice president Kerry Smith .
As to the decision not to accept ads critical of the Obama health care proposal , that 's in line with " a long - standing policy " of the network , says spokeswoman Cathie Levine .
" ABC does not accept advocacy ads , " she said .
Underlying the complaints is a feeling among conservatives that , as Steele put it in his letter , Obama is getting unusually " favorable coverage " from " the mainstream media . "
When John Harwood of CNBC and the New York Times asked Obama about his good press reviews earlier this week , the president pooh - poohed the idea .
" It 's very hard for me to swallow that one .
First of all I 've got one television station entirely devoted to attacking my administration , " said Obama .
Harwood asked whether he meant Fox News .
Obama did n't directly answer , but continued :
" That 's a pretty big megaphone .
You'd be hard pressed if you watched the entire day to find a positive story about me on that front , " the president said .
We 've also put a call into Fox to see if the network has anything to say .

Torchwood follows secret agents battling human and alien enemies Cutting the new series of Doctor Who spin - off Torchwood to five shows from 13 felt like " we were being punished " , its star John Barrowman has said .
The third series of the sci - fi show - which began on BBC
Three before moving to BBC Two - will now be shown on consecutive days on BBC One .
Barrowman said other shows moved to BBC One " and they do n't get cut " .
The BBC said it wanted to create " a powerful sense of event " with Children of Earth , which will start on Monday .
It felt like every time we moved we had to prove ourselves
John Barrowman Barrowman told the Radio Times : " I 'm going to get a little political and I 'll probably get into trouble for it . "
He said Torchwood 's first series had been " the most successful show on BBC3 - ever " and , as a result , had been moved to BBC
Two where " we were beating shows that had been on BBC Two for a long time " .
" The decision was made to go to BBC One and then we were cut - from 13 episodes down to five . "
' Very special ' Barrowman said the new episodes were " incredible , I have no doubt about that " .
" But personally , I felt like we were being punished .
" Other shows move from BBC Three and Two to One and they do n't get cut .
" So why are we ?
It felt like every time we moved we had to prove ourselves . "
I do n't think audiences are remotely lost by a change in format
Creator Russell T Davies
But the show 's writer and creator Russell T Davies told the magazine : " Part of us thought , 'we could do another 13 episodes , we 've learnt how to do that , and the second series was better than the first ' .
" But why not change it ? "
He said if the show was made in the US , " they 'd try to keep it going for seven years , doing the same thing every week " .
He added : " It 's the British audience we make these for .
" And I do n't think audiences are remotely lost by a change in format . "
A BBC spokesman said : " We wanted to create a powerful sense of event when the show came to BBC One and so talked with the show makers about a story that could run over five consecutive days . "
This was something " very special " that had only been done before with 2008 's five - part thriller Criminal Justice and Iraq - based drama Occupation , shown earlier this month .

How do you create compassion ?
What does it take to make us help those in need ?
New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof reads the scientific research , and the news is n't exactly encouraging .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
We 'll give if we 're shown a photo of an African child in need .
Show us two , and the giving diminishes .
Add some statistics , and the giving drops dramatically .
Give us the statistics only , and we turn away .
Call it evolutionary psychology .
Or as Stephen Colbert said to Kristof , why should Americans care about what happens beyond their borders ?
Not long after his interview with Colbert , Kristof wrote a column about a Darfur puppy to highlight the issue .
Yet while Kristof uses the techniques of all those adopt - a - child aid programs as he tries make us care about the world 's human rights crises , he works for the New York Times , so he has to provide a little context .
In Eric Metzger 's documentary Reporter ( trailer below ) , we follow Kristof to the Congo , where 5.4 million people have died in the last decade as a consequence of conflict -- making it the most lethal since the Second World War .
The human face Kristof uses on this trip to dramatize the Congo crisis belongs to Yohanita , who developed an infection after a nasty fall and could n't get the medical help she needed because of the civil unrest .
Hers is an unremarkable Congo death -- one that hardly resonates on the six o'clock news .
Kristof had better luck in Darfur .
His relentless coverage is widely credited with bringing that humanitarian crisis to world attention , and it garnered him his second Pulitzer Prize .
The world has n't solved the Darfur crisis , but we 've saved a lot of lives .
Nicholas Kristof has saved a lot of lives .
Creating a culture of giving
Charles Annenberg Weingarten has similar goals , but he takes a slightly different tack .
He wants to make us care about people like Nicholas Kristof , so we might become more like him .
He wants to inspire us by showing us what 's possible , by showing us good things where we least expect them .
" I try to replace fear with trust . "
Annenberg Weingarten , who will speak and show some of his own short films at the VanCity Theatre on Thursday , June 11 , in conjunction with a screening of Reporter , recently visited Darfur .
He said the six o'clock news gives us no meaningful sense of the place .
" The Darfur I saw and the Darfur you see are two different Darfurs . "
Sure , the area is wracked by conflict .
" War is a powerful business model . "
But despite the distress , Annenberg Weingarten said , " the place that 's supposed to be the scariest was actually the most welcoming .
They have nothing , but they live like they have everything . "
Annenberg Weingarten is one of five family trustees of the Annenberg Foundation , which ranks 11th in the U.S. in terms of charitable giving , and has doled out more than $ 4 billion in grants since it was created in 1989 with a third of the proceeds from the sale of the Annenberg family 's Triangle Publications .
Annenberg Weingarte ' ’s Explore Philanthropy is a foundation offshoot with a dual mandate .
Explore 's short films , available on the Internet , showcase charitable work around the globe .
The travel involved in making the films helps Explore identify opportunities for its own charitable giving .
Time matters more than money
However , it 's not giving so much as his mission to create a culture of giving that motivates Annenberg Weingarten .
Ask him about the blow delivered to foundations by the stock market collapse , and he shakes off the concerns .
" We immediately associate philanthropy with money , " he said on the phone Tuesday , as he prepared for a day trip with Sam Sullivan to Bowen Island .
" What 's more important than money is time .
Forget giving money .
Personalize philanthropy .
There is intrinsic value in getting outside of yourself and helping others . "
Annenberg Weingarten laments that governments forgo a lot of tax revenue if you donate cash or stock but if you give your time the government offers no reward .
" There should be more incentives to be of public service . "
In 2007 , according to Statistics Canada , 84 per cent of Canadians donated money ( about $ 10 billion , with religious organizations getting nearly half ) .
Just 45 per cent of us donated time ( although those who did gave a staggering 2.1 billion hours , the equivalent of 1.1 million full - time jobs ) .
Annenberg Weingarten wants us all to walk into a soup kitchen .
It might even help us replace a little fear with a measure of trust .
Explore Philanthropy 's mission fits well with the overarching aim of the Annenberg Foundation of better communication .
The foundation funds education programs at all levels , from elementary - school language programs to advanced training for journalists .
But its grants really know no boundaries , and Annenberg Weingarten -- whose mother 's family comes from Newmarket , Ontario -- says his own work with Explore has strong B.C. connections .
Funding the underdogs
Those local connections began with First Nations work and continued with the Sam Sullivan Disability Foundation .
When the Inner Change Charitable Society , which Sullivan has championed , began its work on drug substitution research trials , Explore assisted with a $ 175,000 grant .
Annenberg Weingarten sees Vancouver , which he situates not in Canada so much as in the Pacific Northwest region of the Americas , as " a pearl " and a pivotal place in our global future .
And while Explore gives to some of the usual local suspects -- the Museum of Anthropology , the Vancouver Aquarium -- he likes the " talented underdog " , which explains Explore 's funding for Sam Sullivan 's favoured projects , assisting the disabled and drug addicts .
It also explains funding for two iconoclasts working on Orca research on either side of the border -- Ken Balcom and Paul Spong .
Balcom 's Center for Whale Research in the San Juan Islands has drawn attention to the damage that sonar can inflict on Orcas and other members of the dolphin family .
Spong is a Vancouver Aquarium outcast who opposed keeping Orcas in captivity long before it was fashionable , and his Orca Lab on Hanson Island in Johnstone Strait has been a key organization in developing our understanding of these iconic creatures .
Annenberg Weingarten 's Orca Guardians is among the four short films that will screen at the VanCity Theatre .
But whether the subject is education for the poor , protection for species at risk , or catastrophic human conflict , all the films in program exemplify the quote that opens Reporter : " If I look at the mass , I will never act .
If I look at the one , I will . "

NASHVILLE -- Despite voicing doubts , Gov. Phil Bredesen on Friday signed into law legislation allowing Tennessee 's 222,000 handgun - carry permit holders to bring loaded weapons into federal , state and local parks .
In his notification letter to House Speaker Kent Williams , the governor said that , while he signed House Bill 716 , " I continue to have concerns about the inclusion of local parks in this bill . "
" I do want to urge local governments to use the opt - out provisions of this bill to remove parks from its effect when they are located close to schools and other places where large numbers of children congregate , " the governor said .
Chattanooga City Council Chairman Jack Benson said he expected the city to do just that .
" I feel certain that the city 's going to opt out on it , " he said .
" I 'm disappointed that they ( the General Assembly ) usurped our authority .
We 've got home rule , and we already had an ordinance in place prohibiting it in parks .
So we have to come back and do it again . "
The law takes effect in state and federal parks immediately , but it will not go into effect in local parks until Sept .
1 . The delay is to give cities and counties time to enact provisions that exclude guns from parks , playgrounds , greenways , bicycle paths and other areas if they wish .
Sen .
Mae Beavers , R - Mount Juliet , who sponsored the parks bill , said she was pleased by the governor 's decision to sign the bill .
" I think he 'll find there will be no incidents , " she said .
On another front , the governor said he was allowing a separate measure , House Bill 1796 , to become law without his signature , even though he believes the Tennessee Firearms Freedom
Act " represents a fringe constitutional theory that I believe will be quickly dispensed with by the federal courts . "
The bill states that a gun manufactured entirely in Tennessee and stamped " made in Tennessee " is not subject to federal firearms laws .
The governor signed yet a third bill allowing permit holders to transport loaded rifles and shotguns in their vehicles .
Gov. Bredesen recently vetoed another bill allowing handgun - carry permit holders to go armed in establishments , including nightclubs , that sell whiskey , wine and beer .
Lawmakers easily overrode the veto .
Gov. Bredesen later said the guns - in - parks legislation was n't as bad as the guns - in - bars bill .
" I 'll have to say I do n't think it has the same severity in the sense ( that ) it 's not mixing alcohol with guns , which is the really dangerous piece of it for me , " he said .
Despite that , one of the park bill 's sponsors , Rep. Frank Niceley , R - Strawberry Plains , said he understood a deal had been struck with the governor on the bill .
The compromise involved the sponsors agreeing to remove the local park provision in exchange for the governor not vetoing the bill as well as another bill that seeks to block local beer boards from requiring licensees to ban guns .
Gov. Bredesen appeared perplexed when asked about the matter Thursday , and Sen .
Beavers declared earlier Friday that the " deal is off . "

Mr Tsvangirai says Western countries have pledged $ 500 m China has agreed to give Zimbabwe a loan of $ 950 m ( £ 573 m ) to help it revive its battered economy , Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has said .
Mr Tsvangirai had been criticised by supporters of President Robert Mugabe for failing to get more support during his recent trip to the West .
Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe formed a power - sharing government in February .
The government says it needs some $ 8bn to rebuild the country following years of collapse .
" The government through the minister of finance , secured credit lines of almost $ 950 m from China , " Mr Tsvangirai said in a news conference .
China was one of the few countries to retain economic support for Zimbabwe in recent years .
" We will encourage and facilitate more Chinese companies to seek development in Zimbabwe , " Chinese official Zhou Yongkang told state news agency Xinhua .
' Enormous support '
The prime minister visited the US and Europe earlier this month in an attempt to raise funding for the struggling nation .
The US promised $ 73 m in aid while the UK pledged to boost its funding by about $ 8 m , taking its total to $ 98 m for the year .
Mr Tsvangirai said he had received pledges totalling $ 500 m during his trip .
Money can not be found to pay those who are working - not even the ministers , not the president
Robert Mugabe
Zimbabwean president " The amount of assistance that was raised on my visit to Europe and the United States does not reflect the enormous support we will be able to utilise if we are to fulfil all our political obligations , " he said .
Mr Tsvangirai has been forced on several occasions to defend his decision to enter a power - sharing government with Mr Mugabe - as the two men spent years as bitter political rivals .
The prime minister said he had joined the unity government to save the country from disaster - it was battling a cholera outbreak , while water , health and education services had collapsed .
Senior members of Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) on Monday boycotted a cabinet meeting chaired by Mr Mugabe , saying he had treated their party with contempt and disrespect .
And the president himself said last week the unity government had so far not lived up to its promises .
" Money can not be found to pay those who are working .
Not even the ministers , not the president , " Zimbabwe 's Herald newspaper quoted him as saying .
Mr Mugabe said he had been promised $ 100 in salary this year - but had so far received nothing .

The Treasury says Australian households have lost a total of $ 602 billion in the five quarters since the economic crisis took hold , the longest run of wealth destruction in the five decades it has been compiling figures .
Household wealth per person peaked at $ 250,200 in December 2007 and fell to $ 216,700 by this March .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Tuesday proposed making " pay - as - you - go " rules for federal spending into law .
President Obama proposed Tuesday that the government adopt " pay - as - you - go " rules for federal spending .
The so - called PAYGO proposal requires Congress to balance any increased spending by equal savings elsewhere , Obama said in announcing the measure that now goes to Congress .
A previous PAYGO mandate helped erase federal budget deficits in the 1990s , and subsequent ineffective rules contributed to the current budget deficits , Obama said .
Now the PAYGO rules should be the law , he said .
" Paying for what you spend is basic common sense , " Obama said .
" Perhaps that 's why , here in Washington , it 's been so elusive . "
Republican leaders said the proposal comes after record spending initiatives by the Obama administration , such as the $ 787 billion economic stimulus program .
" It seems a tad disingenuous for the president and Speaker [ Nancy ]
Pelosi to talk about PAYGO rules after ramming trillions in spending through Congress proposing policies that create more debt in the first six months of this year than in the previous 220 years combined , " said Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , the House Minority Whip .
However , a group of fiscally conservative Democratic representatives known as the Blue Dogs called Obama 's proposal responsible and necessary .
" President Obama inherited an economy in free - fall and a $ 10.6 trillion national debt , " said Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee , vice - chairman of the Blue Dog Budget and Financial Services Task Force .
" While short - term spending was necessary to get the economy moving again , our long - term fiscal problems became that much more urgent . "
A White House statement said Obama 's proposal calls for the Office of Management and Budget to maintain a ledger of the average 10 - year budgetary effects of all legislation affecting mandatory spending or baseline tax levels .
Any extra cost that lacks payment authorized by Congress would require the president to find money within the budget to pay it , while any tax cut would require a corresponding increase in tax revenue .
Some costs would be exempt , including Medicare payments to doctors , the estate and gift tax , and tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2002 , the White House statement said .

I have received over the years emails from non i-ranian music lovers and collectors in western countries asking me to provide them a list of persian funky music from the 70s .
When we say the word funk , please do not expect to hear James Brown translated to Farsi .
Scrap out any images of Gap Band , Brass Constructon or the Fatback band .
I guess what these collectors reffer to is the cross of p*ersian 70's pop with splashes of elements of funk .
Funk based music did not do too well in iraanian music because it did n't fit well with the complex lyrics that artists wanted in their songs .
Also it didnt mix well with melancholy wich is typically an important ingredient in persian culture .
Still we can dig and find persian music that had funky elements from the 70's .
Here 's a list of some of the funkier 4x4 ones :
- Leila Forouhar - " Shamim " ( the original 70s version ) ( Sample )
- Betti " badragheh "

Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta delivers remarks at a National Italian American Foundation policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington , June 11 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - CIA director Leon Panetta says it ’s almost as if former vice president Dick Cheney would like to see another attack on the United States to prove he is right in criticizing President Barack Obama for abandoning the “ harsh interrogation ” of terrorism suspects .
“ I think he smells some blood in the water on the national security issue , ” Panetta said in an interview published in The New Yorker magazine ’s June 22 issue .
“ It ’s almost , a little bit , gallows politics .
When you read behind it , it ’s almost as if he ’s wishing that this country would be attacked again , in order to make his point . ”
Cheney , who was a key advocate in the Bush administration of controversial interrogation methods such as waterboarding , has become as a leading Republican critic of Obama ’s ban on harsh interrogations and his plan to shut the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
In a blistering May 21 speech , Cheney said Obama ’s reversal of Bush - era policies were “ unwise in the extreme ” that would make the American people less safe .
Panetta called Cheney ’s actions “ dangerous politics . ”
He told The New Yorker he had favored the creation of an independent truth commission to look into the detainee polices of former President George W. Bush .
But the idea died in April when Obama decided such a panel could be seen as politically vindictive .
MTV
News gets hands - on with the upcoming game , which includes ' Here Comes the Sun ' and other Fab Four classics .
After a huge showing at E3 , " The Beatles : Rock Band " came to MTV 's headquarters in Times Square , letting employees check out the hotly anticipated rhythm game first - hand .
John Drake , a spokesman for Harmonix ( the developer behind " Rock Band " ) was on - hand to share the goods on the game .
" ' The Beatles : Rock Band ' has 45 songs from the Beatles catalog and lets you enjoy all the great ' Rock Band ' gameplay you 've come to love from ' Rock Band ' and ' Rock Band 2 , ' with the great songs of the Beatles , " Drake said .
" We 've also added three - part vocal harmony and some really , really amazing visuals . "
After a quick demonstration , employees were invited up onstage to try out the game , as well as the exclusive instruments that will be available upon the title 's release .
Renditions of Paul McCartney 's Höfner bass , John Lennon 's Rickenbacker 325 guitar , George Harrison 's Gretsch Duo Jet guitar and Ringo Starr 's Ludwig drum set were all on hand for folks to channel their inner Fab Four .
We were all too eager to hop onstage for a go .
After an intense battle for who got to be John , we settled on " I Am the Walrus , " which features an existential ( read : nightmare - inducing ) music video where the in - game Beatles are dressed as creepy walrus men .
Thankfully , the abject terror did n't take too much away from the performance .
Three - part harmony was especially interesting .
The game has three different vocal parts that it 's tracking at once , meaning everyone really needs to be on point .
It 's a great addition , since it allows more non-gamers into the action .
It 's still pretty tough on the tone - deaf , though .
The rest of the gameplay follows the " Rock Band " mechanics closely , with guitars , drums and bass having to hit certain beats to progress through the song .
By the end of " I Am the Walrus , " we were rocking on all cylinders ( flair - kicks and all ) , but new players need n't be too intimidated .
There 's still a no - fail mode ( now accessible right from the pause screen ) , so there 's no longer that moment of shame .
Currently , 10 songs have been revealed from the game :
» " When I Saw Her Standing There "
» " I Want to Hold Your Hand "
» " I Feel Fine "
» " Daytripper "
» " Taxman "
» " I Am the Walrus "
» " Back in the U.S.S.R . "
» " Octopus 's Garden "
» " Here Comes the Sun "
» " Get Back "
After the game 's release , the entire Abbey Road album will be available for download , and Xbox 360 users will get exclusive access to " All You Need Is Love , " with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders .
The game arrives September 9 .

Funny baby t- shirts
FUNNY BABY TSHIRTS
You know how some parents are just completely inappropriate with their babies ?
If there ’s one area where I ’d be totally flexible , it ’s putting ridiculous T - shirts on my child .
Look , they ’ll never remember having them on and you ’ll be the talk of the town .
I say why the hell not .
At least your not physically putting your kid at risk .
With that said here are the first 10 shirts I plan on buying my unborn baby .

Before I even got to the " work " part of my experience , I realized I had serious problems .
AT&T 's service is never anything to write home about in New York City ( in fact , it 's usually embarrassingly bad ) , but I found that my 3G connection seemed especially weak in this Manhattan doctor 's den .
Oh , I had five bars all right , but trying to load just the iPhone - formatted version of Engadget tested my will to live .
After nurses denied my requests for assisted suicide , I resigned myself to dealing with the network issues .
Honestly , a lot of what I do during the day ( namely , hanging out in a chat room and commanding the team to help me pick the perfect pizza toppings ) does n't require the highest - test connection -- though I certainly put pedal to floor at times .
So , stoically accepting the fate of thin 3G , I set about firing up the apps I would need to actually tend to Engadget .
First up , I required an IRC session .
That 's no problem , because the App Store is filled with useful tools for chatting with good buddies .
I prefer Mobile Colloquy , so away I went , happily bounding into the Engadget chat room to direct the editors and get the latest gossip about Gyllenspoon .
Of course , it took an exorbitant amount of time to actually connect , but once I did it 's a reasonable experience ... save for one big issue .
The iPhone keyboard truly sucks if you 're trying to type words it might not be familiar with .
You know , like tech terminology which is n't exactly part of its native dictionary .
Additionally , typing quickly during a conversation with lots of people is severely hampered by the inaccuracy of the on - screen keyboard .
I would have left it at that , but my work requires that I use a bunch of web tools , look at lots of news sites , and have a feed reader open ... basically , things that would require some level of multitasking .
Imagine the frustration of having to constantly break the connection in chat to go look at a site or work on a post .
It 's frustrating , let me tell you .
The idea of jumping into and out of applications -- of having to actually quit an app to move to another one -- is
" We do n't work like this on our computers -- why does Apple think we want to work like this on our phones ? "
make more sense .
Doom Resurrection
work .
an incredibly outmoded and foreign idea in 2009 .
Additionally , the email experience on the iPhone is brutal -- and to get anything done in a day as Editor - in - chief of Engadget , you need your mail .
As a Gmail user , the way the native iPhone mail application handles messages is counterintuitive at best .
Google presents a lovely browser - based solution for email , but it is markedly hampered by the browser environment itself .
It 's slow and inaccurate to navigate , though obviously better if you need to bounce between an open page and your mail .
Funnily , the Safari experience provides better multitasking than the phone itself .
Adding insult to multiple injuries , the system of notification for SMS , calendar events , or even push IM messages ( which still gives you limited options ) is intrusive , productivity - stalling , and frankly upsetting .
It does n't aid productivity if you 're constantly being hammered with pop-ups .
The whole , painful experience set me thinking .
Is this really what Apple wants me to be doing with my phone anyhow ?
The company has added lots of features -- like decent Exchange support -- so that its phone will appeal to enterprise and business users , but can these users really get what they need out of the device ?
Basic functionality , like calling people , email , and certainly document editing still feel inelegant and clunky due to the onscreen keyboard , and the lack of multitasking makes moving around through those typically important tasks difficult to say the least .
The experience on an Android device , S60 , the Pre , a BlackBerry , or even Windows Mobile just makes more sense .
Let me say that again : those experiencesNow I 'm not saying the execution of those experiences is better across platforms , but the philosophy of letting users multitask is more natural to us .
The iPhone does n't even have a method for switching between recently used or favorite applications .
We do n't work like this on our computers -- why does Apple think we want to work like this on our phones ?
Well that 's the thing -- maybe they do n't really care about how we work .
Maybe they do n't want us to work at all .
If you take a look at the App Store , it 's fairly obvious where the cash is going -- and it's not to productivity or enterprise apps .
Where is it going ?
To , frankly ( sorry , not for me -- I hate games on rails ) .
At the end of the day , it 's nice to stick the " we love business users " line into your PR , but it 's quite another thing to make it real .
Keep this in mind : I 'm not a Wall Street lifer -- I 'm a guy in new media who needs to get things done .
I should be part of Apple 's target market .
So , what 's the fix here ?
Well for Apple , the solution is simple -- the virtual keyboard problem is annoying , but not a deal breaker necessarily .
The lack of multitasking is .
The fact that Apple wo n't let end users decide to run down their battery with these dangerous , experience - ruining background tasks is galling , but the fact that the company does n't seem to recognize how important the concept is is even worse .
Giving users the option to select even a few apps to juggle would alleviate this problem instantly , but you 've still got the hurdle of notifications which are difficult to manage , and an email platform which feels woefully behind the curve .
Until the company finds some new paths to beat in those departments , the iPhone -- for all its apps and all its uses -- still does n't hit the sweetspot for a lot of users who need to For me ?
Providing this heart holds up the way doctors say it will , I 'll be keeping a keen eye on Android developments .
But seriously guys ... put a keyboard on those things .
Tough luck , Paul Simon -- your Kodachrome is being taken away .
Eastman Kodak Co. announced today that it is retiring the 74 - year - old Kodachrome color film as photographers gravitate to digital cameras and newer films .
About 70 % of the company ’s revenue now comes from its digital sales .
Kodachrome sales had plunged in recent years to less than 1 % of Kodak ’s total film sales .
Dwayne ’s Photo in Parsons , Kan. , the only lab worldwide that still processes Kodachrome , will offer the service through 2010 .
But the film had an illustrious history , favored by professional photographers like Steve McCurry , who used Kodachrome in 1985 for his famous National Geographic photo of a young Afghan girl with piercing green eyes .
In 1973 , Simon immortalized the film ’s “ nice bright colors ” in his song “ Kodachrome . ”
Kodak said it will donate the last rolls of Kodachrome film to the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester , N.Y. , after McCurry shoots one of the rolls .

Human progress is furthered , not by conformity , but by aberration .
~ H.L. Mencken
For some time , I have been trying to figure out why the nation and we as individuals are in the fix we are in now .
Many reasons manifest themselves .
We labor under a government of such monstrous reach and epic incompetence that it makes the Soviets now look like a paragon of efficiency and probity .
We suffer under a ruling class that has not simply been a gangster government under Obamunism but has been this way since the defeat of the original Constitution in 1865 .
With each illegitimate war since 1898 , the power of the Federal government has increased exponentially .
With each manufactured crisis , liberties and freedoms have withered and died .
This is simply the latest and greatest improvement in the ongoing process of our overseers to find emerging ways to increase the output of our slavery .
I have alluded before that we live in the country and have occasion to run across orphaned animals .
We have horses and chickens and other assorted animals on the Circle A Ranch .
My wife happens to be a fantastic gardener and the reincarnation of Dr. Doolittle .
We discovered by following the horrid cacophony of rabbit screams three orphaned cottontails , two of which promptly died .
My wife is now nursing the survivor and hoping to brighten his life expectancy in this mortal coil .
As is her wont , she is an inveterate researcher and proceeded to go on the ‘ net and search out advice on care and feeding of a rabbit which is not one of our areas of husbandry expertise .
What struck her were the countless admonitions to seek government assistance and report it to wildlife " authorities " or the zoo .
I look around and converse with colleagues and associates to find my fellow Americans increasingly frightened or unfamiliar with doing anything without someone ’s permission .
Whether at work or play , we :
obey speed limits that have nothing do with safety and simply provide revenue to our rulers
pay property taxes which inevitably increase the yoke around our necks locally and pay for the intellectual suicide pact call government schooling
pay extraordinary sales taxes on local and state purchases to subsidize the countless layers of bureaucracy that choke citizen and business productivity everyday
stop locally at a US Border Patrol checkpoint nearly twenty miles north of the Mexican border to be asked if we are American citizens and a visual check of the interior of our vehicles
sit idly by while the various levels of government erect observation devices at traffic intersections to increase revenue streams
receive property tax bills on our real estate which increase in assessment while market prices decrease
are required to have permission from the US Forest Circus or National Park Service to hunt , play or work on lands expropriated by our betters in government
I have discovered the silver bullet and it is from the University of the Intuitively Obvious : question authority and maintain a skeptical attitude about all facets of government and governance .
That ’s it …simple .
Even those of us who have invested considerable intellectual heavy - lifting in discerning why the government in all its consistent brutality and blood - raged destruction commands such a loyal and slavish quality in men are baffled by the absence of this simple epistemological tool to ask why on a consistent basis from stem to stern .
If enough vigilance is maintained at the outset and embryonic stages of so much government mischief , much of the madness could be strangled in its statist cradle through peaceful discourse , non-compliance , shunning and development of innovative strategies to sabotage the government ’s machinations .
Most government programs start out with promises of nirvana and positive outcomes but the history of man shows that this is essentially iatrogenic and hubristic .
The state is a violent actor by necessity to preserve its power and expand it , so inevitably the promises dissolve into a nightmarish brew of incompetence , lethality and baleful societal consequences and we are stuck with the myriad Frankenstein monsters shambling about with the vague promises of eternal goodness and heaven on earth .

One may say that the horse is out of the barn and we are truly stuck with the state of affairs and no amount of reform will fix DC and its loyal minions at this stage of their maturation and dominance and you would be correct .
The rub is this : the FEDGOD will fall and it will be in the next 12 — 24 months and much like the USSR , it will perish of its own internal Marxoid contradictions .
Foreign wars , self - induced economic calamity and sheer naked arrogance will force it to fold and dissolve as a ruling elite .
This is a window that rarely opens and the opportunities will be tremendous — for both sides .
The furloughed politicos will spread their contagion when they flee the ruins of the DC power structure and seek to encourage the usual suspects among government workers and gullible subjects to help resurrect this monstrosity that has been astride our necks like a decomposing albatross .
Truth serum will be necessary and that all starts with the kind of skepticism and incredulity that seems to characterize most everything we do except our attitude toward our rulers .
Cross-examination is the engine of truth .
Question every bit of alleged government authority which emerges from the ashes .
This is one reason Thomas Jefferson was agitating for constant revolt for the tree of liberty .
Government is a fungal growth that cannot be checked without constantly striking the root and taking whatever measures are necessary to curb its growth .
You wo n’t find this kind of critical thinking taught in the universities or any facet of the school systems because skepticism and clear thinking will be the end of them and the whole rotting mold growth choking American civilization called government .
When was the last time you saw a government sponsored university study which called for the reduction and / or elimination of a statist rule or department ?
You do n’t have to be a philosophy major or graduate to realize that Socratic drilling works .
This is simply the process where you repeatedly ask why to a set of explanations until either you are satisfied the meritorious answer has been given or the shoddy intellectual construction is bared for all to see .
It bears repeating : the entire artifice of the state is based on the threat or employment of violence to meet its ends , so it is morally illegitimate and reprehensible from the starting blocks .
You have the moral high ground because all government for the most part is an elaborate shell game to develop proxy relationships with servant classes who obey at the urging of a lash or worse for the material and power benefit of the ruling class .
Wake up , helots !

This is the chance we have .
A dozen , fifty or hundreds of resistance and secessionist entities are going to move into the vacuum left by the great sucking abyss of the FEDGOD collapse .
Hundreds of laboratories will emerge to test every variant of political collective and ordered enterprise imaginable .
I have little hope for the subjects and somnambulant mental zombies that stumble around the cities of the Left Coast and the Northeast ( Vermont and New Hampshire excepted ) will do anymore other than instantly resurrect facsimiles of DC patterns of rule and other processes of national socialism but between the Marxist coastlines ; the life and times of ordinary Americans will take extraordinary turns to develop from scratch freedom - oriented communities and spasms of spontaneous order .
People may finally awaken and look at their neighbors and try to do the right thing .
They may seek a system that asks , persuades and cooperates instead of bullies , collectivizes and forces through violent means the shape and texture of human relationships .
They will be the vanguard of the men and women who finally awaken from the five millennia fever - dream of enabling various strangers the power of life and death over thousands and millions simply because they have surrendered the most basic right of all ; leave us the hell alone .
Turn off the television , grab a book (s ) and have conversations with family and like - minded friends .
Go out and do things .
Start a garden , fix your fencing , move to the country and reach out to the community you live in .
Open your mind to the possibilities before us .
Most of all , question every aspect of your relationship with authority .
Does it derive from fear or respect ?
Does it emanate from first - hand experience or second - hand knowledge ?
How many times have you truly asked why a certain bureaucratic edict must be followed ?
More importantly , what is your line in the sand where your servitude stops and your resistance begins ?
Just say no to big government .
Once a man establishes his limitations for tolerance of interference in his life and adopts a resolute stand against the forces buffeting him against his will , the world will change .
If you are still reading this , you are the Resistance .

Much as it may endear him to hardcore conservatives , I can't imagine Mark Sanford 's stonewalling on unemployment funds is going to endear him to the national electorate in 2012 .
Can anyone imagine him being anything other than a Goldwateresque sacrificial lamb ?
PS The Times report also includes this detail on a very classy 2004 Sanford publicity stunt -- can you say dignity problem ?
Mr. Sanford once carried two piglets onto the floor of the House chamber to symbolize his opposition to what he considered wasteful spending .
One of the piglets promptly defecated ; lawmakers were not amused .
Here 's video of the stunt :
And here are some disturbing details on how things went wrong :
The Destabilization of Pakistan
So far the principal result of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following the events of 9 - 11 has been the destabilization of Pakistan .
That breakdown is peaking with the events in what AP calls the “ Swat town ” of Mingora — actually a city of 375,000 from which all but 20,000 have fled as government forces moved in , strafing it with gunships .
We ’re talking urban guerrilla warfare , house - to - house fighting , not on the Afghan border but 50 miles away in the Swat Valley .
We ’re talking about Pakistani troops fighting to reclaim the nearby Malam Jabba ski resort from the Tehreek - e - Taliban , who since last year have been using it as a training center and logistics base .
We ’re talking about two million people fleeing the fighting in the valley and 160,000 in government refugee camps .
And of course , “ collateral damage ” :
As was reported in The News in Pakistan May 19 :
Several persons , including women and children , were killed and a number of others sustained injuries when families fleeing the military operation in Swat ’s Matta town were shelled while crossing a mountainous path to reach Karo Darra in Dir Upper on Monday , eyewitnesses and official sources said .
Eyewitnesses , who escaped the attack or were able to reach Wari town of Dir Upper in injured condition , said they were targeted by gunship helicopters .
However , police officials said they might have been hit by a stray shell .
Local people said they saw some 12 to 14 bodies on a mountain on the Swat side but could not go near to retrieve them or help the injured for fear of another aerial attack .
What a nightmare scenario for Pakistan .
We ’re talking about the Pakistani Army sometimes fighting over the last year to retake towns from Taliban forces in the Buner region of the North - West Frontier Province that are closer to the capital of Islamabad than the Afghan border .
And while the Talibs apparently lack popular support , even among the Pashtuns ( who are 15 % of the Pakistani population — 26 million and 42 % of the Afghan population — 14 million ) they have been able to inflict embarrassing defeats on the army .
Tehreek - i-Taliban leader Baitullah Mahsud , head of the militant forces in South Waziristan , established his credentials when his forces captured 300 Pakistani soldiers and traded them for about 30 imprisoned militants in the fall of 2007 .
Time and again , the several ( sometimes rival ) “ Taliban ” forces , which did not exist before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan created them , have forced the government to negotiate terms .
Most recently in February , Islamabad agreed to the implementation of the Sharia in the Swat Valley in exchange for peace .
The Taliban broke the agreement in April , or so the story goes , and the army claims it ’s killed 1,100 militants since .
But curiously , as of Sunday it claimed to have killed only 10 Taliban , while boasting of seizing ( according to AP ) “ a spot nicknamed ‘ bloody intersection ’ because militants routinely dumped the mutilated bodies of their victims there . ”
On Monday , I read of another four dead militants but the Taliban announced through a spokesman that they would maintain “ aides ” in place in the city , cease fire , and advise civilians to return .
It appears most have retreated to other towns , including Buner and Daggar where fighting goes on now .
This they can do under cover of the masses of refugees of course .
Now think of what has happened here .
Whether or not this was Osama bin Laden ’s conscious plan , the local , ethnically - based , ideological movement most receptive to his own ( i.e. , the Taliban , or more precisely , multiple talibans on the Pakistan side of the border ) has flourished since the U.S. attack upon Afghanistan in response to the 9 - 11 attacks .
The imperialist response to 9 - 11 inflamed Pashtunistan .
The toppling of the Taliban itself aroused indignation among many Pakistani as well as Afghan Pashtuns .
Some militants fleeing east met with the traditional Pasthtunwali welcome , as they would under less stressful circumstances , and beyond that political sympathy .
The drone missile attacks , the civilian deaths , the contemptuous official denials , the repeated insults to national sovereignty , the connivance of the regime in power , have angered many , perhaps most , Pakistanis .
While the Taliban has undergone a quiet resurgence in southern Afghanistan , leading U.S. generals to conclude that a military solution to the war is impossible , bands of religious “ students ” gathering around tribal leaders and warlords in Pakistan forming the umbrella “ Movement of the Taliban ” or Tehreek - e - Taliban under Mahsud have been able to generate this kind of chaos .
The Army had been deployed before against Indian forces .
But the disproportionately Pashtun force had never confronted or been trained to confront fanatical Pashtun jihadis–particularly when the issue was the implementation of the Sharia .
Not surprisingly it performed badly and Islamabad wound up cutting a deal in February to implement Islamic law in the Swat Valley .
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates can criticize that judgment in stating , “ We want to support [ the Pakistanis ] .
We want to help them in any way we can .
But it is important that they recognize the real threats to their country . ”
And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can tell Congress , “ I think the Pakistani government is basically abdicating to the Taliban and the extremists [ by making a peace deal in Swat ] .
Changing paradigms and mindsets is not easy , but I do believe there is an increasing awareness of not just the Pakistani government but the Pakistani people that this insurgency coming closer and closer to major cities does pose such a threat . ”
It ’s easy to lecture about such things , to judge the actions of another government facing a crisis .
But is n’t it obvious that ( what Clinton has , since at least April , been calling ) Pakistan ’s “ existential threat ” would n’t be closing in on the cities of that country had the U.S. not responded to 9 - 11 with the knee - jerk bombing of Afghanistan and the toppling of the Taliban ?
President Pervez Musharraf recalled that Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told him soon after 9 - 11 to “ prepare to go back to the Stone Age ” if he did n’t cooperate with the U.S. in the war on terrorism .
The existential threat to Pakistan was the Bush administration !
The Bush administration pressured Musharraf to deploy the Pakistan Army in border provinces where it had never been deployed and where its very presence was perceived as a provocation .
The result was the September 2005 “ peace agreement ” in which the government agreed to halt military operations along the border and dismantle checkpoints in return for tribal leaders ’ commitment to end support for militancy and prevent cross - border incursions into Afghanistan .
It was a face - saving defeat for the regime that drew U.S. criticism , as have all subsequent deals with the militants , which have in any case broken down , like the February deal in Swat .
The 2005 agreement followed the notorious Lal Masjid episode in Islamabad when the security forces stormed an important seminary and hotbed of Islamist activism .
The khatib ( prayer - leader ) had been dismissed for issuing a fatwa stating no Pakistani Army officer could be given an Islamic burial if died fighting the Taliban , and then the mosque had risen up in general rebellion , sparking solidarity attacks on government forces by militants in North Waziristan and the North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) .
The government was forced to back down .
That ’s been the pattern ever sense .
Get tough on the “ insurgents , ” with U.S. prodding , funding , and threats of funding reduction and direct intervention .
Then negotiate with tribal and religious leaders , recognizing locals ’ mistrust of outsiders , the Pakistani state , and its international backers , which the mullahs may identify as U.S. imperialism and Zionism .
And watch both carrot and stick policies fail as Pakistan ’s own homegrown Taliban insurgency swells alongside the recrudescent original next door .
Now , while the Pakistani Army is still struggling to take control of Mingora and the Taliban is regrouping , the insurgents have pulled off a brazen attack on the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) office compound in Lahore , in eastern Pakistan , on the border with India , killing about 30 and injuring 250 .
The irony here of course is that the Taliban was nurtured by the ISI in the 1990s and the attackers may well have known the location of ISI offices for that very reason .
Such terror has Bush ’s war on terror visited on Pakistan , with no end in sight .
And Obama ’s war in “ Af - Pak , ” reliant on a troop surge , more Predator drone attacks , and maybe some “ divide and conquer ” tactics , hold out little promise for relief .
U.S. officials screw up their faces as if genuinely puzzled about while the Pakistanis are n’t doing more–as if puzzled about why they do n’t understand that their existence is at stake .
The fact is that they are the ones on the outside looking in , who do not understand that the interests of U.S. imperialism do not cause religious and national and ethnic sensibilities to disappear or make it possible for local leaders , even those on the imperialist payroll , to snap their fingers , crush local resistance and produce social peace .
The interests of U.S. imperialism in this case , in the form of regime change in Afghanistan , and the way it was done , have antagonized much of the Pakistani population .
This is Washington ’s unwanted gift to Islamabad , for which Islamabad keeps getting paid and keeps paying .

Is there anything more refreshing than a cold , therapist crisp Mojito when it it ’s 200 degrees outside ?
I do n’t think so .
Nothing says summer like lime and ice and mint leaves .
Roasted potatoes ?
Those are more like fall and winter .
A summer potato is usually smothered in mayo and plopped on a picnic table .
Delicious yes , obesity but sometimes cold potato salad is n’t what I ’m craving .
So , here ’s my attempt to bring the refreshing summery - ness of a Mojito to the lowly potato .
I roasted them with garlic , olive oil , lime zest and salt , then tossed them with lime juice and fresh mint .
The caramelized potatoes and garlic added just the right amount of sweetness so that it really reminded me of a Mojito .
The lime and mint brightened them up and added a good bite .
They were really good and kind of addicting in that way that only roasted potatoes can be .
Although I loved them this way , I think I ’ll try a cold , salad version of this recipe next time .
Just boil the potatoes instead of roasting them and toss them with the rest of the ingredients once they ’re cool .
I bet that salad would be a big hit at my next BBQ !
Mojito Roasted Potatoes
2 lb. red potatoes , diced into bite - sized pieces
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic , minced
1 tbsp . salt
zest of 1 lime
juice of 1 lime
1/2 cup mint leaves , roughly chopped
Preheat the oven to 400° and toss the potatoes with the garlic , olive oil , salt and lime zest .
Spread the potatoes onto a cookie sheet in an even layer .
Bake for 30 minutes , or until the potatoes are golden and slightly crisp .
Remove from oven and place the potatoes in a bowl .
Toss with lime juice and mint leaves .
Serve immediately .
Makes 4 – 6 side servings .
Bernie Madoff is about to experience what it 's like to have his life 's worth taken out from under him .
A judge entered a preliminary order today to yank everything he 's got , and then some .
He 's absolutely finished .
A US district judge issued a final order for the forfeiture of $ 170,799,000,000 from Bernie , which divests him of basically everything but his ass .
I 'd make a joke about that being divested from him in prison , too - his sentencing that 'll be sending him into medium - security lockup is on Monday - but , oh , what the hell : Bernie Madoff 's ass will be divested from him in the hoosegow , or at the very least , commodified .
His sentence is expected to be somewhere between 25 and 35 years of hard time , but Bernie 's lawyer asked for a high single digit number due to Bernie 's old age .
Meanwhile , Ruth - who will most definitely be affected tomorrow by the rise in price of a Metrocard ( Agh ! ) in a few days - struck a bit of a deal .
She 's relinquishing $ 80 M in assets for a measly $ 2.5 Million in cold , hard cash .
She 's apparently not going to be attending Bernie 's sentencing , probably because eleven of Bernie 's victims are going to be having a snap - tacular prose slam of their grievances against Madoff in court that day .
She 's been given the option to have a statement read without her in the house , however , and according to her lawyer , might elect to do so .
I know one thing I would n't do with $ 2.5 Million in cash - invest in Bernie Madoff , har !
But really : it was recently reported that her kids have taken to calling her and Bernie by their names ( as opposed to , you know , " Mom " and " Dad " or whatever you call Bernie Madoff if he 's your dad - Scrooge McDuck ? ) , so who knows if they 're going to have doors open to her , or if they 're going to have doors , period .
Maybe Ruth can write a tell - all .
Maybe she can get a TV show !
I 'd like that : The Ruth Madoff QVC Hour .
Nice ring , right ?
Also , says some thug who consults Wall Street - ers who go to lockup :
" There will be people who think that Bernie can give them stock tips , but I do n't see anyone being his big pal , " said Larry Levine , founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants who served 10 years for his ties to organized crime .
" I believe he 'll be treated like an outcast . "
Look on the bright side , though .
Most parents never find the time to repair broken relationships with their kids .
Madoff 's going to have plenty of it .
An ideal blueprint for this kind of thing has thankfully already been provided :
Madoff reduced to nothing [ CNN ]
Madoff's Wife Cedes Asset Claim [ WSJ ]
" It 's drowning .
It gives you the complete sensation that you are drowning ...
I 'll put it to you this way :
You give me a waterboard , Dick Cheney and one hour , and I 'll have him confess to the Sharon Tate murders ....
I would prosecute every person that was involved in that torture .
I would prosecute the people that did it .
I would prosecute the people that ordered it , because torture is against the law .
Crazed and rejected , the GOP Left Behinds have nothing better to do than carp and complain that Obama is making America less safe .
Experienced from years of their bullshit , no one believes them -- except themselves .
Jack Goldsmith is a professor at Harvard Law , a member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law , and a former Assistant Attorney General in the Bush Regime .
I doubt Cheney has enjoyed reading his book , .
Nor will Cheney or any of the other apologists for the Bush years find much solace in a NeoCon - lite examination of why President Obama is waging a more effective war on terror than Bush did , The Cheney Fallacy in the current issue of .
I 'm no fan of Goldsmith 's but his readers can't walk away still buying the absurd premises pushed by the Inside the Beltway media that Cheney is a serious voice rather than a pathetic sore loser and lightweight hack .
Despite the media spin , polls show that most Americans prefer Obama 's national security policies .
They see Obama as a countervailing force between " the liberal left , " whatever that 's supposed to mean , and Dick Cheney .
Most Americans think Obama is doing a better job -- by a 2 to 1 margin -- than Bush did .
Like me , I bet a lot of Americans cringe when they hear toadies like Cheney and Sean Hannity claiming , as though any sentient being would ever buy their snake oil , that " Bush kept us safe . "
Bush did n't keep us safe ; Bush was a vital part of the 9/11 tragedy .
He failed to keep us safe and then compounded the damage with his wrongheaded , opportunistic responses from the next seven catastrophic years .
The worst president in the history of the United States did n't acquire that sobriquet by keeping the nation safe .
You may have seen ( or read about ) former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura -- an ex-Navy Seal who 's experienced waterboarding -- on > The View or on Larry King 's show He made the point that George W. Bush was the worst president of his lifetime and offered to waterboard Dick Cheney .
Yesterday he absolutely pulverized Sean Hannity on his own show .

FRANKFURT /DETROIT
( Reuters ) - GM edged closer to preparations for possible bankruptcy on Wednesday , a source familiar with the company ’s plans said , while Germany extended its subsidy for scrapping old cars .

Also on Wednesday , Daimler forecast 2009 sales would fall and struggling contract automaker Karmann said it had filed for insolvency .
General Motors Corp , which has until June 1 to complete a reorganization plan , is in “ intense ” and “ earnest ” preparations for a possible bankruptcy filing , the source said on Tuesday , sending its shares tumbling , to close down 11.89 percent .
Meanwhile in Europe , Daimler AG warned on Wednesday morning it expected a “ considerable ” drop in revenue in all of its automotive businesses this year and pushed back its expectations of when the industry might turn around into the second half .
It also repeated that it would post a significant loss in the first quarter .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s cabinet on Wednesday approved an increase in funds for its car scrapping subsidy , which pays a cash bonus to exchange old cars for new greener models , to 5 billion euros ( $ 6.60 billion ) , a government official familiar with the decision told Reuters .
The move came a day after the European Investment Bank approved 866 million euros ( $ 1.14 billion ) of loans to several automakers , including Volkswagen AG , Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Jaguar Land Rover to help them develop and build more fuel - efficient vehicles in Europe .
The money is part of a 7 billion euro package to the industry the European Union ’s lending arm expects to complete in the first half of this year .
Also on Wednesday , industry body data showed a deepening decline in demand for new cars in Russia , with sales plunging 47 percent in March year on year , compared with a 38 percent fall in February .
By 1044 GMT ( 6:44 a.m. EDT ) the DJ Auto Stoxx European index was up 3 percent .
GM BANKRUPTCY INEVITABLE ?
As Europe came to the aid of automakers , worries about the impact of possible automaker bankruptcies in the U.S. are widening and Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement said on Tuesday the government must be prepared for GM or Chrysler to enter bankruptcy protection .
Clement said Canada would guarantee the warranties of cars sold by GM and Chrysler , regardless of whether the automakers go into bankruptcy protection .
GM , operating with $ 13.4 billion of government loans since the start of the year , is under pressure to cut unsecured debt by two - thirds and make half of its remaining payments into a union healthcare trust in equity to preserve cash .
The government has warned the alternative would be bankruptcy .
A plan to split GM into a “ new ” company made up of its most successful units and an “ old ” company of unprofitable units , is gaining momentum and is seen as the most sensible configuration , said a source familiar with the talks .
Moody ’s Investors Service said on Tuesday that GM and Chrysler have a 70 percent chance of bankruptcy due to the difficulty of winning deep concessions from creditors out of court .
“ Given the lack of progress achieved and the additional progress that will be required in the revised plans , this threat will need to be seen as credible in order to compel adequate movement on the part of stakeholders , ” Moody ’s said .
Chrysler , owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP , also faces possible bankruptcy .
Chrysler has until April 30 to complete an alliance with Italian automaker Fiat .
In Asia , South Korea ’s cash - strapped sport utility vehicle maker Ssangyong Motor announced plans to slash its workforce and sell idle assets in a bid to ensure its survival .
Vietnam ’s first - quarter car sales slumped 36 percent on higher taxes and the economic slowdown , an industry report said .
But China vehicle sales for March could hit a record high , the official Shanghai Securities News said on Wednesday .

The American Clean Energy and Security Act , authored by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) and House Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chair Ed Markey ( D - MA ) would achieve a significant reduction in the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming .
The ACES mandates a 17 - percent reduction in greenhouse gases below 2005 levels by 2020 .
That translates into a cut of 2.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020 compared to inaction , according to a projection based on an analysis by the World Resources Institute .
This is comparable to taking 500 million cars off the road , which is twice the number of U.S. cars today , and half the cars expected in the world in 2020 .
This pollution reduction estimate is very conservative , since it does not include other complementary policies in the bill that would also reduce greenhouse gases .
These provisions include renewable electricity and efficiency standards that would give utilities until 2020 to generate 15 percent of their electricity from the wind , sun , and other clean sources .
Utilities would also have to reduce electricity demand by 5 percent .
These measures would further reduce greenhouse gas pollutions .
The ACES would also slash energy use in new buildings by 50 percent by 2016 .
Buildings are responsible for nearly half of energy use and greenhouse gas pollution , so this provision would achieve additional reductions beyond the cap .
These pollution reductions come not a moment too soon , since scientific evidence of global warming harms continue to mount .
In addition to fiercer storms , longer droughts , wetter floods , and scarcer food , global warming will harm human health .
Margaret Chan , the director - general of the World Health Organisation , noted that “ Climate change will affect , in profoundly adverse ways , some of the most fundamental determinants of health : food , air , water . ”
It is morally irresponsible to do nothing in the wake of this mounting evidence of the coming catastrophe .
Despite scientists ’ urgent pleas to act , many conservatives would prefer to do nothing .
House Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Joe Barton ( R - TX ) plans to introduce an energy bill that ignores global warming , except to prevent action to stop it .
Instead , it would continue the Bush - Cheney energy policies of “ drill , baby , drill ” and “ burn , baby , burn . ”
These policies led to an increase in average annual family energy costs of $ 1,100 .
On Monday , May 18 , the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin debate and vote on The American Clean Energy and Security Act .
It is not a perfect proposal that will magically solve our energy problems .
But it would slash global warming pollution by 1.2 billion tons , comparable to removing 500 million cars from the road .
It would create thousands of jobs manufacturing steel for wind turbines and building energy - efficient buildings .
ACES would reduce our oil use and increase our national security .
Representatives Waxman and Markey have done monumental work to start on the long road to a clean - energy future after being stalled for the last eight years .

More than 17 million U.S. children live more than an hour away by ground or air transportation from a life - saving pediatric trauma center , according to a new study by researchers at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania .
The creation of a national inventory of pediatric trauma centers may help to identify the locations of gaps and greatly improve access to care for U.S. children , the authors said .
The average proximity to a pediatric trauma center varies widely from state to state , with the largest gaps in the most rural areas .
Hawaii , Maine , Montana , New Mexico , North Dakota and Wyoming offer almost no access to a verified pediatric trauma center in less than an hour , while virtually all children living in areas such as the District of Columbia , New Jersey , Connecticut , Maryland , Massachusetts and Rhode Island are within 60 minutes of specialized trauma care .
Establishing guidelines for the basic resources necessary for designation as a pediatric trauma center and maintaining an inventory of the location of these centers may improve today 's fragmented access to life - saving trauma care , the study authors said .
Studies show trauma centers provide benefit to severely injured patients of all ages , and timely access to medical care may save lives .
In children ages 1 to 14 , injury causes more deaths than all other causes combined .
While more than 70 percent of U.S. children can be transported by either ground or air to a pediatric trauma center within an hour , vast pockets live in regions that are too far away .
Past studies have shown similar gaps in the adult population living in rural areas .
" This study shows that access to pediatric trauma centers is variable and inadequate in many areas of the U.S.
Timely access to the best possible care is likely to save the lives of more children , " said Michael L. Nance , M.D. , lead author of the study and director of the Trauma Program at Children 's Hospital .
" We need to set up guidelines to help hospitals understand what is required to establish a pediatric trauma center where those centers should be . "
The researchers ' article appears in the June issue of the journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
The study identified 170 pediatric trauma centers in 40 states and the District of Columbia , which equals about one center for every 358,000 children .
The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma accredits most U.S. trauma centers .
The researchers combined that organization 's records with the American Trauma Society 's list of adult centers designated as " pediatric capable , " and the National Association of Children 's Hospitals and Related Institutions ' members self - classified as trauma centers .
" The lack of a single national accrediting body or uniform standards for pediatric trauma centers has been an obstacle to understanding the resources that exist for the care of our most severely injured children , " said Nance , who added , " A reliable inventory of accredited pediatric trauma centers will allow for expansion of resources into areas currently underserved . "
The study did not look at patient outcomes from injury as it relates to access to a center in under an hour .
And , although the care delivered to children in an adult - care setting may be adequate , without reliable guidelines , it is impossible to determine if the best care is being provided to the most severely injured children .

I was never one for female body builders .
The only real experience I ’ve had with them was a weird few months where I ’d jerk off to videos of the shit .
Then there was my little league baseball coach who tried seducing me with his mustache when explaining what steroids does to a clit when I was 12 .
I guess there was also a group of strippers the local strip club hired who would do sit-ups and push - ups and chin-ups with their fake tits and big strong pussy exposed and I did n’t really dig it .
The only good thing about these kinds of muscular bitches is that they have these insane sex drives , probably from the high testosterone from the muscles , the only problem with them is that going down on a bitch while staring at her abs pulsating , or cumming all over a rock hard muscular ass while her pussy down bicep curls , is enough to make a motherfucker feel gay .
So Mel B and this 6 - pack is fuckin’ nuts and not for me , but I figure maybe you ’ll dig it and I ’m here to help … .

The FBI has set its sights on satellite descramblers , charging three individuals behind the Viewsat satellite receiver with conspiracy to violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
The indictment was unsealed this week after Viewtech owner Jung Kwak was arrested in San Diego , where he is currently being held without bail .
Several associates were also arrested .
The group faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine each .
Some of our readers may be familiar with the Viewsat — it 's a free - to - air ( FTA ) satellite receiver box that claims to provide users with access to free satellite programming , such as religious and cultural content .
However , as most Viewsat customers also know , the device is engineered in such a way that makes it simple for users to grab what is otherwise designated as for - pay satellite programming .
All that 's required is for the FTA boxes to spoof DISH 's smartcards so that the DISH Network can see that the boxes are authorized .
The satellite companies know that this practice is n't particularly rare , so they occasionally re-encrypt their signals and send out new smartcards to legitimate customers .
In this case , DISH Network started rolling out new encryption known as either " Nagra 3 " or " rom 240 , " this update " dramatically " reducing the sales of Viewsat receivers , according to the indictment document .
By March of 2008 , Kwak began working with the other two defendants , Phillip Allison and Robert Ward , to circumvent this new encryption .
Kwak allegedly agreed to reimburse their expenses and finance research on how to crack Nagra 3 , while the other two worked together and recruited more hackers for the project .
Among other things , the group spent $ 8,500 on a microscope for use in analyzing the new DISH smartcard and paid $ 20,000 for detailed photographs of the card .
In a particularly damning comment , Kwak apparently said on a March 2009 conference call that he wanted to reimburse expenses in person because , " I do n't want no traces or records . "
Oops .
As a result , the FBI charged the trio with conspiracy to violate the DMCA , which bars circumvention of encryption technologies like the ones DISH uses .
It 's going to be hard for the defendants to argue their way out of this one , if the facts are true — not only did the group seek to profit from stolen satellite signals , it was also obviously aware that what it was doing was n't legal and then ( unsuccessfully ) attempted to operate with no paper trail .

Die Geschichte geht so : wer Goldbarren hat , läßt die nicht zuhause im Safe liegen , sondern hat sie bei einem Gold Depository , wo sie in einem ordentlichen Vault liegen und versichert sind .
Dafür zahlt man ein paar Dollar im Monat .
Nun will kaum jemand dann tatsächlich das Gold haben , das er da einliegen hat .
Wenn man das an jemand anderen verkauft , kann man ja einfach den Einlagervertrag weitergeben .
Wenn man so einen Einlagervertrag hat , ist das nicht für " einen Goldbarren " sondern für einen bestimmten Goldbarren , mit Seriennummer und so .
Was jetzt passiert ist , dass einige Leute ihren Goldbarren abholen wollten , und einen anderen gekriegt haben .
Jim Sinclair of jsmineset.com , a legendary gold trader , reported that some of his contacts have told him that , when they request to withdraw their 100 oz .
bars from the Comex depositories , they have not received the proper indicted bars .
They received a bar , but not one with the correct serial number or weight .
Aber hey , da ist halt viel los , Fehler passieren , … hier kommt die Verschwörungstheorie :
Another possibility is that the bar indicated on the warehouse receipt does not actually exist .
The implications of that are rather dire .
In April , delivery notices were sent on a whopping 1.5 million ounces of gold , against 2.5 million ounces of dealer inventory .
That month , Deutsche Bank alone delivered 850,000 ounces .
This coincided , rather suspiciously , with a sale of 1.14 million ounces of gold by the European Central Bank that month , suggesting that Deutsche Bank was being bailed out in a big way .
Wow .
Das ist natürlich zu krass , als dass sich da jemand von der Deutschen Bank oder der EZB zu äußern könnte oder würde .
Insofern : als wilde Theorie betrachten .
Und ab jetzt das Gold lieber selbst bei einem solchen Service lagern , nicht via eine Großbank .
Now Mark Sanford says he is " thankful " for the experience afforded him by his extra-marital affair .
Seriously .
In an op - ed written for South Carolina newspapers , Sanford writes :
It is true that I did wrong and failed at the largest of levels , but equally true is the fact that God can make good of our respective wrongs in life .
In this vein , while none of us has the chance to attend our own funeral , in many ways I feel like I was at my own in the past weeks , and surprisingly I am thankful for the perspective it has afforded .
Look , Mark , I do n't know if you 've ever been to a funeral , but what you 've been through over the past few weeks -- a five - day vacation with your mistress in Argentina and another five - day vacation with your wife in an undisclosed location ( all the while pulling down a fat paycheck ) -- is n't anything like a funeral .
If you had resigned as governor , maybe you could claim this was like a funeral of sorts , but judging by the fact that you are keeping yourself in the public eye , you 're holding out hopes for your political career , are n't you ?
In fact , you are trying to nurse it back to life , right ?
A sort of a political reincarnation , no ?
Truth is , you 're trying to seduce the Republican electorate by spinning this whole sordid affair as a story of God -- with yourself as the hero , struggling to return from the beyond , a story of your own rebirth .
To wit :
I ’ve been humbled and broken as never before in my life , and as a consequence have given up areas of control in a way that I never have before .
And it is my belief that this will make me a better father , husband , friend and advocate .
It ’s in the spirit of making good from bad that I am committing to you and the larger family of South Carolinians to use this experience both to trust God in his larger work of changing me and , from my end , to work to becoming a better and more effective leader .
Listen , Mark , you might as well have gone all the way and started talking about what it will be like at your own resurrection , because that 's what you 're going for here .
Jebus .
Talk about a complex .
You 've got the fever something fierce .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Hope was 14 years old when her uncle raped her .
Betty Makoni founded the Girl Child Network to help Zimbabwe 's young sexual abuse victims .
" He trapped me to the ground and covered my mouth with his hand , " said the 18 - year - old from Zimbabwe .
" He threatened to kill me if I ever told anybody . "
So , she kept quiet .
" After a while people around the villages started saying that I looked pregnant , " she said .
Hope was not only pregnant , but her uncle had infected her with HIV .
Like many young girls in Zimbabwe , Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease .
This so - called virgin myth , perpetuated by Zimbabwe 's traditional healers , has led to the rape of hundreds of girls , according to UNICEF .
Some of those victims are too young to walk , much less protect themselves .
Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country 's young girls from sexual abuse .
And she 's witnessed some of the worst cases of the myth in action .
" The youngest girl I ever came across was a day - old baby who was raped , " said Makoni , 37 .
Through her Girl Child Network ( GCN ) , Makoni has helped rescue 35,000 girls from abuse -- including Hope ; thousands more have found an empowering community and a public forum in which to speak out .
Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year
" Ten girls per day report rape cases , " she said .
" It means if we keep quiet , at least 3,600 girls per year may just be contracting HIV and AIDS . "
Makoni's own tragic experiences fuel her fierce determination .
" I was raped when I was 6 years old , " she recalled .
Her attacker was a local shopkeeper .
Makoni said her mother would not allow her to report the abuse .
" She said , ' Shh , we do n't say that in public , ' " Makoni remembered .
" I had no shoulder to cry on . "
Three years later , she witnessed her father murder her mother .
In that moment , Makoni said she realized the potentially deadly consequence of a woman 's silence .
" I told myself that no girl or woman will suffer the same again , " she said .
Believing an education would provide her the best opportunity and means to speak out , Makoni earned two university degrees and became a teacher .
While teaching , she noticed that girls were dropping out of school at an alarming rate .
She approached her students with an idea .
" I [ said ] to girls , ' Let 's have our own space where we talk and find solutions , ' " Makoni said .
Girl Child Network was born .
Watch Makoni help young girls find safety and empowerment in Zimbabwe »
By the end of the first year , there were 100 GCN clubs throughout Zimbabwe where girls could find support .
Makoni said she was not surprised : " Every woman and girl identified with the issues that we were raising , " she said .
In 2000 , she quit her teaching job to volunteer with GCN full time .
" I decided to become an advocate because I walked my own journey to survival , " she said .
The following year Makoni successfully procured a piece of land and opened the organization 's first empowerment village , designed to provide a haven for girls who have been abused .
Girls are either rescued or referred to the village by social services , the police and the community .
The healing begins as soon as a girl arrives .
" In the first 72 hours , a girl is provided with emergency medication , reinstatement in school , as well as counseling , " said Makoni .
It is important to her that the girls are in charge of their own healing .
" It gives them the confidence to transform from victims to leaders , " she explained .
The process helped Hope work through the times when she said " I thought my life had come to end . "
" They offered all they could ... as I was in a traumatized state , " she said .
" I really appreciate what [ Betty Makoni ] has done and is doing in my life . "
Today , GCN has grown to 700 girls ' clubs and three empowerment villages across Zimbabwe .
An estimated 300,000 girls have received assistance .
For those who were at greatest risk , Makoni believes that help was especially critical .
" If my organization did n't exist , the 35,000 girls I 've saved from rape and abuse could have died by now , " she said .
But for Makoni , speaking out came with a high personal cost .
In 2008 , she was forced to flee her native country .
" I left Zimbabwe because my life was in danger as a result of my project being interpreted politically . "
Watch Makoni describe her reasons for leaving her homeland »
Today , she lives with her family in the United Kingdom .
She still serves as executive director of her organization and shows no signs of slowing down .
GCN has partnered with the DOVE project , a group based in Essex , England , that deals with domestic violence .
" We are now bringing the girls from a local community to the international scene , " she said .
Her efforts in Zimbabwe will also be highlighted in an upcoming documentary , Tapestries of Hope .
Makoni says nothing will end her fight for the rights of women and girls .
" This is the job I have always wanted to do , because it gives me fulfillment .
And in girls I see myself every day . "

Analyst firm IDC suggests that a major economic upturn could spur in the near future and North Americans will benefit in large part from the sales of Windows 7 .
The report even suggests that Microsoft 's latest operating system has the potential to save us from the current recession all on its own .
IDC estimates that Microsoft will sell about 177 million copies of Windows 7 all together , with 50 million of those sales coming from the European market .
Windows 7 Stimulus Ripple Effect
How will this help the rest of us ?
Looking at a sales snapshot from October 2009 ( the expected release date of the new OS ) until the end of 2010 , every dollar made by Microsoft will translate into $ 18.52 in revenue accumulated by the IT sector .
If these figures hold true , the North American economy can soon afford to shell out an additional $ 320 billion in goods and services thanks to Windows 7 . ( Source : itpro.co.uk )
In regards to the European market , every euro made by Microsoft will translate into 19 euros in revenue accumulated by the EU IT sector .
The revenue figures listed above pertain to all aspects of Windows 7 , including training , installation , increased hardware sales and other parts of the IT sector that are connected to software .
Earlier Negative Outlook " Untrue "
It is interesting to hear such optimism surrounding Windows 7 after an earlier survey had suggested that some businesses would hold off on upgrading to Windows 7 to save money .
According to IDC , nothing could be farther from the truth .
At the end of 2010 , it is estimated that seven million people in the IT industry all across the world will be using Windows 7 , with 1.5 million in Europe .
That 's a fifth of the entire IT workforce .
( Source : itpro.co.uk )
It is expected that Windows 7 could also lead to the creation of 300,000 new jobs in client operating systems all on its own .
If these predictions are valid , Windows 7 could have more to offer us than software alone .
Notes from the newsroom on grammar , usage and style .
The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court prompted discussion about our use of “ Hispanic , ” “ Latino ” and related terms .
It ’s not a simple issue , and I consulted with a number of reporters and editors here who offered good counsel .
Here are some key points to keep in mind :
• While both “ Latino ” and “ Hispanic ” are generally acceptable , some people have a strong preference .
We should respect those preferences as much as possible in referring to individuals and groups ; reporters and editors should routinely ask .
• Specific references like “ Puerto Rican ” or “ Mexican - American ” or “ Guatemalan immigrant ” are often best .
• Judge Sotomayor clearly uses “ Latina ” for herself , and we should respect that preference whenever feasible .
In more detailed references , we can note that her parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico .
Once again , remember : they were not immigrants .
• In describing one distinction she would attain if confirmed , I think we have to say she would be “ the first Hispanic justice , ” despite her own use of “ Latina . ”
Calling her “ the first Latina justice ” is n’t quite what we mean , and several people I consulted agreed that calling her “ the first Latino justice , ” while perhaps grammatically defensible , seems awkward or wrong .
• I will adjust the current entry in The Times ’s stylebook to clarify that “ Latina , ” like “ Latino , ” can be used as an adjective as well as a noun .
We should be aware , though , that for many English speakers the use of inflected adjectives may still be unfamiliar .
• As always , references to ethnicity should be used only when they are pertinent , and the pertinence is clear to readers .
One reporter pointed out that many second - and third - generation Latinos regard themselves as simply “ American ” or “ Texan ” or whatever .
If ancestry is relevant , phrases like “ a lawyer of Mexican descent ” or “ a New York native of Puerto Rican descent ” might serve .
• Our stylebook defines “ Hispanic ” as “ descended from a Spanish - speaking land or culture . ”
But be aware that opinions vary on how broadly to apply these terms .
Can “ Hispanic immigrants ” describe a group that includes Brazilians or other Portuguese speakers ?
Can “ Hispanic ” describe immigrants from Spain itself ?
Once again , being specific will help minimize confusion or ambiguity .
• We should avoid constructions like “ President Obama has nominated Judge Sotomayor to be the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court , ” or “ Judge Sotomayor is hoping to become the first Hispanic justice . ”
That phrasing suggests that their primary goal is to have a Hispanic justice .
We can note the potential distinction parenthetically : “ Judge Sotomayor , who would be the court ’s first Hispanic justice , … ” ( Similarly , during the presidential campaign , we tried to avoid phrases like , “ Senator Obama is campaigning to become the first African - American president ” — that was n’t the point of his campaign . )
A brief report from the Pew Hispanic Center offers some interesting background ( including more on the Cardozo question ) .
Here ’s one section :
Q. How do Hispanics themselves feel about the labels “ Hispanic ” and “ Latino ” ?
A . The labels are not universally embraced by the community that has been labeled .
A 2006 survey by the Pew Hispanic Center found that 48 % of Latino adults generally describe themselves by their country of origin first ; 26 % generally use the terms Latino or Hispanic first ; and 24 % generally call themselves American on first reference .
As for a preference between “ Hispanic ” and “ Latino ” , a 2008 Center survey found that 36 % of respondents prefer the term “ Hispanic , ” 21 % prefer the term “ Latino ” and the rest have no preference .
Q. What about Puerto Ricans ?
Where do they fit in ?
A. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth — whether they were born in New York ( like Judge Sotomayor ) or in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( like her parents ) .
According to the Census , some 97 % of all persons born in Puerto Rico and living in the mainland United States consider themselves Hispanics .
Overall , Puerto Ricans are the second largest group of Hispanics in the 50 states and District of Columbia — they make up 9 % of the mainland Hispanic population , well behind the Mexican - origin share of 64 % , but ahead of the 3.5 % share of Cubans .
In 2007 , the 4.1 million persons of Puerto Rican origin living in the mainland United States exceeded Puerto Rico ’s population of 3.9 million .
Verb Trouble
We ’ve had a few slips lately in handling past tenses of strong , or irregular , verbs .
Readers are quick to point these out , and loud in voicing their dismay .
( And if you have the feeling that I ’m repeating myself , you ’re right .
Check here for a fuller diatribe on the subject . )

By then , Orlando Coach Stan Van Gundy had already wrote and underlined the numbers that mattered on a dry - erase board : “ 32 - 1 . ’’
This was fixed for later editions , but not before some disappointed readers had seen the gaffe .

The talk was called “ the New Foundation speech , ’’ and in the month since then , Mr. Obama has weaved the phrase into 14 public addresses .
Make it “ has woven . ”
Dictionaries allow “ weaved ” and “ had weaved ” instead of “ wove ” and “ had woven ” only in the special sense of making one ’s way by winding back and forth : “ The car weaved from lane to lane at high speed . ”

Mr. Zhao had initially wrote notes and then around 2000 , encouraged by three sympathetic former officials who were allowed to visit him , decided to tape his memoirs , which he did partly in the presence of those supporters , said Bao Tong , a former close adviser to Mr. Zhao who remains under tight surveillance in Beijing .
I ’m not sure about this case , but sometimes errors like this result from an incomplete revision .
More Verb Trouble
When there is more than one acceptable form for a verb , we should normally use the first one given in our preferred dictionary ( Webster ’s New World College Dictionary ) .
A few cases where we ’ve been inconsistent :
• Kneel :
For the past tense use knelt , the first option in the dictionary .
Our archives show eight uses of “ kneeled ” in the past year .
• Tread : Normally use trod for the past .
We ’ve had several instances of “ treaded , ” which the dictionary notes should be confined to the special sense of “ treaded water . ”
• Plead :
Use pleaded ( it ’s in the stylebook as well as the dictionary ) .
This is a somewhat unusual case where we prefer the regular or “ weak ” past form , using the - ed ending , to the irregular or “ strong ” form “ pled . ”

After Deadline examines questions of grammar , usage and style encountered by writers and editors of The Times .
It is adapted from a weekly newsroom critique overseen by Philip B. Corbett , the deputy news editor who is also in charge of The Times ’s style manual .
On the morning of July 20 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong and I floated up through the access tunnel that linked Apollo 11 ’s command module to its lunar module , the spacecraft in which Neil and I would descend to the lunar surface .
Three days earlier , I had entered the lunar module to check things out and prepare what would be Neil ’s and my home away from home for approximately 24 hours .
The “ LM , ” though a technological wonder , was the epitome of bare - bones construction .
Because it had to be as light as possible , it was far from luxurious inside .
There were no seats or sleeping couches .
Neil and I would sleep in makeshift hammocks hung from the walls , and we would fly the lunar lander while standing up , wearing our 21 - layer pressurized suits and helmets .
Two small triangular windows provided our only sight of the surface .
Crucial to the success of the landing was the module ’s guidance computer .
Like its twin on the command module , this machine had a 19 - button keyboard , a 2.048 MHz clock processor , and about 74 kilobytes of memory .
In short , many modern mobile phones have more computing power than Apollo 11 did .
But those two computers enabled us to measure our velocity changes to a hundredth of a foot per second , determine course corrections , and make minute maneuvers for our descent to the moon .
On the day that Neil , our crew mate Michael Collins , and I launched , we were probably 60 percent certain that we would succeed in landing on the moon and 95 percent sure that we would make it home alive .
We depended on those computers to work astoundingly well .
The three of us were on the far side of the moon , during our 13th orbit , when Mike announced that we were ready to commence undocking .
Until this point , our linked pair of spacecraft had simply been known as Apollo 11 .
Now , as we sealed off the hatches to become two separate entities , the command module would take on the name picked by Mike , the Columbia , and the lunar module became known to Mission Control and the world as the Eagle .
Mike wasted no time when Houston ordered the undocking .
As though he were backing a truck out of a parking space , he pulled the Columbia away from the Eagle , releasing us with a thump .
“ Okay , Eagle , ” he said .
“ You guys take care . ”
“ See you later , ” Neil replied , just as casually .
More than two hours later , Neil and I were flying about eight miles above the lunar surface when the voice of astronaut Charlie Duke , communicating from Mission Control , parted the static : “ Eagle , Houston , ” Charlie said , in his friendly Texas drawl .
“ If you ’re ready , you ’re go for powered descent . ”
Neil nodded .
Inside my helmet , I grinned .
In 11 minutes we were going to set the Eagle down for a landing unlike any other .
Oddly , when Neil threw the switch to ignite the descent burn , we could barely feel any sensation caused by the orange plume pouring from our engine into the black space below us .
Had we not seen the change on the instrument panel in front of us , we might not have even known that the engine was whisking us downward .
But downward we were going , and rapidly , too .
Five minutes into our powered descent , everything was looking good .
Suddenly , though , an alarm flashed on the screen in front of us .
“ Program alarm ! ” Neil said instantly .
Even with our transmissions traveling at the speed of light , there was a three - second delay in our communications with Earth , meaning that Charlie could n’t respond immediately .
“ It ’s a twelve - oh - two . ” Neil added .
“ What is it ? ”
We had never seen a 1202 alarm in our simulations , and in the middle of our crucial landing maneuver , we were n’t about to take out the thick navigation dictionary we had brought along .
To Houston , Neil said , “ Give us a reading on the twelve - oh - two program alarm . ”
“ Twelve - oh - two , ” I repeated , as the data screen in front of me went blank .
We were now at 33,000 feet , not a time to have our landing data disappear .
Neil and I exchanged tense looks .
Something was causing our guidance computer to have difficulty handling the gigantic array of information coming into it from the landing radar .
Neil and I were n’t thinking about aborting ; we did n’t want to get this close and have to turn back .
On the other hand , the alarm was ominous .
Even if we succeeded in landing without the aid of the computer , the malfunction could prevent us from blasting off the moon and making our rendezvous with Mike the next day .
The demands on the computer then would be even greater .
While we grappled silently with these possibilities , we continued descending toward the moon , the large red abort button looming large in front of us .
If either Neil or I hit the button , the Eagle would instantly blast back up toward Columbia , and America ’s attempt to land on the moon would be dubbed a failure .
“ Roger , ” Charlie ’s voice broke through the static into our headsets .
“ We ’ve got you ... we ’re go on that alarm . ”
Even from 250,000 miles away , I could hear the stress in Charlie ’s voice .
Yet for some reason the experts at Mission Control judged the computer problem an “ acceptable risk , ” whatever that meant .
There was no time for discussion ; we could only trust that Mission Control had our best interests at heart .
Of the hundreds and hundreds of people who had helped get us here , nobody wanted to abort the mission .
Yet at the same time we knew that Mission Control would not jeopardize our lives unnecessarily .
Two nights before we launched , NASA ’s top administrator , Tom Paine , had eaten dinner with Neil , Mike , and me in the crew quarters .
“ If you have to abort , ” he said , “ I ’ll see that you fly the next moon landing flight .
Just do n’t get killed . ”
Just as I was getting over my concern about the first alarm , another 1202 alarm appeared on the display .
I felt a shot of adrenaline surge through my system .
At Mission Control , 26 - year - old Steve Bales was the expert in the LM guidance systems .
When the alarms started flashing in the Eagle , they showed up on Steve ’s computer as well .
Even if Steve did n’t know the source of the problem , he did know that the computer was programmed to ignore the data causing the overload while it did the more important computations necessary for landing .
Or so he hoped .
In any case , he had little time to think when mission flight director Gene Kranz called out to him by the acronym
Steve held as guidance officer : “ GUIDO ?
Are you happy ? ”
Eyes glued to his computer screen , Steve called back , “ Go ! ”
At about 1,000 feet , Neil began a visual search , looking for a good spot to land .
My gaze , meanwhile , was glued to the panel in front of me .
With the dropouts in radar information , it was vital that Neil receive accurate altimeter readings .
Moreover , our fuel level was becoming a concern .
Neil was not happy with what he saw as we headed to our designated landing site .
“ Seven - fifty , coming down at 23 , ” I said , letting Neil know that we were a mere 750 feet above the surface and descending at 23 feet per second .
“ Okay , ” Neil said .
“ Pretty rocky area … ”
“ Six hundred , down at 19 . ”
Neil had made up his mind .
“ I ’m going to … ” He did n’t have to finish his statement .
I knew that Neil was taking over manual control of the Eagle .
Good thing , too , since our computer was leading us into a landing field littered with large boulders .
Neil made a split - second decision to fly long , to go farther than we had planned , to search for a safe landing area .
“ Okay , 400 feet , ” I let him know , “ down at nine . ”
Then , for the first time , I added , “ Fifty - eight forward . ”
We were now skimming over the moon ’s surface at 58 feet per second , about 40 miles an hour .
“ No problem , ” Neil responded , but I could tell by the tone of his voice that he still was n’t satisfied with the terrain .
I started to be concerned about our fuel .
It would be problematic to get this close and “ run out of gas . ”
“ Three hundred , ” I called .
“ Okay , how ’s the fuel ? ” Neil asked without taking his eyes from the surface .
“ Eight percent , ” I responded .
“ Okay , here ’s a ... looks like a good area here . ”
Then : “ Gonna be right over that crater . ”
“ Two hundred feet , four and a half down , ” I said .
I looked at our fuel gauge .
We had about 94 seconds of fuel remaining , and Neil was still searching for a spot to bring us down .
Once we got down to what we called the “ bingo ” fuel call , we would have to land within 20 seconds or abort .
If we were at 50 feet when we hit the bingo mark , and were coming down in a good spot , we could still land .
But if we still had 70 to 100 feet to go , it would be too risky to land ; we ’d come down too hard .
Not wanting to say anything that might disrupt Neil ’s focus , I pretty much used my body English , as best I could in a spacesuit , as if to say , Neil , get this on the ground !
“ Sixty seconds , ” Charlie warned .
Our ascent engine fuel tanks were filled to capacity , but that fuel did us no good , since the descent engine tanks were completely separate .
We had 60 seconds ’ worth of fuel left in the descent tanks to either land or abort .
“ Sixty feet , down two and a half . ”
Neil had slowed our descent .
“ Forty feet … Picking up some dust . ”
We were moving over the lunar surface like a helicopter coming in for a landing , but we were now in what we sometimes referred to as the “ dead zone . ”
If we ran out of fuel at this altitude , we would crash onto the moon before our ascent engine could push us back into space .
“ Thirty seconds , ” Charlie said , the nervousness evident in his voice .
Neil slowed the Eagle even more , searching … searching …
Then I saw it — the shadow of one of the three footpads that had touched the surface .
Although our engine was still running and the Eagle was hovering , a probe had touched the surface .
“ Contact light , ” I said .
Neil and I looked at each other with a stolen glance of relief and immense satisfaction .
The LM settled gently , and we stopped moving .
“ Shutdown , ” I heard Neil say .
It was 4:17 p.m. ( EDT ) .
We had less than 20 seconds ’ worth of fuel remaining , but we were on the moon .
“ We copy you down , Eagle , ” Charlie Duke said .
I had already turned my focus to completing a flight checklist , but I paused now , and for the first time glanced out my window .
The moon ’s pockmarked terrain , which now for the first time in its existence hosted human beings , stretched out as far as I could see .
At that moment , Neil did something that really surprised me .
“ Houston , ” he said calmly .
“ Tranquility Base here .
The Eagle has landed . ”
“ We made it ! ” I whispered , almost as if I did n’t want to seem amazed .

Clicking on it took you to a story from " News 5 " in Sacramento – which is not a TV station – revealing how one Mary Steadman now makes $ 6,500 a month working from home , thanks to an internet course called Google Home Income .
The story has art , it has a sidebar , there 's weather , supposed reader comments – even ads .
Steadman is described as " a mother from San Francisco " – at least , when I read the article .
Thanks to cutting - edge reporting techniques perfected by News 5 , she will automatically move to the geolocation of your internet IP address when you read it .
Look , she lives right in your neighborhood !
Salon displayed a similar ad yesterday , showing a newspaper clipping with the headline , " Can You Really Work Online at Home ?
We Investigate This Trend . "
Click through the Salon ad , and John B. Guiseman 's story at the Miami Gazette News reports glowingly – but with a convincing patina of journalistic distance – about software called Easy Google Profits .
The reader comments below the article are also laudatory , though many happen to be identical to comments on the News 5 piece , just with different names .
It turns out there 's a whole fake - media empire pushing the story of the massive profits to be made by gaming Google from home : The Boston Weekly News , USA Financial Post , America Finance News , New York Finance News , Ohio Business News , the New York Tribune News , the Bakersfield Gazette , the San Jose Times , and the prestigious New York City Hearld .
No , not " Herald " ; Hearld .
Mary Steadman appears in most of the fake stories , sometimes shown on the cover of Riches magazine , or in a still frame from a notional TV newscast .
Steadman is variously reported as owing her windfall to Google Cash Club , the Google Biz Kit , Google Automated Income , Google Cash and an endless series of similar mail or internet business courses or software , all sold by different companies , which , one suspects , are really all the same .
In some stories , Samantha Cafferty is the lucky entrepreneur , though the details of the story are the same .
Consumers who have signed up for the $ 2 trial have reported being hit with surprise charges on their credit cards ranging from $ 70 to $ 80 .
When they call the company to complain , they 're told that they agreed to the charges in the terms - of - service on the website , which they surely read .
You 're in for a similar treatment if you visited Slate yesterday , and were persuaded by the report from " News 3 " – which looks to be , but is n't , an ABC affiliate – about a miracle anti-aging pill called Resveratrol Ultra .
In it you learn that veteran TV reporter and health specialist Katie Wilson started off as a Resveratrol Ultra skeptic .
But when her " news director " asked her to do a story on the wonder drug , she tried it herself .
" I can say with the utmost certainty that this is a feel good story for the ' ages ' ! , " she concluded .
Just look at how youthful and vibrant she is holding that TV microphone !
If you sign up for the free sample , the company will start charging about $ 80 - a- month to your credit card , unless you cancel .
That 's from Forbes , which is even more reliable than the New York City Hearld .
The U.S. Supreme Court put elected judges on notice Monday that they must step aside from deciding cases involving big - money donors who helped them win their jobs .
The decision comes after a decade in which corporate interests and trial lawyers have waged increasingly costly campaigns for 21 states ’ supreme court seats .
Most are in the Great Lakes region or the South .
The justices said Monday that there is a real risk of bias -- and certainly the appearance of it -- if one side has spent millions to elect the judge .
“ Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause , ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority in the 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision , so too can fears of bias arise when “ a man chooses the judge in his own cause . ”

Case was criticized
The case centered on Don Blankenship , a West Virginia coal company executive who spent $ 3 million of his own money to oust one West Virginia Supreme Court justice and to elect his replacement .
At the time , Blankenship and his Massey Coal Co. were appealing a $ 50 - million jury verdict for having driven a small competitor into bankruptcy .
After the election , new Justice Brent Benjamin cast the deciding vote -- twice -- to throw out the verdict against Massey .
The case drew wide criticism as a seemingly blatant example of how money could buy justice , and it suggested the plot for a John Grisham novel , “ The Appeal . ”
The West Virginia case also spotlighted growing concern over the effect of money in state high court races .

( In California , Superior Court judges are elected , but the governor appoints state Supreme Court justices . )
The Supreme Court did not set a hard or clear rule for when a judge must step aside .
The four dissenters called the ruling hazy .
But Kennedy said the principle of fairness requires that a judge not decide cases for a favored benefactor .
“ Not every campaign contribution by a litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias , ” Kennedy said .
But “ when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence ” in putting the judge on the case , that judge would have to step aside , he wrote .

In one sense , the court ’s ruling puts legal force behind a long - standing provision in the judicial code that says a judge “ shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned . ”
This code applies to all judges , including those on the Supreme Court .
But unlike other judges , its justices alone get to decide whether they have violated the code .
This issue arose in 2004 when the Sierra Club asked Justice Antonin Scalia to step aside from deciding a case involving Vice President Dick Cheney and his energy policy task force .
Scalia had gone duck hunting with Cheney in Louisiana shortly after the court agreed to hear his case .
Scalia refused to step aside , saying that the case involved the office of the vice president , not Cheney personally .
Dissent , reaction

On Monday , he dissented along with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The ruling in the West Virginia case “ will inevitably lead to an increase in allegations that judges are biased , however groundless those charges may be , ” Roberts wrote in the dissent , which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also joined .
Legal reformers praised the ruling .
“ This is an appropriately narrow ruling that represents a huge victory for a very basic principle : the right to a fair hearing , ” said James Sample , a lawyer for the Brennan Center in New York .
“ It sets a floor .
Now , it is up to the states . ”
Contribution limits may not be the answer , he noted .
Blankenship gave the legal limit of $ 1,000 directly to Benjamin ’s campaign .
But he spent $ 3 million through two independent groups to fund mailings and ads in favor of Benjamin .
Benjamin ousted a justice who was seen as more favorable to plaintiffs .

Massey ’s case came before the five - member West Virginia Supreme Court twice .
In the first ruling , the court by a 3 - 2 margin threw out the verdict on the grounds that the lawsuit was brought in the wrong place .
When questions arose about fairness , the court agreed to rehear the matter .
Two justices stepped aside , but Benjamin refused to do so .
When a reconstituted court heard the issue again , the result was another 3 - 2 ruling in favor of Massey , with Benjamin voting in the majority .
Hugh Caperton , whose small company was driven into bankruptcy by Massey , appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court after the West Virginia ruling .
The case of Caperton vs. A.T. Massey Coal split Kennedy ’s colleagues along the usual liberal - conservative lines , with Kennedy joining the liberal bloc .
Justices John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer signed his opinion .

The high court ’s ruling today sent the matter back to the West Virginia court , with the requirement that Benjamin step aside .
The decision does not directly affect federal judges because none of them run for election .

Do you recycle your cell phones ?
It ’s a great practice for insuring that toxic materials in those old phones do n’t make their way into the environment .
But what about the other side of the cell phone lifecycle ?
Do you know where the materials come from ?
It turns out that many of the minerals in that phone have an ugly story behind them , similar to that of blood diamonds .
TakePart.com , a project of Participant Media , produced the PSA above as part of a larger campaign to educate the public about the role “ conflict minerals ” such as tin , tungsten , gold , and tantalum play in funding armed groups fighting in the Eastern Congo .
According to Raise Hope for Congo , a campaign of the Enough Project ,
The conflict in eastern Congo , the deadliest in the world since World War II , is being fueled by a multi-million dollar trade in minerals that go into our electronic products from cell phones to digital cameras .
Over five million people have died as a result of the war , and hundreds of thousands of women have been raped in eastern Congo over the past decade .
The armed groups that are perpetuating the violence generate an estimated $ 144 million each year by trading in [ the above - mentioned ] four main minerals …
[ social_buttons ]
Want to join the effort to keep “ conflict minerals ” out of your electronics ?
Watch the video , check out the Raise Hope for Congo site , and then take the activist pledge ( you can get a link to the pledge by following the instructions at the end of the video ) .
Let cell phone and electronics manufacturers know that you ’d like them to pledge to trace their supply chains of these materials , and conduct independantly - verified audits of those supply chains .
Also let them know you ’ll be keeping an eye on them , and purchasing only from manufacturers who take the pledge .

“ Racists for Democracy ”
HOW LUCKY we are to have the extreme Right standing guard over our democracy .
This week , the Knesset voted by a large majority ( 47 to 34 ) for a law that threatens imprisonment for anyone who dares to deny that Israel is a Jewish and Democratic State .
The private member ’s bill , proposed by MK Zevulun Orlev of the “ Jewish Home ” party , which sailed through its preliminary hearing , promises one year in prison to anyone who publishes “ a call that negates the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and Democratic State ” , if the contents of the call might cause “ actions of hate , contempt or disloyalty against the state or the institutions of government or the courts ” .
One can foresee the next steps .
A million and a half Arab citizens cannot be expected to recognize Israel as a Jewish and Democratic State .
They want it to be “ a state of all its citizens ” – Jews , Arabs and others .
They also claim with reason that Israel discriminates against them , and therefore is not really democratic .
And , in addition , there are also Jews who do not want Israel to be defined as a Jewish State in which non-Jews have the status , at best , of tolerated outsiders .
The consequences are inevitable .
The prisons will not be able to hold all those convicted of this crime .
There will be a need for concentration camps all over the country to house all the deniers of Israeli democracy .
The police will be unable to deal with so many criminals .
It will be necessary to set up a new unit .
This may be called “ Special Security ” , or , in short , SS .
Hopefully , these measures will suffice to preserve our democracy .
If not , more stringent steps will have to be taken , such as revoking the citizenship of the democracy - deniers and deporting them from the country , together with the Jewish leftists and all the other enemies of the Jewish democracy .
After the preliminary reading of the bill , it now goes to the Legal Committee of the Knesset , which will prepare it for the first , and soon thereafter for the second and third readings .
Within a few weeks or months , it will be the law of the land .
By the way , the bill does not single out Arabs explicitly – even if this is its clear intention , and all those who voted for it understood this .
It also prohibits Jews from advocating a change in the state ’s definition , or the creation of a bi-national state in all of historic Palestine or spreading any other such unconventional ideas .
One can only imagine what would happen in the US if a senator proposed a law to imprison anyone who suggests an amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America .
THE BILL does not stand out at all in our new political landscape .
This government has already adopted a bill to imprison for three years anyone who mourns the Palestinian Naqba – the 1948 uprooting of more than half the Palestinian people from their homes and lands .
The sponsors expect Arab citizens to be happy about that event .
True , the Palestinians were caused a certain unpleasantness , but that was only a by - product of the foundation of our state .
The Independence Day of the Jewish and Democratic State must fill us all with joy .
Anyone who does not express this joy should be locked up , and three years may not be enough .
This bill has been confirmed by the Ministerial Commission for Legal Matters , prior to being submitted to the Knesset .
Since the rightist government commands a majority in the Knesset , it will be adopted almost automatically .
( In the meantime , a slight delay has been caused by one minister , who appealed the decision , so the Ministerial Commission will have to confirm it again . )
The sponsors of the law hope , perhaps , that on Naqba Day the Arabs will dance in the streets , plant Israeli flags on the ruins of some 600 Arab villages that were wiped off the map and offer up their thanks to Allah in the mosques for the miraculous good fortune that was bestowed on them .
THIS TAKES me back to the 60s , when the weekly magazine I edited , Haolam Hazeh , published an Arabic edition .
One of its employees was a young man called Rashed Hussein from the village of Musmus .
Already as a youth he was a gifted poet with a promising future .
He told me that some years earlier the military governor of his area had summoned him to his office .
At the time , all the Arabs in Israel were subject to a military government which controlled their lives in all matters big and small .
Without a permit , an Arab citizen could not leave his village or town even for a few hours , nor get a job as a teacher , nor acquire a tractor or dig a well .
The governor received Rashed cordially , offered him coffee and paid lavish compliments to his poetry .
Then he came to the point : in a month ’s time , Independence Day was due , and the governor was going to hold a big reception for the Arab “ notables ” ; he asked Rashed to write a special poem for the occasion .
Rashed was a proud youngster , nationalist to the core , and not lacking in courage .
He explained to the governor that Independence Day was no joyful day for him , since his relatives had been driven from their homes and most of the Musmus village ’s land had also been expropriated .
When Rashed arrived back at his village some hours later , he could not help noticing that his neighbors were looking at him in a peculiar way .
When he entered his home , he was shocked .
All the members of his family were sitting on the floor , the women lamenting at the top of their voices , the children huddling fearfully in a corner .
His first thought was that somebody had died .
“ What have you done to us ! ” one of the women cried , “ What did we do to you ? ” “ You have destroyed the family , ” another shouted , “ You have finished us ! ”
It appeared that the governor had called the family and told them that Rashed had refused to fulfill his duty to the state .
The threat was clear : from now on , the extended family , one of the largest in the village , would be on the black list of the military government .
The consequences were clear to everyone .
Rashed could not stand up against the lamentation of his family .
He gave in and wrote the poem , as requested .
But something inside him was broken .
Some years later he emigrated to the US , got a job there at the PLO office and died tragically : he was burned alive in his bed after going to sleep , it appears , while smoking a cigarette .
THESE DAYS are gone forever .
We took part in many stormy demonstrations against the military government until it was finally abolished in 1966 .
As a newly elected Member of Parliament , I had the privilege of voting for its abolition .
The fearful and subservient Arab minority , then amounting to some 200 thousand souls , has recovered its self - esteem .
A second and third generation has grown up , its downtrodden national pride has raised its head again , and today they are a large and self - confident community of 1.5 million .
But the attitude of the Jewish Right has not changed for the better .
On the contrary .
In the Knesset bakery ( the Hebrew word for bakery is Mafia ) some new pastries are being baked .
One of them is a bill that stipulates that anyone applying for Israeli citizenship must declare their loyalty to “ the Jewish , Zionist and Democratic State ” , and also undertake to serve in the army or its civilian alternative .
Its sponsor is MK David Rotem of the “ Israel is Our Home ” party , who also happens to be the chairman of the Knesset Law Committee .
A declaration of loyalty to the state and its laws – a framework designed to safeguard the wellbeing and the rights of its citizens – is reasonable .
But loyalty to the “ Zionist ” state ?
Zionism is an ideology , and in a democratic state the ideology can change from time to time .
It would be like declaring loyalty to a “ capitalist ” USA , a “ rightist Italy ” , a ” leftist ” Spain , a “ Catholic Poland ” or a “ nationalist ” Russia .
This would not be a problem for the tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews in Israel who reject Zionism , since Jews will not be touched by this law .
They obtain citizenship automatically the moment they arrive in Israel .
Another bill waiting for its turn before the Ministerial Committee proposes changing the declaration that every new Knesset Member has to make before assuming office .
Instead of loyalty “ to the State of Israel and its laws ” , as now , he or she will be required to declare their loyalty “ to the Jewish , Zionist and Democratic State of Israel , its symbols and its values ” .
That would exclude almost automatically all the elected Arabs , since declaring loyalty to the “ Zionist ” state would mean that no Arab would ever vote for them again .
It would also be a problem for the Orthodox members of the Knesset , who cannot declare loyalty to Zionism .
According to Orthodox doctrine , the Zionists are depraved sinners and the Zionist flag is unclean .
God exiled the Jews from this country because of their wickedness , and only God can permit them to return .
Zionism , by preempting the job of the Messiah , has committed an unpardonable sin , and many Orthodox Rabbis chose to remain in Europe and be murdered by the Nazis rather than committing the Zionist sin of going to Palestine .
THE FACTORY of racist laws with a distinct fascist odor is now working at full steam .
That is built into the new coalition .
At its center is the Likud party , a good part of which is pure racist ( sorry for the oxymoron ) .
To its right there is the ultra-racist Shas party , to the right of which is Lieberman ’s ultra-ultra racist “ Israel is our Home ” party , the ultra - ultra - ultra racist “ Jewish Home ” party , and to its right the even more racist “ National Union ” party , which includes outright Kahanists and stands with one foot in the coalition and the other on the moon .
All these factions are trying to outdo each other .
When one proposes a crazy bill , the next is compelled to propose an even crazier one , and so on .
All this is possible because Israel has no constitution .
The ability of the Supreme Court to annul laws that contradict the “ basic laws ” is not anchored anywhere , and the Rightist parties are trying to abolish it .
Not for nothing did Avigdor Lieberman demand – and get – the Justice and Police ministries .
Just now , when the governments of the US and Israel are clearly on a collision course over the settlements , this racist fever may infect all parts of the coalition .
If one goes to sleep with a dog , one should not be surprised to wake up with fleas ( may the dogs among my readers pardon me ) .
Those who elected such a government , and even more so those who joined it , should not be surprised by its laws , which ostensibly safeguard Jewish democracy .
The most appropriate name for these holy warriors would be “ Racists for Democracy ” .
The giant monoliths of Easter Island are worn , but they have endured for centuries .
New research suggests that a compound first discovered in the soil of the South Pacific island might help us stand the test of time , too .
On July 8 , in the journal Nature , The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and two collaborating centers reported that the Easter Island compound – called " rapamycin " after the island 's Polynesian name , Rapa Nui – extended the expected lifespan of middle - aged mice by 28 percent to 38 percent .
In human terms , this would be greater than the predicted increase in extra years of life if cancer and heart disease were both cured and prevented .
The rapamycin was given to the mice at an age equivalent to 60 years old in humans .
The studies are part of the National Institute on Aging ( NIA ) Interventions Testing Program , which seeks compounds that might help people remain active and disease - free throughout their lives .
The other two centers involved are the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Maine .
The Texas study was led by scientists at two institutes at the UT Health Science Center : the Institute of Biotechnology ( IBT ) and the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies .
" I 've been in aging research for 35 years and there have been many so - called ' anti- aging ' interventions over those years that were never successful , " said Arlan G. Richardson , Ph.D. , director of the Barshop Institute .
" I never thought we would find an anti-aging pill for people in my lifetime ; however , rapamycin shows a great deal of promise to do just that . "
Versatile compound

Discovered in the 1970s , rapamycin was first noted for its anti-fungal properties and later was used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients .
It also is used in stents , which are implanted in patients during angioplasty to keep coronary arteries open .
It is in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer .
The new aging experiments found that adding rapamycin to the diet of older mice increased their lifespan .
The results were the same in Texas , Michigan and Maine .
" We believe this is the first convincing evidence that the aging process can be slowed and lifespan can be extended by a drug therapy starting at an advanced age , " said Randy Strong , Ph.D. , who directs the NIA - funded Aging Interventions Testing Center in San Antonio .
He is a professor of pharmacology at the UT Health Science Center and a senior research career scientist with the South Texas Veterans Health Care System .
The findings have " interesting implications for our understanding of the aging process , " said Z. Dave Sharp , Ph.D. , director of the Institute of Biotechnology and professor and chairman of the Health Science Center 's Department of Molecular Medicine .
" In addition , " Dr. Sharp said , " the findings have immediate implications for preventive medicine and human health , in that rapamycin is already in clinical usage . "
Molecular pathway
advertisement
Aging researchers currently acknowledge only two life - extending interventions in mammals : calorie restriction and genetic manipulation .
Rapamycin appears to partially shut down the same molecular pathway as restricting food intake or reducing growth factors .
It does so through a cellular protein called mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) , which controls many processes in cell metabolism and responses to stress .
A decade ago , Dr. Sharp proposed to his colleagues that mTOR might be involved in calorie restriction .
" It seemed like an off - the - wall idea at that time , " Dr. Richardson said .
In 2004 , a year after the launch of the NIA Interventions Testing Program , Dr. Sharp submitted a proposal that rapamycin be studied for anti-aging effects .
The proposal was approved , and testing centers in San Antonio and elsewhere began to include rapamycin in the diets of mice .
The male and female mice were cross - bred from four different strains of mice to more closely mimic the genetic diversity and disease susceptibility of the human population .
Dr. Strong soon recognized a problem : Rapamycin was not stable enough in food or in the digestive tract to register in the animals ' blood level .
He worked with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio to improve the bioavailability of the compound through a process called microencapsulation .
The reformulated drug was stable in the diet fed to the mice and bypassed the stomach to release in the intestine , where it could more reliably enter the bloodstream .
Older mice
The original goal was to begin feeding the mice at 4 months of age , but because of the delay caused by developing the new formulation , the mice were not started until they were 20 months old – the equivalent of 60 years of age in humans .
The teams decided to try the rapamycin intervention anyway .
" I did not think that it would work because the mice were too old when the treatment was started , " Dr. Richardson said .
" Most reports indicate that calorie restriction does n't work when implemented in old animals .
The fact that rapamycin increases lifespan in relatively old mice was totally unexpected . "
Added Dr. Strong : " This study has clearly identified a potential therapeutic target for the development of drugs aimed at preventing age - related diseases and extending healthy lifespan .
If rapamycin , or drugs like rapamycin , works as envisioned , the potential reduction in overall health cost for the U.S. and the world will be enormous . "
Leaders of the other interventions testing centers are Richard Miller , M.D. , Ph.D. , of the University of Michigan and David Harrison , Ph.D. , at the Jackson Laboratories .
I will admit before reading “ The New Answer Book ” by Ken Ham I was really dead set against believing dinosaurs exsisted … I had all these thoughts like …
How could they fit on the ark ?
How on earth would these big mean creatures live with humans ?
They ca n’t be millions of years old b/c man and animal were created on the same day , the sixth day ?
How could anyone know what dinosaurs look like from finding the bones … that would be like us never knowing what a cat was and finding these bones one day and drawing it just from seeing its bones to be like a cat with fuzzy ears , wet nose , fluffy fur you could n’t possibly fathom what it looks like without ever seeing it , so it is just a guessing game .
So I was dead set against it and I knew that behemoth was in the Bible but I thought yeah hippo or mammoth or elephant !
But thanks to reading this book by Ken Ham he answers every one of my questions above so that ’s why I posted the whole section he wrote on “ What Really Happened to the Dinosaurs . ”
No joke EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY QUESTIONS ABOVE WAS ANSWERED !!!
I am no longer so skeptical about the possibilities of there being dinosaurs b/c I was picturing these Jurassic Park movie type things and I could n’t believe that those would exist so Ken Ham did an excellent job in making sense of Dinosaurs so that is why I chose to name the following 15 posts “ Making Sense of Dinosaurs ” b/c that ’s exactly what Ken Ham did !
I am not responsible for the content in the “ Making Sense of Dinosaurs : PART I - XV ” I simply copied and pasted from the web @ http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/what-happened-to-the-dinosaurs
and from there I found the Bible verses he referred to and wrote them in to make it easier for you to read without stopping .
I really hope you find the answers you may be seeking as to Dinosaurs and this helped me so please read if you are interested it may help you !

Introduction
To assess the type and amount of tissue missing from the adult circumcised penis .
The gross and histological features of the prepuces of 22 adults obtained at autopsy were assessed , primarily focusing on the inner or mucosal surface of the prepuce .
Skin and mucosa sufficient to cover the penile shaft was frequently missing from the circumcised penis .
Missing tissue included a band of ridged mucosa located at the junction of true penile skin with smooth preputial mucosa .
This ridged band contains more Meissner 's corpuscles than does the smooth mucosa and exhibits features of specialized sensory mucosa .
The amount of tissue loss estimated in the present study is more than most parents envisage from pre-operative counselling .
Circumcision also ablates junctional mucosa that appears to be an important component of the overall sensory mechanism of the human penis .
Prepuce , ridged band , Meissner 's corpuscle , specialized mucosa , circumcision .
The prepuce is usually dismissed as skin [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] or , less often , it is seen as a simple fold of skin and mucosa [ 3 ] .
At best , the prepuce is thought to protect the glans penis ; at worst it is a health hazard that may be avoided by circumcision [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Not surprisingly , articles and editorials on the advantages and disadvantages of circumcision consistently fail to discuss the prepuce as a tissue worthy of preservation in its own right .
` Circumcision removes only a few millimeters of skin ' is , in our experience , common and comforting counsel but has been neither proved nor disproved for North America or other countries where circumcision remains largely a cosmetic procedure .
Material and methods
The prepuces of 22 adults ( mean age 37 years , range 22 - 58 ) were studied grossly and histologically at autopsy .
Ten prepuces extended to or beyond the tip of the glans and 12 prepuces failed to reach the tip of the glans .
The material was unselected except for the age of the subjects ( 20 - 60 years ) and for preputial length ( `long ' and `short ' ) .
The outer surface of the prepuce was measured from its tip to the sulcus of the glans ; the skin of the penile shaft extended from the sulcus to the abdominal wall .
The inner surface of the prepuce ( `mucosa ' ) was measured with the prepuce retracted but not stretched .
The expected preputial tissue loss to circumcision ( preputial skin plus mucosa ) was reduced by 3 cm to allow for a residual mucosal cuff ( the estimated cuff at autopsy was 2 - 4 cm ) .
Ellipses of mucosa and submucosa ( 15 x 5 mm ) were excised from four sites ; the mucocutaneous junction , to include a cross-section of the `ridged band ' ( see below ) ; the `smooth mucosa ' ; the corona of the glans penis ; and the frenu lum of the prepuce .
Mucosae were fixed in buffered 5 % formol - saline , divided lengthwise into two blocks and embedded in paraffin wax .
Subserial sections , 3 - 5 from each block , were stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) .
Meissner 's corpuscles of the genitalia resemble those of finger - print skin and are identified in H&E - stained sections as compact , pear - shaped or elongated , lamellated and encapsulated end - organs attached to the basal lamina of the mucous membrane , or located high in the mucosal papillae of preputial mucosa [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Similar and additional end - organs of `ridged ' and `smooth ' mucosae were stained using the avidin - biotin - complex peroxidase technique using an antibody ( Biomeda Corp , Foster City , CA , USA ) against S100 protein [ 9 ] present in neurites and Schwann cells .
Sections from each mucosal area were assessed semi-quantitatively for neural end - organs .
Superficial blood vessels of the `ridged band ' were filled with a silicone rubber mass placed in the superficial external pudendal artery , followed by dehydration and clearing of the mucosa samples through graded alcohol and methyl salicylate .
Results
Normal prepuce
The mean length of prepuce in this sample was 6.4 cm ( range 4.8 - 9.2 ) and covered 93 % of the mean penile shaft ( 6.9 cm ) .
Ten prepuces were as long as or longer than the shaft of the penis to which they belonged ; three of them were > 10 % longer than the shaft and glans combined .
Circumcision of these subjects , allowing for a 3 cm mucosal cuff , would have removed a mean of 3.4 cm ( range 1.8 - 6.2 ) of ( strictly ) preputial skin and mucosa , or 51 % of the length of the mean adult penile shaft , or more from nearly half the penises .
Unknown amounts of true skin were missing from the shaft of the circumcised adult penis .
Therefore , four circumcised babies , 1 - 3 years of age , who had died for reasons unrelated to circumcision , were also reviewed .
In each case , the cut edge of the skin of the penile shaft stopped 1 - 2 cm short of the glanular sulcus , an estimated shortfall in shaft skin of 20 - 25 % .
The mucosa between the cut - skin edge and corona of glans was stretched and flattened and contrasted sharply with the lax mucosa normally seen at this location ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ) .

Dotted line indicates tip of retracted prepuce .
Ridged and smooth mucosal surfaces
When retracted , the inner surface of the prepuce displays two zones , `ridged ' and `smooth ' ( Fig. 3 ) .
The first , a transversely - ridged band of mucosa 10 - 15 mm wide , lies against the true skin edge , forming the outer surface of the tip of the prepuce .
In the dorsal midline .
the `ridged band ' lies above the level of the adjacent `smooth ' mucosa and merges smoothly , on either side , with the frenulum of the prepuce .
When magnified , the ridged mucosa has a pebbled or coral - like appearance .
Unretracted , the adult `ridged band ' usually lies flat against the glans ; retracted , the `ridged band ' is everted on the shaft of the penis .
The remainder of the preputial lining between the `ridged band ' and the glans is smooth and lax .
There is considerable variation in the degree of ridging : older subjects showed less and younger subjects more marked ridging .
Some ridging was seen in all the prepuces examined ( Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 ) .
The intense vascularity of the `ridged band ' was best seen in transilluminated mucosa ( Fig. 7 ) .

The `ridged band ' and glans , like the patient 's lips , were intensely cyanosed .
Mucosal histology
The inner surface of the prepuce is lined by variably - keratinized squamous epithelium similar to frictional of the mouth , vagina and oesophagus .
The epithelium is papillated by stromal or `corial ' tissue and is rich in nerves , Schwann cells , lymphoid cells and capillaries .
Papillae are continuous with a highly vascular , loose - knit tissue layer that resembles the corium of oral mucosa .
Preputial mucosa also lacks the dense collagenous zone seen in most areas of true ( skin ) dermis and , again unlike true skin of the penile shaft and outer surface of the prepuce , the mucosal surface of the prepuce is completely free of lanugo hair follicles , sweat and sebaceous glands .
Smooth muscle bundles are common to both shaft skin and preputial mucosa .
Histological cross-sections of the `ridged band ' showed focal , spiky or more rounded , broader and flatter ridges interspersed with sulci .
Meissner 's corpuscles were more plentiful in some subjects than in others but perhaps significantly , they were only seen in the crests of ridges , occasionally in small clumps that expanded the tips of corial papillae ( Fig. 8 ) .
End-organs were not seen in sulci between ridges in this material .
S100 staining ( Fig. 9 ) showed additional end - organs and myelinated nerve fibres within papillae and confirmed the richly innervated nature of the `ridged band ' .
The distribution of Meissner 's corpuscles in the mucosal ridges was best seen in tangential sections through the epithelium and tips of corial papillae of some but not all specimens .
Sections of `smooth mucosa ' showed no ridging of the mucosal surface , slightly shallower corial papillae and few Meissner 's corpuscles .
Meissner 's corpuscles were seen in the frenulum and glans but no at tempt was made to compare smooth with deeply ridged mucosae .
Histologically , no clear demarcation line can be drawn between true skin of the penile shaft and the `ridged band ' at the precise tip of the prepuce .

Discussion
Teaching on the anatomy of the prepuce has undergone little change since that of Niccolo Massa , Alessandro Benedetti and other masters of the 15th century .
` The skin covering the penis is remarkable for its thinness , its dark colour , and its looseness of connexion with the fascial sheath of the organ .
At the neck of the penis , it is folded upon itself to form the prepuce or foreskin , which covers the glans for a variable distance ' [ 10 ] .
The current tendency to eliminate the prepuce from anatomy textbooks [ 1 ] reflects the popular emphasis on the glans ; perhaps the wrinkling and pleating of the retracted prepuce , like unwanted hair , is an affront to good taste or simply superfluous to requirements .
The present findings support the view that the lining of the prepuce is identical to and a prolongation of the common squamous mucosa of the glans and the balano - preputial sulcus [ 11 ] .
The `ridged band ' may be key to the persistent mislabelling of the inner lining of the prepuce as `skin ' ; it is clearly visible on inspection of the retracted prepuce , it is continuous with the wrinkled true skin of the tip of the prepuce , and it looks like skin .
Histology aside , the `wrinkles ' of the ridged band are regularly transverse and are difficult to efface by gentle stretching .
A vascular blush is usually present .
The vascular ridges of the `ridged band ' and its Meissner 's corpuscles firmly separate preputial epithelium from true skin and place preputial mucosa amongst other mucocutaneous mucosae .
Winkelmann [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] emphasized the structural and functional importance of junctional regions of the body and focused on mucocutaneous end - organs , or `genital corpuscles ' , of the glans penis and prepuce .
Some of these end - organs resemble Krause end - bulbs ; others resemble Meissner 's corpuscles .
Meissner 's corpuscles of the prepuce may be compared with similar nerve - endings in the finger - tips and lips , which respond in a fraction of a second to contact with light objects that bring about deformation of their capsules [ 14 ] .
However , complex sensation , at least in the glans penis , may be mediated by free nerve - endings rather than by specialized end - organs [ 15 ] .
The mode of transmission of stimuli from the prepuce and glans penis has not been completely elucidated .
The present findings suggest that a part of the prepuce differs in several ways from the rest of the prepuce ; no attempt was made to quantify the specialized nerve endings of the `ridged band ' because they should be seen in the context of their function and location in the crests of ridges .
The present study examined the area as a whole rather than analysing it point by point .
Clearly , the penis is a complex organ with many different parts , each specialized for a specific role .
The prepuce provides a large and important platform for several nerves and nerve endings .
The innervation of the outer skin of the prepuce is impressive [ 16 ] ; its sensitivity to light touch and pain are similar to that of the skin of the penis as a whole .
The glans , by contrast , is insensitive to light touch , heat , cold [ 17 ] and , as far as the authors are aware , to pin-prick .
Le Gros Clark [ 18 ] noted that the glans penis is one of the few areas on the body that enjoys nothing beyond primitive sensory modalities .
Here , the overall anatomy of the prepuce is partly repeated , to provide a framework for the `ridged band ' of mucosa and ancillary structures ; one of these , the Dartos fascia , keeps the delicate mucosal surface of the prepuce pressed flat against the glans [ 19 ] .
Whether this flattening , or closure , is important depends on the functions of glans and prepuce .
We postulate that the `ridged band ' with its unique structure , tactile corpuscles and other nerves , is primarily sensory tissue and that it cooperates with other components of the prepuce .
In this model , the `smooth ' mucosa and true skin of the adult prepuce act together to allow the `ridged band ' to move from a forward to a ` deployed ' position on the shaft of the penis .
In short , the prepuce should be considered a structural and functional unit made up of more and less specialized parts .
It is generally thought that the prepuce protects the glans .
However , it is equally likely that the glans shapes and protects the prepuce .
In return , the glans and penile shaft gain excellent if surrogate sensitivity from the prepuce .
Possibly , the `ridged band ' helps mediate the afferent limb of the ejaculatory reflex .
Another use has to be found for the infantile prepuce , which contains muscle bundles , blood vessels and nerves in profusion ; its internal organization is poorly understood but a case can be made for sensory tissue with the rigidity and form associated with specific function .

In this previous post I disassembled the Coby DP - 151SX digital picture frame .
This device is very hackable , and includes a lot of goodies such as a Li-Ion battery and battery charger circuit as well as a neat little color LCD display with a white LED backlight .
The pinout for the LCD is in the previous post .
The MAXQ2000 microcontroller development board I have uses a 0.1 ″ spacing header to connect to the I/O pins , so I made a little adapter and wired it up to the LCD connector using wire - wrap wire .
It uses 13 I/O lines , but that could be reduced 11 if CS # is wired to ground and RST # tied to a separate reset IC ( such as a MAX811 ) .
It ’s actually a good idea to use CS# , because you can then multiplex the functionality of all the other pins and recover that I/O .
Here is a picture showing the LCD up and running with a simple test pattern :
It ’s not 128×128 , but actually 132×132 pixels .
The color depth is 16 - bit using a fairly standard 5 - 6 - 5 bit encoding .
See the PCF8833 datasheet for more details .
Spark Fun has a similar LCD display which uses the same controller , only it costs $ 20 .
Amazon.com sells the Coby - 151SX in black for $ 10 .
Not a bad deal : for $ 10 less you get a Li-Ion battery , mini-USB cable , and a driver CD , which you could use as a coaster for your Mountain Dew to help with the LCD programming .
Spark Fun has some sample code which you should easily be able to adapt for parallel mode ( since the Coby LCD connector brings out the parallel data lines , unlike the Spark Fun LCD ) .
The source code for my test program will get posted once I clean it up and possibly add functionality ( Character fonts ?
Bit blitters ? )
The following list compiles ten of the best documentary films relating to the United States , released in the last 25 years .
The documentaries here are shown in no particular order .
Be sure to add your own favorites to the comments .
10 The Civil War Directed by Ken Burns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1QRXtEBiYI
This 9 episode epic chronicles the U.S. Civil War which took place from 1861 - 1865 .
Extremely well crafted , it includes an original theme ‘ Ashokan Farewell ’ that will haunt you long after the final chapter .
It includes narration by some of the finest actors and academics of the last half century including Sam Waterston , Arthur Miller , and Shelby Foote .
This documentary also featured on our previous list : Top 10 Greatest TV Documentary Series .
9 The Trials of Darryl Hunt Directed by Annie Sundberg
Darryl Hunt is a man from Winston - Salem , N.C. who was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of a young white woman in 1984 .
A shocking indictment of the criminal justice system in the U.S. , the film shows how a lack of physical evidence , faulty eyewitness testimony , and racism can overcome the search for actual truth .
Did I mention he was falsely convicted … twice !
8 Sicko Directed by Michael Moore
Yes , it is more propaganda by possibly the most polarizing fimmaker since Leni Riefenstahl , but Sicko hits all the right notes .
Focusing on the state of the U.S. healthcare system , the film interviews former insurance claim agents , victims of insurance company negligence , and foreign healthcare workers .
In the most inspired moment Mr. Moore takes uninsured Americans to Guantanamo Bay where they are refused entry , then to Cuba where they are helped free of charge .
7 Lake of Fire Directed by Tony Kaye
Tony Kaye ’s first film since the unrelenting American History X , Lake of Fire is a 2 1/2 hour pontification on the abortion issue in America .
Interviewees include noted anarchist Noam Chomsky and lawyer Alan Dershowitz .
Extremely unsettling in its portrayal of the two sides of this issue , it leads one to believe that there is no middle ground .
6 Paradise Lost Directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4xk4dFbv0
Full titled : “ Paradise Lost ( The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills ) ” , Paradise Lost recounts the trials of 3 teenage boys for multiple counts of murder in Arkansas .
In hoping that my less is more approach will encourage readers to watch these films , I will keep spoilers minimal as there are many twists and turns .
But let it be said , a bloody knife as a gift is not normal , even in Arkansas ( kidding ) .
5 No End in Sight Directed by Charles Ferguson
Virtually the antithesis to the other noted Iraqi war documentary Farenheit 911 , No End in Sight takes a more evenhanded approach at American involvement in Iraq .
Legitimacy is added by the fact that many of the interviewees are former George Bush Jr. staff members who reveal the crucial initial mistakes that they and others had made .
This caused what many thought would be a quick and clean military exercise into an eight years and counting war .
Heartbreaking in its candor .
4 The Staircase Directed by Jean - Xavier de Lestrade
The Staircase is an eight part documentary series that began filming initially with the indictment of its protagonist Michael Peterson .
He was an author living in North Carolina when his wife died of injuries related to a fall down a flight of stairs at the home .
Honestly , not even the best scriptwriter could come up with the revelations that followed in the police investigation and eventual trial .
If you like true crime dramas watch this film .
3 Indian Point Directed by Rory Kennedy
“ Indian Point : Imagining the Unimaginable ” is a nuclear power plant that has drawn quite a bit of attention since the 9/11 attacks due to its lack of security .
There is not a ‘ no - fly zone ’ required for the air space above it , safety violations have been common , and the security officers are undertrained .
At least it is not within spitting distance of one of the biggest cities in the world , right ?
Well , no .
It is located just 35 miles from New York City .
Fascinating .
This documentary was made by Rory Kennedy ( pictured above ) , youngest daughter of Bobby Kennedy .
2 Capturing the Friedmans Directed by Andrew Jarecki
Capturing the Friedmans is proof positive that truth is stranger than fiction .
Simply stated , it tells the story of Great Neck , New York family man Arnold Friedman who taught computer classes in his basement to local children .
After child pornography is delivered to his house during an FBI sting , he is indicted for mulitple counts of child sexual abuse .
Along with The Staircase , this film causes the rug to be pulled out from beneath the viewer the most , truly amazing .
One fact to note is that the director had initially planned to make a film about the relatively normal brother to Jesse and son of Arnold , David Friedman who is a clown for hire in New York City .
1 The War Directed by Ken Burns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVQXJQREXZg
A true master of his craft , Ken Burns The War was his latest directorial effort .
It chronicled World War II and premiered on PBS in the U.S. in 2007 .
Due to the enormous scope of the war , its causes , and the aftermath , the director decided to focus on segments of troops from 4 American cities and followed them to the conclusion of the war through all three major theaters .
The all - star cast of narrators includes Tom Hanks , Adam Arkin , Ernie Hudson , and Keith David .
On the one hand it 's the ultimate in " de- development . "
But on the other it's a testament to Gazan ingenuity which has somehow been undimmed by three bloody weeks of war and two years of total economic blockade .
Certainly there is no prouder home - owner in southern Gaza than Jihad al Shaer , as he sits on his palm - lined verandah looking out on his desert garden , its path neatly fenced with half buried tyres , and already blooming with water melon , tomatoes and aubergines .
But it 's the three - room family house itself which he completed within weeks of the end of Israel 's Operation Cast Lead in January that is the source of his pride .
It 's built almost entirely with mud .
Mr Al Shaer , 36 , first became interested in the multi-millennium - old technique of building mud houses when he visited Bangladesh during a religious trip in the 1990s .
" This was what our ancestors did before us , " he says .
" But I never thought I would be doing it myself . "
Last year , when his parental home , in a town whose chronic housing shortage is compounded by the relentless demolitions along the border with Egypt during nine years of conflict , became too overcrowded , he realised he needed somewhere else to live .
Money was in short supply and cement , which Israel has not allowed into Gaza since Hamas seized full control by force in June 2007 , unaffordable .
But thanks to the multiplication of smuggling tunnels under the border , mud was abundant .
It was also free apart from the £ 32 a truckload it cost to transport it to his 300 square metres of land on what was , until 2005 , the Israeli settlement of Morag .
Using a shoe box to mould mud , sand and water bricks strengthened with corn husk straw , leaving them to dry for three days , and making a timber roof frame , allowed him to install his wife , his four daughters and infant son in a new house for around $ 3,000 ( £ 1,877 ) compared with the $ 25,000 for conventional construction .
Pausing only for the three weeks of war , when bombing made it too dangerous to make the four - kilometre journey from his home , he completed the job in just two months .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Al Shaer is delighted with his low - energy methods .
" This is natural , not man-made , " he says .
" God has created this mud so people can live .
There is no technology .
This will be an alternative way for people to survive " .
But his financial incentive to go green also tells you something about how the siege of Gaza has been more effective in hurting the legitimate economy than Hamas , widely believed to be taking a cut from the tunnel economy .
Mr Al Shaer was , and on paper still is , a driver with a once flourishing local motor oil distributor which imported its lubricants from South Korea until the blockade meant the workers had to be laid off .
Some $ 500,000 dollars of the company 's oil is stuck at the Israeli port of Ashdod while inferior but usable oil continues –despite three weeks of intensive Israeli bombing of the tunnels – to flow under the border .
Mr Al Shaer suggests , without apportioning specific blame , there are business " interests " in Gaza still doing well out of the tunnel - economy .
" If I own three tunnels , " he says , " I wo n't want the crossings to open . "
But he is is no doubt who is to blame for the blockade of all but basic humanitarian supplies .
" Israel is always looking for an excuse not to allow anything to come here , " he says .
" They want us to worry about day - to - day life and not think about our political rights . "
Experts from the Hamas de facto government have been to Mr Al Shaer 's house to see whether it could be a model for the huge task of post - war reconstruction .
That task – of which rebuilding the 4,000 multiple - occupied homes totally destroyed by Israel 's military operation is only a part – has yet to begin because of the Israeli - imposed blockade on all building materials , even glass .
But it may not be as easy as that .
With a wife and seven children living in three storerooms , Mr Al Shaer 's friend Nidal Eid is desperate to complete his own mud house , but he cannot afford increasingly scarce timber for the roof frame , which has now shot up from £ 192 last year to around £ 960 .
Mr Eid was inspired to follow Mr Al Shaer 's example because he lived for 20 years in his parents ' mud home in the coastal Sinai town of El Arish .
Even though he had to skimp on straw because that has gone up to £ 4.80 a sack , he is convinced it will be sturdy enough to withstand rain and war .
After all , he says " an F16 can destroy a house made of stone . "
For the blockade which has stopped his wood , " I have to blame the occupation [ Israel ] "
But he adds : " And the Gaza government , because they are not making an agreement with the other factions .
If there was a unity government , there would be no siege . "
Mr Eid says that he is now thinking of leaving Gaza if it becomes possible .
" I want co-operation with Israel but Israel wo n't accept that , " he says .
" We just want to live like other people in the rest of the world . "
Mr al Shaer , agrees , arguing that his mud house is a symbol .
" This shows we can live in a simple way , " he says .
" We are Palestinians , not terrorists or beggars .
We do n't need outside support , just open borders . "
Although President Obama‘s $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus is still working its way through the pipeiline , Berkeley economist — and former Clinton Treasury official — Brad DeLong makes the case for another round .
In a draft of a letter he says he may send Obama next week , he said :
“ At the end of 2008 , when your incoming administration was preparing your recession - fighting strategy , your forecasts were that the recession would bottom out in August of 2009 , with a peak unemployment rate of 7.9 % .
The unemployment rate in May was already 9.4 % .
10 % unemployment this year is a nearly foregone conclusion .
11 % unemployment — a recession twice as deep as the one your incoming administration was forecasting at the end of 2008 — is not unlikely ….
Even had the fiscal expansion plans of your administration not been cut back by roughly a quarter in their employment - generating effectiveness by the Congress , fiscal stimulus plans that appeared to be adequate and appropriate at the turn of the year now appear to be inadequate .
Compounding the problem of inadequate fiscal expansion at the federal level is the problem of inappropriate and substantial fiscal contraction at the state level . ”
DeLong ’s proposal :
* Seek from the Congress for authority to guarantee the debt of states that , in response to the current recession , ( a ) seek to conduct their own state - level fiscal expansions , and ( b ) devise plans and strategies for the long - term repayment of the debt the federal government guarantees that the Secretary of the Treasury certifies as prudent and sustainable .
* Seek an additional $ 500 billion of federal aid to states for the federal fiscal year that begiins Oct. 1 , 2001 , to be distributed per capita and conditioned on their maintaining effort at the provision of public services — on their not repeating the mistake of Herbert Hoover of cutting government employment and spending in a downturn .
DeLong , of course , works for the state university system in California , where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state legislature are struggling with a colossal budget deficit .
In response to this post , Brad DeLong wrote :
Truth to tell , the possibility that an additional round of fiscal expansion targeted at aid to the states might trickle down and help pay for my forthcoming master bathroom renovation literally never crossed my mind over the past week …
What did cross my mind was ( a ) memories of Paul Krugan last fall warning about this , ( b ) running the numbers on the deterioration of the forecast over the past six months , ( c ) Peter Schrag ’s recountings of Sacramento politics over lunch , and Gene Smolensky ’s and John Ellwood ’s repeated pointings - out that California is only the worst case as far as fiscal contraction by state governments are concerned , and ( d ) my eighteen - year - old Michael ’s summer job , which involves going to California budget conference committee hearings and taking notes …

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is moving ground - to - air missile defenses to Hawaii as tensions escalate between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea 's recent moves to restart its nuclear - weapon program and resume test - firing long - range missiles .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Thursday that the U.S. is concerned that Pyongyang might soon fire a missile toward Hawaii .
Some senior U.S. officials expect a North Korean test by midsummer , even though most do n't believe the missile would be capable of crossing the Pacific and ...
As the unemployment rate increases , and Wall Street goes back to it ’s traditional bonus model , this is not going to be well received .
Bush is long gone , so the public is naturally going to look at Obama ’s team who is negotiating with AIG on the issue .
At times like this it ’s hard to imagine how average Americans can accept “ retention bonuses ” for one of the most incompetent businesses in the country that represents everything that went wrong during the crisis .
The AIG team may very well leave if they do n’t receive their bonuses , though good luck finding new employment in this environment .
When does everyone else get their retention bonus ?
AIG has been talking with Washington ’s newly - appointed compensation czar Kenneth Feinberg about the bonuses , which are due to be paid on July 15 , said the source .
The company is reviewing its compensation plans with Washington as it tries to avoid the national furor set off by $ 165 million in retention bonuses paid to employees of a financial products unit in March .
Much of AIG ’s $ 99 billion in losses last year stemmed from derivatives written by that unit .
Feinberg was appointed last month to oversee the compensation of top executives at seven firms that have received large federal bailouts .
And to think we have a long way to go before this crisis is over .
How many more bonuses are coming from this black hole ?
Gay figures pull out of Biden fundraiser
Two prominent gay figures , activist David Mixner and widely read blogger Andy Towle , have pulled out of a Democratic National Committee fundraiser later this month amid growing calls to confront the administration at what was supposed to be its first large scale opportunity to bring in gay cash .
" I will not attend a fundraiser for the National Democratic Party in Washington next week when the current administration is responsible for these kind of actions , " Mixner wrote of a motion to dismiss a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act that drew a parallel between same - sex marriage to incestuous marriage .
" How will they ever take us seriously if we keep forking out money while they harm us .
For now on , my money is going to battles within the community such as the fight in Maine or the March on Washington !
I am so tired of being told by Democratic operatives to ' suck it up ' because so many other profound issues are at stake , " Mixner wrote .
" I 've had concerns about the lack of movement from the administration on LGBT issues for some time now but I was n't comfortable attending after that DOMA brief came out , " Towle , who writes the widely read Towle Road blog , said in an e-mail .
Prominent gay and lesbian bloggers are also pushing guests at the $ 1,000 - a- plate dinner to turn up the heat on its hosts , out Reps .
Barney Frank , Jared Polis , and Tammy Baldwin .
" Please politely contact our out LGBT representatives on the Hill to ask them why they still plan to hold the event in the wake of lack of leadership re : DADT repeal and the horrible DOMA brief and 2 ) do they see anything problematic about financially supporting a party that runs for cover when our issues come up on the Hill , " wrote Pam Spaulding .
Americablog 's John Aravosis writes :
Please call Barney , Tammy and Jared and politely ask them WTF ?
It 's been 5 days and none of them have said anything about this travesty , let alone why they 're hosting the inopportune fundraiser - literally asking you to give Obama and the Democrats your good money after they 've abandoned us - no - knifed us .
It 's clear to me that the White House asked them not to say anything , perhaps promising something in return .
And before anyone just assumes that Obama privately promised them to move forward on gay rights , the president could have just as easily promised them a new highway in their state or to do a fundraiser for their re-election , provided they shut up .
Their silence is looking very bad .
The escalating tension sets the stage for an unusual conflict between the vice president and what has traditionally been a core Democratic group — and a wealthy one — at the posh Mandarin Oriental on June 25 .
Now I do this :

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans strongly support fundamental changes to the healthcare system and a move to create a government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll published on Saturday .

The poll came amid mounting opposition to plans by the Obama administration and its allies in the Democratic - controlled Congress to push through the most sweeping restructuring of the U.S. healthcare system since the end of World War Two .
Republicans and some centrist Democrats oppose increasing the government ’s role in healthcare -- it already runs the Medicare and Medicaid systems for the elderly and indigent -- fearing it would require vast public funds and reduce the quality of care .
But the Times / CBS poll found 85 percent of respondents wanted major healthcare reforms and most would be willing to pay higher taxes to ensure everyone had health insurance .
An estimated 46 million Americans currently have no coverage .
Seventy - two percent of those questioned said they backed a government - administered insurance plan similar to Medicare for those under 65 that would compete for customers with the private sector .
Twenty percent said they were opposed .
President Barack Obama and many Democrats in Congress have argued a publicly run healthcare insurance plan would increase competition and drive down the high cost of care at a time when the U.S. economy is mired in a deep recession .
Republicans argue a public plan would drive insurers out of business and lead to a government - run healthcare system .
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives suggested this week that all Americans should be able to get insurance regardless of medical history and that coverage should be mandatory for individuals and businesses .
The proposal , contained in the latest House draft of the healthcare bill , would create new insurance exchanges where people shop around for health coverage .
Whether a government - run plan has a role in such an exchange has spurred serious political debate .
Republicans , the minority party in Congress , have proposed more modest healthcare changes , but lack the votes in the House or Senate to push them through or derail the Democrats ’ health reform drive .
They have warned about the expected high cost of restructuring the healthcare system , projected at more than $ 1.5 trillion -- a huge expense for a nation carrying record budget deficits .
The Republicans also hope to gain traction by playing on fears a vast expansion of government could further hurt the economy and reduce the quality of medical care .
The poll found that people were uneasy about heightened government involvement in the healthcare sector , with 77 percent saying they were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of their own care .
A total of 895 adults participated in the telephone survey , which was conducted from June 12 to 16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
A couple of weeks ago , some of my kinmates and I were preparing a run through Great Barrow .
We had a group of five that could handle completing the instance , but I tossed out an advertisement in LFF anyway for the last spot because I know there is always someone that wants to complete the quests and cannot find a group .
I quickly get a whisper from a Minstrel asking if she could join us .
I replied in the affirmative and shortly thereafter we are all having a relaxed and grand old time with the Wights .
About halfway through the instance , our new friend says that she is sorry but will have to go AFK because the “ doctor has come to my room ” .
She puts me on follow and we continue , but of course the rest of us are wondering what circumstances brings someone to playing LOTRO while a hospital patient .
She returns after a short while , apologizing profusely for the inconvenience .
We tell her “ No Worries ! ” and continue .
After the run , one of our group members ( and our kin leader ) continues a private conversation with her and learns that she is 20 years old , her mother died when she was young , her father is not involved in her life , she has no other close friends or family , and is a hospice patient with Stage 4 bone cancer .
Her doctor tells her that she has maybe two months left .
Our kin leader communicated this information to us , and being a kind hearted sort , speaks to her again the next day and invites her to join our kin .
She accepts and brings her hunter , Gynnie , into our family .
We all try to be as friendly and upbeat as we can whenever she logs on , hoping to bring a little sunshine into an otherwise gloomy world .
Gynnie and our kin leader strike up a fast friendship and he spends some time chatting with her each day , mostly to let her share her pains with someone .
Also , one of our kin officers that had a house next to the kin house gave it to Gynnie since he was planning to upgrade to a deluxe house anyway .
She was very excited to be a part of the kin and a resident of our neighborhood 🙂
Now , let me confess something right now .
Although I am not proud of the fact , I am quite often cynical of new people , particularly those with hard - luck stories .
Surely , someone would n’t lie about something as grave as this .
However , it is not beyond the realm of possibility that an attention starved teen drama queen could play a game like this thinking that no one will get hurt because it all takes place in the imaginary digital world .
For the time being I would take her story at face value , but I would watch carefully for inconsistencies / inaccuracies in her story .
I REALLY should lighten up sometimes .
Gynnie asked our kin leader if he wanted to be added to her Oncology Advisory Update List ( or something like that ) , to which he agreed .
From what I gather , it is a system that provides information about her condition and treatment schedule via email or other means .
Gynnie ’s nurse also commented that since our kin leader had taken an interest in her life , she had been more willing to cooperate with her treatment .
This past Wednesday night , the kin leader asked some of us to be online Thursday evening because Gynnie was going to have a very painful treatment and wanted to know someone was available for her to talk to ( he had a previous engagement , would be on , but later ) .
I was n’t able to log on until about halfway through the four hour process , but Gynnie immediately began sending me tells , they seemed a little frantic , I guess because she was so scared .
I tried to calm her by telling her that I have a daughter almost the same age as her .
Here is the conversation paraphrased :
Gynnie : “ What would you do if your daughter were sick and dying like me ? ”
Me : “ I would do everything possible to make her last days comfortable ”
Silence .
Me : “ If your Dad were involved in your life , what would you want him to do ? ”
Gynnie : “ I would like to hear that he cared that I was sick , that he would tell me he would n’t forget me . ”
Me : “ A father is n’t required for that , a friend can do that 🙂 ”
Gynnie : “ But a father should offer :( ”
Gynnie : “ and mine never will ”
She would also tell me many times that the treatment was horrible and she could n’t do it anymore .
I was at a loss for what to say … ” Sure you can ! ” ?
Easy for me to say when I ’m not the one going through it .
Or , “ Yeah , you ’re right . ” ?
That ’s not what she needed either .
I finally settled for , “ I ’m sorry you are having to go through this .
I ’ve been praying for you . ”
Finally , our kin leader logged on and she began to talk with him ( do n’t blame her , I was n’t much help or comfort ) .
Friday and Saturday night were largely incident free as Gynnie mostly spent time talking with our kin leader .
Gynnie did whisper me to apologize for “ dragging you all into my problems ” and disrupting our playing time .
I told her that she was a friend and therefore could not be considered a nuisance .
Then she brought it up again , “ I know I am going to die alone , I just do n’t want to be forgotten ” .
I replied that I have a stellar memory and promised to never forget her .
This seemed to comfort her a bit and she did n’t bring it up again .
Sunday afternoon she logged in briefly without really saying much .
Sunday night things went South .
Gynnie logged in ( with help from her hospice nurse ) and immediately got in a group with her new best friend ( kin leader ) .
Not too much later , he posts a message in kin chat to the effect of “ Gynnie is not able to type , but she wants to say goodbye to everyone .
If you want to reply , now is the time . ”
Wow .
So it ’s time .
Everyone that is on posts as comforting a message as possible and Gynnie ’s nurse reads them to her .
Then the kin leader says , “ She wants to leave her character at her house , I ’m explaining to the nurse how to get her there . ”
I respond , “ meet ya there ! ” and clicked on my travel to Kin House ability .
But I was n’t the first one to arrive .
Another officer was sitting in her yard when I arrived , two more kin mates came in right behind me .
In a moment the kin leader and Gynnie were in front of us .
The nurse ( God bless her ) , held the laptop up so Gynnie could see us with her at her house .
Prayers and words of love were typed in kin chat , the nurse reading them to Gynnie as her heart went into an arrythmia and she drifted away .
At 7:20 pm PST , she left us and went to rest with God .
And there we were , stunned in Falathorn Homesteads .
Gynnie had given everyone in the kinship maintenance privileges to her house for us to do with it what we will .
Our will is to keep that house as hers for as long as we play , and plant pretty flowers in her yard .
Everytime we run through her yard , it will say “ Home of Gynnie ” , and we will remember her .
And that ’s what she wanted .
Maybe this blog will be around for years to come and someone will read it and learn about Gynnie , helping to make sure she is n’t forgotten .
Dying young is tragic enough , but dying alone is even worse .
I am thankful that we were able to be there ( albeit virtually ) and provide a little comfort during her last days , but what if she had n’t met us ?
It roils my stomach to think of it .
Go hug your loved ones and thank God you have them .
( Gynnie is the one facing the house )
UPDATE 06/23/09 :
Good news and bad news .
The good news is “ Gynnie ” did n’t die after all .
The bad news is my cynicism about people has again been vindicated .
The girl in the video is NOT “ Gynnie ” , and probably has no idea that this was taking place .
Therefore I have removed all references to her from this blog post .
I have chosen to leave this blog post largely intact because it ’s purpose is to chronicle my adventures in LOTRO , and that means both good and bad .
This has been a difficult experience and I hope that it does n’t cause others to be callous in the event that they have contact online with someone who claims to be sick , but maybe they will do more fact checking than we did .
Apparently this is a fairly common occurance .
My kin acted completely in good faith and from the bottom of our hearts , so we have nothing to be ashamed of and I am proud to call them friends .

CBS late night comic David Letterman .
Olive Garden backtracks on ads
The Olive Garden restaurant chain is denying that it canceled all of its scheduled ads on CBS late night comic David Letterman ’s “ Late Show ” in response to a crude joke Letterman told about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s daughter and instead contends that its ad schedule concluded .
POLITICO reported Thursday that the company would pull its remaining television spots and was emailing Letterman critics with a note informing them that “ there will be no more Olive Garden ads scheduled for ‘ The Late Show ’ with David Letterman in this year 's broadcast schedule , ” citing the talk show host ’s “ inappropriate comments . ”
Advertisement
“ We apologize that Mr. Letterman ’s mistake , which was not consistent with our standards and values , left you with a bad impression of Olive Garden , ” wrote Sherri Bruen , the company ’s guest relations manager .
Bruen said the company “ screens network television programs whenever possible , ” but explained that “ telecasts , such as ‘ The Late Show ’ with David Letterman , are taped on a daily basis , preventing advertisers from reviewing the content prior to airing . ”
Olive Garden ’s manager of media relations , who asked not to be quoted on the record , confirmed to POLITICO Thursday that the emails were sent by the restaurant chain , and also confirmed that the company would be pulling its remaining television spots on the program for the rest of the year when asked that question .
But in a statement released later in the day , Olive Garden Director of Media Relations Rich Jeffers disputed POLITICO ’s report as “ erroneous . ”
“ No authorized spokesperson for the company confirmed the information in his report , ” Jeffers said .
“ The Olive Garden media schedule is planned months in advance .
The schedule for the Late Show with David Letterman was completed earlier this month .
We take all guest concerns seriously .
And , as always , we will factor those concerns in as we plan our advertising schedule in the future . ”
When asked about the cancellation confirmation POLITICO obtained from the company ’s media relations office , Jeffers responded in an email that the individual listed as the press contact on the company ’s website was unauthorized to speak for the company .
“ The so called ‘ confirmation ’ did n’t come from an authorized spokesperson for the company .
The guest email you received did not say any ads were pulled .
And as our statement says , the schedule — which is set months in advance — was completed earlier this month . ”

CBS did not return several calls seeking comment .
Letterman has apologized for his comment last week about Palin ’s daughter getting “ knocked up by Alex Rodriguez ” during the governor ’s recent visit to a Yankees baseball game .
Palin attended the game as part of a trip to New York .
“ I told a joke that was beyond flawed , and my intent is completely meaningless compared to the perception , ” Letterman said .
“ And since it was a joke I told , I feel that I need to do the right thing here and apologize for having told that joke . ”
After repeatedly blasting the late night comic in statements and interviews last week , Palin accepted Letterman ’s apology on Tuesday .
“ Letterman certainly has the right to ‘ joke ’ about whatever he wants to , and thankfully we have the right to express our reaction , ” she said in a statement .

Everyone makes mistakes , but it's not very often that those mistakes are seen by millions of people , incite user revolts , or create multi-million dollar lawsuits .
In the world of social media , however , this can happen if a person or company is careless , overly defensive , or not proactive .
With that in mind , the following are some of the most notable blunders in social media , as well as lessons to take away from each event .
Hopefully companies and individuals can learn from these disasters and become more productive and engaged in social media rather than becoming the pariah of every tweet or wall post .
1. Facebook News Feed Controversy
The History : Facebook launched one of the most revolutionary features in social media during September 2006 : the Facebook News Feed .
Its launch however , did n't go so well - within a week , 750,000 users were protesting the feature .
After several days , Facebook added privacy controls and created a Facebook group to discuss privacy and news feed issues .
The Lesson : Prepare users for major changes and be proactive in responding to criticism .
Facebook launched news feed as a complete surprise , throwing off many users .
Now Facebook rolls out new features gradually .
2. Sony BMG Copy Protection Scandal
The History : In 2005 , Sony decided to place copy protection ( XCP ) on its CDs to prevent pirating .
However , the XCP software created new vulnerabilities on computers that malware could exploit .
Mark Russinovich broke the story and launched a wave of bloggers and criticism against it .
Worse ,
Sony tried to stonewall bloggers instead of being upfront , fanning the flames .
The result was millions lost in class - action lawsuits .
The Lesson : Two lessons , actually .
First , do n't try to fight against user behavior using ill - advised malware .
The second lesson is be upfront about mistakes .
If Sony had been up front and apologized immediately , the results of the scandal might have been far different .
3. Motrin Moms
The History : Motrin decided that it would be smart to launch a social media campaign for International Baby Wearing Week by producing a well - made YouTube video .
However , they did n't anticipate the backlash .
Moms were not pleased with babies being made into fashion statements and Motrin got an earful from the Internet community .
The Lesson : Understand your audience before engaging with it .
Had Motrin done some research , it probably would have anticipated such a backlash .
People do n't mess around when you talk about their kids .
4. Astrospace Twitter Account
The History : Twitter user Astrospace , now Astronautics , simply flipped out against Twitter and his followers .
After astrospace / astronautics lost his cool , he deleted his account , which was quickly snapped up by somebody else .
Eventually he did return with most of his followers on his astronautics account , but with far more confusion and far less credibility .
The Lesson : Keep your emotions in check .
You may get really angry or depressed over events in social media , but like any public situation , tempered emotions will prevent embarrassment on your end .
5. Facebook Terms of Service
The History : Facebook has been through its share of social media snafus .
Its most recent one was the change to Facebook 's terms of service that was soon reverted after users and bloggers cried out in protest .
Instead of dragging its feet however , Facebook quickly responded to user concerns and created an open forum for discussing changes to Facebook .
The Lesson : Proactive engagement with your users and customers during controversy helps address concerns .
Facebook has clearly learned from its past mistakes and made a visible effort to incorporate user information .
This helped keep the terms of service controversy from blowing up into an even bigger mess .
Learn From Their Mistakes
When building a brand , engaging customers , or just communicating with friends , it is vital to remember how quickly even a single update can go viral in social media .
People value honesty , being upfront , and listening to others .
Employing these principles can prevent social media blunders from turning into lawsuits and PR disasters .

Darwinius new genus
The limb proportions of Europolemur kelleri Franzen , 2000a , E. koenigswaldi Franzen , 1988 , and the North American Notharctus osborni Gregory , 1920 , are similar , whereas the limbs of E. klatti Weigelt , 1933 , from Geiseltal are unknown .
The dentition of E. kelleri , E. koenigswaldi and E. klatti ( type species ) correspond so well , that there is no doubt that they belong to the same genus .
Radiographs demonstrate that all species of Europolemur match each other in possessing unicuspid but two - rooted P 2 /P 2 , while that of Godinotia neglecta and that of Darwinius masillae are small , straight and one - rooted , almost remnants in the maxilla ( Fig. 3 ) .
The type specimen of G. neglecta from Geiseltal clearly differs from E. kelleri , E. koenigswaldi , and D. masillae in having very gracile limb bones ( Figs. 1 – 3 ) .
The postcranial skeleton of E. klatti is little known save for an isolated astragalus , calcaneum , and atlas , the species determination of which is uncertain [ 22 : 50 , 62 –65 , fig .
2.20 ] .
When Franzen described the counterpart specimen ( plate B ) and assigned it to Godinotia neglecta from Geiseltal [ 1 ] , the permanent dentition of the Messel specimen was only represented by a fragmentary left M 1 and an incomplete forelimb and lower leg without hands and feet .
He therefore did not recognize the difference of limb proportions , basing his determination mainly on the similar degree of reduction of the antemolar dentition .
In 1994 similarities of the dentition led him to assign Geiseltal and Messel specimens to the genus Caenopithecus described by Rütimeyer in1862 from Egerkingen γ [ 18 ] , [ 27 ] .
Now that the completely preserved right side of the Messel specimen ( plate A ) is known and described herein , it is clear that Darwinius masillae n.gen. , n.sp. differs considerably from the type specimen of Godinotia neglecta in the postcranial skeleton and in particular , the limb proportions .
Moreover , its dentition is clearly different from that of Europolemur koenigswaldi as well as E. kelleri from Messel and it differs from that of Caenopithecus lemuroides from Egerkingen in lacking a mesostyle on the upper molars .
Differs from Cercamonius brachyrhynchus ( Stehlin , 1912 ) , from Prajous ( Quercy Phosphorite deposits ) in having a mandibular ramus that is mesially not as deep , a trigonid of M 1 that is mesiodistally longer , and a talonid of M 1 – 2 that is larger and broader .
M 1 and M 2 have a separate metastylid cusp not seen in Cercamonius .
Differs from Caenopithecus lemuroides Rütimeyer , 1862 ( Egerkingen γ [ 26 ] ) in being smaller and having upper molars that lack a mesostyle ( postcranial skeleton of Caenopithecus is unknown except for an isolated talus ; see below ) .
M 1 and M 2 display a well developed hypocone but no mesostyle .
A metaconule is lacking .
The M 1 and M 2 show a small trigonid and a very broad talonid .
In the permanent dentition , P 1 /P 1 have been lost whereas P 2 /P 2 are unicuspid and uniradical , especially reduced in the maxilla .
The lower segments of the anterior and posterior limbs are conspicuously short and robust .
The phalanges are elongated .
A toilet or grooming claw is not present .
Molars of Darwinius masillae are distinct in morphology and intermediate in size between those of contemporary species of Periconodon and Europolemur .
Description
Rostrum and orbit .
Nasale :
The anterior parts of the nasals are not preserved .
The ventral suture with the premaxilla is about one - third of the length of the suture with the maxilla and lachrymal ( or median process of maxilla , see below ) .
Following the impressions , the right nasal extends mesially to above I2 whereas the left ends above the border between I1 and I2 .
The right nasal contains three similar sized slit - like nasal foramina .
The most caudal one is situated above the anterior rim of the orbit .
The most mesial one occurs above the tip of the deciduous upper canine .
Premaxilla :
The suture between the two premaxillae is recognizable between the central incisors .
The right premaxilla contains two permanent incisors ( Figs. 4 –5 ) .
The bone is almost triangular and has a long caudal suture with the maxilla , as well as a straight , upwardly - directed suture with the premaxilla of the left side .
Above there is also a dorsomesial suture with the right nasal .
The bone reaches distally to above upper dC1 .

Deciduous dI 2 has not yet been shed , and dC1/dC 1 , dP3/dP 3 , and dP4 / dP 4 are still functional .
Permanent teeth that are fully erupted include I1 / I 1 , P2 / P 2 , and M1/ M 1 ( P2 is present on plate B [ 1 ) .
Erupting teeth include I2 / I 2 and M2 / M 2 .
Crowns of M3 / M 3 are fully formed but lack roots .
Crowns of P3/P 3 and P4 / P 4 are partially formed , with P4 / P 4 notably more developed than P3 / P 3 .
The crown of C1 appears to be fully formed , while that of C 1 is less mineralized .
Judging from the stage of crown formation , premolars erupted in the sequence P2 / P 2 – P4 / P 4 – P3/ P 3 , as in Cantius ( Gingerich and Smith , in prep . ) , Notharctus [ 23 , pl. LII : 9 ] , and Europolemur [ 16 , pl. III : 3 ] .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005723.g005
Maxilla :
The bone forms a large part of the face .
It contains the canine , two deciduous premolars , P2 and three molars ( Fig. 4 ) .
The maxilla is very flattened and damaged and hard to distinguish from the other bones .
The anterior border is located above the precanine diastema .
Its suture with the premaxilla is steep and curving caudally into the suture with the nasal .
There might be a median process of the maxilla dorsal to the lachrymal as seen in Lemur , but this cannot be decided from the X - ray photographs or CT scans .
In the intraorbital part of the maxilla , there is a large intraorbital foramen .
The mesial opening of the infraorbital channel is very small and situated above the metacone of dP4 .
Lachrymal :
The lachrymal bone is crushed .
There seems to be a substantial facial part , but most of the bone lies within the orbit .
The lachrymal foramen is not visible .
Frontal :
The frontal bone forms the medial and upper half of the posterior border of the orbit .
Mesially , it has a suture with the nasal and lachrymal .
There is a well - defined ethmoidal foramen .
The processus jugalis is robust and meets the processus frontalis of the jugal halfway .
Together the two bones form the postorbital bar .
Jugal :
The mesiodorsal beginning of the zygomatic arch as well as the ventral border of the orbit is situated above the metacone of dP4 .
The zygomatic arch is mesially low and slender .
The jugal size increases considerably distally until the divergence of the processus frontalis .
Behind this the jugal narrows to about half of its former height .
This is also the width of the postorbital bar .
Squamosum :
The bone forms the posterior half of the zygomatic arch and ends caudally in the fossa glenoidalis .
Auditory region .
Squamosum : Caudally of the rather massive processus postglenoidalis there is a deep porus acusticus , which is not surrounded by an external meatus .
The squamosum forms the dorsal roof of the meatus .
Petrosum :
The bulla tympanica has completely collapsed .
However , the posterior and dorsal part is visible .
The bulla of the left side is preserved on plate B , where the dorsal half of the annulus tympanicus is clearly seen on the X - ray photograph [ 1 : fig . 5 ] .
Braincase .
Part of the left parietal and frontal is visible above the well exposed sutura sagittalis .
Because of compaction , the skull appears higher than it was originally .
A crista sagittalis was not developed .
The rather voluminous braincase ends distally at the crista nuchalis .
Caudoventrally , the in situ planum nuchale is turned up and crushed .
The following bones form the dorsal and lateral parts of the braincase : Frontal :
As usual , the bone forms the mesial part of the braincase .
Parietal :
The bone makes up most of the lateral side of the braincase .
It is both deep and wide .
Mesially , the parietal meets the frontal bone and caudally it has a long suture with the dorsal part of the occipital .
It ends posterolaterally at the nuchal crest .
Occipital :
The dorsal extension of the occipital bone ( protuberantia occipitalis externa ) is wedged between the parietals as a triangular plate .
On the caudal end of the skull , the dorsal rim of the foramen magnum is visible .
The atlas is visible to the right of the foramen magnum , pressed against the occipital plane .
Lower jaw .
The right ramus mandibularis is exposed laterally , with the teeth visible in buccal view .
In contrast to adapid skulls [ 28 ] , its height increases mesially , but not as much as it seems on its left counterpart [ 1 : 293 , fig . 4 ] .
In addition , the mesial outline of the mandible is not as steep as it is on the left side ( plate B ) .
Both may result from damage during preparation .
The micro-CT shows that the symphysis was fused ventrally but still open dorsally , due to the juvenile age of the individual ( see below ) .
The angular area increases caudally , where it extends into a well developed , caudally - protruding processus angularis .
Some flat bony fragments located ventral and caudal to the processus angularis seem to belong to the hyoids .
The processus articularis is still articulated with the fossa glenoidalis , which is situated about 6 mm above the occlusal surface of the mandibular cheek teeth .
The coronoid process appears dorsal to the arcus zygomaticus , but it is not fully exposed making description impossible .
There is only one foramen mentale appearing below P 2 in the middle of the corpus .
Dentition .
The dentition of Darwinius masillae shows the holotype to be a juvenile , and imaging reveals a host of developing teeth within the face and jaw ( Fig. 5 ) .
Much of the face preserves natural occlusion of upper and lower teeth .
Studies of higher primates show that teeth generally begin eruption sometime after roots begin to mineralize , emerging through bone and gum before roots are complete [ 28 ] .
In this light , images of Darwinius crown and root development reveal a coherent , readable pattern , in which we see : ( 1 ) fainter , less dense deciduous crowns with long roots ; ( 2 ) developing permanent molars with densely mineralized crowns and incomplete roots ; and ( 3 ) mineralizing crowns of the replacing permanent teeth ( I1/ I 1 - P4 / P 4 ) , largely , but not entirely , buried within the face .
Basically , the entire permanent dentition was mineralizing while the deciduous dentition had only begun to be shed .
Deciduous teeth :
In the mandible , it appears that the central deciduous incisors ( dI 1 ) have been shed and replaced .
Much smaller second deciduous incisors ( dI 2 ) remain in the mandible , on right and left sides .
We cannot positively identify any upper deciduous incisors , which may have been shed .
Clearly , upper and lower deciduous canines are in place .
All four deciduous third and fourth premolars ( dP3 / dP 3 and dP4 / dP 4 ) are erupted and in occlusion .
All the deciduous teeth have long roots , consistent with circumnatal emergence .
At the second premolar position we see only a single tooth generation in the mandible and maxilla , and , after more extensive comparison , conclude that dP 2 was probably shed at an early age .
Permanent molars :
All three permanent molars can be seen in the dentary .
The first permanent molar in the dentary , M 1 , is fully erupted , occluding in normal position with M1 .
The long , but open roots of M 1 suggest that it was probably erupted for some time ( weeks or possibly months ) .
The mandibular second molar , M 2 , is just erupting , and its roots are less developed .
The upper second molar , M2 , is displaced but lacks sufficient root development for eruption .
Third molars , M3 / M 3 , had no roots mineralized , and these crowns were probably still covered by soft tissues .
Replacement teeth :
The first permanent incisor is the most advanced of the replacement teeth ; this tooth is fully erupted with root length mineralized perhaps ⅔ or ¾ of final adult length .
The tooth labeled I 1 is permanent because it is much larger than dI 2 and it has a denser crown .
Development of I 2 is well underway , but it is significantly behind I 1 .
In the premaxilla , we can see four incisor teeth .
The right side is clearest : here , the I1 ( with its labial edge slightly broken ) is erupted , with a long root ( ¾ or more mineralized ) .
The more caniniform right I2 shows root development of about ⅔.
Radiographs also show a well developed incisor from the left side that is more difficult to identify ( it may be I1 or possibly I2 ; one of these teeth is missing in either case ) .
Maxillary permanent incisors were at or near emergence .
The developing lower canine crown , C 1 , is substantial , but probably no more than half its eventual size .
The massive upper permanent canine crown is probably caught at its maximum width , as mineralization was just outlining flanges at the base of the crown , indicating that a wide but not extremely tall crown was forming .
The second premolar is represented by a tiny maxillary tooth , P2 , on plate B , and a small mandibular tooth , P 2 , on both plates A and B .
The mandibular tooth has a more densely mineralized crown , casting a denser shadow on radiographs and allying it with other permanent teeth .
Root development is long and clearly advanced over that of the remaining permanent premolars .
The crown of P 4 is less than ½ formed , but noticeably advanced over that of P 3 ; crowns of P4 and P3 can be identified in radiographs , with P4 again much advanced over P3 .
Molar morphology .
Little can be seen of the crowns of the molars in either plate A ( Fig. 5 ) or plate B .
However , we have succeeded in extracting three molars using micro-CT and graphic reconstruction ( Fig. 6 ) .

Micro-CT reconstructions of molar teeth of Darwinius masillae , new genus and species .
Tooth crowns shown here were extracted digitally to show the entire crown for teeth that are only partially exposed in Plate A ( see Fig. 5 ) .
( A–B ) — right M1 , in buccal and occlusal view .
( C–D ) — right M 1 , in buccal and occlusal view .
( E–F ) — right M 2 , in buccal and occlusal view .
Note the absence of a mesostyle on M1 , and the presence of a hypocone on the broad lingual cingulum of this tooth .
Note too the absence of a distinct paraconid and hypoconulid on M 1 –2 , and the very broad talonid on M 2 .
Molars of Darwinius masillae are distinct in morphology and intermediate in size between those of contemporary species of Periconodon and Europolemur .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005723.g006
The crown of M1 is subrectangular in occlusal outline , with a prominent protocone , paracone , and metacone well spaced on the crown .
There is a well - developed hypocone developed on a broad lingual cingulum , but a pericone , if present , was weakly developed ( Fig. 6A–B ) .
This tooth has the classic simplicity of cercamoniine upper molars .
Roots are relatively well developed , which is consistent with its early eruption .
Measurements are listed in Table 2 .
The crown of M 1 is relatively long and narrow ( Fig. 6C–D ) .
There is no distinct paraconid , but a looping paracristid encloses a basined trigonid .
The protoconid and metaconid are well developed on the trigonid , followed by a distinct hypoconid and entoconid on the talonid .
There is no hypoconulid , but a well developed metastylid distally from the metaconid .
The talonid of M 1 is distinctly broader than the trigonid , but less broad than the talonid on M 2 .
The cristid oblique or prehypocristid runs mesiolingually toward the notch in the postprotocristid but then turns abruptly to join the protoconid .
There is a narrow cingulid bordering the lingual side of the tooth .
Measurements are listed in Table 2 .
The crown of M 2 is shorter than that of M 1 , with a broader trigonid and a much broader talonid ( Fig. 6E–F ) .
The trigonid is short anteroposteriorly .
It lacks a paraconid , and again has a looping paracristid enclosing a shallowly basined trigonid .
The protoconid and metaconid are well developed on the trigonid , and again they are followed by a distinct hypoconid and entoconid on the talonid .
There is neither a hypoconulid nor a metastylid .
The lingual cingulid is more pronounced than that on M 1 .
As on M 1 , there is a distinct cristid oblique that ends near the base of the protoconid .
Measurements are listed in Table 2 and Appendix S1 .
Vertebral column .
( Figs. 1 –2 , 7 , S3 , and measurements in Appendix S1 ) .
The vertebral column is complete , although laterally compressed and , in part , crushed .
Altogether it comprises 7 cervical , 11 thoracic , 7 lumbar , 3 sacral , and 31 caudal vertebrae .
The whole vertebral column , from the proximal end of the atlas to the end of the last caudal vertebra , measures ca. 53 cm ( Table 2 ) .
Together with a basal length of the skull of about 5 cm , this results in a total skeleton length of ca. 58 cm , whereas the head and body length is ca. 24 cm without the tail .

Length profile for caudal vertebrae of Darwinius masillae , new genus and species , compared to those of other primates .
Measurements of Darwinius were taken from plate A ( Fig. 1 ) .
Darwinius , Europolemur , and Notharctus are Eocene adapoids ; Ateles and Callithrix are extant Ceboidea ; and Avahi and Eulemur are extant Lemuroidea .
Measurements of comparative specimens are from [ 23 ] , [ 38 ] , with new measurements added for Avahi .
Note that the profile for Darwinius is flatter ( rises less high and declines less rapidly ) than that for any of the comparative specimens .

The atlas is broken and incomplete .
It is attached to the planum nuchale of the cranium .
The left wing of the atlas is crushed , whereas the right wing is seen in dorsal view , with a well - developed foramen vertebrale laterale .
The lateral surface of the axis is visible in plate A , however the prominent processus spinalis is crushed .
C3–C5 are visible in lateral view .
Their processus spinales are only partially exposed , whereas their processus transversi are clearly visible .
Caudally in the cervical series , the processus transversi become more and more expanded .
C6 is crushed , whereas the right scapula covers C7 .
By including the first and second thoracic vertebrae , which are hidden below the right scapula , 11 thoracic vertebrae are present although their exact number is difficult to determine and therefore somewhat ambiguous .
Whereas T3–T5 are laterally exposed , T6–T8 have rotated around their long axis so that they are seen in dorsal aspect , while T9 –T11 are visible laterally .
There is no diaphragmatic vertebra , because even the processus spinalis of T11 is slightly but clearly dipping caudally .
The ribs are not well preserved .
Most of their cartilaginous parts exist only as natural casts .
The right humerus mostly covers the sternum .
Caudal to the thoracics are 7 lumbar vertebrae .
They are comparatively massive and display cranially oriented transverse processes , which become more and more expanded caudally .
No spinal processes are evident on L1–L3 , but L4 carries a rather small process slightly dipping caudally .
The spinal process of the lumbar vertebrae becomes somewhat larger caudally and dips more in this direction .
The os sacrum comprises 3 vertebrae , S1–S3 , the most proximal one of which is damaged .
Altogether , there are 31 caudal vertebrae but the last one ends fragmented at a fault .
So there may have been one or two more .
The 3 most proximal are comparatively short and display strong transverse processes that become weaker more distally in the series .
The last transverse process is developed on Ca4 , which is already considerably longer and shows only a small processus transversus at its caudal end .
All following vertebrae have no processus transversi .
In D. masillae the dorsal vertebral column shown on plate A is gently curved ( that of plate B is fake ) and the tail is only slightly curved .
The length profile of the proximal half of caudal vertebrae is close to that of living Callithrix jacchus , while more distally D. masillae has much longer vertebrae .
Altogether , the tail is much longer than that referred to Europolemur koenigswaldi ( Fig. 7 ) .
In D. masillae , the length profile of Ca8 –Ca20 differs from that of the living Avahi laniger , even more so from Eulemur mongoz , and considerably from Ateles geoffroyi .
Clearly , Darwinius did not have a prehensile tail .
The tail was presumably used primarily for balance , and possibly for steering while leaping .
Its soft body contours are incomplete .
Therefore , it is impossible to decide whether it was bushy or not .

Funny and Cute Hedgehogs
Hedgehogs can be very interesting pets .
They supply tons of fun , all you need to do to see that is to catch them in just the right moment .
Hedgehogs are cuter than kittens .
Check out what they have in store for you :
Interesting Information About Hedgehogs :
* If you think about the name hedge - hog , it tells you a great deal about this animal .
Hog – snout like a pig : hedge – where it roots about for slugs and snails .
* Hedgehogs are found in Europe , Asia and Africa .
In some parts of the USA people have introduced the African Pygmy hedgehog , but it ’s not native to American , and hedgehogs are banned in California .
* For hedgehogs , smell is their primary sense , however hearing also pays a large part in its senses .
Hedgehogs hibernate for one simple reason : to survive the winter , for the rest of the year they are solitary and nocturnal , hence their eyesight is not highly developed .
Famous hedgehog – Mrs Tiggywinkle
* The male hedgehog is called the boar and the female the sow , their their offspring are hoglets .
Incidentally , the sows are grateful that the hoglets are born without spines .
* The hedgehog is an insectivore and eats lots of beetles and caterpillars ; they particularly like , earthworms and slugs .
Hedgehogs have a varied diet and will also eat small mammals , snails , millipedes , earwigs and even bees .
* In Will and Guy ’s view , Mrs Tiggywinkle is the most famous of all hedgehogs .
Mrs Tiggwinkle appears in Beatrix Potter ’s books where she is usually ironing , or starching shirts .
( See hedgehog picture to the right ) .
By comparison Sonic the Hedgehog is a young interloper .
* Sadly , hedgehogs are becoming rare , even endangered .
The problem is fewer good old scruffy gardens .
These days it ’s either manicured lawn or patio .
Other enemies of the hedgehogs include cars , lawnmowers , trimmers , plus the occasional fox or badger .
Late last year , while the country was in the midst of a generation - defining election , the financial system was about to collapse , and the Congo was on the brink of genocide , I exited the subway on Bedford Avenue to discover hundreds of drunk twentysomethings dressed as panda bears .
These self - proclaimed “ anarchist cyber - pandas ” in skinny jeans were part of a “ costumed - roving - street - party - apocalyptic - dance - rock - battle ” called Pandamonium .
Equipped with all the accouterments you ’d expect from such an occasion — face paint , booze , glow sticks , and a misguided notion that wearing animal costumes outside a Chuck E. Cheese is a good idea — the panda posse had effectively brought all traffic to a standstill .
But this was no political rally organized to protest genocide , economic disparity , or anything approaching profound .
It was performance art masquerading as activism .
This was Williamsburg , after all .
The trendy Northside of Brooklyn .
These pandas were hipsters .
According to its organizers , the idea behind Pandamonium was to “ take back the streets , ” evidently by getting drunk , blaring boomboxes ( “ the louder the better ” ) , blocking the streets , and by generally annoying the cops until they were forced to make several arrests .
For Williamsburg hipsters , Pandamonium was their very own Kent State moment — only without the carnage , social activism , the historical significance , or the firing of synapses within the cerebral cortex .
For me , it was another embarrassing moment I ’d doubtlessly be asked to defend the next time someone decided to sling a little mud at the place I call home .
I ’ve been a resident of Williamsburg since 1996 .
And once again the hipsters had made us all look stupid .
If anyone has hipster fatigue , it ’s me .
I literally wrote the book on them — a satire called The Hipster Handbook that was , after all , the byproduct of my own hipster fatigue more than seven years ago .
( Full Disclosure : I went to a state school and I ca n’t fit into skinny jeans .
But admittedly , I listen to Grizzly Bear and own pastel Chuck Taylors .
So if there were a hipster personality test , I ’d be checking a few boxes . )
But these days , I ’m even more exhausted by the tired vitriol and self - loathing that has become integral to any conversation involving hipsters .
At least for now , they ’re clearly not going away — so is n’t it about time we stopped dismissing every person who owns a MGMT record as an entitled hipster ?
It ’s been nearly a decade , y’all .
The rage has gotten so shrill , the hipster haters have become more exasperating than those fools in panda suits .
For a while , it seemed the “ h ” word was destined to find its place beside the c- and n-words , a pejorative too offensive to utter .
Thankfully , the tired hipster bashing — which was always the loudest among “ non-hipsters ” who owned every CD recommended by Pitchfork — seemed to have reached a crescendo in 2007 .
That was the summer when the hilarious Hipster Olympics became viral and Time Out New York published the cover story “ The Hipster Must Die . ”
Seemingly , hipster bashing had peaked .
Meanwhile , a growing obsession with social - networking sites and new forms of communication — Facebook , Twitter , the iPhone — was beginning to hint that something different was on the horizon .
By 2008 , Obama was motivating a new generation to put aside childish panda suits , as editorialists gushed about the hopeful , refreshingly sincere generation that had suddenly emerged .
The Millennials , they wrote , were taking over as those nihilistic hipsters pushed their designer baby carriages out of “ the scene ” and into a Park Slope sunset .
If you believed the hype , the hipster suddenly seemed to be on the verge of extinction .
A fleeting trend .
Just like rap music .
But then hipsters started popping up in the news once again .
I first noticed the trend when magazines and newspapers began devoting ink to stories on hipsters during the recession .
A New York Times reporter called : “ How are hipsters cutting back ? ” she asked .
Would they have to sell their iPods ?
Another Times article reported booming ticket sales at Coachella , a music festival with a hipster - heavy constituency , suggesting they were n’t necessarily cutting back at all .
And in its article , “ The New Counterculture ’s Buying Power , ” Forbes appeared hopeful that hipsters would save the economy with their frenzied spending .
For weeks , the internet buzzed with tales of Ferrell ’s exploits as this heavily tattooed con artist roamed the streets of New York , scamming bearded hipster boys .
“ While retailers geared toward consumers under 45 – the Gap , Abercrombie & Fitch , and Express – have struggled in the past year to increase sales , ” the article stated , “ hipster - centric clothing outlet Urban Outfitters has reported record results . ”
Of course , the subtext to most of the articles was that hipsters were not only a thriving demographic , but as entitled and out - of - touch as ever .
“ What sort of recession victim spends $ 270 for a ticket she can barely afford ? ” mocked Gawker , in response to the Coachella article .
Over the past several months , the chatter about hipsters has grown even louder .
In March , “ Look at This Fucking Hipster , ” a website that posts photos of hipsters posing , puking , and wearing over - the - top outfits that could get them killed in some states , launched and became an instant viral hit .
This month it became the latest Tumblr site to secure a book deal .
Meanwhile , the self - reflexively cool website Hipster Runoff — written anonymously by the mysterious chatspeak aficionado Carles — published a much - distributed critique on the band Animal Collective .
It went viral too , thus introducing this formerly under - the - radar blog to the masses and generating fresh interest in bowl - cut mullets , “ contorted alts , ” and blog house DJs .
In other words , hipsters .
There ’s even been conjecture at Gawker , New York , and Curbed about an alleged hipster reality series that ’s rumored to be casting for a “ major network . ”
But this much - loathed demographic officially made a comeback when they found a new folk hero ( or anti-hero ) in the form of Kari Ferrell , aka the Hipster Grifter .
For weeks , the internet buzzed with tales of Ferrell ’s exploits as this heavily tattooed con artist roamed the streets of New York , scamming bearded hipster boys and offering to give strangers “ handjobs with her mouth . ”
When the New York Observer introduced the Hipster Grifter to the world it became official .
The hipster was back .
All of which makes me ask :
Had the hipster ever really gone away ?
After trying to avoid spending any more mental energy on hipsters , I found myself confronted with this question when I was invited to be a “ special guest ” at an n+1 magazine panel at the New School .
An “ historic event , ” its organizers assured me , on a topic that was guaranteed to catalyze a heated discussion .
The symposium was called “ What Was the Hipster ? ”
“ Who was the turn - of - the - century hipster ? ” asked the suspiciously hip magazine ’s promotional copy .
“ Why do we declare the hipster moment over — that , in fact , it had ended by 2003 — when the hipster ’s ‘ global brand ’ has just reached its apotheosis ? ”
First and foremost , hipsterism is about stuff .
It ’s the natural byproduct of a consumption - obsessed culture with a thriving middle class .
Of course , as I panned around the audience the day of the event , the question “ who was the hipster ” suddenly seemed absurd .
Judging by the surplus of skinny jeans and American Apparel day - glo leggings — not to mention the inane banter that ensued after an audience member presented the panel with a question about Charles in Charge — they should have changed the name of the event to “ what is the hipster ” and replaced the podium with a mirror .
The audience could have found the answer by gazing sullenly at their own reflections as they chanted , in unison , with a manic self - loathing , “ Die , hipster , die . ”
For try as they might to instill the event with an air of academia , the organizers were confronted with a roomful of delusional art students , enraged by the banality of hipsterdom , but unwilling to be honest enough to admit that they were the very subject of their own derision .
Here ’s the thing .
As fatigued as we all may be , hipsters are here to stay .
We can change their names to scenesters , or altbros and altbags ( as Hipster Runoff prefers ) , but in the hipster we ’ve found a new archetype that is not an ephemeral phenomenon .
Undoubtedly , they ’ve been far too exposed at this point in time to be considered an “ underground ” or “ countercultural ” movement .
( See Urban Outfitters or the indie - rock drenched advertisements for the iPod . )
But as the hipster aesthetic has been co-opted by advertisers and the mainstream media , they have only managed to grow in number .
As Mark Greif , the co-founder of n+1 , pointed out at the New School panel , the hipster is now a global phenomenon .
Further bad news for bashers is the evidence that , as time marches forward , hipsters seem to be quite adaptable .
When they were first identified as a demographic , circa 1998 , the two most dominant hipster aesthetics were twee — think Belle and Sebastian , sweater vests , and Ira Glass — and a white trash - chic epitomized by the tattoos and wifebeaters found in Vice magazine .
( Greif referred to these two types as “ non-aggressives ” and “ aggressives , ” respectively . )
Jump forward 10 years , and the latest wave of hipsters have their own trends — beards , “ freak folk , ” Depression - era chic — all of which communicate : “ I take careful care to cultivate an aesthetic , by which I hope you ’ll judge me . ”
The styles have changed , but the overall sensibility of the hipster remains intact .
But this should come as no surprise .
“ Hipsterism , ” after all , was always something deeper than trucker caps and PBR .
It ’s a sensibility that transcends fleeting trends and can be reduced to a few consistent , identifiable , time - resilient elements .
So allow me to deconstruct .
First and foremost , hipsterism is about stuff .
It ’s the natural byproduct of a consumption - obsessed culture with a thriving middle class .
The complete works of Johnny Cash on vinyl .
An iPhone packed with apps .
Thick - framed glasses without the lenses .
Throw in an unwavering certainty that your tastes are superior to everyone else ’s , and you ’re on your way to establishing a hipster aesthetic .
Future generations may not have the same resources to squander , but there will undoubtedly continue to be artistically inclined young people who define their identity and their aesthetic , by accumulating meticulously selected possessions .
The James Deans and Fonzies of the world never got the girl by gushing .
Instead , they made them swoon by pretending they did n’t give a damn .
The second element is pastiche , the hodgepodge blending of elements from pop culture to create a sensibility .
Whether it be the goofy “ post - punk - electro - blog - house ” labels associated with hipster music , or the entire film career of Wes Anderson , pastiche is essential to hipsterdom .
And clearly , as our already overwhelming inventory of pop culture references continue to grow with the passing of time , pastiche will continue to flourish .
Finally there ’s irony , a knee - jerk way for hipsters to emotionally distance themselves from sincerely appreciating things .
While the hipster ’s ironic sensibility has always been the subject of ire , pretending to be disaffected is n’t exactly a novel concept among people who are “ cool . ”
The James Deans and Fonzies of the world never got the girl by gushing .
Instead , they made them swoon by pretending they did n’t give a damn .
And in regard to the hipster ’s “ ironic ” appreciation of things that are not traditionally considered cool — shirts with Pegasus decals , Gossip Girl , PBR — I ’d argue that many hipsters do sincerely appreciate all of the aforementioned , either as a form of nostalgia or as a celebration of low culture they ’ve been instructed to avoid .
This ironic sensibility saturates current shows like Flight of the Conchords and Important Things With Demetri Martin and it ’s not about to go away .
As was true with the hippie , another contemporary archetype that ’s proven to be here for the long haul , there ’s obviously plenty of cultural baggage that accompanies the hipster .
All of which , of course , has been thoroughly and exhaustively mocked .
Apathy .
Trust funds and entitlement .
Nihilism .
Gentrification .
Celebrity worship .
Lack of originality .
Naiveté .
Random stupidity .
None of these annoyances is essential to the DNA of the hipster , but all too often , well , you meet some self - absorbed , entitled moron in a panda suit .
But let ’s get real .
For every cynical slacker sitting around “ ironically ” watching The Real Housewives of Orange County and turning his beard orange with Sparks spittle , there ’s a legitimate artist who ’s working his / her ass off , dare I say it , doing something cool .
There ’s no contrived lack of aesthetic to the films of Michel Gondry .
He ’s an artist , and yes , he ’s cool .
There ’s no artificial , ironic detachment to the music that TV on the Radio produce .
They ’re artists too , and yes , they ’re cool .
And perhaps it should go without saying , but hipster profiling is about as effective as racial profiling .
Owning a pair of skinny jeans and living in Bushwick does n’t make someone cool .
But it does n’t make them a hipster douchebag either .
That ’s why the knee - jerk hipster rage , perhaps best exemplified by Douglas Haddow in the Adbusters article , “ Hipster : The Dead End of Western Civilization , ” seems so overblown .
“ The hipster represents the end of Western civilization , ” writes Haddow .
“ [ A ] culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning .
Not only is it unsustainable , it is suicidal . ”
I hate to call bullshit , but a quick Google search of the author reveals an article about hipsters who paint graffiti murals in their bedrooms and an author photo that looks suspiciously like something you ’d find on Look at This Fucking Hipster .
Which reinforces my point .
The rage and self - loathing associated with hipsters has become more annoying , more naive , and more artificial than hipsters could ever hope to be .
After all , in the rubble of this fury , what remains for artists and bohemians who are legitimately trying to be part of a counterculture ?
You get the sense that if Jimi Hendrix were to show up in Echo Park today , he’d be publicly mocked in a style section piece on blipsters for wearing a feathered fedora .
Duchamp would have given up as soon as he appeared on dadaist - or - douchebag.com .
And Warhol would be demonized as a hipster gentrifier for setting up his factory in a Brooklyn warehouse .
Critics continue to complain that we live in an era where all art is derivative and devoid of substance .
But if Hendrix , Duchamp , or Warhol were alive today , we ’d be doing our damnedest to derail their self - expression , dismissing them as fucking hipsters .
As Pandamonium illustrates , there ’s no shortage of hipsters worthy of our mocking .
But our challenge is to make the distinction between the artists and the pandas .
Otherwise , when the next generation finds its own Jackson Pollock , John Coltrane , or Dorothy Parker , we ’re likely to stifle their talents with our misappropriated cynicism .
Or worse , we ’ll turn them into a joke .
" In his seven years on the court , Justice Albin has demonstrated the fairness , the judgment , the compassion , and the commitment to the rule of law that we must demand of our Supreme Court justices , and has proven to be a thoughtful and progressive member of our state 's highest court , " Corzine said in a statement following the Senate vote .

Battlefield 1943 serves as a good indicator of how far downloadable console games have come in just a few years .
It began with the modest ( but still fantastic ) Xbox 360 launch title Geometry Wars , a simple 2D shooter that was n't much more than Robotron with an extreme makeover .
Jump ahead to summer 2009 and we can download a 3D first - person shooter that supports 24 players online and looks almost as good as a full retail game .
Battlefield 1943 is a benchmark for digital titles and sets a new standard for what we 'll be expecting .
It does n't innovate in terms of gameplay , but it 's a fun and streamlined multiplayer shooter you can obtain without dealing with the nerds at GameStop .
The Battlefield franchise got its start back in 2002 with Battlefield 1942 , a World War II shooter with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer fights .
It grew in many directions including the future with Battlefield 2142 , but Battlefield 1943 is sort of a spinoff of that first game .
There are just three maps included , all from 1942 .
And there is only one game mode , Conquest , that sees both teams ( the U.S. and Japan ) trying to capture and hold five strategic points .
So this is a neat and trim download that makes getting into battles as quick and easy as possible .
From the title screen you can create a private match , join a quick match , or join a match with friends -- a feature I 'd like to see in more games .
You can also create a squad of four people to play as a unit and share a voice channel during the game .
Your squad members can easily be located on your HUD and mini-map , and they have the ability to spawn next to each other .
There are three classes to choose from : infantry , rifleman , and scout .
Each have different weapons and work best at short - , middle - , and long - ranges , respectively .
Each respawn you can pick your class , and downed enemies leave behind their gear in case you want to switch up during battle .
Any friendly flag can be a respawn point , so the more bases you control the more options you have .
Players have infinite ammo but still need to reload -- a process that can take a while , so you 'll need to choose your reload times carefully .
The game is well balanced , and the maps provide strategic opportunities for each class .
There are towers for the snipers , for instance , and bases often have a hidden entrance infantry can charge .
Vehicles have traditionally been a big part of Battlefield , and that remains true here .
Scattered around each map are jeeps , tanks , boats , and planes , literally giving players access to land , sea , and air .
The planes definitely have the highest learning curve , but once you get the hang of it you 'll be able to pick off soldiers and bomb tanks .
Even better , sharp - shooting soldiers can bring down planes .

Saku Koivu , the Montreal Canadiens ' longtime captain and fan favorite , signed a one - year deal with the Anaheim Ducks , the team announced Wednesday .
The deal is worth $ 3.25 million .
Koivu was Montreal 's captain for nearly 10 years , tying Jean Beliveau for longest - serving captain in the team 's 100 - year history .
He had 191 goals , 450 assists and 623 penalty minutes with the Canadiens , the only team Koivu has played for during his NHL career .
Koivu successfully overcame non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and returned to hockey seven months after being diagnosed in September 2001 .
" Saku Koivu 's character and leadership qualities are unquestioned , " Ducks general manager Bob Murray said .
" He is a skilled playmaker and we are thrilled to add him to our team . "
Koivu , a two - time All - Star who turns 35 in November , reached the 600 - point milestone with a goal against Florida in October .
He had 16 goals and 34 assists in 65 games last season .
He has recorded 40 or more assists in five of the past six seasons and surpassed 50 points in the past six consecutive seasons .
" For us it 's been an exciting day , an exciting couple of days .
After spending 14 years in Montreal and not experiencing anything else in the NHL , it 's the first time for me to become a free agent , " Koivu said .
" When that happens , there 's a lot of question marks and you do n't know for sure what 's going to happen and where you 're going to end up .
" Now that today we 've signed with Anaheim , I can tell you , and my family and I are extremely happy , we 're extremely excited about the new challenge and if it was up to me I 'd like to start the season next week . "

Faith is more basic than language or theology .
Faith is the response to something which is calling us from the timeless part of our reality .
Faith may be encouraged by what has happened in the past , or what is thought to have happened in the past , but the only proof of it is in the future .
Scriptures and creeds may come to seem incredible , but faith will still go dancing on .

So many people have been asking how I managed to write a book that I ’m starting to wonder whether I should be feeling a little insulted .
Yeah okay , so I produced something that someone , in a moment of either extraordinary generosity or extraordinary folly , decided to publish .
But me succeeding in releasing a book is n’t , like , one of the seven signs of the Apocalypse or anything .
Or at least I hope it is n’t – WikiAnswers is worryingly inconclusive on the subject .
The question has been particularly popular with people who know me well , which is no surprise really – my most outstanding talent is generally agreed to be procrastination .
So I guess it is a bit of a surprise that someone who is n’t able to complete a tax return on time might have a bit of difficulty completing 70,000 words which , when read consecutively , make at least some degree of sense .
The reason people ask , of course , is that like running , singing and laughing at Peter André and Jordan , writing is one of those things that we ’ve all done a bit of ourselves .
I know for certain I have n’t got a Nobel Prize - winning theorem in me , or a shot at the Tour de France , but like most people who enjoy reading books , I ’d always wondered about writing one .
Actually , the answer of how I did it is simple .
I enrolled in a creative writing Masters at UTS , and did a bunch of courses , after which I ’d written about 60,000 words .
After all that work , it was n’t that much more strenuous to polish it up into a first draft , which I sent to publishers .
But of course that ’s not the answer people want to hear .
I remember , because the question used to absolutely fascinate me way back in my B.N. , or Before Novelist period .
And yes , I know this sounds a bit patronising , but hell , I just wrote 70,000 words that some people , at least in my immediate family , have actually bought – I ’ve a right to be slightly smug .
The answer people want to hear is the one that explains a great mystery – how on earth you actually discipline yourself to do all that writing .
A Masters deadline helps , but it does n’t explain how you actually do the assigments .
The thought of writing all those words sounds to most people like a quirky variant of waterboarding where your clothes stay dry .
And even after I ’d written the first 6000 words of my novel , for an assignment , the prospect of pushing it up to 70,000 seemed more painful a prospect than hammering rusty nails into the soles of one ’s feet , or doing the publicity for Dick Cheney ’s forthcoming autobiography .
But during my Masters , one of the things we learned us was how other people do it .
Authors love nothing more than writing pieces explaining how they write , and we read dozens of them while I was studying .
Every author has their own approach , which they insist is the definitive solution which all wannabe writers must adopt .
And the hilarious thing is , every writer is utterly different .
Some exhaustively plan their novels , and write full , detailed biographies for every character , while some let them flow spontaneously from their subconscious .
Some rouse themselves at 4 am each morning and perform callisthenics before settling in , while others burn the midnight oil .
Some writers plough through all day , some stop when they ’ve hit a specific target .
There really is no secret .
To cite some famous examples , JK Rowling writes in an Edinburgh Starbucks , which is n’t something I could possibly recommend because it ’s hard to concentrate when you ’re gagging on terrible coffee .
While Roald Dahl had a shed in his garden in which he would always have exactly six sharpened yellow pencils , which sounds more like a basis for diagnosing obsessive compulsive disorder than a surefire technique that should be adopted by other writers .
Every aspiring writer wants to know how they can actually make themselves do the work .
The glib answer is that you have to have self - discipline .
But frankly , I do n’t .
So I essentially tricked myself into writing the novel .
See , I hate working , but I love cafés .
Knowing this , I would take myself off to my favorite café , and sit there for an hour or two , having a coffee .
I get bored easily , so to avoid the tedium of my own company , I ’d pull out my laptop ( with no internet or games on it – that ’s essential ! ) and write .
And once I actually started tapping away , I found it fairly easy to concentrate , and I would n’t let myself go home until I ’d written 1000 words , and edited the last 1000 words I wrote .
( I ’m lucky to write fast , but if you set your own target at 250 words a day , that ’ll still work . )
I also had an incentive scheme where once I ’d finished , I gave myself a reward .
Sometimes it was an arcade game if there was one near the café , sometimes a bit of browsing in a music store , and sometimes even a gelato .
Yeah , it was really literary .
But the biggest reward was that , to my surprise , I really , really enjoyed doing the writing .
It made me feel like , well , a real writer , like I ’d always dreamed of being .
Sometimes I ’d work in a bookshop café , like the one at Kinokuniya or Berkelouw ’s in Paddington , and imagine what it would be like to see my work on the shelves around me .
In other words , I ’d daydream – but it worked as an incentive .
So if you want to know how other writers do it , you ’re actually asking the wrong question , in my opinion .
What you need to ask yourself is how can you make yourself write .
No - one else can answer that for you .
For me , it took deadlines imposed by a university course that was so expensive that I simply would n’t let myself drop out – and most importantly , yielding to my own personality .
That is , I ended up working with my flaws rather than trying to overcome them .
I would love to get up at dawn and write every morning , right after I go to the gym for an hour and bake fresh crusty bread rolls for the homeless .
But the fact is , I never will .
So I made writing a pleasurable activity , and before I knew it , I ’d written a whole book .
There is one downside to this .
I ’ve now carefully trained myself only to work in cafés – in any other environment , I will simply procrastinate .
And to be honest , the café habit is getting expensive , and I ’m doubtlessly eating way too much gelato .
Still , at least I ’ve found a way to make myself do the work .
And as my friends will tell you , that ’s something of a miracle .
In all honesty , I can hardly believe I did it either .
Perhaps it is one of the signs of the Apocalypse after all ?

A noted Firefox contributor called the situation " self - inflicted , " and said it was likely that the hacker who posted public exploit code Monday became aware of the flaw by rooting through Bugzilla , Mozilla 's bug - and change - tracking database .
( See our introduction to the new version . )
The vulnerability is in the TraceMonkey JavaScript engine that debuted with Firefox 3.5 , said Mozilla . " [ It ] can be exploited by an attacker who tricks a victim into viewing a malicious Web page containing the exploit code , " the company 's security blog reported Tuesday .
Secunia , a Danish security company , rated the bug " highly critical , " the second - highest threat ranking in its five - step system , and added that the vulnerability is in TraceMonkey 's processing of JavaScript code handling " font " HTML tags .
Older versions of Firefox , including Firefox 3.0 , are not vulnerable , according to a message posted by Asa Dotzler , Mozilla 's director of community development , in a comment to the company 's blog .
" Mozilla developers are working on a fix for this issue and a Firefox security update will be sent out as soon as the fix is completed and tested , " said that same blog .
In lieu of a patch , users can protect themselves by disabling the " just - in - time " component of the TraceMonkey engine .
To do that , users should enter " about : config " in Firefox 's address bar , type " jit " in the filter box , then double - click the " javascript.options.jit.content " entry to set the value to " false . "
The popular NoScript add - on will also ward off attacks .
The hacker who published exploit code on the milw0rm.com malware site Monday was not the first to uncover the vulnerability : Mozilla developers first noted the flaw last Thursday , and were in the middle of working on it when the attack code appeared .
" Looking at the exploit code and our test cases , I think this is self - inflicted and we should have hidden the bug earlier , " argued Andreas Gal on Bugzilla .
Gal is a project scientist at the University of California , Irvine , where the technique called " trace trees " was developed .
Firefox 3.5's TraceMonkey engine is based on that technique , and builds on code and ideas shared with the open - source Tamarin Tracing project .
Another contributor agreed .
" It would seem that the milw0rm exploit code is based on the test cases for this bug , " said someone identified only as " WD " in the same Bugzilla thread .
" When you look at the crash details in a debugger , it 's pretty clear that it 's exploitable with a heap spray to the access violation address in question . "
The fix has been slated for Firefox 3.5.1 , a fast - track update originally scheduled to release in the last two weeks of this month .
That update will be accelerated to plug the just - gone- public hole , said Daniel Veditz , a security lead at Mozilla .
" [ The bug ] was checked in yesterday , a few hours before we learned of the milw0rm posting , " Veditz said Tuesday night in a comment on the Mozilla security blog .
" This fix was going to be in the 3.5. x update we had scheduled for the end of July , but obviously now we have moved up the schedule for release . "
Mozilla launched Firefox 3.5 on June 30 .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Hundreds of Pakistani residents have taken up arms and are battling local Taliban militants in the wake of a deadly mosque attack last week .
A Pakistani police stands guard at a checkpoint in Peshawar , Pakistan on June 8 .
It is the first major battle between the residents of northwest Pakistan and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan border .
The residents are outraged over a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers that killed at least 40 people and wounded some 80 others .
Starting on Saturday morning , some 400 villagers in the Upper Dir district formed a " lashkar " -- or militia -- to fight the Taliban , killing 14 of the militants as of Sunday evening , according to local administrator Atiq Ur Rehman .
Four of the villagers have been injured in the battle , Rehman said .
The militia have burned a number of houses thought to be sheltering the militants , according to Upper Dir police chief Ijaz Kahn .
Both the residents and Taliban fighters are using heavy weapons , including rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons , Rehman said .
There is a long history of Taliban presence in the area , including foreign fighters in leadership roles , local officials said .
Authorities said Taliban fighters were driven out of Shot Ghas and Ghazigay -- two villages where the Taliban have support .
The villagers took up arms against the Taliban after Friday 's suicide attack at a mosque in Hayagay Sharqi -- a village in Upper Dir located about 35 km ( 22 miles ) from the Afghan border and known for being against the Taliban .
Upper Dir is a part of the Swat Valley , where the Pakistani military has waged a month - long operation against Taliban militants , but the district has not been part of the ongoing military offensive .
The United Nations has said an estimated 2 million Pakistanis have been displaced by fighting between the Pakistani military and Taliban militants .
The militants threatened to continue attacking cities in Pakistan until the military ends its operations against Taliban militants .
As a result , Pakistani authorities have increased security in Islamabad , Pakistan 's capital city .

Germany is on the verge of censoring its Internet :
The government – a grand coalition between the German social democrats and conservative party – seems united in its decision :
On Thursday the parliament is to vote on the erection of an internet censorship architecture .
The Minister for Family Affairs Ursula von der Leyen kicked off and lead the discussions within the German Federal Government to block Internet sites in order to fight child pornography .
The general idea is to build a censorship architecture enabling the government to block content containing child pornography .
The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation ( BKA ) is to administer the lists of sites to be blocked and the internet providers obliged to erect the secret censorship architecture for the government .
A strong and still growing network opposing these ideas quickly formed within the German internet community .
The protest has not been limited to hackers and digital activist but rather a mainstreamed effort widely supported by bloggers and twitter - users .
The HashTag used by the protesters is #zensursula – a German mesh up of the Ministers name and the word censorship equivalent to #censursula .
As part of the public ’s protest an official e-Petition directed at the German parliament was launched .
Within three days 50,000 persons signed the petition – – the number required for the petition titled „ No indexing and blocking of Internet sites “ to be heard by the parliament .
The running time of an e-Petition in Germany is 6 weeks – within this time over 130,000 people signed making this e-Petition the most signed and most successful ever .
During the past weeks , protests became more and more creative – countless blogs and twitter - users followed and commented the discussions within governments and opposing arguments .
Many mainstream media picked up on this and reported about the protest taking place on - line .
A working group on censorship was founded and the protest coordinated with a wiki , mailing lists , chats and of course employing twitter and blogs .
One website „ Zeichnemit.de “ created a landing page explaining the complicated petitioning system and making signing the petition easier and more accessible for non net - experts .
Over 500 people attended the governments official press conference on the planed internet censorship – a number of whom used this occasion to demonstrate and voice their concerns .
In fact , demonstrators began attending some of the Minister von der Leyens public appearances , carrying banners and signs to raise attention to the stifling of information freedom in Germany .
The net community did not only oppose the governments plans , but also made constructive suggestions how to deal with the problem of child pornography without introducing a censorship architecture and circumcising constitutional freedoms .
The working group on censorship demonstrated the alternatives for instance by actually removing over 60 websites containing child pornographic content in 12 hours , simply by emailing the international providers who then removed this content from the net .
The sites were identified through the black lists of other countries documented on Wikileaks .
This demonstration underlines the protesters main arguments : instead of effectively investing time and efforts to have illegal content removed from the internet , the German government is choosing censorship and blocking – an easy and dangerous way out .
The greatest fear of the protesters is that once in place , the infrastructure will be used to censor other forms of unwanted content , not only child pornography .
German politicians already seem to be lining up with their wish - list of content to be censored in future – the suggestions ranging form gambling sites , islamist web pages , first person shooters , and the music industry cheering up with the thought of finally banning pirate bay and p2p .

( CNN ) -- President Obama poked fun at the travails of the Republican Party last weekend , telling the party 's chairman that no , the GOP does not qualify for a bailout , and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh does not count as a troubled asset .
RNC Chairman Michael Steele has been unexpectedly " freewheeling , " one CNN analyst says .
Though the president was just looking for a laugh at the annual White House Correspondents dinner , Republicans have a tough road ahead as they try to rehabilitate their party .
" When a party goes out of power so spectacularly as the Republicans have over the last couple of elections , it 's going to take a while for a leader to emerge , " said Candy Crowley , CNN 's senior political correspondent .
" And we should say that when a party is out of power , usually the leader emerges when they nominate their next presidential nominee . "
In recent weeks , the GOP has received more attention for a steady spout of infighting than it has for its message .
The latest matchup : Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele vs. Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor and a likely frontrunner for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination .
Steele cast doubt on Romney 's conservative credentials Friday and said the Republican base rejected Romney because " it had issues with Mormonism " and was unsure of Romney 's commitment to opposing to abortion rights .
Romney 's camp took issue with the suggestions that the most reliable Republican voters are intolerant and fired back Tuesday , with spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom saying , " Sometimes when you shoot from the hip , you miss the target . "
Watch more on Romney 's response »
Sen .
John McCain , Romney 's former rival for the presidential nomination , also stepped in to do damage control .
" I think the fact that Mitt Romney succeeded as much as he did and remains an important and central figure in our Republican Party -- and I would n't be surprised to see him run again -- is a testimony , I think , to the inclusiveness of the Republican Party , " said McCain , R - Arizona .
David Gergen , a CNN senior political analyst , said that based on the performance so far , he can't imagine Steele staying on as chairman a year from now .
" There 's a lot of buyer 's remorse , I think , within the Republican Party .
I do n't think they expected anyone quite this undisciplined and sort of freewheeling as he is .
He does shoot from the hip a lot , " Gergen said .
" Does this mean the Republican Party is down and out forever ?
No .
I think ... they 'll come back . "
Infighting is common among Democrats , he said , " but Republicans usually heed and remember Ronald Reagan 's 11th commandment .
And that is , ' Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican . '
" This party needs a chairman who can keep his mouth shut and try to keep peace , not one who throws oil on the flames , " he said .
Republicans have been burned by losses in recent elections as well as the Democrats ' accusation that they 've become " the party of no . "
In an effort to shine their image , GOP leaders kicked off an outreach campaign this month designed to connect the party heads with voters across the country .
Those involved in the initiative include Romney , McCain , former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour .
They are members of the " panel of experts " that reports back to Republican congressional leaders including Rep. Eric Cantor , Rep. John Boehner , Rep. Mike Pence , Sen. Mitch McConnell , Sen. Jon Kyl and Sen. Lamar Alexander .
Not to be left out , former Arkansas governor and likely 2012 contender Mike Huckabee blasted the group 's planned listening tour , writing in a column for Fox News that it was " hard to keep from laughing out loud . "
Huckabee called it sad that Jeb Bush thinks the party needs to move past Reagan and equally upsetting that " it does n't plan to listen much to the Republicans who became Republicans because they believe in the sanctity of life , traditional marriage and express support for the Second Amendment . "
Although some Republicans think the party can win with ideological purity , others argue that the key is not making the party purer ; it 's making it bigger .
" In a country of 300 million people , for one party to have a majority of the voters , you have to be , inherently , a coalition .
You have got to assemble a lot of different groups of people .
And not all of those groups of people will agree on every plank in the platform , " said Ed Gillespie , the former chairman of the Republican National Committee .
That split explains why the more moderate Romney sniffed when told that the more purely conservative Sarah Palin made Time magazine 's 100 most - influential people list .
" Was that the issue on the most beautiful people or the most influential people ? " he asked .
Party purity vs. the big tent also explains former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's observation that Limbaugh hurts Republicans , Limbaugh 's suggestion that Powell leave the party and former Vice President Dick Cheney 's statement that he thought Powell had already left the party .
The Republican Party will find its voice , Gergen said , but first and foremost , " they need ideas . "
Crowley said that at least in the case of Capitol Hill , a minority party generally comes back into power when the majority messes up .
" It 's cyclical .
Sometimes it takes decades .
Sometimes it takes a shorter time .
As far as the White House is concerned , in general , the American people tend to switch over from Republicans and Democrats .
Eight years of any one party in the White House tends to be a long time for the American people , " she said , adding that she thinks it will be a while before the GOP returns to a majority status on the Hill .
CNN 's Candy Crowley and Kristi Keck contributed to this report .

In the digital world , it ’s easier to tell a lie and get away with it .
That ’s good news for liars , but not so good for anyone being deceived .
Michael Woodworth , a forensic psychologist at UBC Okanagan studying deception in computer - mediated environments , says offering up a fib in person might make you provide certain signals that you ’re trying to deceive , but lying online avoids the physical cues that can give you away .
“ When people are interacting face to face , there is something called the ‘ motivational impairment effect , ’ where your body will give off some cues as you become more nervous and there ’s more at stake with your lie , ” says Woodworth .
“ In a computer - mediated environment , the exact opposite occurs . ”
The motivational enhancement effect – a term coined by Woodworth and colleague Jeff Hancock from Cornell University – describes how people motivated to lie in a computer - mediated environment are not only less likely to be detected , they are also actually better at being deceptive than people who are less motivated .
When telling a lie face - to - face , the higher the stakes of your deception , the more cues you may give out that you ’re lying .
So , what is n’t in a text message may have advantages for a would - be deceiver : text does n’t transmit non-verbal cues such as vocal properties , physical gestures , and facial expressions .
Woodworth ’s research is very timely as technology and deceptive practices converge .

“ Deception is one of the most significant and pervasive social phenomena of our age , ” says Woodworth .
“ On average , people tell one to two lies a day , and these lies range from the trivial to the more serious .
Deception lies in communication between friends , family , colleagues and in power and politics . ”
Woodworth began his exploration by looking at how to detect deception in face - to - face environments .
But he soon recognized the invasion of information and communication technologies into nearly all aspects of our lives was an opportunity to study how technology affects “ digital deception ” – defined as any type of technologically mediated message transmitted to create a false belief in the receiver of the message .
“ Given the prevalence of both deception and communication technology in our personal and professional lives , an important set of concerns have emerged about how technology affects digital deception , ” says Woodworth .
He points out a growing number of individuals are falling prey to deceptive practices and information received through computer mediated contexts such as the Internet
“ By learning more about how various factors affect detecting deceit in online communication , our research will certainly have important implications in organizational contexts , both legal and illegal , in the political domain , and in family life as more and more children go online . ”
Common threads detected in psychopath texts
Michael Woodworth ’s research at UBC Okanagan goes beyond deception .
He also studies the personality disorder of psychopathy , looking at what secrets can be gleaned from the language used by psychopaths who have killed .

After interviewing dozens of psychopaths and non-psychopaths convicted of murder , Woodworth and colleagues used electronic linguistics analysis to automatically process the interview transcripts , paying attention to the appearance of certain words , parts of speech ( verbs , adjectives , nouns ) , and semantics – for example , looking at how often certain topics came up .
The results were revealing .
“ In the transcripts of psychopathic offenders , we found twice as many terms related to eating , and 58 per cent more references to money , ” says Woodworth .
“ And the psychopaths were significantly more likely to discuss both clothing and drinking while discussing their homicide , compared to non-psychopathic offenders . ”
Woodworth has now teamed with noted forensic psychologist and deception researcher Stephen Porter , who joined UBC Okanagan from Dalhousie University last summer , and fellow forensic psychologist Jan Cioe to build a multi- disciplinary forensic science graduate program and research centre at UBC Okanagan .
Bringing together prominent forensic psychologists will benefit both the academic and wider communities , says Woodworth .
“ In the back of my mind I ’m always thinking ‘ how is this going to potentially have some applied value ? ’ whether it be the community in general , or specifically for law enforcement , or by furthering our knowledge within a certain area , ” he says .
“ All of these applications ultimately assist with both assessment and treatment . ”

Maybe the most alarming development of the 21st century -- other than reality TV shows , Freddie Prinze Jr , bobble - head dolls and the fact that some females actually identify with the dysfunctional characters on " Sex and the City " -- has been the declining standards of etiquette in our society .
Do n't worry :
You 're sitting right behind this guy .
Whether it 's Little League parents , inconsiderate cell phoners , road rage , air rage , gabbing in movie theaters , unprovoked assaults , venom - spewing spectators or whatever else , everyone just seems to be bugging everyone else .
Of course , there is n't a livelier venue for dissension than a summer baseball game .
It 's sticky and uncomfortable .
And expensive .
Fans are crammed into every crevice of the park .
Passions are running high .
People are drinking .
And since every social group is represented , you have a number ofat the game .
Let the peeving begin !
With that in mind , here 's one man 's list of the " 20 Most Annoying Fans at a Baseball Game " :
Honorable Mentions
The guy who buys a souvenir bat before the game and spends the whole game tapping it against the floor and / or your seat .
The guy who keeps swearing in a section filled with kids .
The guy who 's dipping Skoal and spitting juice on the floor .
The fat guy who leans over the wall trying to get a rolling foul ball and inadvertently exposes his butt crack .
The guy wearing a replica jersey with his own name on the back .
The guy sitting in the section directly behind the home team 's dugout who believes that every 1 - 2 - 3 inning by a veteran pitcher deserves a standing ovation .
The guy who throws half - used mustard packets in the aisle so everyone can step on them .
The guy who runs out on the field .
The guy who runs on the field : a time - honored tradition that wo n't go away .
The sweaty , uncomfortable guy who 's too big to be sitting in the tiny seat next to you .
The drunken guy at Fenway who 's watching the Red Sox lose to Tampa Bay by eight runs and suddenly tries to get a " Yankees Suck ! " chant going .
The guy who gets mustard all over himself and does n't realize it .
The awkward teenager who makes bad jokes and holds a sign up all game , usually during key at - bats .

The guy in the bleachers who tries to start the Wave , then gets belligerent when everyone ignores him .
The guy who thinks he 's a baseball scout .
The guy who makes a mosh pit - style leap into a crowd of people vying for a foul ball .
The guy who carries in his 8 - year - old even though he only has one ticket .
The guy sitting 400 feet away from home plate who yells at umpires and opposing players and actually thinks they can hear him .
And now , on to the top 20 , in reverse order ( with No. 1 being the worst ) : The Top 20
20 .
The guy who yells lame insults at the plate umpire
If you 're going to heckle , make sure you use some original material .
Advice for aspiring hecklers out there : anything over seven words is bound for failure .
Just trust me on this one .
19 .
The guy who thinks everyone 's looking at his girlfriend
Of course , she 's dressed in one of those Britney Spears outfits , she 's chewing gum and she looks easier than Lacey Underall , but that 's beside the point .
This guy does not want you looking at her .
And even though she gets up every inning and takes her sweet time shaking her buns up and down the aisle , he 's glancing around with one of those " DeNiro in Taxi Driver " glares on his face .
You lookin ' at her ?
You lookin ' at her ?
You lookin ' at her ?
18 .
The mother who suddenly decides that she needs to get a picture of her family during the middle of an inning
Bonus points here if she 's clueless enough to ask somebody else in the section to take the picture .
The best part is seeing the beaten - down father and his humiliated children posing for the picture and praying they wo n't get hit by a projectile soda .
17 .
The guy wearing a replica jersey of someone who is n't on the team anymore
Ca n't Sally Struthers film another informercial so we can donate updated jerseys for these fans ?
It 's one thing if you 're wearing an authentic jersey or a game - worn jersey ... but one of those flimsy replica jerseys ?
Two weeks ago at Fenway , I actually noticed someone wearing a blue , " ( Mo ) Vaughn , No. 42 " Red Sox practice jersey .
Swear to God.
Apparently his " Greenwell , No. 39 " jersey was at the cleaners .
16 .
The father who keeps badgering the ballboy to give his kid a baseball
Once a player is traded away from your team , you can throw out his replica jersey .
One mitigating factor here : the little - known baseball rule that all ballboys have to be as spastic , unathletic and awkward - looking as possible .
It 's always fun to watch them interacting with the overbearing parents , is n't it ?
15 .
The guy sitting in crappy seats who 's living in denial
You 're sitting along the right - field line at Fenway during a day game , you 're baking in the sun like a fried egg , you can barely see home plate and the temperature in your scrotal region is about 275 degrees ... and the game has n't even started yet .
And yet the fool sitting next to you is telling his buddy , " Great seats , huh ?
I got these from work .
You get a great view of the whole ballpark .
And you get a great view of anything down the right field line .
I love these seats ... "
14 .
The guy who needs to pronounce every Latin player 's name correctly
We hear this at Fenway all the time -- the know - it - all American who rolls his R's and uses the Latino pronounciations of " Pedro " or " Arrojo " when shouting out the names of those respective players ( " Come on , Pey - drrrrrrrroh ! " ) .
These tend to be the same guys who turn around and correct you when you unknowingly screw up a fact -- like if you 're discussing Pedro with a friend and you say , " Hell , the guy 's won four Cy Young Awards ! " and the guy turns around and says , " Actually , he 's only won three . "
13 .
The guy with premium seats along the first - base side who brings his kids so they can get struck by a line drive
In all seriousness , this should be considered a criminal offense .
When you 're sitting that close -- especially along the first - base line between the home dugout and home plate -- you have to be prepared for foul balls from right - handed hitters ( usually on checked swings ) that scream into the stands at about 300 mph .
Be very careful if you 're a kid sitting along the first - base line .
Anyway , if you put your children in danger at a baseball game , shame on you .
( Note : I 'm not really that upset .
I just wanted to work the condescending sports columnist phrase " Shame on you " into one of my postings .
Big day for me -- I feel like a genuine columnist now .
As Jim Nantz would say , " What a moment ! " ) 12 .
The guy sitting in a luxury box who butchers an easy foul ball
And it 's always an easy foul ball , yet this guy has 10 thumbs and can't haul it in .
Bonus points here when the crowd starts booing him and the guy looks out with that condescending smile that says , " I might have botched that one , but I 'm sitting in a luxury box and I 'm making more money than all of you . "
Then he takes a swig from his $ 7 premium drink .
I hate that guy .
11 . The guy sitting near the visiting on - deck circle who yells unfunny insults at every on - deck batter
Usually , it 's a mild - mannered guy who turns into Shecky Greene after enough beer ... unfortunately , he 's not funny and producing insults like " Hey , Jeter , where 's Mariah ? " and " Hey , Alomar , spit on anyone lately ? " and bombing worse than Andrew Dice Clay at the 1988 MTV Video Awards .
Every time I sit near someone like this , I 'm always angry that I forgot to bring my laugh track .
Brief intermission
Speaking of heckling , it 's time for a brief intermission before we hit the Top 10 !
Time for a story from your buddy , Sports Guy .
As Vin Scully would say , pull up a chair ...
My most memorable heckling incident at a baseball game happened back in the late - '80s , when former major - league star Frank Howard was coaching first base for the Yanks .
I was sitting at Yankee Stadium with my buddies Bish and Jim ; thanks to Bish 's Dad , we were in the first row to the right of the Yankees dugout , inches from the field , about 25 feet away from the first - base bag .
Three things you should know about coach Frank at the time : 1 . ) he was an enormous guy , probably about 6 - foot - 7 ; 2 . ) his nickname during his playing days was " Hondo " ; and 3 . ) during every at - bat , he would lean forward , stick his hands on his knees and stick his butt out .
So if you were sitting in our section , basically you were looking at Frank 's giant butt all game .
Not good times .
Bad times .
After a few innings and a few beers , we beat every possible joke about Frank into the ground , but lacked the guts to heckle him ( given that he was 6 - foot - 7 and all ) .
He jogged out for the eighth inning -- last ups for the Yankees , since they were running away with the game -- and it was pretty quiet at Yankee Stadium .
Quiet enough for a piercing heckle , anyway .
You might want to keep an eye out for flying objects ... like bats !
Until I shouted out , " Hey , Hondo ... NICE ASS ! " Brought the house down .
Everyone in our section started giggling and poor Frank jolted up straight as if he'd been shot .
You really had to be there .
Probably my proudest heckling moment other than the time I yelled " Magic carried you ! " and " You never won a ring without Magic ! " at Pat Riley for four straight quarters of a Heat - Celtics game in Boston last year .
All right , the pilot just turned back on the " No Babbling " sign .
Back to the column ...
The Top 10
10 .
The guy who keeps score and keeps telling you about it
Hey , it 's OK to keep score ; everyone has that one friend who keeps score at a game ( mine is Nick Aieta ) .
But sometimes you have that guy in your section who 's a little too fired up about keeping score -- he 's hovering over his scoresheet like a weeble , he 's making hieroglyphic notations next to every batter and he 's offering everyone around him tidbits like , " Here comes Bonds ... he 's 2 - for - 4 today with six total bases . "
Needless to say , there is n't a woman sitting on either side of him .
Go figure .
9 . The guy with the giant head
Somehow this guy always seems to be sitting precisely between you and home plate , so you spend the entire game peering around his gigantic , watermelon head .
An absolute game - killer .
Plus you end up getting distracted by the sheer size of the head ; you just keep staring at it and fighting off the urge to imitate the Scottish grandfather from " So I Married an Ax Murderer " :
If you get seated behind the guys with the big heads , you might as well go home and watch it on TV .
8 . The loud guy rooting for the other team
We 've all cheered our team in an enemy ballpark , but there 's a difference between supporting the visitors and antagonizing the home fans , is n't there ?
The Loud Guy usually wears some form of opposing paraphernalia ( usually a hat , sometimes a jersey , if he 's feeling ballsy ) , shouts out inane nicknames for his players , claps his hands obnoxiously and does everything possible to annoy people in his section .
He thrives on it .
But there 's a fun little catch ...
When something positive happens for his team , the Loud Guy will inevitably stand up , turn around with his back to the field , point to his hat / shirt and scream , " Yeahhhhhhhhhh ! " to everyone sitting behind him .
And if he tries this at the wrong ballpark , he inevitably gets something chucked at him -- a drink , a half - eaten hot dog covered in mustard , maybe even a right hook .
What goes around comes around .
7 b .
The guy who 's just getting bombed
Some warning signs : 1 . ) he 's usually a high school senior or college freshman who has n't really figured out the whole drinking thing yet ; 2 . ) he 's usually the shortest guy in his group ; 3 . ) every two innings he hops up for another round ; 4 . ) he always returns to his seat carrying two beers and spilling them all over the place ; 5 . ) he enters some sort of catatonic , glazed trance by the sixth inning ; 6 . ) he becomes a legitimate " Heads up , that dude looks like he might puke " candidate by the seventh inning stretch .
( And lemme tell you something ... there is nothing worse than somebody blowing chunks at a baseball game .
That 's a savvy way to clear out an entire section if you 're gunning for a foul ball and hoping to increase your odds . )

The drunken , belligerent guys
Distant cousins of The Guy Who 's Just Getting Bombed , these guys are prepared to offend everyone within a 100 - foot vicinity .
They 'll hoot at your girlfriend .
They 'll drop random F - bombs .
They 'll spill beer on you .
They 'll threaten the lives of anyone who roots for the other team .
They 'll light cigarettes even as the scoreboard says , " No Smoking . "
Basically they 're paying a nine - inning homage to the Hells Angels during that Rolling Stones ' Altamont performance in 1970 .
Two side benefits to The Drunken Belligerent Guys :
They always get thrown out at some point .
With the Battle of Parma Ham not two months over the nation is facing an even more audacious claim .
As British as chicken tikka masala
It 's so British the court of Richard II was making it in the 14th Century and most likely serving it up to ravenous knights in oak - panelled banqueting halls .
The claim has been made by researchers studying a medieval cookbook , The Forme of Cury , in the British Museum .
A spokesman for the Berkeley Castle medieval festival , with whom the experts were working , said : " I defy anyone to disprove it because it appeared in the first cookery book ever written . "
Recipe for disaster
It is not known whether he has dared put the claim to outspoken Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi .
But the Italian embassy in London reportedly responded : " Whatever this old dish was called , it was not lasagne as we make it . "
I think it must have been the Romans who brought it over
Restaurateur Antonio Piscopo
" I think it 's rubbish .
I think it must have been the Romans who brought it over .
It is definitely Italian . "
The recipe does not mention meat - a staple of a good lasagne .
And such an early use of tomatoes in food would have had medieval cooks spluttering into their espressos .
But it does describe making a base of pasta and laying cheese over the top .
It calls this " loseyns " , which is apparently pronounced " lasan " , although it fails to mention whether it should be followed with a sweet tiramasu and a glass of Amaretto .
Pasta faded from the British diet when potatoes arrived , according to the researchers .
The hearty roast dinner soon swept all before it .
Ham - fisted
Britain would be well advised not to make a meal of the claim , because Italy 's track record on food fights is impressive .
Take flour of paynedemayn and make erof past with water and make erof thynne foyles as paper with a roller ; drye it harde and see it in broth
British lasagne recipe
European judges ruled the ham must be packed and sliced in Parma itself to be marketed under its name of origin .
And last year Parmesan producers won protection from European rivals that had been using their name .
Authentic Parmesan must come from the banks of the Po .
But despite its winning streak , Italy will not fancy many more claims to its gourmet prowess .
If you throw enough pasta , some of it will stick .
Well , if it 's been cooked properly .
CNN and other Western media outlets have aired “ unverified material ” obtained from websites like Facebook and YouTube in their non-stop coverage of demonstrations in Iran .
US
The US media often celebrate themselves as the “ freest and fairest ” in the world , completely independent of a state unlike , for example , the media in Iran .
Yet , an astute observer will notice that the US media generally choose stories and cover them in a way that play directly into the US ’s global agenda .
Who decides whether or not a particular issue is “ newsworthy ? ”
One would think that this is the role of the media , to cover issues like conflict or rights abuses as they happen around the world .
Although , it seems this is n’t the case .
Most Western media appear to follow their government ’s lead when focusing on different issues and then cover them in a way fitting with the government ’s position , hence the complete domination of events in Iran in nearly every single Western media outlet and the overwhelmingly positive portrayal of the protestors and the opposition as just .
The current case of Iran makes it clear that it is governments who are directing the media ’s coverage , instead of the actual news organizations themselves .
There was also a noticeable shift in the US media ’s coverage of foreign affairs after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Soon after , then President George Bush ’s rule of “ with us or against us ” was applied to all , and media outlets and individuals critical of American foreign policy were immediately demonized and labeled “ unpatriotic ” or “ anti-American . ”
To counter such charges , it became common for American television journalists to prove their patriotism and loyalty by wearing American - flag lapel pins .
These reasons explain why over recent weeks while the Iran elections were happening there has been virtually no coverage in most media of demonstrations numbering in the tens of thousands in Georgia or Peru .
It has even been reported in Peru that dozens of persons have been killed during the protests , or “ clashes ” as they ’ve also been labeled ( since more than a dozen police have also been killed ) , more than the reported number killed in Iran .
Why are protests in Iran receiving more attention than those in other places ?
One logical explanation is that the Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili is a key ally of the US and NATO .
Thus , the West and its media have remained largely silent about the opposition protests to not give them attention that would likely inspire the demonstrations to continue and grow , undoubtedly weakening the Saakashvili government .
Meanwhile , the situation in Latin America is particularly sensitive .
Coverage of protests by indigenous groups and their supporters in Peru might further embolden these efforts and expose the unjust policies of recent Free Trade Agreements with the US and perhaps lead that country down a path like the increasingly popular governments of Venezuela or Bolivia .
Of course , both nations are seen as “ anti- American ” for their critical positions regarding US intervention in Latin America .
However , Iran is different than both Georgia and Peru .
Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad has probably overtaken Osama Bin Laden as the most hated individual in the US .
Over the past several years , many officials in Washington have called for more aggressive actions to be taken against Iran .
More recently , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave US President Barack Obama an ultimatum that the US president better take care of Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program , or else Israel would .
It ’s no coincidence then that the protests in Iran are receiving around - the - clock media coverage and are also one of the only examples in recent years where US government officials have showed support for demonstrators like Obama did when he called on Iran to “ stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . ”
They are certainly not the only protests that have been met with violent government repression .
For years , Palestinians have organized weekly nonviolent demonstrations against Israel ’s wall in the West Bank .
Each week protestors face the heavily - armed Israeli military and are beaten and shot at with rubber - coated steel bullets and tear - gas canisters , sometimes fatally .
Yet , during his recent speech in Cairo to the Muslim world , Obama made no reference to these protests and instead called on Palestinians to “ abandon violence ” and adopt nonviolent means .
Days after the speech a Palestinian was killed and a teenager wounded during the weekly protest , yet there has been no call by the US administration for Israel to “ stop all violent and unjust actions ” against the Palestinian people .
And the media has followed and remained silent , even though covering the demonstrations would be as easy as a 30 - minute drive from most Jerusalem - based news bureaus on any given Friday .
Furthermore , at the height of the Bush Administration ’s call for “ democracy ” in the Middle East , an indigenous democratic movement arose in Egypt to challenge the corruption and failed economic policies of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
Comprised of workers who organized unprecedented strikes for four years that grew in number with each successive rally , the demonstrations received little coverage in the US .
An odd occurrence , considering the duration of the strikes and the size of the protests , which a number of observers believe had the potential to lead to something much bigger in Egypt , perhaps even a “ revolution . ”
The lack of media coverage of these events can only be explained by the relationship between the US and Egypt .
Mubarak , who has governed Egypt for nearly three decades , is often referred to as a dictator for his repression of opposition political figures and journalists critical of his government .
Yet , he remains one of the most important US allies in the Middle East , so “ violent and unjust actions ” against Egyptians are tolerated by the West .
Similarly , during Israel ’s three - week assault on Gaza this past winter , there were massive and unprecedented demonstrations across the Middle East in support of Palestinians in the besieged territory .
Again , these received minor if any mention , likely because it challenged the media and Washington ’s narrative that Israel was “ fighting Hamas . ”
Also in accordance with that narrative , there was scant footage broadcast in the Western media from inside Gaza .
Similar to what Iran is doing now , Israel banned journalists from entering Gaza during the attacks .
Despite this , there were large Arabic - language satellite stations like Al - Jazeera reporting from the ground with footage of nearly everything that was happening there .
When images were shown by CNN or its competitors , it was generally not true to the real horror faced by Palestinians in Gaza .
I ca n’t recall seeing one video of one of the hundreds of children killed in Gaza shown in the US media .
In contrast , two days ago CNN broadcasted footage of a woman who was shot and bleeding to death on a Tehran street .
Most of these viral videos are taken on citizens ’ mobile phones , and they even have a special logo that CNN has created for the “ unverified material . ”
But there is plenty of “ verified material ” showing violent images from the Middle East and many other places around the world in recent days , weeks , years that has never been shown .
Videos and testimonials are readily available on YouTube , Facebook , Twitter , waiting , indeed begging , for the US media to take notice .
But coverage of certain places might contradict US foreign policy there , something much of the media are proving unwilling to do .
If the elections and demonstrations in Iran have revealed anything , it is that there are undeniably huge divisions that will greatly affect the future of the country .
It ’s the individual ’s decision to choose which side he or she supports , if any .
And it ’s the responsibility of the media to be independent of the authorities and to present accurate information in context so that news consumers ’ judgments will be informed and not made based off the foreign policy of Western governments .
A free and independent media is an essential part of any democracy , and something that the West is proving more and more that it lacks .

Buried on page 83 of the 89 - page Report on Financial Regulatory Reform issued by the U.S. Administration on June 17 is a recommendation that the new Financial Stability Board strengthen and institutionalize its mandate to promote global financial stability .
Financial stability is a worthy goal , but the devil is in the details .
The new global Big Brother is based in the Bank for International Settlements , a controversial institution that raises red flags among the wary . . . .
“ Big Brother ” is the term used by George Orwell in his classic novel 1984 for the totalitarian state that would lock into place in the year of his title .
Why he chose that particular year is unclear , but one theory is that he was echoing Jack London ’s The Iron Heel , which chronicled the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States .
In London ’s book , the oligarchy ’s fictional wonder - city , fueled by oppressed workers , was to be completed by 1984 .
Orwell also echoed London ’s imagery when he described the future under Big Brother as “ a boot stamping on a human face – forever . ”
In Secret Records Revealed : The Men , the Money , and the Methods Behind the New World Order ( 1999 ) , Dr. Dennis Cuddy asked :
“ Could the ‘ boot ’ be the new eighteen - story Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) which was completed in Basel , Switzerland , in 1977 in the shape of a boot , and became known as the ‘Tower of Basel’ ? ”
The boot - like shape of the building is strange enough to be thought - provoking ( see photo ) , but more disturbing is the description by Dr. Carroll Quigley of the pivotal role assigned to the BIS in consolidating financial power into a few private hands .
Professor Quigley , who was Bill Clinton ’s mentor at Georgetown University , claimed to be an insider and evidently knew his subject .
He wrote in Tragedy and Hope ( 1966 ) :
“ [ T ] he powers of financial capitalism had another far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences .
The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations . ”
That helps explain the alarm bells that went off among BIS - watchers when the Bank was linked to the new Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) President Obama signed onto in April .
When the G20 leaders met in London on April 2 , 2009 , they agreed to expand the powers of the old Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) into this new Board .
The FSF was set up in 1999 to serve in a merely advisory capacity by the G7 ( a group of finance ministers formed from the seven major industrialized nations ) .
The chair of the FSF was the General Manager of the BIS .
The new FSB has been expanded to include all G20 members ( 19 nations plus the EU ) .
The G20 , formally called the “ Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors , ” was , like the G7 , originally set up as a forum merely for cooperation and consultation on matters pertaining to the international financial system .
But its new Financial Stability Board has real teeth , imposing “ obligations ” and “ commitments ” on its members .
The Shadowy Financial Stability Board
The Report on Financial Regulatory Reform issued by the Obama Administration on June 17 includes a recommendation that the FSB “ strengthen ” and “ institutionalize ” its mandate .
What is the FSB ’s mandate , what are its expanded powers , and who is in charge ?
An article in The London Guardian addresses those issues in question and answer format :
“ Who runs the regulator ?
The Financial Stability Forum is chaired by Mario Draghi , governor of the Bank of Italy .
The secretariat is based at the Bank for International Settlements ’ headquarters in Basel , Switzerland . ”
Draghi was director general of the Italian treasury from 1991 to 2001 , where he was responsible for widespread privatization ( sell - off of government holdings to private investors ) .
From January 2002 to January 2006 , however , he was a partner at Goldman Sachs on Wall Street , another controversial player .
As already noted , “ basing ” the FSB at the BIS is not a comforting sign , considering the dark and controversial history of the BIS .
Dr. Cuddy , writing in 1999 , quoted media sources describing the BIS and its behind - the - scenes leaders as “ this economic cabal . . . this secretive group . . . the financial barons who control the world ’s supply of money ” ( Washington Post , June 28 , 1998 ) ; “ some of the world ’s most powerful and least visible men . . . officials able to shift billions of dollars and alter the course of economies at the stroke of a pen ” ( New York Times , August 5 , 1995 ) ; men who can “ move huge amounts of money into and out of markets in a nanosecond ” and “ topple politicians with the click of a mouse ” ( ABC ’s “ Nightline , ” July 1 , 1998 ) .
“ What will the new regulator do ?
The regulator will monitor potential risks to the economy . . .
It will cooperate with the IMF , the Washington - based body that monitors countries ’ financial health , lending funds if needed .
. . . ”
The IMF is an international banking organization that is also controversial .
Joseph Stiglitz , former chief economist for the World Bank , charges it with ensnaring Third World countries in a debt trap from which they cannot escape .
Debtors unable to pay are bound by “ conditionalities ” that include a forced sell - off of national assets to private investors in order to service their loans .
“ What will the regulator oversee ?
All ‘ systemically important ’ financial institutions , instruments and markets . ”
The term “ systemically important ” is not defined .
Will it include such systemically important institutions as national treasuries , and such systemically important markets as gold , oil and food ?
“ How will it work ?
The body will establish a supervisory college to monitor each of the largest international financial services firms .
. . .
It will act as a clearing house for information - sharing and contingency planning for the benefit of its members . ”
In some contexts , information - sharing is called illegal collusion .
Would the information - sharing here include such things as secret agreements among central banks to buy or sell particular currencies , with the concomitant power to support or collapse targeted local economies ?
Consider the short - selling of the Mexican peso by collusive action in 1995 , the short - selling of Southeast Asian currencies in 1998 , and the collusion among central banks to support the U.S. dollar in July of last year – good for the dollar and the big players with inside information perhaps , but not so good for the small investors who reasonably bet on “ market forces , ” bought gold or foreign currencies , and lost their shirts .

WASHINGTON  Badly outnumbered and months behind in the debate on energy and climate change , House Republicans plan to introduce an energy bill on Wednesday as an alternative to the Democratic plan barreling toward a House vote this month .
The Republican proposal , drafted by a group led by Representative Mike Pence of Indiana , leans heavily on nuclear power , setting a goal of building 100 reactors over the next 20 years .
No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States since 1978 because of the high cost of construction and uncertainty about regulatory approval .
The bill also provides incentives for increased oil and gas production on public and private lands and offshore .
It would also authorize oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska , a focus of 30 years of controversy in Congress .
The Republican measure does not include any mandatory cap on emissions of heat - trapping gases , relying instead on nuclear energy , natural gas and renewable fuels like wind , solar and biomass power to reduce production of the gases , which have been linked to global warming .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s Defense Ministry said on Monday it had approved construction of 50 new homes at a West Bank settlement as part of a plan for 1,450 housing units , an expansion that defies a U.S. call for a settlement freeze .
News of the planned building work emerged hours before Defense Minister Ehud Barak left for the United States for talks aimed at narrowing a rift with Washington over settlements .
He will meet President Barack Obama ’s Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , in New York on Tuesday , Barak ’s office said .
An affidavit submitted by the Defense Ministry to the Supreme Court outlined plans to relocate settlers from Migron , an outpost built in the West Bank without Israeli government permission , to the settlement of Adam , north of Jerusalem .
According to the document , a response to a court case brought by the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now , a master plan for Adam calls for the construction of 1,450 homes there .
But the ministry said it had given the go - ahead for the construction of only 50 of the dwellings and any additional units would require its separate approval .
Separately , Israel went public with a plan to expropriate 139 sq. kms ( 54 sq. miles ) of West Bank land , including shoreline exposed by the receding Dead Sea , saying it would give Palestinians 45 days to contest the decision in court .
Hatem Abdel - Qader , Palestinian minister for Jerusalem affairs , denounced what he said would be “ the largest area of land ever confiscated by Israel in one go since 1967 , ” when the West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured from Jordan in a war .
STATEHOOD
Obama has pressed Israel to halt settlement activity as part of a bid to revive peace talks under which the Palestinians would gain statehood .
In a rare dispute between Israel and its main ally , the United States , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to declare a settlement freeze , saying some construction should continue to match population growth within the enclaves .
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Palestinians say settlements , deemed illegal by the World Court , could deny them a viable and contiguous state .
Underscoring tensions , Palestinians said settlers raided the West Bank village of Asira al - Qiblya , firing guns at the windows of buildings .
Two Palestinians were injured , said Ghasan Daghlas , an official in nearby Nablus , quoting the villagers .

An Israeli military spokesman quoted settlers as saying the incident began with a Palestinian arson attack on nearby Yitzhar settlement .
Settlers tried to douse the flames and were stoned by Palestinians , he said , adding that a settler was hurt .
The spokesman said he had no knowledge of live rounds being fired , saying troops called to quell the disturbance had used “ riot - dispersal gear ” -- usually a reference to rubber bullets .
In the West Bank city of Ramallah , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas reiterated his refusal to resume negotiations with Israel until it froze settlement .

“ We wo n’t accept the continuation of settlements , ” he said .
Abbas also urged Netanyahu to drop his conditions for the creation of a Palestinian state , which include international guarantees it would have no army and a demand the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state .
“ Israel should accept the two - state vision and not put conditions that would render the issue meaningless , ” Abbas said .
Barak left open the possibility of a limited , temporary halt to construction in settlements in comments he made on Sunday in response to an Israeli newspaper report that he would propose a three - month moratorium .
Barak has also spoken of couching a Palestinian deal within a wider Israeli - Arab peace accord .
A goal of the Israeli- U.S. negotiations is “ advancing a process for a comprehensive regional settlement in the Middle East , ” Barak ’s office quoted him as saying in a statement .
Peace Now said some 2,500 settlement homes are currently under construction in the West Bank .

Referenced : The Massachusetts Bar Association report http://drugsense.org/url/6YrE3Rdr
Bookmark : http://www.mapinc.org/find?199 ( Mandatory Minimum Sentencing ) REPORT CALLS FOR OVERHAUL OF DRUG CRIME POLICIES
The Massachusetts Bar Association , in a wide - ranging report released yesterday , called for the overhaul and reexamination of law enforcement efforts to combat drug use and the penalties nonviolent drug users face under current laws .
The report , titled " The Failure of the War on Drugs : Charting a New Course for the Commonwealth , " says its recommendations could save the state $ 25 million annually through reduced minimum sentencing and the parole of nonviolent drug offenders , according to a statement from the bar association .
The report calls drug policies obsolete .
" What appears to the task force as obsolete in state drug policy is the idea of using the criminal justice system to control what people consume , " it says .
The report points to four areas of widespread failure : the increase of arrests without the diminished use of illegal drugs , a disparate impact of drug laws on minority groups , economic effects for offenders looking for work with a criminal record , and high rates of recidivism .
In the short term , the report calls for reformulation of mandatory minimum sentences linked to drug crimes in school zones , diversion programs for nonviolent offenders with drug addiction , and more opportunities for work - release , parole , and " good conduct " credit .
Long - term goals include increasing addiction treatment programs , the reformulation of educational programs , and a better utilization of parole programs .
The task force was created in 2007 to study Massachusetts sentencing mandates and incarceration policies concerning drug addiction and related crimes committed by drug offenders .
The task force was composed of 33 area lawyers , law enforcement officials , members of the judiciary , mental health professionals , physicians , social workers , and public policy advocates .
Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea J. Cabral , a task force member , said in the bar association statement that the costs of dealing with the 2,500 inmates and pre-trial detainees in custody are unsustainable .
" Sheriffs have made great progress in creating programs that increase post - release opportunities and reduce recidivism , but we need much broader authority to properly classify eligible inmates to those programs , " Cabral said .

President Obama 's anti-settlement stance has , unsurprisingly , prompted an outpouring of wailing and teeth - gnashing among supporters of Israel 's irredentist policies .
His unequivocal demand for settlement expansion to come to a grinding halt has dominated headlines in both Israel and the diaspora , with many outraged by his assertion that " natural growth " of settlements be proscribed as well .
In his opponents ' eyes , to call for an end to natural growth is – as Charles Krauthammer put it – to " strangle to death the thriving towns close to the 1949 armistice line " , as though Obama 's views are as insidious as those of a serial killer hellbent on leaving a trail of corpses in his wake .
" It means no increase in population " , Krauthammer continues .
" Which means no babies .
Or if you have babies , no housing for them – not even within the existing town boundaries .
Which means for every child born , someone has to move out .
No community can survive like that " .
There 's no denying he has a point .
If more children are born than elderly residents die in a particular settlement , a dearth of accommodation will , in time , undermine the settlement 's ability to function as a living , breathing town .
Its pattern of natural expansion and contraction will be utterly usurped by external pressures that will crush the life from its lungs , with potentially terminal results .
So far , so bleak .
But what Krauthammer and his co-conspirators fail to point out is that Israel has for decades been implementing just such a restrictive policy against Palestinian towns and cities .
One way or another , the Israeli authorities have sucked the lifeblood out of the Palestinian people as a whole , refusing them any kind of opportunity for " natural growth " , cloaking their decision in a nebulous haze of security concerns for both regular Israelis and – of course – Israel 's legions of settlers dwelling illegally in the West Bank .
For years , settlers have been cosseted and coddled by both the heads of Israel 's parliament and military , who have reacted to their behaviour with a mixture of turning a blind eye and out - and - out complicity with their crimes .
The settlement enterprise could never have got off the ground without explicit support from the upper echelons of Israeli power .
Given Israel 's undisputed military might , to suggest that the settlers were too powerful to resist when they first set up shop in Judea and Samaria is a fallacy ; rather , their insistence on expropriating Palestinian land and " Judaising " the area played right into the hands of successive Israeli governments who needed the settlers ' physical presence to justify an occupation of the Palestinian territories .
Today , the Israeli authorities are reaping what they sowed .
The settler movement has spiralled out of control : the gun-toting residents of the wild West Bank have become a law unto themselves , who have no qualms about meting out threats and violence against Israeli security personnel if they do n't agree with decisions laid down by the state and enforced by the army .
The dismantling of settlement outposts engenders reprisals against both Israeli troops and Palestinian townsfolk ; religious fervour and nationalist rage combining to create a heady concoction in the minds of law - defying thugs who wo n't take no for an answer : not from Israeli politicians , not from Obama , not from anyone short of God Himself .
Meanwhile , the separation wall , the maze of checkpoints , the economic blockades , and all the other restrictions imposed on the Palestinian populace deny the original residents of the West Bank any chance of natural growth or development .
In East Jerusalem , communities are dying out in just the manner Krauthammer spells out – except that those affected are Arab rather than Jewish , so instead of speaking out against the situation , pundits and politicians alike sit back smugly and watch the devastating effects of their chokehold policies kick in .
The disaffection with Obama 's stance is not confined simply to those living illegally beyond the Green Line .
According to polls , over half of Israelis are " disappointed " with Obama 's policies .
Regarding settlements , 70 % called for removing outposts , but only 52 % were prepared to call for a freeze on growth in existing settlements – demonstrating just how deeply the " facts on the ground " element of the settlement enterprise has penetrated the collective Israeli psyche .
Settlements that began life as outposts – and that were n't " strangled at birth " – have now become too large to even consider dismantling , thus cementing their status as corners of a foreign land that must remain forever Israel .
Disregarding the fact that these settlements are key to the policy of denying natural growth to Palestinian communities , more than half of Israelis polled are prepared to overlook the negative impact of the settlements ' existence , so long as it's not their fellow Israeli citizens whose lives are affected as a result .
Whether Obama is able to live up to his strong statements in the coming months and years remains to be seen ; while he has certainly dispensed with previous administrations ' softly - softly approach towards Israel 's misdeeds , there is a long way to go to turn his words into actions .
In the interim , however , it is of great interest how the Israeli right cope with being given a taste of their own medicine : their howls of protest ring all too hollow , given their own dubious approach towards loving their neighbours over the preceding years .
Last week , the cities of Palo Alto , and East Palo Alto , experienced a horrific plane crash that took the lives of several executives from Tesla , caused damage to several houses in the area , and also was responsible for a power outage that lasted several hours in many parts of the two cities .
This power outage caused loss in productivity for many silicon valley companies , disrupted traffic , and interrupted medical care at Stanford Hospital .
While the loss of life in from the crash is tragic , the power outage serves an example of the extreme vulnerability of our electrical grid .
In addition to providing more efficient energy delivery that can connect to clean energy sources , a clean energy smart grid also provides security to our power delivery system .
In the report , “ Powering America ’s Defense : Energy and the Risks to National Security ” the CNA provides a report that gives examples of how the decreasing resiliency of the grid is a threat to many of the services that are vital to our national security .
The aging power grid is vulnerable to hackers , natural disasters , and terrorist organizations .
Power outages also cause loss of productivity for the American worker , and can be dangerous for those who are dependent on medical care that is dependent on electricity .
The 2003 power outage across the Northeast was estimated to cost between $ 7 and $ 10 billion in economic losses .
The smart grid will integrate telecommunication technologies into the power distribution system .
The integrated communication ability will enable the grid to heal itself and increase energy storage options .
Hopefully , we can take from this incident the importance to continue to push for the investment in America ’s Smart Grid .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A man fell into a vat of hot melted chocolate and died on Wednesday at a factory in New Jersey , a spokesman for the local public prosecutor said .
The 29 - year - old man was among four workers on a platform above the vat who were dumping in pieces of solid chocolate to be melted down , said Jason Laughlin , spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor ’s Office .
“ He somehow slipped and fell into the vat , ” Laughlin said .
“ Inside the vat , he was hit by a piece of equipment called the agitator that ’s used to stir , and that killed him . ”
Laughlin said the vat at the Cocoa Services Inc plant in Camden was around eight feet deep .
“ At this point there ’s no suggestion of foul play , ” Laughlin said , adding that the man appeared to have died instantly from the blow to the head from the agitator .

When President Obama was asked in March whether he thought legalizing marijuana could help solve the nation ’s financial problems , his answer was unequivocal .
“ No , I do n’t think that is a good strategy to grow our economy , ” he said .
But his response is unlikely to quell debate on an issue that polarizes Americans .
Even academic studies that purport to be unbiased arrive at very different conclusions .
Here are three viewpoints on why the country should or should not decriminalize the drug .
--
I ’m on the phone getting a recipe for hashish butter .
Not from my dealer but from Lester Grinspoon , a physician and emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
And not for a party but for my 9 - year - old son , who has autism , anxiety and digestive problems , all of which are helped by the analgesic and psychoactive properties of marijuana .
I would n’t be giving it to my child if I did n’t think it was safe .
I came to marijuana while searching for a safer alternative to the powerful antipsychotic drugs , such as Risperdal , that are typically prescribed for children with autism and other behavioral disorders .
There have been few studies on the long - term effects of these drugs on a growing child ’s brain , and in particular autism , a disorder whose biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood .
But there is much documentation of the risks , which has caused the Food and Drug Administration to require the highest - level “ black box ” warnings of possible side effects that include permanent Parkinson ’s disease - like tremors , metabolic disorders and death .
A panel of federal drug experts in 2008 urged physicians to use caution when prescribing these medicines to children , as they are the most susceptible to side effects .

We live in Rhode Island , one of more than a dozen states -- including California -- with medical marijuana laws .
That makes giving our son cannabis for a medical condition legal .
But we are limited in its use .
We can not take it on a plane on a visit to his grandmother in Minnesota .
Even though we are not breaking the law , I still wonder what my neighbors would think if they knew we were giving our son what most people only think of as an illegal “ recreational ” drug .
Marijuana has always carried that illicit tang of danger -- “ reefer madness ” and foreign drug cartels .
But in 1988 , Drug Enforcement Administration Judge Francis L. Young , after two years of hearings , deemed marijuana “ one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man .
Beyond helping people like my son , the reasons to legalize cannabis on a federal level are manifold .
Anecdotal evidence from patients already attests to its pain - relieving properties , and the benefits in quelling chemotherapy - induced nausea and wasting syndrome are well documented .
Future studies may find even more important medical uses .
Including marijuana in the war on drugs has only proved foolhardy -- and costly .
By keeping marijuana illegal and prices high , illicit drug money from the U.S. sustains the murderous narco - traffickers in Mexico and elsewhere .
In fact , after seeing how proximity to marijuana growers affected the small Mexican village of Alamos , where my husband spent much of his childhood , I was adamant about never entering into that economy of violence .

Because Rhode Island has no California - like medical marijuana dispensaries , the patient must apply for a medical marijuana license and then find a way to procure the cannabis .
We floundered on our own until we finally connected with a local horticultural school graduate who agreed to provide our son ’s organic marijuana .
But given the seedy underbelly of the illegal drug trade , combined with the current economic collapse , even our grower has to be mindful of not exposing himself to robbery .
Legalizing marijuana not only removes the incentives for this underground economy , it would allow for regulation and taxation of the product , just like cigarettes and alcohol .
The potential for abuse is there , as it is with any substance , but toxicology studies have not even been able to establish a lethal dose at typical - use levels .
In fact , in 1988 , Young of the DEA further stated that “ it is estimated that ... a smoker would theoretically have to consume ... nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about 15 minutes to induce a lethal response . ”
Nor is it physically addicting , unlike your daily Starbucks , as anyone who has suffered from a caffeine withdrawal headache can attest .
Although it has been demonized for years , marijuana has n’t been illegal in the U.S. for that long .
The cannabis plant became criminalized on a federal level in 1937 , largely because of the efforts of one man , Harry Anslinger , commissioner of the then newly formed Bureau of Narcotics , largely through sensationalistic stories of murder and mayhem conducted supposedly under the influence of cannabis .
Cannabis was still listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia , or USP , until 1941 as a household drug useful for treating headaches , depression , menstrual cramps and toothaches , and drug companies worked to develop a stronger strain .
In 1938 , a skeptical Fiorello LaGuardia , mayor of New York , appointed a committee to conduct the first in - depth study of marijuana ’s actual effects .
It found that , despite the government ’s fervent claims , marijuana did not cause insanity or act as a gateway drug .
It also found no scientific reason for its criminalization .
In 1972 , President Nixon ’s Shafer Commission similarly concluded that cannabis should be re-legalized .

Both recommendations were ignored , and since then billions of dollars have been spent enforcing the ban .
Public policy analyst Jon Gettman , author of the 2007 report , “ Lost Revenues and Other Costs of Marijuana Laws , ” estimated marijuana - related annual costs of law enforcement at $ 10.7 billion .
I was heartened to hear California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s recent call for the U.S. to at least look at other nations ’ experiences with legalizing marijuana -- and to open a debate .
And given the real security threats the nation faces , U.S. Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr.'s announcement that the federal government would no longer conduct raids on legal medicinal marijuana dispensaries was a prudent move .
Decriminalizing marijuana is the logical next step .

If Favre signs with Minnesota , will Jackson get the boot ?
Vikings owner Zygi Wilf told the Minneapolis Star - Tribune that it ’s up to Brett Favre whether or not Minnesota signs Brett Favre , so essentially the team is waiting on Brett Favre .
( Brett Favre . )
While Minnesota waits to hear whether or not Favre is healthy enough to come back ( apparently he threw at a local high school recently and still had pain ) , Vikings beat writer Judd Zulgad wonders aloud if the team would release Tarvaris Jackson if good ol ’ No. 4 comes aboard .
In a recent chat , Zulgad said that he would n’t be surprised if Jackson got the axe if Favere were signed .
The fourth year player is in his final year of his contract and the Vikings apparently do n’t want to cut former USC QB John David Booty because they like his potential .
Plus , the Vikes traded for Sage Rosenfels in the offseason , so that would leave Jackson on the outside looking in .
Whether the Brett Favres sign the Vikings or not , it looks like Jackson ’s time in Minnesota is running out .
If the team still had confidence in him , they would n’t have traded for Rosenfels and would n’t be so hell bent on signing Favre if they thought Jackson could still have a bright future in Minnesota .
Maybe Jackson should be secretly hoping for a release .
He would certainly catch on somewhere and sometimes a change of scenery is exactly what a struggling player needs .
He has always been talented , but he remains unpolished despite entering his fourth season .
Maybe a different setting and a good coaching staff could get Jackson to realize his potential .
Brett Favre .

Electromagnetism leaking through the floor of a Kobe train causes paperclips to dance .
( Watch video . )
The video -- shot on the Rokko Liner in Kobe , Japan -- shows how paperclips on the floor react when the train accelerates and decelerates .
The magnetic pull , which is produced by the electric current that drives the motors located under the floor , apparently poses no harm to the human body , though it could damage credit cards , mobile phones , or other electronic devices if left on the floor .
The Kobe New Transit Company , which operates the Rokko Liner ( as well as the Port Liner , which uses similar trains ) , says extra shielding is being installed for good measure .

Le Wild du Minnesota a embauché le gardien et joueur autonome Wade Dubielewicz afin d'ajouter de la profondeur à cette position .
Le directeur général du Wild Chuck Fletcher a déclaré que Dubielewicz pourrait servir de police d'assurance s'il parvenait à échanger Josh Harding qui seconde présentement Niklas Backstrom .
Dubielewicz pourrait également servir de troisième gardien .
Le vétéran de 30 ans a participé à 40 matchs dans la LNH avec les Islanders de New York et les Blue Jackets de Columbus .
En carrière , il présente un dossier de 17 - 15 - 1 avec une moyenne de 2,65 et un coefficient d'efficacité de .916 .
It may not need justification , but it ’s become so obvious that I have to talk about it .
Artists love It ’s Blitz !.
They just want to get their hands around it , their fingers in it .
Yeah Yeah Yeahs have succeeded in making even the alternative unorthodox with this latest album release .
And track by track , the remixes pour out .
Ears first perked with Animal Collective ’s take on ‘ Zero , ’ a dark horse remixer if that race ever existed .
Intriguing , worth the listen , but nothing to write home about .
Take a look for yourself : [ audio : http://jetcomx.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/yeah-yeah-yeahs-zero-animal-collective-remix1.mp3]
Others who ’ve had their way with the track ?
RAC , N.A.S.A and Erol Alkan .
Now ‘ Heads Will Roll ’ is getting the same royal treatment from the likes of big - beating Emre B , Hollywood hitter DAN OH , up and coming Canadian producer John Roman , Swedish Duo Legobeat Dark Cuts , Hail Social ’s side project Weird Tapes , Cleveland ’s own Digiraatii Dance Til You ’re Dead and I ’m sure others I ’m unaware of .
Of the bunch , three seem to go beyond the generic bass thump - thumps and outer space noises .

And just when you thought a single CD could n’t possibly become more bent and tweaked , even their own guitarist Nick Zinner has a remix of ‘ Turn Into . ’
Them Jeans leads the way for the next sitting duck - I ’m sure his acoustic version of ‘ Soft Shock ’ will spark an influx of master mixers within the next few weeks !
Quite a beautiful fusion of Cuban bongo percussion , those dance floor snares and Karen O ’s sweet ooh ooh oohs .
Ridiculous ?
It ’s Questionable .
Fun ?
Undoubtedly .
Hey , maybe these fresh versions are n’t exactly what the doctor ordered .
I ’m not itching to get all of these tracks in my iTunes , but no DJ should feel himself de trop .
It ’s exciting , creative , and I ’m sure Yeah Yeah Yeahs feel downright honored .
So get you ’re dancing shoes on , a new Lykke Li is coming to town …
Yeah Yeah Yeahs are getting down , dirtied , and mixed around !

( Fortune ) --
On May 28 , Microsoft proclaimed it would launch a new search engine that would compete in the vast hunt for search bucks .
In an incredible act of sagacity , it announced that the name of the new search engine would be ... Bing .
Uh -huh .
Microsoft top elephant Steve Ballmer mentioned something about Bing being the " sound of found . "
No duh .
I found it .
Some time ago , in fact .
As you can imagine , this has concerned me quite a bit .
I have to ask myself , What happens when somebody nabs your name for its gigantic corporate purposes ?
I realized there was only one person I could consult .
He 's very old now , and his circumstances are much diminished .
But I found him , in a seedy tavern in Van Nuys , Calif. , where he was nursing a beer before setting off for the races at Santa Anita .
Following is a transcript of our conversation .
Stanley Bing : Mr. Google , thanks for taking time to speak with me .
Barney Google : Do n't be a fool .
Buy me a drink .
Bing :
You were once quite famous , Mr. Google .
The comic strip of which you were the star still appears in 21 countries .
Google :
It do n't matter .
I was here first , but since the Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) hotshots came along , nobody gives a horsefeather for me .
Bing :
In a song from 1923 , you were called " the most important man this country ever knew , " as well as " the greatest lover " and , for some reason , " the greatest fire chief . "
Google : ( laughs , coughs up phlegm ) :
They said my sneeze could put the fire out !
( Unintelligible )
Bing :
You were in shorts , cartoons , and two live - action films along with your friend Snuffy Smith .
As recently as 2006 , you appeared in a DVD that captured 20 episodes of your classic animated series .
Google : Just try searching my name , though .
Forget it !
I 'm almost completely not optimized .
It 's creepy !
Bing : I know .
I do n't want to be mean , but I bet not one person in 100 reading this column today knows who you are .
They certainly do n't think about you when they hear the word " Google , " as they did for much of the century just past .
Google : I can't talk when my throat is so dry ...
Bing :
When did you feel the whole thing turning ?
Google :
It was in 1940 , when Columbia University math professor Edward Kasner asked his 9 - year - old nephew to come up with a word he could use for a very large number .
I was at the height of my brand awareness then , and the kid said Google .
Bing : Kasner misspelled it as Googol .
Google : Yeah , but the damage was done .
Folks started seeing Googol as a mathematical concept .
There was confusion all of a sudden .
It 's not a coincidence that around that time I moved out of Beverly Hills and into the Valley .
Bing :
Then the Mountain View guys came along and changed it back to its original spelling - yours .
Google :
And I 'm left to suck hose water .
I mean , I 'm on YouTube and everything .
But you think I can get a table at Dan Tana 's anymore ?
Bing : Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) just announced it was going to spend , like , $ 100 million on an ad campaign for its new search engine , called Bing .
Google : Are n't you Bing ?
Bing : I thought so .
Google : I get it .
I bet you could use a drink , right ?
Bing :
Do n't you think this could be good for my brand ?
There are people all over who now are aware of me who were n't before ...
Google : Yeah , you may get a bump in the beginning .
Bing : But ... ?
Google :
My landlady has a one - bedroom over the garage .
He scurried off not long after that , muttering something about seeing a man about a horse .
I was left sitting there in the darkened bar .
I felt kind of thirsty all of a sudden .

Bar Code Trackers for Food Could Help You Eat More Ethically
While the technology is n’t commercially available yet , several companies are working to implement food tracking software , which will help conscientious consumers to find out where their local shops ’ food was grown before making a purchasing decision .
You might feel proud of yourself for always making sure that the bananas you buy are organic .
But would you still feel good about your choice if you knew that rainforest trees were cut down to make room for the plantation where your fruit was grown , and that it was shipped all the way from Brazil to your supermarket ?
For those who are passionate about food and the earth , eating is full of little ethical quandaries like these ( read Michael Pollan ’s The Omnivore ’s Dilemma for many more ) .
Almost any food , unless it comes straight from your own veggie garden , might have a darker back story than you ’ve been led to believe .
And in some cases , such as when a crop may have been infected with the e. coli virus , the food you eat might actually be dangerous to you .
So how can you find out the facts ?
Simple : scan your food ’s bar code and trace it back to its source .
While the technology is n’t commercially available yet , several companies are working to implement food tracking software , which will help conscientious consumers to find out where their local shops ’ food was grown before making a purchasing decision .
“ The calculation of food miles and carbon footprint could be the killer application for traceability , ” Heiner Lehr of FoodReg , a food tracking software developer , told NewScientist .
“ The technology is there .
If a big retailer puts itself behind this , it could happen very fast . ”
Another new initiative , the UK - based Fair Tracing Project , provides poor farmers in developing countries with cell phones and other technological tools to tell the story of their crops , and to provide documentation that their workers are treated ethically .
Western consumers choosing produce at their local shops can then learn about the farmers who grew their food , and will be reassured to learn about their Fair Trade policies .
And for those who are concerned about the environmental impact of all of the consumer goods they purchase , from laundry detergent to light bulbs , our neighbors to the east may already have the key : the Japanese government has already launched an initiative to print an estimated carbon footprint on all consumer goods , which is calculated based on the distance and energy needed to import a product .
Hopefully , the United States will follow suit soon — but in the meantime , if you ’re concerned about your food miles , there ’s no need to hold out for a high - tech scanner : just take a stroll down to your local farmers market and chat up the vendors there .
It ’s safe to say they did n’t just hop on a plane from Brazil — and even if their fruits and veggies are n’t as exotic as the mangosteens and papayas you might find at your grocery store , they ’re sure to taste much fresher going straight from the farm to your plate .
Technology.am ( Apr. 8 , 2009 ) —
The Pentagon spent over $ 100 million in the past six months to repair damage from cyber attacks and other network issues , military leaders said on Tuesday .
The Pentagon has admitted that its vast computer network is scanned or probed by outsiders millions of times each day .
Last year a cyber attack forced the Defense Department to take up to 1,500 computers off line .
And last fall the Defense Department banned the use of external computer flash drives because of a virus threat officials detected on the Pentagon networks .
According to Army Brig .
Gen. John Davis , deputy commander for network operations , the money was spent on manpower , computer technology and contractors hired to clean up after both external probes and internal mistakes .
Strategic Command is responsible for protecting and monitoring the military ’s information grid , as well as coordinating any offensive cyber warfare on behalf of the U.S .
Speaking to reporters , the military leaders said the U.S. needs to invest more money in the military ’s computer capabilities , rather than pouring millions into repairs .

This Week in Palestine – Week 15 011
Welcome to this Week in Palestine , a service of the International Middle East Media Center , www.imemc.org, for April 9th to 15th 2011
Palestinians going forward with preparations for their request for a UN recognition of a Palestinian state in September , meanwhile Israeli military steps up attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , these stories and more , coming up , stay tuned .
Nonviolence
As we begin our report this week , we remember Vittorio Arrigoni , who was murdered in the Gaza Strip by unknown assailants .
On behalf of the members and administrators of the Palestinian Centre for Rapprochement between People and the staff of the International Middle East Media Center , we condemn this crime and call on the Palestinian Authority in the west Bank and Gaza to bring the murderers to justice , and we pay our warm condolences to Vittorios parents , family and friends , and to all the members of the International Solidarity Movement .
And now we continue with the nonviolent activities in West Bank with IMEMC ’s Fredricka Kallstrom ,
On Friday Five civilians were injured and three arrested when Israeli troops attacked the weekly anti-war protests taking place in Bil’in , Nil’in , al - Nabi Salleh , central West Bank and al - Ma’ssara village in the south .
Protestors this week demanded the release of all political prisoners and carried pictures of the Italian peace activist Vittorio Arrigoni , who was killed in Gaza on Friday .
In Bil’in , three civilians were wounded and many were treated for the effects of tear gas during the weekly protests .
As has been the case for the past six years , international supporters joined the villagers after their daily prayers and marched up to the wall to protest .
Upon arriving at the gate of the wall , troops stationed there fired tear gas and rubber coated steel bullets at protesters , leading to their injuries .
In the nearby village of Nalin , villagers along with their Israeli and international supporters , marched up to the wall where soldiers fired tear gas and sound bombs at them .
Many were treated for the effects of tear gas .
In al - Nabi Salleh , in central West Bank , Israeli troops attacked the weekly anti-war and anti settlements protests there .
International and Israeli supporters gathered after midday prayers and marched up to the land where Israeli plans to build a new settlement .
Troops there attacked the activist with rubber - coated steel bullets and tear gas .
The troops then chased people back to their homes and sprayed them with chemical water .
One villager was injured in the foot ; another in the abdomen and one international activist was arrested .
In Al - Ma’sara village in the southern West Bank , international and Israeli supporters joined the weekly protest against the wall and settlements in the area .
Israeli troops stopped villagers from reaching the construction - side of the wall and used rifle butts and batons to push people back into the village .
Israeli troops also arrested two French activists before the weekly protest had ended .

Political
Palestinian President said he has ordered halt of all media propaganda that further fuel tension between his Fatah party and the Islamist Hamas in Gaza .
Such a position comes in the backdrop of Palestinian Authority ’s willingness to ask the UN for recognition of a Palestinian state on 1967 border lines IMEMC ’s Rami Al - Meghari has more .
.
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas wants an end to the Palestinian division .
Such a wish was expressed by the president almost one month ago , when said he would visit the Gaza Strip and embark on forming a non-politically - affiliated government ahead of next September of general presidential and legislative elections .
In Gaza , Hamas is yet to respond clearly to the Abbas ’s call .
Meanwhile , Palestinian foreign minister , Riyad Almalki , of the Abbas ’s government , said yesterday that it is not time for the Palestinian Authority to resume peace talks with Israel .
Almalki and other PA officials voiced the hope that the PA would be able to get UN recognition of a Palestinian state by September .
Israel , from its part , said it would block such a UN recognition by whatever means at its disposal , while Washington said it would use Veto right against a possible UN vote on a Palestinian state within 1967 borders .
This comes as the Israeli - Palestinian peace talks are still stalled over continued Israeli settlements building ob occupied Palestinian lands , including the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
In other news , Chief of Arab League , Amr Mousa , signaled the possibility to request the UN to debate enforcing a No- fly zone over the Gaza Strip to prevent further Israeli attacks on the area .
Mousa ’s call amidst Gaza - based factions ’ unilateral ceasefire this week that put an end to Israeli military attacks on the region last week .
The attacks claimed the lives of 19 Palestinians including 7 women , elderly men and children and wounded 67 others including 40 civilians .

In addition , Israeli soldiers abducted 14 Palestinians , including children , on Wednesday at dawn in several West Bank areas .
On Thursday , the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center reported that Israeli soldiers violated a ruling issued by the Israeli High Court , and demolished six tin-houses and barns that belong to Bedouin residents living in Al Nwei’ma area , near the Jericho City .
The Center sent an urgent letter to the Israeli Prosecution , the Legal Councilor and the High Court demanding them to stop the violation .
The Center added that the Israeli army recently demolished several tin-houses and barns in the same area , also in direct violation to a ruling issued by the High Court earlier this year .
The Court ordered a delay of the demolishing of the structures but the army demolished barns and tin-houses anyway , without even obtaining the approval of the so - called Civil Administration Office .
Even with Civil Administration approval , such demolitions are illegal under international law .
They are expressly prohibited by article 53 of the 4th Geneva convention except in cases of absolute military necessity .

Updated at 5:27 p.m..
CLEVELAND -- Continental Airlines plans to lay off hundreds more employees , but Greater Cleveland must wait months to learn how many will lose their jobs here .
The Houston - based airline said Tuesday that it will eliminate 1,700 positions nationwide but hopes some will come through leaves of absence and other voluntary measures .
How many employees will be laid off - and where - will be determined by about Sept. 23 , Chief Executive Lawrence Kellner said .
Continental has almost 2,200 employees at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport , where it is the busiest carrier .
Continental announced the work force reductions as it released weak second - quarter results .
Reports from Continental and other airlines showed that carriers continue to flounder as both business and leisure customers rein in travel in a sluggish economy .
Continental said it will increase domestic fees for checked bags by $ 5 .
The first checked bag will cost $ 20 and the second $ 30 for passengers who check luggage at the airport instead of online .
The change took effect immediately for flights on or after Aug. 19 .
United Airlines and US Airways also charge $ 20 for a first bag and $ 30 for a second .
All three carriers discount baggage fees $ 5 if paid online .
Continental also added $ 5 to the fee for booking a reservation over the phone .
The airline said the new fees would yield about $ 100 million .
It said other revenue - raising moves are coming .
The airline announced no new capacity cuts .
It slashed flights and routes last year as fuel prices soared .
Continental 's capacity in Cleveland for the 2009 second quarter was down 23.3 percent from a year earlier , while traffic fell 21 percent .
Airlines can cut capacity by flying fewer flights or using smaller planes .
Continental said it lost $ 213 million , or $ 1.72 a share , in the quarter ended June 30 , compared with a loss of $ 5 million , or 5 cents a share , a year earlier .
A swine flu scare last spring took a particular toll on Continental 's flights to Mexico .
Excluding one - time charges , the loss was $ 169 million , or $ 1.36 per share .
Analysts expected a loss of $ 1.35 per share excluding charges , according to a survey by Thomson Reuters .
The airline took $ 44 million in charges during the second quarter because of the falling value of its Boeing 737s .
The write - down included $ 8 million for disposing of three 737-300s and a $ 4 million charge related to obsolete spare parts .
Revenue tumbled 22.7 percent , to $ 3.13 billion , nearly matching the $ 3.14 billion forecast by analysts .
Southwest Airlines , the No. 2 carrier at Hopkins , squeezed out a profit in the second quarter of $ 54 million , down from $ 321 million in the second quarter last year .
While outperforming other carriers , Southwest said its total operating revenue was almost 9 percent lower than a year ago -- and it expects a steeper drop in the third quarter unless demand rebounds significantly .
Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly called today 's travel market " one of the worst revenue environments for the airlines " ever .
Kelly said about 1,400 employees had decided to accept early buyout offers of cash and travel benefits .
United Airlines said Tuesday that it lost $ 323 million in the second quarter .
United said it would reduce international capacity an additional 7 percent for the last four months of 2009 .
Continental 's job cuts , amounting to about 3.4 percent of its work force , are on top of plans to eliminate 500 reservations agents and to put 700 flight attendants on leave .
The layoffs for most employee groups , but not management and clerical , will be determined by seniority
At Hopkins , airport Director Ricky Smith declined to comment about Continental 's decision since it's too early to tell the effect on Cleveland .
Continental CEO
Kellner said a key measurement of revenue in relation to capacity " appears to be bottoming out , " but he added , " It is doing so at low levels , and we must take aggressive steps to increase revenue and reduce costs . "
Industry analyst William Swelbar said capacity reductions by airlines have not allowed airlines to raise fares as they had hoped .
" At this point , revenue is declining at nearly twice the rate of traffic , meaning that even rock bottom fares are not energizing demand in this environment , " he said .
" This is a simple economic fact that makes the current construct of the U.S. airline industry hard to sustain over the medium term . "
Well , Reuters has the story out already , so there 's no longer any reason for me to keep mum .
Yes , the rumors you 've been seeing all over the web the last few days are true .
Another huge piece has fallen into place for the HBO pilot of A GAME OF THRONES -- we have signed Sean Bean to play the part of Lord Eddard Stark .
For the movie fans out there , Sean Bean needs no introduction .
I mean , what the hell , he was Boromir and he was Sharpe , he was terrific in both roles , and in a hundred other parts besides .
I can't imagine a better Ned .
The deal took some doing , so my fingers have been crossed for a month now ( and boy , that made it hard to type ) , but now it 's done , and I 'm thrilled .
That 's only part of the exciting news , however .
Casting has been proceeding apace these past six weeks or so -- in New York and LA , London and Dublin , most recently in Australia .
David and Dan and director Tom McCarthy have been looking all over the world for the right actors , and now they 've filled some key roles as well .
For King Robert I Baratheon , we 've got Mark Addy , a veteran British actor of stage and screen that many of you may remember from his fine turn in A KNIGHT'S TALE .
The roles of Joffrey Baratheon , the crown prince , and Viserys Targaryen , the beggar king , have also been filled ... by Jack Gleeson and Harry Lloyd , respectively .
Sorry , I have n't been able to find pictures of them on the internet yet , though I 'm sure they are out there somewhere .
I 've seen readings by both Gleeson and Lloyd , and both should be terrific .
And last , but certainly not least , the role of the bastard Jon Snow will be played by a young actor named Kit Harington .
You probably have n't heard of him yet ... but you will , we 're confident .
David and Dan can't say enough about his talent and intensity .
Of course , there 's a lot more roles still to fill , including some very crucial ones like the Lannister twins , the Stark children , and Daenerys Targaryen , so the search will continue for awhile .
But we 've begun , and so far I could n't be happier .
October is right around the corner .
Apple is giving Snow Leopard , the next version of OS X , a proper unveiling today at WWDC .
Here are all the details , as we get them .
The biggest news ?
It 's only $ 29 to upgrade , and coming in September
Advertisement
Snow Leopard , otherwise known as OS X 10.6 , was first announced at last year 's WWDC , and we got a pretty comprehensive rundown of what to expect : serious 64 - bit support ; the ability to really use multi-core processors with Grand Central ; GPGPU processing ( that 's graphics card processing , in English ) with OpenCL ; and more under - the - hood upgrades .
There 've been plenty of rumors since then , but here 's the official word :
WHAT'S NEW :
Advertisement
FASTER PERFORMANCE
• Much of the codebase has been rewritten , for speed increases system - wide .
• Installation is 45 % faster , which is considerate , I guess .
• General optimizations abound : opening JPEGs , for example , is now twice as fast in Preview .
PDFs are 1.5 x faster .
Some of this could be down to the new 64 - bit , multi - threaded underpinnings ; mostly , though , it 's just plain old software tweaking .
• Same goes for Mail : it 's about twice as fast to launch , search and move messages .
Advertisement
• Installing Snow Leopard actually saves space : you 'll get back 6GB of hard drive space over Leopard 10.5 .
Successive versions of OS X are usually faster , yeah , but much smaller ?
That 's new .
SAFARI 4
• Javascript performance , which is basically the core issue in the browser wars nowadays , is up by 50 % .
Browsing as a whole is faster , and Safari 4 passes the Acid3 CSS test at 100 % .
It gets Coverflow ( for history browsing ) , just like virtually every other part of OS X. " Fastest in the World " , they say .
In addition , Safari 4 now has " crash resistance " , meaning Chrome - like threaded processes , so a single crashed tab does n't take down the entire browser .
More here .

MICROSOFT EXCHANGE SUPPORT
• According to our own Mark Wilson , " it looks like it should look . "
That means seamless integration with Mail , Contacts and iCal .
The implementation looks fairly complete , and most importantly , it 's standard in Snow Leopard — not part of a separate app suite .
Advertisement
QUICKTIME 10
• QT gets a new interface , looks like the iTunes video player .
Hardware acceleration for video playback , too .
You can do some quick video editing as well , like in older versions of Quicktime Pro , except with an iMovie - style visual timeline .
It 's very pretty , and a welcome improvement of the ultra - limited editing powers of previous QTs .
This , of course , is now standard .
Oh right , and there ' a new , vaguely menacing icon .
Advertisement
Advertisement
NEW DOCK , EXPOSE
• It 's a lot like regular Exposé , except it can be controlled from the dock , and offers more in the way of interactivity , i.e. , dragging content between previewed windows .
App grouping is now managed by from the dock icons .
Nothing revolutionary , but it 's nice to see tighter Exposé integration .
I see little hints of Windows 7's awesome new taskbar , maybe ?
Advertisement
• Sorta related , but not worthy of its own heading : you can magnify some icons in Finder , and preview video in thumbnails .
Advertisement
64 - BIT , GPGPU , AND MULTI - CORE SUPPORT :
• 64 whole bits :
All native OS X apps , like Mail , Quicktime , Finder , and Safari , are fully coded for 64 - bit compatibility .
This should n't have a massive effect on performance , but it's an inevitable progression , and a positive one .
Previously .
Advertisement
• Multi-core support , i.e. Grand Central :
We knew this was coming , but it bears repeating : the whole OS has been optimized to use all those fancy multi-core processors in your MacBooks and iMacs .
This includes core apps .
The API , which will allow developers to tap into Grand Central , which is essentially the software brain of the OS X multi- core engine , will expand support to third - party apps .
Previously .
• GPGPU acceleration :
Not much new here , but Snow Leopard will support GPU acceleration in non-graphics apps , when appropriate .
Again , previously .

HOW MUCH , AND WHEN ?
• Well , this is a hell of a surprise , but it fits with Apple 's vision of Snow Leopard as a stopgap product : $ 29 to upgrade from Leopard , down from their regular $ 129 upgrade price .
$ 49 for a family pack .
It comes out in September , before Windows 7 , and a developer preview is available from today .
Anyone who buys a new Mac from June 8th can upgrade for a nominal $ 10 handling fee .

The Queen is not amused by MPs ' expenses scandal
As one of the few pillars of the Establishment not to have been in any way weakened by the continuing disclosures over parliamentary expenses , the Queen has been careful to keep her own counsel about the affair .
At least in public .
Children in the developing world are most at risk from the virus The World Health Organization says a vaccine which can prevent a diarrhoea and vomiting virus should be given to all children as a routine vaccination .
Rotavirus causes more than 500,000 diarrhoeal deaths and two million hospitalisations a year among children .
Over 85 % of deaths occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia .
International experts welcomed the WHO 's recommendations , based on new research , but UK scientists have said the vaccine is too costly .
' Milestone '
The WHO 's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE ) made its recommendations after new data from clinical trials .
The clinical trial , which involved a range or organisations including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations ( GAVI ) and drug company GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , which makes the vaccine plus researchers in South Africa and Malawi , found that rotavirus vaccine significantly reduced severe diarrhoea episodes .
The WHO's Dr Thomas Cherian , said : " This is a tremendous milestone in ensuring that vaccines against the most common cause of lethal diarrhoea reach the children who need them most . "
This is a tremendous milestone in ensuring that vaccines against the most common cause of lethal diarrhoea reach the children who need them most
Dr Thomas Cherian , WHO
But the WHO said , because there were other causes of diarrhoea , it was also important to improve water quality , hygiene , and sanitation and ensure oral rehydration solutions and zinc supplements were available .
Dr Tachi Yamada , president of the Global Health Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , said : " This WHO recommendation clears the way for vaccines that will protect children in the developing world from one of the most deadly diseases they face .
" We need to act now to deliver vaccines to children in Africa and Asia , where most rotavirus deaths occur . "
Dr Julian Lob - Levyt , chief executive officer of GAVI , said : " This represents another important step in our ability to achieve significant impact on under - five deaths in the world 's poorest communities and make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals .
" We are extremely excited about the potential to offer African and Asian countries funding to introduce rotavirus vaccines . "
' Price cut '
There are around 130,000 episodes of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus each year in the UK .
Around 12,700 children are hospitalised , and four die each year .
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , which advises the government , said in February that it would only consider recommending the vaccine if its price were significantly reduced .
In February , the JCVI said : " Rotavirus vaccination would reduce the incidence of rotavirus in the population .
" However , the cost - effectiveness analysis showed that , based on current vaccine prices , universal vaccination of young children significantly exceeded the commonly accepted threshold for cost - effective healthcare interventions .
" Introduction of rotavirus vaccines may only become cost - effective if the vaccine price is reduced significantly . "
Professor Andrew Hall , chairman of the JCVI , said the committee always kept vaccines under review and considered new information .

A few weeks ago I promised to bring in some more general news from the world of Linux audio software development .
Alas , my plans were ambushed by the happy intrusion of the release of Renoise for Linux , but I 'm back on track .
As promised , here 's more straight reporting on the world of Linux sound and music software , starting with some news about recently released music notation programs .
I 've covered notation editors in depth in a previous series about music notation software for Linux .
However , some interesting developments have occurred since I wrote that article .
Figure 1 : NtED
NtED marks the return of Dr. Joerg Anders into the field of Linux music notation software .
Professor Anders is perhaps best known for his pioneering NoteEdit .
Many of that program 's best features are present in NtED , and the list of planned improvement indicates that the good doctor intends to take special care of his project .
NtED is advertised as a true WYSIWYG notation editor , with MusicXML import capability and MIDI and PostScript export functions ( for printing scores directly from NtED ) .
Four - part polyphonic staff entry is supported , along with score playback ( via TiMidity or any synthesizer connected to an ALSA sequencer port ) and a wide variety of rhythmic values and other staff directives .
As I wrote this report I discovered that Dr. Anders has released version 0.19.1 of his program ( Figure 1 ) .
I was a fan of his earlier work , and I must say that I continue to be impressed with this newer project .
Of course , at this stage NtED is still evolving , but it is already stable and useful music software .
On my personal wishlist , I 'd like to see support for LilyPond and MusicXML as export targets , I think those features would greatly expand NtED 's appeal and utility .
Meanwhile , there 's more than enough in NtED to keep me happy and productive .
Figure 2 : MuseScore
Although its most recent release is version 0.9.1 , MuseScore is a relatively new addition to the Linux music notation software armory , but chief developer Werner Schweer is certainly no stranger to the domain of Linux audio development .
Werner 's
Muse is one the top - ranked audio / MIDI sequencers for Linux , and that program is in fact the genesis point for MuseScore .
Muse 's original design included a notation editor , but its developer wisely considered that further development of that editor would continue best as stand - alone program .
Like NtED , MuseScore is a true WYSIWYG editor , complete with support for score playback and import / export of MusicXML and standard MIDI files .
Percussion notation is supported , as is direct printing from the program .
MuseScore 's features are too numerous to list , here so I 'll simply point readers to the program 's Web home for more details .
Alas , MuseScore 's dependencies include a version of Qt ( 4.3 or higher ) that is not available in the stable repos for my JAD and 64 Studio systems , so I was unable to build and test it under Linux .
However , I discovered a rather unusual way to test the program : I ran its Windows version under Wine ( Figure 2 ) .
Since the software is intended to run identically across the platforms , I figured I 'd at least be able to see what it looks like .
I was pleased to discover that I could use MuseScore with the wineasio driver , thus allowing a hybrid setup to test the program 's scoring and playback capabilities ( FluidSynth is built into the app ) .
However , I did not test printing from the Windows version ( no printer hooked to my JAD box , sorry ) .
By the way , readers who have been following Alex Stone 's fascinating odyssey into Linux audio may be interested to know that Alex has also been experimenting with MuseScore and that it appears to have become the notation centerpiece of his Parchment Studios .
This employment speaks well for the program , given that Alex 's work is mainly orchestral music .
Figure 3 : gcomposer
Cedric Roux , a .k.a. sed , describes his gcomposer as " a little tool to write music " .
While it does not aspire to the magnitude of NtED or MuseScore , it is a good program within its ( self - imposed ) design limitations .
First , it 's perhaps best for guitarists .
Sed is himself a classical guitarist who wanted a compact notation editor with a small but flexible features set .
In the true spirit of the Linux audio software hacker , sed had an itch , he scratched it , and thus was born gcomposer ( Figure 3 ) .
gcomposer is available as a source code package for Linux and as a precompiled binary for Windows .
The program has few dependencies , is easy to build , and is even easier to use .
Sed may expand it to support MIDI and LilyPond as export targets , which will be nice , but gcomposer is indeed already a neat little tool for writing music .
Figure 4 : LilyPond
Meanwhile , LilyPond itself continues to mature .
LilyPond stable is now at version 2.10.33 ( my OpenSUSE 10.2 repos are still on 2.8.7 ) , with the development sources at version 2.11.39 .
I 'll not rehearse a litany of praise for LilyPond , I 'll just point readers to the Web site .
While you 're visiting , take the time to read the excellent essay on automated music engraving .
If you 've ever wanted to know the rationale behind LilyPond , you 'll want to read this essay .
Alas , LilyPond documentation developer Graham Percival has announced his departure from the LilyPond team .
Fortunately his leave - taking is amicable , and Graham has solicited the community for volunteers to take up the slack for the not - inconsiderable task of developing and maintaining the LilyPond documentation project .
Interested readers should consult the relevant traffic in the LilyPond mail - list archives and contact the development team ( see the LilyPond Web site for contact adresses ) .
Graham put an enormous amount of work into organizing and expanding a very complex project , and he has high hopes for its continued development .
Good luck in future projects , Graham , and thanks for your great contribution to LilyPond .
And since we must have screenshots , Figure 4 shows off jEdit running the very cool LilyPondTool plugin .
See the Music Notation pages at linux - sound.org for a list of other graphic editors for LilyPond .
Outro
I 'll have more reports coming up next week .
Ardour 2.3 has been released , I still owe you all some news about the LinuxSampler project , and did I mention that I 'm now the proud owner of an XO laptop ?
More about all that when we meet again .
Until then , stay tuneful .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some top recipients of U.S. bailout money owe the federal government more than $ 220 million in unpaid taxes , a U.S. lawmaker said on Thursday .
The flag flies atop the Treasury Department in Washington , November 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
Representative John Lewis , a Democrat from Georgia who heads the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means oversight subcommittee , said 13 bailed - out companies owe the federal government taxes .
Two of them owe more than $ 100 million each .
Lewis said the firms , which he did not name , signed statements at the time of receiving federal aid stating that they owed no federal taxes .
“ It is a disgrace .
The American people are fed up ... and they ’re not going to take it anymore , ” Lewis told a hearing to examine the oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Lewis said it raised further questions about the $ 700 billion program .
“ Are they signing contracts knowing that they owe taxes by thinking they will not get caught ? ” he asked .
Lewis ’ subcommittee looked at the top 23 TARP recipients and found that more than half owe unpaid federal income taxes .
One unidentified company owed $ 112.75 million in unpaid taxes from 2006 and 2005 , according to the subcommittee ’s research .
Another company that received government funds owed $ 101.8 million dating back to before 2004 .
The Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , said the Internal Revenue Service had the enforcement tools needed to recoup unpaid taxes .
“ The IRS has a range of responsibilities under the current law to be able to pursue and obtain collection of delinquent taxes , ” Gene Dodaro , the GAO ’s acting comptroller general , told reporters after the hearing .
So far , more than $ 300 billion of TARP funds have been disbursed to financial services institutions including Citigroup , Bank of America and giant insurer American International Group .
AIG BONUSES
AIG is now being heavily criticized for accepting up to $ 180 billion in government funds and then handing out hefty bonuses .
TARP watchdog , Neil Barofsky , told the congressional panel that he plans to launch an audit examining federal monitoring and enforcement of executive compensation restrictions imposed on companies that have received government help such as AIG .
Barofsky , TARP ’s inspector general , said his office will be looking closely to ensure bonuses to AIG employees are consistent with AIG ’s legal or contractual obligations .
“ If there are any inconsistencies , we will act aggressively to recover taxpayers ’ money , ” Barofsky told the panel .
Barofsky said his office has already initiated two audits to bring more transparency to TARP .
One audit is looking into the impact of lobbyists or other “ outside influences ” on the TARP application process and the second audit is looking at the process under which Bank of America received government help .
The Treasury Department funneled $ 25 billion into Bank of America as part of the capital injections .
The government has also allocated $ 20 billion to the bank as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $ 118 billion of assets .
The CIA is equipping Pakistani tribesmen with secret electronic transmitters to help target and kill al - Qaida leaders in the north - western tribal belt , in a tactic that could aid Pakistan 's army as it takes the battle against extremism to the Taliban heartland .
As the army mops up Taliban resistance in the Swat valley , where a defence official predicted fighting would be over within days , the focus is shifting to Waziristan and the Taliban warlord Baitullah Mehsud .
But a deadly war of wits is already under way in the region , where tribesmen say the US is using advanced technology and old - fashioned cash to target the enemy .
Over the last 18 months the US has launched more than 50 drone attacks , mostly in south and north Waziristan .
US officials claim nine of the top 20 al - Qaida figures have been killed .
That success is reportedly in part thanks to the mysterious electronic devices , dubbed " chips " or " pathrai " ( the Pashto word for a metal device ) , which have become a source of fear , intrigue and fascination .
" Everyone is talking about it , " said Taj Muhammad Wazir , a student from south Waziristan .
" People are scared that if a pathrai comes into your house , a drone will attack it . "
According to residents and Taliban propaganda , the CIA pays tribesmen to plant the electronic devices near farmhouses sheltering al - Qaida and Taliban commanders .
Hours or days later , a drone , guided by the signal from the chip , destroys the building with a salvo of missiles .
" There are body parts everywhere , " said Wazir , who witnessed the aftermath of a strike .
Until now the drone strikes were the only threat to militants in Waziristan , where the Pakistani army had , in effect , abandoned the fight .
But now , emboldened by a successful campaign to drive militants out of Swat , a region about 80 miles from Islamabad , the army is preparing to regain lost ground in the more remote tribal belt .
It will be a much tougher campaign than in Swat , with the army pitched against a formidable , battle - hardened opponent .
Yesterday Taliban fighters ambushed a military position in what could be a prelude to much more intense combat .
For the US military , drones have proved to be an effective weapon against al - Qaida targets , and they are becoming increasingly accurate .
On 1 January a drone - fired missile killed Usama al - Kimi , a Kenyan militant who orchestrated last year 's Marriott hotel bombing in Islamabad , a senior official with Pakistan 's ISI spy agency said .
It is a high - tech assassination operation for one of the world 's most remote areas .
The pilotless aircraft , Predators or more sophisticated Reapers , take off from a base in Baluchistan province .
But they are guided by a joystick - wielding operator half a world away , at a US air force base 35 miles north of Las Vegas [ See footnote ] .
Barack Obama has approved the drone campaign , which is cheap and limits the danger posed to US troops .
But the strikes have many unintended victims .
A Pakistani newspaper estimated that 700 people had been killed since 2006 , most of them civilians , as a result of drone attacks .
For the tribesmen who plant the microchips and get it wrong , the consequences can be terrible .
Last month the Taliban issued a video confession by Habib ur Rehman , 19 .
" They money was good , " he said in a quavering voice , describing how he was paid 20,000 rupees ( £ 166 ) to drop microchips hidden in a cigarette wrapper at the home of a target .
Rehman said his handler promised thousands of pounds if the strike was successful , and protection if he was caught .
The end of the video showed Rehman being shot dead with three other alleged spies .
Residents say such executions – there have been at least 100 – indicate how much the drone strikes have worried the Taliban .
In Wana , the capital of south Waziristan , foreign fighters are shunning the bazaars and shops , and locals are shunning the fighters .
" Before , the common people used to sit with the militants , " said Wazir .
" Now they are also afraid .
Paranoid militant commanders are closely monitoring cross - border traffic with Afghanistan , from where they suspect the chip - carrying CIA spies are coming , said Imtiaz Wazir , a resident of Spin Wam village in north Waziristan .
" If I go to Afghanistan without any purpose , the militants come to ask why , " he said .
A local transporter named Haji Hamid who gave the wrong answer , he said , was found shot dead two months ago , his legs and fingers broken .
The drone strikes are despised across Pakistan , where politicians including President Asif Ali Zardari denounce them as a breach of sovereignty .
But behind the scenes his government is quietly colluding with Washington .
A former CIA officer who served in Waziristan in 2006 said that small American teams comprising CIA agents , radio experts and special forces soldiers are stationed inside Pakistani military bases across the tribal belt .
From there , the CIA recruits a network of paid , and sometimes unwitting , informers – known as " cut-outs " – to help identify targets , he added .
In most cases they are poor local men .
Ironically , support for the drone strikes is strongest in the frontier , especially among embattled security officials .
" They are very precise , very effective , and the Taliban and al - Qaida dread them , " said the provincial police chief , Malik Naveed Khan , with undisguised admiration .
The strikes have caused friction between the US and the ISI , which would like America to give it control over the new technology .
" The problem with the Americans is that the only instrument up their sleeve is the hammer , and they see everything as a nail , " said a senior official .
The ISI resents the US for failing to target Mehsud , whose deputy claimed for last week 's Lahore attack that killed at least 24 people , including an ISI colonel .
But as the army prepares to attack South Waziristan , with broad public support , the warlord 's luck may be running out .
Authorities in North West Frontier Province are preparing for up to 500,000 refugees , added to 2.5 million displaced by operations in Swat .
Mehsud faces other challenges , too .
Rival militant groups , with army support , are challenging his dominance in South Waziristan .
And he faces the ever - present danger that some visitor could drop a " pathrai " at his doorstep , and bring an American drone with it .

Since this story was published in May , it has emerged that the drone programme run from Creech air force base in Nevada is not the only such US system .
A second programme , run by the CIA from a site near its Virginia headquarters , is the one that strikes in Pakistan 's tribal areas .

Unless humans act now , seafood may disappear by 2048 , concludes the lead author of a new study that paints a grim picture for ocean and human health .
According to the study , the loss of ocean biodiversity is accelerating , and 29 percent of the seafood species humans consume have already crashed .
If the long - term trend continues , in 30 years there will be little or no seafood available for sustainable harvest .
The increasing pace of diversity loss thus imperils the " ecosystems services " that many human populations depend on for survival , the study says .
The research also found that biodiversity loss is tightly linked to declining water quality , harmful algal blooms , ocean dead zones , fish kills , and coastal flooding .

" Biodiversity is a finite resource , and we are going to end up with nothing left ... if nothing changes , " said Boris Worm , an assistant professor of marine conservation biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax , Canada .
Worm led the international team of scientists and economists that examined the role of marine biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem services .
The research appears in tomorrow 's issue of the journal Science .
But areas managed for improved biodiversity can and do recover , Worm says , raising the possibility that the trend can be reversed if humans take action .
" Where we [ protect marine areas ] around the world — from the tropics to temperate ecosystems — we see an increase in species diversity and productivity and stability and economic revenue from those ecosystems , " he said .
Consistent Response
Worm and colleagues examined the impact of species loss at local , regional , and global scales and in a variety of ecosystems .
Everywhere they looked , they got the same result :
The greater the loss of diversity , the greater the impact on ecosystem services .
How Eating Venomous Lionfish Helps the Environment Watch how divers and a restaurant in Florida are turning the venomous and invasive lionfish into an appetizing entrée .
" Ecosystems that were losing species were always more fragile , always more vulnerable , always more likely to see a whole collapse of fisheries , more likely to show an increase in toxic events like fish kills and things like that , " Worm said .
" Whereas those systems that still had a full portfolio of species or had large species diversity to begin with were more robust , better buffered against change . "
In a telephone briefing with reporters , Worm added that he and his colleagues were " really surprised , to some extent shocked , by the consistency of the result . "
Worm told National Geographic
News that the tight - knit connections between ocean communities and their habitats might explain why species diversity affects ecosystem services so closely .
He likened the relationship to a house of cards : Remove one species or habitat type in the system , and the whole thing comes tumbling down .
But Donald Boesch at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge is not convinced .
In a Science news article on the study , he said " it falls short of demonstrating that biodiversity losses are the primary drivers of why the services have declined . "
For example , excessive fertilizer runoff into the Chesapeake Bay is most likely behind the decline in water quality there , not loss of biodiversity , he says .
Reversing the Trend
But the finding that areas do recover if managed is a major bright spot to the otherwise dark study , Worm says .
" This can be done .
It 's not beyond our reach at all , " he said .
The study recommends an ecosystem management approach that sets aside some zones completely off - limits to any human activity while opening others to certain uses , such as recreation , research , and fishing .
" It 's exactly what we do on land , and we 've been doing it for a long time , " Worm said .
Jane Lubchenco , a marine biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis , praised the study for presenting compelling evidence that ecosystems can recover if appropriate action is taken .
" That said , their first conclusion about the downward spiral [ of biodiversity ] suggests that the rate of implementation of those recovery tools needs to be sped up quite significantly , " she said .
But " just making recommendations does n't make things happen , unfortunately . "
However , she points to several promising developments , including a proactive movement toward marine reserves and protected areas off the coast of California and Australia 's Great Barrier Reef .
( Related : " Giant Marine Reserve Created in South Pacific " [ March 29 , 2006 ] . )
She also promotes " catch shares " fisheries management , in which commercial fishers have a stake in maintaining healthy fish populations because they are granted a percentage of the total allowable catch .
As more fish are available , the fishers get a larger share .
" The whole idea is to align fishing and conservation interests so there is incentive for fishermen to conserve stocks so we have something to catch in the future , " she said .
On the individual level , Worm says , people need to pay attention to what they eat .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Federal agents arrested 92 municipal police officers accused of providing information and security to one of Mexico 's most ruthless drug cartels , the state - run Notimex news agency reported .
The arrests occurred Wednesday in the city of Hidalgo in central Mexico after an investigation that started in October , Notimex said Thursday .
So far , the news agency said , the investigation has led to the arrests of 124 suspects and the discovery of 12 safe houses in which 14 secret graves were found .
Officials say the Zeta drug cartel is responsible for many of the kidnappings , extortion and drug trafficking in Hidalgo .
The Zetas were paying the Hidalgo police officers 3,000 to 5,000 pesos ( $ 228 to $ 380 ) every two weeks , Notimex said .

So you lose weight without being hungry .
I would like to know if it 's true .
Oh and by the way , I am not going to do this , just heard about it and it made me curious

We ’ve got a long way to go in the land of gender equality .
The woman ’s liberation movement was , when ?
In the 70s ?
So let ’s say it ’s been almost 40 years since Gloria Steinam and her band of marching chicks fought for the rights for women to go up on stage and tell jokes .
And not one has done so successfully .
Did some a -hole shout Lisa Lampanelli ?
I said WOMAN , not BALROG .
Here are ten women who are ( unfortunately ) the TOP stand - up comedians of their gender .
GROAN .
10 . Margaret Cho
“ Hey , I ’m a female Asian comedian !
Laugh !
Please laugh ! ”
Incidentally , Cho is also No. 10 on Gunaxin ’s Top Ten Celebrities Who Had Abortions list .
9. Kathy Griffin
I ’d rather kill myself than listen to this Ronald - McDonald lookalike .
Seriously .
Kidnap me , give me a gun and a video of her , and ten times out of ten the bullet will go through my skull as that video plays .
I ’d pull the trigger till the clip was empty if I could .
8. Rita Rudner
Virtually stapled to Vegas , Rudner ai n’t even close to being funny .
Her jokes take FO - EVA to unfold and who ’s got that kind of attention span ?
Talk faster and add a real punch - line , bee - atch .
7. Wanda Sykes
This Whoopi- wannabe was promising from the start , and justifiably used on Larry David ’s Curb Your Enthusiasm , but when she stands in front of the crowd , the talk - to - the - hand jokes just do n’t fly .
6. Sarah Silverman
Ultimately , Silverman is funny , but as a stand - up comic , she relies too much on the “ I ’m cute and controversial so laugh at me ” approach .
I ’ll give her credit for trying but I ’m hardly tickled .
5. Janeane Garofalo
This chick makes me want to renounce any of my left - leaning tendencies , mainly because comics who go all - out political make me hate them even more when they ai n’t yankin my funnybone .
To her credit , she voiced the HOT French chef Collette in Ratatouille ( though everyone makes fun of me for thinking that ) .
4. Rosie O’Donnell
It ’d be funnier if she just got up on stage and busted ass into the mic for 30 minutes .
I bet she ’s capable .
3. Ellen DeGeneres
Why does n’t she do more dyke jokes ?
I mean , black comics do nigga material , so why should n’t a Lesbian do dyke jokes ?
She ’s one of the few comics who can get away with that material .
What other comics can yak about the misadventures of chick - on - chick cunnilingus ( Do n’t you hate it when you go down on a woman and she queefs in your face ) ?
I ’d be crapping laughter if she said that .
Instead she ’s dishing about commercial themes getting stuck in her head .
HAHAHAHAHA oh Ellen you so funny .
2. Whoopi Goldberg
I ’ve seen Whoopi do stand - up and she ’s made me crack a smirk but hardly laugh .
There ’s something horribly nasty about her , something that makes me not wanna look , let alone listen .
I congratulate her for her career highs ( an Oscar for Ghost ) and detest her for her career lows ( The View ) .
1. Roseanne Barr
“ Hey , I ’m fat and I ’m loud !
Laugh at me ! ” I think Roseanne is hilarious on the sitcom Roseanne .
So , to reiterate , I said women ca n’t be STAND - UP F-ING COMICS .
Fisher forced overtime with a 3 - pointer with 4.6 seconds left in regulation and then drilled another with 31.3 seconds to go in overtime as the Los Angeles Lakers outlasted the Orlando Magic 99 - 91 in Game 4 on Thursday night to open a 3 - 1 lead in the NBA Finals .
Kobe Bryant is one win from an NBA title to call his own .
The Lakers are one victory from title No. 15 and redemption for last year 's loss to Boston .
Fisher got them there .
The 34 - year - old known for a turnaround fling with 0.4 seconds left in a 2004 playoff game to beat San Antonio , called making the Magic disappear even better .
" It ranks right up there at the top , " he said .
" You know , even greater than 0.4 because I feel like we 're as close as possible to what our end goal is . "
It was the first time since 1984 , when Magic Johnson 's Lakers and Larry Bird 's Celtics hooked up , that two games in a finals have gone to overtime .
When the clock expired , Bryant , trying to win his first championship without Shaquille O'Neal , looked at Tiger Woods and wiped sweat from his brow in relief .
Fisher , who has bailed out the Lakers in plenty of big games before , was hugged by every one of his teammates .
He had missed his first five 3s and promised teammate Pau Gasol he would n't miss again .
" He 's been there before , " Bryant said .
" He has been there and done that .
" He just has supreme confidence and I think those shots at the end of the game are actually easier for him than the other ones . "
The Lakers , who improved to 7 - 0 following a loss in the postseason , can wrap up their first title since 2002 on Sunday night in Game 5 .
Bryant finished with 32 points , eight assists and seven rebounds .
Trevor Ariza and Gasol each had 16 for Los Angeles , which came back from a 12 - point halftime deficit .
Ariza had 13 of the Lakers ' 30 points in the third quarter .
Unless they can force a Game 6 , the Magic will remember this as another finals game that got away .
Dwight Howard was magnificent everywhere but at the free - throw line .
Orlando's superman of a center had 16 points , 21 rebounds and a finals - record nine blocks .
But he made just 6 of 14 foul shots , and it was his two crucial misses with 11.1 seconds to go in regulation that doomed the Magic .
Orlando missed 15 free throws .
" I just missed them , " Howard said .
" I 've been working on my free throws .
They just were n't falling tonight . "
( Bel Air , MD – June 13 , 2009 ) – Harford County Sheriff ’s deputies are investigating the death of Dwight Jerome Madison , 48 , who has no fixed address .
On June 11 , 2009 at 8:50 p.m. deputies responded to the 900 block of Hillswood Road , Bel Air for a reported suspicious person who was later identified as Dwight Madison .
Madison did not live in the vicinity and claimed that he was looking for a friend who he only knew by a first name .
He was advised to leave the area , which is private property , by the responding deputy .
At 10:54 p.m. deputies were again called to the 900 block of Hillswood Road , Bel Air for a reported suspicious person banging on doors .
The suspicious person was again identified as Dwight Madison who again advised he was homeless and searching for his friend who he only knew by a first name .
Madison was subsequently arrested for trespassing and transported to the Processing Center at the Detention Center .
Madison arrived at the Processing Center at approximately 11:35 p.m .
At 1:24 a.m. on June 12 , 2009 , deputies assigned to the Processing Center attempted to fingerprint Madison as part of the processing procedures .
Madison became uncooperative and refused to comply with deputies ’ instructions .
As a result , Madison was placed back into the holding cell until he became cooperative .
At approximately 9:10 a.m. Madison was approached regarding being fingerprinted and advised he would cooperate with the deputies .
After being fingerprinted deputies began to escort Madison to the commissioner ’s office for his initial hearing when he suddenly became combative and a struggle ensued .
During the confrontation Madison fought with two correctional deputies and one civilian employee .
Madison was able to grab and choke one of the deputies during the struggle .
A third correctional deputy arrived to assist who also was equipped with a TASER Electronic Control Device .
Madison was warned at least two times and physically shown the TASER device .
He continued to be combative and the TASER device was deployed striking Madison in the upper leg .
Madison then fell , striking his head on the floor .
Deputies observed Madison to be in medical distress and rendered aid while also requesting facility medical personnel and an ambulance to assist .
The Bel Air Volunteer Fire Department treated Madison on the scene and transported him to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center .
Madison was later transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma where he later died today , June 13 , 2009 .
One of the involved correctional deputies was treated by Detention Center medical personnel for minor injuries .
Land Short - Term Work With A Dumbed Down Résumé
Résumés should generally be written to highlight your skill sets .
But if you ’re looking to land a short - term job that you ’re overqualified for , you may need to dumb yours down .
Here ’s how to do it .
Photo by kafka4prez .
The WSJ tells the tale of 29 - year - old Kristin Konopka who sent out nearly 100 copies of her résumé in search of receptionist work and got just one callback .
But when Kristin took her master ’s degree and academic teaching experience off the list , the responses started coming in .
According to The Journal , “ candidates are gearing down their résumés by hiding advanced degrees , changing too - lofty titles , shortening work experience descriptions and removing awards and accolades . ”
One temp agency candidate tweaked her résumé titles from “ manager ” and “ freelance trend researcher ” to “ staff ” and “ office support . ”
The reason ?
A too - impressive application can serve as a red flag for employers who feel that an overqualified candidate may jump ship faster than someone with less experience .
The article advises against drastic changes — and you should , of course , keep it honest — but suggests omitting some of your more impressive achievements when you ’re looking to land a job now .
The New Résumé : Dumb and Dumber [ Wall Street Journal ]
GameStop has a business model that might have a shorter half - life than the company 's executives would like to admit .
The retailer makes the majority of its profits from used games and systems , and from selling high - margin items such as controllers and strategy guides .
The large chain has a major question to answer in the next few years : what happens if / when the majority of games are sold online , directly to consumers ?
So far the answer is n't encouraging : " do n't worry about it , digital distribution is a long way off . "
Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia reported on a study conducted by GameStop brass , and the data suggests that gamers wo n't have the technology needed to download games directly until 2014 , and even then only 25 percent of the market will be set up for digital distribution .
The research also indicates that consumers would only pay $ 39.99 for games , meaning prices for software — especially on consoles — would have to come down .
Even then , GameStop believes that it has a place in the new direct - sales ecosystem .
" Management ... feels that digital growth and brick and mortar growth can co-exist , " Bhatia explained .
" Through their brick and mortar locations , the company can help facilitate and capitalize off digital .
Overall , management did not seem at all concerned about the near - term threat but instead is looking at ways to potentially profit from digital . "
GameStop has a large budget and teams of analysts at its disposal to help research data points for these conclusions , and we 'll likely never see the extent of their digging into the future of digital distribution , but it 's hard not to be skeptical of this timeline .
All you need to download games is a roomy hard drive and a broadband connection , and neither of these things are rare among the game - playing public .
Steam has been selling full PC games , at prices higher than $ 39.99 , for some time .
Microsoft is getting ready to begin selling catalog titles from the 360 directly to consumers , without the use of Microsoft Points .
The PSP
Go wo n't use physical media at all , and even gamers with older - model PSP systems can take advantage of the fact that every future title can be downloaded directly from Sony .
The PS3 has likewise enjoyed full - game downloads from the PlayStation Network for some time .
In other words , the future is now ; digital downloads are grabbing hold of the market much quicker than anticipated .
Publishers have a huge incentive to move in this direction : digital downloads can't be resold or bought used , and the industry has never been comfortable with GameStop profiting by selling the same physical game over and over .
Larger retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy might not mind ditching low - margin items such as new games , only keeping a stock of hardware that can be sold alongside high - margin accessories and warranties .
This stops the cycle of " buy game , trade it in , buy another used game , " but GameStop does n't have many other ways of turning a profit .
Gamers in rural areas and those without high - speed connections will remain customers of physical media , but it 's clear that publishers and console manufacturers are invested in the idea of digital distribution and are expanding their offerings aggressively .
We still need storage to get a bit cheaper , and connections to get a little faster , but these are n't large obstacles and will take care of themselves in time .
Does GameStop have an actual plan to deal with the new digital marketplace ?
Surely .
Historically , however , those selling buggies did n't adapt quickly enough to make money off the car movement .
The big names in digital distribution are already setting up virtual shops , and their names are Sony , Microsoft , Nintendo , and Valve .
If GameStop waits too long to stake its own claim , there may be little left to monetize .

Here ’s the deal about this fantastic Cargo Pick - up concept : Traffic ’s bad , it ’s only gonna get worse with time .
To tackle inner city deliveries , is this innovative battery powered vehicle that boasts of variable track , wheelbase and load carrying configurations .
It features a Compact Mode , Narrow Mode ( with banking corner action ) and Pick - up Truck Mode .
The Compact Mode sees the Pick - up section flushed to the back of the cabin .
It ’s an ideal situation for small deliveries .
The Narrow mode gives reduced width and higher maneuverability and as the name suggests , the Pick - up Truck Mode allows you to carry larger payloads .
The Clip - On composite body panels give plenty of real estate for putting up adverts , which I think is a brilliant idea .
The CarGo Pod or the storage compartment when empty can be removed to further reduce the vehicle length .

' Baghdad looked like Austin ' : Perry visits Texans in Iraq Perry makes surprise visit to Texas troops in Iraq
He says life in Baghdad is getting back to normal
Perry said as he returned to Baghdad Saturday night from Camp Taji aboard a Blackhawk helicopter , he could not see the city as one that has been at war .
“ Baghdad looked like Austin , Texas .
Lights were on everywhere .
Traffic is moving through the streets , ” he said .
The governor said when he visited the country in 2006 , most of the nation was still in a blackout from the 2003 war and insurgency .
But he said now people can be seen going to parks and traffic jams are everywhere .
“ I would n't say it 's normal in what you would see in an American city , but the transition Baghdad has made , particularly since ' 06 , is stunning , ” Perry said .
The purpose of the trip was to visit Texas Army National Guard troops stationed in Iraq , as well as regular military troops .
The Defense Department started organizing the trip for governors in May , Perry said .
Other governors on the trip were Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota , Jay Nixon of Missouri , Pat Quinn of Illinois and Jim Gibbons of Nevada .
' 115 on the thermometer '
Perry said it is important for governors to visit troops from their home states to let them know they are remembered and thanked for the job they are doing .
“ It is very , very important that these young men and women see the support of their governors , ” he said , noting there are 4,000 to 5,000 National Guard troops under his command .
“ Yes , it 's hot in Texas , but it was 115 on the thermometer I saw around noon today .
It 's tough working conditions , ” Perry said .
Perry said he was honored to give the combat infantry badge to Command Sgt. Maj .
Travis Petty of Fort Worth and Specialist Bradley Merchant of Lubbock .
“ Whether it 's shaking someone 's hand and telling them they 're doing a great job … it is very important for governors to come and interact with the young men and women under their command , ” Perry said .
The governor said he took some Texas flags that that had over the state Capitol for several commanders .
Perry was in Kuwait when he held a conference call with reporters .
He said he was not returning directly to Texas , but declined to say what remains on his itinerary .
Perry in the past has been criticized for the political timing of trips to the Middle East to visit troops .
He made two trips in 2006 when he was facing re-election .
On one trip with other governors , the airplane they were on took evasive action to avoid a possible missile attack .
This is Perry 's second trip this year .
He also traveled to Iraq in January .
Perry is being challenged in next year 's Republican gubernatorial primary by U.S. Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison .
Democrat Tom Schieffer also is running in the 2010 elections .

It ’s a miracle that there is a comic here because
Wes spent most of his week battling a vending machine and Tony had a run-in with the rebel alliance .
By the way , we have a recent post up on the front page dedicated to all of you sexy spambots out there .
So , you ’ve spent the money on getting your website up and running , you ’ve got the eye - catching web layout and an innovative online business but , do you know how much your site is really worth ?
After all the time and money you ’ve fed into your business venture , is it now living up to its potential and you are thinking about selling ?
Or perhaps it is taking too much of your time and you need to focus your energy elsewhere .
In these cases , you are going to want to know ‘ how much is my website worth ? ’
Our website valuation tool will give you a better grip on where you sit in the online business market , and how to make the most of your website ’s earning potential .
How Does the Website Valuation Tool Work ?
You ’re probably wondering how the value calculator will work for different types of businesses and what it is exactly that makes your business valuable .
Its web economics , and we are here to make sense of it for you .
We use your 12 - month net profit average and multiply it by a multiple to produce a website valuation .
The multiple ranges from 20 - 50 x the net profit .
The multiple is affected by your net profit average and how long your business has been around for .
The higher the net profit , the higher the multiple .
The longer the history of your business , the more attractive it looks to potential buyers .
A steady profit level over time will earn you a higher multiple which will inevitably lead to a higher website valuation .
There are many factors that affect the multiple in this equation .
If you ’re looking at preparing your online business for sale then this is where to focus .
By optimizing the factors below you can ensure your business is ready for a significant increase in multiple and valuation price .
How to Grow Your Website Value
Minimize Your Weak Areas
As an example , instead of having just one supplier for a product , make sure to have a backup in case the supplier becomes unavailable or increases their price and puts your business in jeopardy .
Increase Your Website Traffic
This will increase your revenue , net profit and your multiple !
Use Email Subscribers
When used correctly , email subscribers are a valuable asset to your business and many buyers see great value in this !
Social Media Promotion
An effective driving force of traffic and sales to increase your multiple .
Offer More Products
This will generate more sales and make your business more attractive if you ’re looking to sell .
Minimize The Hours Required
Reduce the amount of time spent on your website every week to make your business more attractive to potential buyers .
What Type of Online Business Do You Have ?
This website value calculator tool can be used to evaluate the value of various types of online businesses , some examples of which we have highlighted below .
Fulfillment By Amazon ( FBA )
Your website makes use of Amazon ’s broad network of fulfillment centers that store your products until they ’re sold .
Not only do they provide a warehouse of sorts , but they also take care of the packaging , shipment , delivery and customer service for you .
You ’re paying to store your products with them and for each product sent out so you have more time on your hands to focus on growing your business .
Google Adsense
You run paid adverts with Google Adsense to make the most out of your website traffic every month .
You ’re involved in the choosing and placement of the ads so you can ensure the most relevant and high paying ads get preference .
DropShipping
Dropshipping websites are involved in the retail of products or services but essentially do not stock or own the products themselves .
The item is sold on your website , purchased from a third party and delivered directly to the customer by your website ’s delivery service .
E-commerce
“ E- commerce ” is a blanket term referring to any online business involved in transactions with consumers .
Think retail , wholesale , dropshipping , crowdfunding , subscription , physical products , digital products or services .
Amazon Associates
Your website makes use of the Amazon Associates program and earns revenue when people click on a link that leads them to Amazon.com resulting in a purchase .
It ’s as simple as creating the link , and earning the referral fee when a product is bought .
Affiliate
Your website drives customers to a retailer .
As an affiliate marketer , you are essentially driving sales to a retailer however , you ’re compensated not only when a sale is made but also potentially when a visitor is redirected to the retailer ’s website .
Monthly Recurring / Subscription
Your website earns revenue primarily from subscriptions .
Customers pay a fee to use the services of your website either by subscribing to a long - term contract or by paying a monthly recurring fee .
Service ( Productized or Other )
You make money by selling a service online .
Whether you do so as a virtual assistant or are directly involved in the service , you ’re essentially selling your time and promising a particular result instead of a tangible product .
Lead Generation
If you ’ve got a lead generation site then you ’ve caught on to the long - term benefit of gaining prospective customers with a particular interest in your website .
Capturing personal information about a potential customer allows you to nurture that customer to the point where they buy your product (s ) or sell it on to other businesses interested in the leads .
SaaS
SaaS stands for “ Software - as - a - Service ” .
It is , simply put , a website that earns an income based on the monthly subscriptions its customers buy in order to use the application it hosts on the cloud .
Businesses needing to use the application can log into their account on your SaaS website and gain access to the application .
Info Product
Your website is a business of providing info products to an information - hungry customer base .
Either in the form of a lengthy , informative PDF or a detailed recorded webinar , the info product earns you money every time it is purchased from your website .
Application
Applications ( or apps ) on smartphones , tablets and ‘ wearables ’ earn money in many ways .
They can either be downloaded for a fee or offer a free download with in - app purchases or in - app ads .
Apps have huge money - making potential and can generate revenue for years after they are developed .
My bud Neil Tyson was on Jimmy Fallon 's TV show the other day , and they asked him a series of questions .
It 's worth watching : About some people 's total credulity when it comes to ridiculous doomsday scenarios , Neil says :
It 's a profound absence of awareness of ... how nature works .
They 're missing some science classes in their training in high school or in college that would empower you to understand and to judge when someone else is basically full of it .
I actually disagree with Neil here ; it 's not that students missed that part of science class , it 's that it was never taught in science class to start with .
It 's very , very rare that science is taught as a process , as a way of knowing .
Instead , it 's taught like a compendium of facts , as dry as a dictionary , and like a dictionary only pulled out when needed .
In fact , the methods of science are a way of understanding everything in the whole Universe , and so can be used all the time , whether it's when you 're deciding to eat a sandwich or when you 're trying to figure out why gamma - ray burst beams are collimated so tightly .
Being skeptical , asking for evidence , examining that evidence , and diagnosing it compared to the whole of learning that goes on around it is the way to go .
That 's how you distinguish sense from nonsense .
It takes work , and sometimes hard work , but it 's worth it .
The prize is understanding .
And I do agree strongly with Neil when he says ,
Sceince is basically an inoculation against charlatans .
Yup .
One of many , but still the best .
Horizon , the commercial organic milk producer , is introducing its first new non-organic products for children .
These will be labeled “ natural , ” not organic .
Horizon ’s press people say the products “ do n’t contain growth hormones and will be easier on the pocketbook …
These are our first natural offerings in the marketplace , and Horizon always tries to provide great - tasting products for moms and for families . ”
Really ?
“ Natural ” is an odd term .
It has no regulatory meaning .
Meats that are “ natural ” are supposed to be minimally processed and if their labels say they were produced without antibiotics or hormones the statements have to be truthful and not misleading .
As I discussed in What to Eat , meat retailers can’t tell the difference between “ natural ” and organic and neither can a lot of consumers .
Retailers are happy to charge the same high prices for the “ natural ” products and consumers think they are buying organics .
This is not a good situation .
So why would a company ostensibly devoted to the principles and practice of organics suddenly decide to start marketing “ natural ” products ?
For the answer , I defer to Mark Kastel of the Cornucopia Institute who sent this message today :
Swine Flu Reality Check
Where flu pandemics hit present and past , with advice on what to do about it .
May 1 , 2009  --
States reporting new cases of swine flu are lighting up the country like election night .
Celebrities , meanwhile , are wearing masks , thousands of children will be out of school for weeks , and many are cancelling their travel plans for fear of a virus that is currently on level 5 out of 6 on the World Health Organizations pandemic alert level .
Swine flu may sound nasty .
As of late Thursday , there are 236 cases of swine flu and eight confirmed deaths worldwide .
But by comparison an estimated 600 people die of tuberculosis , about 1,400 people die from strep and 2,704 people die from a common asbestos - related lung cancer in the United States every year .
Last year the seasonal flu took the lives of 83 children and an estimated 36,000 adults in the United States , according to the CDC .
The head of the CDC 's influenza division , Dr. Nancy Cox , said today that preliminary research suggests the swine flu virus lacks many of the " markers for virulence " possessed by the H1N1 pandemic virus of 1918 .
Because the virus lacks these key components of the virus that killed between 30 - 50 million people nearly a century ago , she suggested that the swine flu may not be as deadly .
" What we have found by looking very carefully at the sequence of the new H1N1 virus is that we 're not seeing the markers for virulence that we saw in 1918 virus , " she said .
Of course , pandemics can be deadly and need public health measures .
But in every flu pandemic since 1918 , the numbers have luckily dwindled .
The 1957 - 1958 pandemic flu took 70,000 deaths above the normal flu season , and the 1968 - 1967 pandemic flu caused 33,000 more deaths than the average flu season .
The virulence of the virus does matter , but public health measures can clearly make a huge difference .
The following are some of the quick facts on the swine flu outbreak so far .
How Worried Are Americans ?
The Harvard School of Public Health conducted a national poll on swine flu this week , the results of which were released Friday .
According to the results :
46 percent of Americans are concerned about catching swine flu in the next year ;
20 percent , are " very " concerned about it ;
53 percent not concerned about encountering the swine flu over the next 12 months .
But that does n't mean Americans are n't taking precautions .
In response to the outbreak :
59 percent of respondents say they have washed their hands or used a hand sanitizer more frequently ; 25 percent have avoided crowded places ; 20 percent have avoided people they think may have recently visited Mexico ; 17 percent have avoided Mexican restaurants or grocery stores ; 8 percent have worn a face mask ; 5 percent have talked with their doctor about swine flu ; 1 percent have gotten a prescription for or purchased antivirals such as Tamiflu or Relenza .

Swine Flu Around the World
International Swine Flu Cases
The WHO has officially confirmed 331 cases of swine flu and 10 deaths .
The numbers increase according to each country 's official tally .
Mexico : 156 cases , 7 deaths .
United States : 141 cases , 1 death Austria : 1 case Canada : 34 cases Germany : 3 cases Israel : 2 cases New Zealand : 3 cases Peru : 1 case Spain : 13 cases Switzerland : 1 case Netherlands : 1 case United Kingdom : 8 cases
The WHO announced suspected cases under investigation in at least 15 other countries .
International Swine Flu News
Mexico 's government suspects nearly 2,300 cases of swine flu and 159 possibly - related deaths ; yet the WHO organization only reports 97 cases in that country .
The Netherlands and Switzerland both reported their first case each yesterday .
Germany , Austria and New Zealand confirmed cases of swine flu Wednesday , April 29 .
A South Korean Catholic nun traveling in Mexico has tested positive for swine flu , according to reporting by ABC's Joohee Cho .
South Korean authorities believe the 51 - year - old woman caught the disease from a taxi driver and have requested the Mexican government look into the matter .
South Korea and Ukraine have temporarily banned all pork imports from North America in response to flu concerns , despite the WHO advisory that the virus is not transferred by eating well - cooked pork and pork products .
Suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries , including : South Korea , Australia , Brazil , Chile , France and South Africa .
Officials around the world have taken measures from closing schools to screening people 's body heat checking for fevers at airports .
How to Protect Yourself
The CDC recommends the following steps to protect yourself from flu .
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze .
Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it .
Wash your hands often with soap and water , especially after you cough or sneeze .
Alcohol - based hands cleaners are also effective .
Doctors say the biggest mistake many make is to just do a quick rinse under the faucet while washing their hands .
Avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth .
Germs spread that way .
Try to avoid close contact with sick people .
Influenza is thought to spread mainly person - to - person through coughing or sneezing of infected people .
If you get sick , CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them .
What Are the Symptoms of Swine Flu ?
The World Health Organization is working to develop a profile of the " typical case " of swine flu , but thus far , the symptoms appear to be essentially the same as those for the usual winter flu .
Hallmark symptoms of flu include :
High fever
Muscle aches
Headache
Fatigue
Coughing
Runny nose
Vomiting and Diarrhea ( less common )

Obama 's Trail of Broken Promises
America has lost her soul , and so has her president .
A despairing country elected a president who promised change .
Americans arrived from every state to witness in bitter cold Obama 's swearing in ceremony .
The mall was packed in a way that it has never been for any other president .
The people 's good will toward Obama and the expectations they had for him were sufficient for Obama to end the gratuitous wars and enact major reforms .
But Obama has deserted the people for the interests .
He is relying on his non-threatening demeanor and rhetoric to convince the people that change is underway .
The change that we are witnessing is in Obama , not in policies .
Obama is morphing into Dick Cheney .
Obama has not been in office four months and already a book could be written about his broken promises .
Obama said he would close the torture prison , Guantanamo , and abolish the kangaroo courts known as military tribunals .
But now he says he is going to reform the tribunals and continue the process , but without confessions obtained with torture .
Getting behind Obama 's validation of the Bush / Cheney policy , House Democrats pulled the budget funding that was to be used for closing Guantanamo .
The policy of kidnapping people ( usually on the basis of disinformation supplied by their enemies ) and whisking them off to third world prisons to be interrogated is to be continued .
Again , Obama has substituted a " reform " for his promise to abolish an illegal policy .
Rendition , Obama says , has also been reformed and will no longer involve torture .
How would anyone know ?
Is Obama going to assign a US government agent to watch over the treatment given to disappeared people by third world thugs ?
Given the proclivity of American police to brutalize US citizens , nothing can save the victims of rendition from torture .
Obama has defended the Bush / Cheney warrantless wiretapping program run by the National Security Agency and broadened the government 's legal argument that " sovereign immunity " protects government officials from prosecution and civil suits when they violate US law and constitutional protections of citizens .
Obama 's Justice Department has taken up the defense of Donald Rumsfeld against a case brought by detainees whose rights Rumsfeld violated .
In a signing statement this month , Obama abandoned his promise to protect whistle - blowers who give information of executive branch illegality to Congress .
Obama is making even more expansive claims of executive power than Bush .
As Bruce Fine puts it : " In principle , President Obama is maintaining that victims of constitutional wrongdoing by the U.S. government should be denied a remedy in order to prevent the American people and the world at large from learning of the lawlessness perpetrated in the name of national security and exacting political and legal accountability . "
Obama , in other words , is committed to covering up the Bush regime 's crimes and to ensuring that his own regime can continue to operate in the same illegal and unconstitutional ways .
Obama is fighting the release of the latest batch of horrific torture photos that have come to light .
Obama claims that release of the photos would anger insurgents and cause them to kill our troops .
That , of course , is nonsense .
Those resisting occupation of their land by US troops and NATO mercenaries are already dedicated to killing our troops , and they know that Americans torture whomever they capture .
Obama is fighting the release of the photos , because he knows the barbaric image that the photos present of the US military will undermine the public 's support for the wars that enrich the military / security complex , appease the Israel Lobby , and repay the campaign contributions that elect the US government .
As for bringing the troops home from Iraq , this promise , too , has been reformed .
To the consternation of his supporters , Obama is leaving 50,000 US soldiers in Iraq .
The others are being sent to Afghanistan and to Pakistan , where on Obama 's watch war has broken out big time with already one million refugees from the indiscriminate bombing of civilians .
Meanwhile , war with Iran remains a possibility , and at Washington 's insistence , NATO is conducting war games on former Soviet territory , thus laying the groundwork for future enrichment of the US military / security complex .
The steeply rising US unemployment rate will provide the needed troops for Obama 's expanding wars .
Obama can give a great speech without mangling the language .
He can smile and make people believe his rhetoric .
The world , or much of it , seems to be content with the soft words , which now drape Dick Cheney 's policies in pursuit of executive supremacy and US hegemony
State leaders talking again - budget woes go on State 's fiscal crisis
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Los Angeles , talks with reporters as she and Assembly Minority Leader Sam Blakeslee , R - San Luis Obispo leave Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Capitol office during a break in a budget negotiations in Sacramento , Calif. , Friday , July 10 , 2009 .

California 's fiscal crisis continued unabated Friday with most major banks refusing to cash the state 's IOUs starting today , the state controller delaying $ 4 billion in payments to public schools , and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders still looking for a compromise to solve the state 's huge deficit .
Schwarzenegger and the four legislative leaders returned to the negotiating table Friday for the first time since Monday , when Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) , refused to meet with the governor .
She protested that his insistence on long - term budget fixes would have little or no impact in closing the current $ 26.3 billion shortfall .
The state 's top leaders met for about 2 1/2 hours Friday afternoon before taking a break .
" Negotiations have started out on a good note , " Schwarzenegger said outside his office .
State Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , called the talks " the most constructive discussion we have had in weeks . "
By early evening , the legislative leaders returned to Schwarzenegger 's Capitol office for additional closed - door talks that continued into the night .
The leaders said they expected to meet through the weekend .
As the state 's top leaders continue to struggle to find a compromise in erasing the massive deficit , the state 's finances continued to crumble .
State Controller John Chiang and state Superintendent of Instruction Jack O'Connell said $ 4 billion in payments to local school districts that were supposed to go out on Friday will be delayed until July 30 .
The move will conserve cash for the state , which has been issuing IOUs since July 2 .
O'Connell said this is yet another example of the state 's public schools receiving a disproportionate share of pain in the state 's fiscal crisis .
As of Friday morning , the state controller had mailed 101,930 IOUs covering more than $ 389 million in payments , said Hallye Jordan , a spokeswoman for Chiang .
And despite a plea from state Treasurer Bill Lockyer that banks extend their Friday deadline to accept the IOUs , most refused to do so .
Citibank agreed to a one - week extension , while Bank of the West said it will accept IOUs until further notice .
The banks that rejected extension requests include Bank of America , Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase and Union Bank , said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Lockyer .
The pain of IOUs will be especially excruciating for vendors that have contracts with the state , business owners say .
Receiving IOUs as payment has been like adding insult to injury because the state has n't been making its payments on time this year , they say .
" The Department of Corrections alone owes ( me ) about $ 18,000 , " said Ken Jackson , whose company has been delivering janitorial supplies such as hand towels and toilet paper to state buildings and prisons for nearly two decades .
He received an IOU for $ 2,300 that he deposited , he said , but his bank , Westamerica in Vallejo , wo n't accept IOUs as of today .
" What we 're doing is floating the state , " Jackson said .
" And my suppliers are not going to float me . "
Last year ,
Acer ’s market share grew by 3 percentage points , to 10.9 percent , while Dell gained just 0.1 percentage point , to 15 percent , according to the research company IDC .
Acer has continued to narrow that gap this year , claiming 11.6 percent of the market to Dell ’s 13.6 percent through the first quarter .
Mr. Lanci says he thinks that Acer can keep growing , especially in the United States and China  the two most prized regions for PC sellers .
In addition , he ’s steering Acer into cellphones , arguing that the growing similarities between smartphones and laptops play directly to Acer ’s strengths .
“ I think we have the know - how , and these two worlds are going to merge , ” he says .
In the meantime , Acer has snatched the mantle of quick - moving , lean operator from Dell .
Be it wireless technology or super - thin laptops with a long battery life , Acer often ships computers with new features before any other large PC maker .
And when it spots a hot trend started by another company  netbooks , for instance , were the brainchild of Asustek , a fellow Taiwanese company 
Acer follows in force , bombarding the market with low - cost products .
Paul S. Otellini , the chief executive of Intel , credits
Acer with embracing its underdog role and taking big risks to disrupt the status quo .
“ They have done a spectacular job , ” he says .
Acer ’s quest comes with challenges , of course .
Its low - cost operating structure leaves only so much money for research and development .
H.P. knocks
Acer as having a limited breadth of products and a dearth of the homegrown features that can command higher prices .
And Dell has moved into retail , Acer ’s home turf , while also releasing a flood of eye - catching new designs meant to tempt consumers .
“ I think Acer is just one more competitor that does n’t focus on anything other than public relations to win in the marketplace , ” said Todd Bradley , the head of H.P. ’s computer business .
Image Acer has risen swiftly on the strength of netbooks and laptops , and its chief , Gianfranco Lanci , sees an opening with smartphones .
Credit ... Ashley Pon for The New York Times
Such comments , however , come as H.P. ’s revenue from the PC business has declined 19 percent in each of the last two quarters .
Dell ’s decline has been even more severe , with desktop sales falling about 30 percent each quarter .
Acer ’s overall revenue has fallen as well , but only 7 percent and 8 percent , respectively .

I wanted to give my opinion on why the XHTML2 Working Group failed while the topic was still under discussion .
These are thoughts based on my memory of various events ( including many mailing list discussions , a workshop in 2004 , and some technical plenaries ) , and my memory may not be perfect .
But impressions do matter ( since they lead to events ) , and in this case I 'd like to convey my impressions , even if I have n't gone back to find all the mailing list messages or the minutes of meetings that made me form those impressions .
The work on XHTML2 started at a time when the technology underlying the Web ( as experienced by the bulk of users and content providers ) was stagnating .
Internet Explorer had a monopoly or near - monopoly in the Web browser market .
Microsoft was slowing development of new versions of Internet Explorer in the hope that Web - based applications would not be able to compete with Windows applications , and Windows applications would keep people locked in to the Windows operating system .
Thus XHTML2 was developed with no expectation that the leading Web browser would ever implement it .
In that environment , other groups working on Web technologies kept working with other browser makers , in the hope that the success of their technology in other browsers would eventually pressure Microsoft into implementing .
However , the developers of XHTML took a more extreme position : they wanted to build a separate Web , of their own technology , designed “ the right way . ”
Their Web technology would be browsed with different software that would eventually displace current Web browsers — all current Web browsers .
This showed when members of the group spoke to authors : they showed uses that did n't depend on browsers implementing HTML , and emphasized those uses , to try to build up a critical mass of users .
The working group became hostile to Web browser implementors , even those implementors who were trying to move the Web forward .
They discouraged those implementors from participating , and did n't think about what might get those implementors back into their fold .
This showed when they did n't care whether it was possible to implement XHTML2 in the same software that already implemented other Web technologies .
For example , they required different processing for " new " documents , but provided no mechanism to distinguish them from " old " ones .
( And they did this twice , once with XHTML1 and again with XHTML2 . )
Finally , this lack of communication led past the intended divergence , to unintended divergence .
XHTML2 became unnecessarily different in ways that would make it even harder to bring back into today 's Web .
Well , this plan to replace the Web does n't seem to have worked so far .
And the Web browser market is becoming more competitive : enough that we 're pushing today 's Web forward so that more things can be built on it .
We do n't need to replace it with a new one .
Microsoft today announced Windows 7 retail pricing , upgrade information , launch details , and a preorder deal .
The software giant has reduced the price on its most popular retail Windows product , the Home Premium upgrade version , by approximately 10 percent ( this varies based on the market ) .
In the US , this means a drop from $ 130 to $ 120 , a savings of $ 10 .
For the Home Premium full version , the price drops from $ 240 to $ 200 .
Those are the only differences when comparing Windows Vista prices to Windows 7 prices after Microsoft made cuts in in February 2008 ( compared to the ones announced in September 2006 ) .
The table below summarizes the slow drop in cost for Windows Vista and Windows 7 in the US :
Upgrade retail products
Windows Vista
as of 1/2007
Price Windows Vista
as of 2/2008
Price Windows 7
as of 10/2009
Price Home Premium $ 159.99 Home Premium $ 129.99 Home Premium $ 119.99 Business $ 199.99 Business $ 199.99 Professional $ 199.99 Ultimate $ 259.99 Ultimate $ 219.99 Ultimate $ 219.99
Full retail products
Windows Vista
as of 1/2007
Price Windows Vista
as of 2/2008
price Windows 7
as of 10/2009
Price Home Premium $ 239.99 Home Premium $ 239.99 Home Premium $ 199.99 Business $ 299.99 Business $ 299.99 Professional $ 299.99 Ultimate $ 399.99 Ultimate $ 319.99 Ultimate $ 319.99
Comparing the Windows Vista retail pricing at launch to the Windows 7 retail pricing at launch , the differences are much more notable .
The Home Premium upgrade version has dropped $ 40 and the Ultimate upgrade version has dropped $ 40 .
The Home Premium full version has dropped $ 40 and the Ultimate full version has dropped $ 80 .
However , Microsoft has not touched the pricing for the Professional edition ( previously called the Business edition ) .
This might be attributed to the fact that in Windows 7 , every edition is a superset of the previous one .
That means that unlike Windows Vista Business , Windows 7 Professional will contain all the features that the Home Premium edition has , and thus Microsoft cannot justify a price drop .
Upgrading from XP or Vista with a retail copy
While these price changes are positive for consumers ( none of the products has increased in price ) , they are rather disappointing for those hoping for much more aggressive price slashes given the current economic climate .
Thankfully , retail pricing is typically used as a starting point ; most users will not be buying retail versions anyway .
Retail sales account for less than 5 percent of Windows sales , the rest of sales are via OEM .
Some consumers will either grab an OEM copy via an online or in - store purchase , but most will be getting a copy of Windows 7 with the next purchase of their PC .
Windows XP users need to know that regardless of which edition they currently have installed ( Windows XP Home , Windows XP Professional , or Windows XP Media Center Edition ) and regardless of which edition of Windows 7 they are moving to ( Home Premium , Professional , or Ultimate ) , they will need to perform a clean install , whether they buy the upgrade or full version .
The hassle of backing up applications and user data will fall on the user ; a clean install will not back up anything .
Using Windows Easy Transfer , users can copy their important files and settings to an external USB stick , external hard drive , or DVD , and then move the data back after the installation .
The installer will verify that XP is genuine and Windows 7 will have to be installed on the same partition as the XP installation .
The good news is that Microsoft is allowing XP users to buy the cheaper upgrade version if they want to ( Microsoft typically lets owners of the two previous releases of Windows to do this , in this case XP and Vista ) .
Windows Vista users can follow multiple upgrade paths to Windows 7 .
As was the case when upgrading from XP to Vista , you will only need to perform a clean install if you are going to a version that is lower on the food chain .
For example , if you are going from Windows Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Home Premium , you would do a clean install .
If you are going from Windows Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate , you do not need to do a clean install .
When you switch to a higher version , you 're adding on the existing functionality , but when you 're going to a lesser version , you 're taking away functionality , thus the need for a clean install .
Clean installs will also have to be performed when upgrading from a 32 - bit version to a 64 - bit version , regardless of edition .
Unless the user chooses to repartition or format the current partition , Vista 's files from C:WINDOWS will be preserved under C:WINDOWS.OLD , just as when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows Vista .
As with Vista , each DVD includes the various editions .
Unlike Vista , every edition of Windows 7 is a superset of the previous edition , so you will not lose any features when upgrading .
Once you have some edition of Windows 7 on your system , whether you purchased it via an OEM or just upgraded from Windows XP or Windows Vista , you will be able to upgrade to a " more premium " version of Windows 7 by purchasing an upgrade key to unlock additional features , just as with Vista .
This is called Windows Anytime Upgrade ( WAU ) .
For example , you could start off with Windows Vista Home Premium , upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium , and then later choose to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional .
Windows 7 E : no upgrades for the EU
Both Windows XP and Windows Vista come with Internet Explorer , and the upgrade editions of Windows 7 were never tested to handle the installation of Windows 7 without Internet Explorer .
Mike Ybarra , general manager of product management of Windows , told Ars that Microsoft had three choices for the release of Windows 7 E : delay the whole release of Windows 7 to make sure everyone gets the release of Windows 7 at the same time and without any upgrade problems , delay the release of Windows 7 just in Europe and have this market wait till Windows 7 E passes all upgrade tests , or do n't offer upgrade versions at all .
Microsoft chose the last solution , and it's actually a pretty good one , for both Microsoft and consumers .
Windows 7
E editions will be sold only in full versions : there will be no upgrade versions available in the European Union .
The good news is that the full versions will be available at the upgrade price , though if history is any indication , they 'll likely still be higher than the US upgrade prices shown above .
Microsoft announced two weeks ago that it was shipping Windows 7 in Europe without Internet Explorer 8 installed in response to the EU 's antitrust investigation of its browser with Windows .
Preorder Windows 7 cheaply
In select markets , Microsoft is offering its customers the ability to preorder Windows 7 upgrade versions at a significantly reduced price .
This is easily the most aggressive pricing Microsoft has ever offered for Windows .
The low preorder price will vary per country :
US : Windows 7 Home Premium ( $ 49.99 ) and Windows 7 Professional ( $ 99.99 )
Canada : Windows 7 Home Premium ( $ 64.99 ) and Windows 7 Professional ( $ 124.99 )
Japan : Windows 7 Home Premium ( �7,407 ) and Windows 7 Professional ( �14,073 )
UK : Windows 7 Home Premium ( �49.99 ) and Windows 7 Professional ( �99.99 )
France and Germany : Windows 7 Home Premium ( �49.99 ) and Windows 7 Professional ( �109.99 )
The deal includes select retail partners , such as Best Buy and Amazon , as well as the online Microsoft Store .
This program begins Friday , June 26 in the US , Canada , and Japan .
It goes on while supplies last or until July 11 in the US and Canada , and until July 5 in Japan .
For the UK , France , and Germany , the preorder starts July 15 and runs while supplies last or until August 14 .
Microsoft was not willing to discuss the limits of the supplies , but a spokesperson did confirm to Ars that the reduced prices for the European countries will simply apply to the full version ( as noted above ) , as upgrade versions will not exist in Europe .
In short , these preorders will allow those in the UK , Germany , and France to purchase full versions of Home Premium or Professional , except without IE8 , for a very low price .
Windows 7 Upgrade Option Program
Waiting to buy a PC until Windows 7 is released can be frustrating ( especially given the upcoming back - to - school season ) , so Microsoft is making an upgrade offer similar to what it did for consumers buying XP but who wanted to secure a copy Vista : buy a Windows Vista PC as of June 26 and receive the equivalent edition of Windows 7 when it comes out .
If the June 26 date sounds familiar , that 's because it was rumored earlier this month via a leaked Best Buy memo ( contra the rumor pointing to July 1 being the date ) .
Microsoft will be offering the program globally until January 31 , 2010 but OEMs can cut it off early if they choose to .
The offer will be available only from participating OEMs or retailers and encompasses Windows Vista Home Premium , Windows Vista Business , and Windows Vista Ultimate .
For example , if you purchase a computer with Windows Vista Home Premium on it , once it is available , you will get a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium to upgrade to .
Further details will be available soon at windows.com/upgradeoffer and windows7upgradeoption.com .
Ybarra told Ars that Microsoft would not charge consumers for Windows 7 if they purchased a Vista PC between tomorrow and the day of general availability .
He did admit , however , that OEMs can choose the price of the upgrade , possibly charging for shipping and handling fees .
Furthermore , it will be up to OEMs to decide which computers the upgrade offer will be available on , so it 's unlikely that low - end computers like netbooks or PCs on sale will have this offer .
Windows 7 in your language
Microsoft is promising that all major OEMs will have PCs with Windows 7 shipping in all language versions beginning on the day of general availability , October 22 , 2009 .
However , the same cannot be said for the Windows 7 retail versions .
On October 22 , they will be available in 14 languages : English , Spanish , Japanese , German , French , Italian , Dutch , Russian , Polish , Brazilian Portuguese , Korean , Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese , and Chinese ( Hong Kong ) .
On October 31 , the remaining 21 languages will become available : Turkish , Czech , Portuguese , Hungarian , Swedish , Danish , Norwegian , Finnish , Greek , Ukrainian , Romanian , Arabic , Lithuanian , Bulgarian , Estonian , Slovenian , Hebrew , Thai , Croatian , Serbian Latin , and Latvian .
This wait of just over one week is a big improvement over Windows Vista 's launch : the wait between the initial launch in the US and all the languages becoming available was about three months .
This theme of " better than Vista " that we 're seeing with Windows 7 is apparent in today 's announcement as well : the release has better pricing and will be more rapidly broadly available .
However , whether " better than Vista " will be good enough for consumers to switch away from their current operating system is up to the market to decide .
That said , we 're optimistic , as Microsoft is quite obviously listening intently this time around .
Update
A few readers have asked in the comments and via e-mail about retail pricing in other countries .
While we begged for pricing in every country , a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars that only pricing for the EU and the UK were available :

A new study from University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School finds that women homeowners are an average of 12 pounds heavier than renters .
They ’re also more aggravated and spend less time socializing .
Thing is , it ’s hard to tell why .
Figuring it out , the article notes , presents a chicken - and - egg type problem , since two lines of homeowner reasoning are possible :
a) Now that I ’ve gone and bought a house , I may as well make owning my house worthwhile by maxing and relaxing in it as much as humanly possible .
b ) I really like maxing and relaxing .
Much more than , say , going for a walk with my friends .
Gosh , it ’d be great to have my very own M&R temple .
Previous studies have shown that homeowners are happier than renters , but they did n’t control for external factors , like whether or not the subjects have kids .
This study did .
Have you recently switched from renting to owning or vice versa ?
What ’s it like ?

Please digg this post or email it in order to spread it around as a way to show the below companies that you refuse to accept their distorting our democracy and engangering us in the process .
On April 23 , Andrew Revkin of the New York Times published a story proving conclusively that the so - called Global Climate Coalition , a group representing industries with profits tied to fossil fuels , knew that they were lying when they ran " an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign against the idea that emissions of heat - trapping gases could lead to global warming . "
According to Revkin :
... a document filed in a federal lawsuit demonstrates that even as the coalition worked to sway opinion , its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted .
“ The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied , ” the experts wrote in an internal report compiled for the coalition in 1995 .
A working democracy requires a correctly informed electorate .
Deliberately lying to the public is a direct assault on the American system of democracy .
To use power and money to lie to the American public is to distort our electoral process .
And to do it knowing what is at stake is just unfathomable .
We are now at the point where we are near the climate tipping point .
Without the efforts of the so - called Global Climate Coalition ( GCC ) , and other organizations like it , we may have been able to get to work on this planetary problem a decade or even 20 years ago .
This is like a health insurance company refusing treatment to a child with cancer , except that we are talking about refusing treatment to billions of children -- an entire planet 's worth .
In the course of it's work , according to SourceWatch , the GCC spent tens of millions of dollars on ad campaigns trying to stop action on global warming and made millions of dollars of contributions to politicians to influence their decisions .
The companies who exhibited this gross disregard for human life continue to wield power in the ongoing discussion about how to ameliorate the climate crisis .
It is important to know , therefore , exactly which companies are prone to lie and distort the truth so we know not to believe them in the future .
For that reason , here , according to SourceWatch , is the list of members of the so - called Global Climate Coalition , who tried for so long to mislead us .
I hope you 'll digg or stumble or email this post around to make sure it is seen and read and to show these companies that we wo n't accept this kind of this behavior :
( CNN ) --
Two unmanned NASA spacecraft reached the moon 's orbit Tuesday morning and began the process of mapping its surface for future missions .
An unmanned NASA spacecraft captured this image of the moon from about 5,000 miles away Tuesday .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , a satellite whose instruments will help scientists compile high resolution , three - dimensional maps of the moon 's surface , entered lunar orbit at 6:27 a.m. ET .
About two hours later , the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Spacecraft ( LCROSS ) swung past the moon on its way into an elongated Earth orbit .
The spacecraft sent streaming video back to Earth , shown on a NASA Web site , for an hour as it passed the moon .
The two spacecraft lifted off June 18 atop the same Atlas V rocket .
The mission is the first in NASA 's plan to return to the moon , then travel to Mars and beyond , the space agency said .
During the mission , the agency will collect all sorts of data , including day - night temperature maps , NASA said .
There is particular emphasis on the polar areas of the moon , where sunlight is more plentiful and where water might exist .
The LCROSS is scheduled to crash land on the moon Oct. 9 to search for the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon 's South Pole .
The data that the LRO collects and sends to Earth also will be used in planning an eventual lunar outpost , the agency said .
During its mission , the orbiter also will spend at least a year looking for potential landing sites for astronauts .

The History Channel issues cease and desist to bloggers
Update : CLIO removes campaign from list of winners on website
Update : Camaign won silver Clio – but where did it run ?
Update : Conservative commentators took aim at campaign before lawyers stepped in
MarkLives received a cease and desist letter from AETN , parent company of The History Channel , demanding we remove advertising material for The History Channel from this site .
For the record , the campaign in question was submitted by Multichoice agency Ogilvy Johannesburg , along with the information in the copy still below to MarkLives.com who published it in good faith .
The AETN letter read in part ; “ AETN is the owner of numerous trademarks associated with its History network , including the world famous marks THE HISTORY CHANNEL and the H logo ( which are the subject of numerous trademark registrations worldwide ) .
Neither the use and display of AETN ’s trademarks nor the purported advertisements themselves were authorized by AETN .
As such , your display and hosting of this unauthorized content violates our rights under relevant law and constitutes , among other things , trademark infringement , dilution and tarnishment of our brands and marks , misrepresentation , interference with contract , and unfair business practices .
We therefore demand that you immediate cease and desist from all use and display of AETN ’s trademarks , and take all necessary action to remove , delete , and disable the identified content from your website . ”
It seems we were not the only site targeted by AETNs lawyers .
Adsoftheworld.com removed the material from their site on the same day MarkLives.com received the threat of legal action .
MarkLives.com showcases great South African design .
We believe in fair use .
We believe in creative freedom and that governments and corporations have erred in insisting in ever tightening copyright laws .
It stifles creativity and innovation rather than promoting it .
Some laws are needed but we have allowed ourselves to be boxed in by greed and short - sightedness .
Everything has to be inspired by something and piracy to our minds should be the primary concern of these laws rather than the diminishment of fair use .
Today corporations think they control calendar years – think 2010 – or letters of the alphabet .
It has gone too far .
For the record we believe corporate lawyers are increasingly a threat to freedom of speech and therefore to constitutional democracy .
They no longer have to win cases , only draw it out until under funded media independents go broke , as have been explained to me by one such lawyer trying to close down another unrelated article ( in the end they failed ) .
Normally we would stand firm against such editorial interference .
However , in an email to AETN , Ogilvy Johannesburg and MarkLives.com , Graham Pfuhl , Marketing and Sales Director at Multichoice , stated that the campaign in question was in fact rejected by Multichoice , and confirmed “ no History Channel ads can be published without the prior authorization of AETN . ”
Would an ad agency really go ahead and produce a campaign without some sort of authorisation ?
The point remains unclear as no official correspondence was received from Ogilvy Johannesburg at the time of publication .
While awaiting feedback from Ogilvy , we do believe everybody has a right to put their case after all , and having informed AETN of this fact , they sent us another note stating “ We do not understand why , now that you have actual knowledge that this content was unauthorized , you continue to post it and to point to Ogilvy as the source , and this notwithstanding Ogilvy ’s clarifications to you and apologies to AETN [ Ogilvy has not yet publicly responded , only Multichoice has – ed ] .
We are sure that you realize that your continued actions subject you to liability regardless of who provided you the content or the circumstances of that delivery . ”
This hard headed stance once it was clear that MarkLives.com had no malicious intent in publishing the images ( they might be uninformed of this point in South African law ) and that we needed some time to allow all the affected parties to respond should weigh heavily on AETN .
The profound disrespect shown for proper journalistic practise in a country whose democracy is only 15 years old and where good media practice should be encouraged tells us much of the limiting stands corporations often seek out .
In the end MarkLives decided to remove the content in question though the ads can still be viewed elsewhere on the Web ( mostly on Russian language sites it seems ) .
Meanwhile the debate the ads sparked on other advertising sites , particularly Adsoftheworld and mostly around the perceived anti-American stance the ads take and from which we guess The History Channel wanted to disassociate itself has been cut short , brutally and effectively .

Body art is art made on , with , or consisting of , the human body .
The most common forms of body art are tattoos and body piercings , but other types include scarification , branding , scalpelling , shaping ( for example tight - lacing of corsets ) , full body tattoo and body painting .
More extreme body art can involve things such as mutilation or pushing the body to its physical limits .
For example , one of Marina Abramovic 's works involved dancing until she collapsed from exhaustion , while one of Dennis Oppenheim 's better - known works saw him lying in the sunlight with a book on his chest , until his skin , excluding that covered by the book , was badly sunburned .
It can even consist of the arrangement and dissection of preserved bodies in an artistic fashion , as in the case of the plastinated bodies used in the travelling Body Worlds exhibit .
Body art is also a sub-category of performance art , in which artists use or abuse their own body to make their particular statements .

Carl Friend 's Minicomputer " Museum "
- Welcome ! -
Welcome to Carl Friend 's computer " museum " .
In reality , this is a private collection covering a range of calculating machines from slide rules to reasonably modern microcomputers and workstations ; however , the " crown jewels " of my collection are the minicomputers .
What 's here :
In the press : On 1999/09/28 I was the subject of a feature article in the Worcester ( MA ) Telegram & Gazette .
Copyright © 1996 - 2007 , Carl R. Friend .
I wrote last week about a positive portrayal of a Muslim woman who had recently been voted president of a mosque .
I ’m going to stick with the positive stuff for at least another week ( although , considering the state of global media portrayals of Muslim women , this probably wo n’t last too much longer ) and talk about a recent Toronto Star article about Kamala Suraiyya , a Muslim poet and writer from southern India , who has recently passed away .
Cleo Paskal , the journalist , who knew Kamala Suraiyya as a family friend , remembers her as
an award - winning writer and poet who was famous for unflinchingly , and controversially , writing about every aspect of being human , including love , sex and religion .
Her honesty , beautifully packaged in elegant turns of phrase , combined with her social activism to make her an icon .
Paskal describes Suraiyya as a popular and gracious figure who was constantly receiving visitors :
They came from all over the world : editors from New York wanting to include her poems in their anthologies , village women wanting to talk about their hardships , TV producers wanting to serialize her short stories , politicians wanting endorsements , believers wanting blessings .
They were all looking for something .
And what they found was Kamala .
I watched as she gave and gave and gave .
Time , bangles , tears , laughter , advice , admonitions , poems .
She held court in the grandest tradition , welcoming each and every one with honour and respect .
By this point , when I was reading the article , I had assumed that Suraiyya was not Muslim , so I was surprised to get to the part where Paskal mentioned that Suraiyya had in fact become Muslim in 1999 , at the age of 65 .
I had to ask myself , why had I been so quick to assume that she was non-Muslim , especially because the whole reason that I was reading the article was that my Google News search had indicated that the word “ Muslim ” appeared in the article ?
I think one of the reasons I was surprised is that Muslim women are so often talked about as if the “ Muslim ” part overtakes all other facets of our identities .
To go more than half an article before specifying that its main subject is Muslim seems pretty unusual .
Granted , the article was written by a friend of Suraiyya ’s who knew her before she was Muslim , so it makes sense that the focus was on other things ( and that the journalist obviously saw her as more than just “ a Muslim woman . ” )
However , given how rare it is for “ Muslim ” to be represented as only one facet of a person ’s identity , instead of the overarching label that dominates the portrait , it was good to see this description emphasize the multiple identities that any Muslim woman may happen to have .
Even the fact that she had embraced Islam after coming from a Hindu family is n’t made into a big deal .
Suraiyya passed away on May 31 of this year , and Paskal ’s description of the multi - faith memorials for her is especially powerful :
The burial was at Palayam Mosque in the state capital , Thiruvananthapuram .
It is one of the most conservative in Kerala and was chosen in part because it shares a wall with a temple , and is close to a church – symbolizing Kamala ’s universal importance .
In keeping with the spirit of Kamala , the Islamic community made sure that all were welcome .
I was privileged to be there , and it was remarkable .
Women , including non-Muslims , were allowed to participate in preparing the body for burial .
Hindu and Christian leaders , and one of the city ’s oldest Jewish families attended .
It was accepting , emotive and powerful .
Like Kamala .
Already the unprecedented coming together of so many faiths on the welcoming grounds of the mosque is having a resounding , rebounding , positive effect .
Mosques throughout the world held prayers for Kamala , and prayers were said for her in churches and temples .
This description provides a welcome contrast to images of Islam and Muslims as intolerant of other religions and incapable of existing peacefully with followers of other faiths .
This is n’t even portrayed as something out of the ordinary , but as a normal way that one woman related to the members of her community .
I am not at all familiar with Kamala Suraiyya ’s work , so I ca n’t comment on her as a writer ; however , the positive and loving portrayal in this article shows that Muslim women fall into many different categories besides “ Muslim ” – writers , activists , mentors – and that it is possible for Muslims to exist in close and respectful relationships to people of all different religions .
It is , perhaps , sad that we should have to celebrate this fact ( since this image may seem obvious to many of us ) , but considering all the representations out there of Muslims as inherently violent and intolerant , descriptions such as this one , of alternate possibilities , are always nice to see .
Vas asks the question , how come the following does n't satisfy the guardedness condition ?
Set Implicit Arguments .
CoInductive LList ( A : Set ) : Set := | LNil : LList A | LCons : A -> LList A -> LList A. Implicit Arguments LNil [ A ] .
CoFixpoint append ( A: Set ) ( l1 l2 : LList A ) : LList A := match l1 with | LNil => l2 | LCons x xs => LCons x ( append xs l2 ) end .
CoFixpoint cycle ( A : Set ) ( input : LList A ) : LList A := match input with | LNil => LNil | LCons x xs => LCons x ( append xs ( cycle input ) ) (* " unguarded recursive call " *) end .
The problems with this is that Coq is concerned that append will do something nasty like consume some constructors .
If it did then cycle would not be productive .
The first solution I came up with was to inline append and simplify .
That worked , but I did n't understand why Coq was n't doing that in the original code .
Coq will do reduction when checking the guardedness condition .
The problem was that my simplifications was neither β nor ι reduction .
I was substituting parametric parameters into the definition of append .
If we make the parametric parameters actual function parameters , then Coq will be able to do this substitution by β reduction .
One small problem is that A and l2 are the parametric parameters , and we will need to reorder the parameters so that all the parametric ones come first .
However , a little notation will allow us to write the parameters in a natural order .
Set Implicit Arguments .
CoInductive LList ( A : Set ) : Set := | LNil : LList A | LCons : A -> LList A -> LList A. Implicit Arguments LNil [ A ] .
Section Append .
Variable A: Set. Variable l2:LList A. CoFixpoint append0 l1 : LList A := match l1 with | LNil => l2 | LCons x xs => LCons x ( append0 xs ) end .
End Append .
Notation " ' append ' l1 l2 " := ( append0 l2 l1 ) ( at level 0 , l1 at level 0 , l2 at level 0 ) .
CoFixpoint cycle ( A : Set ) ( input : LList A ) : LList A := match input with | LNil => LNil | LCons x xs => LCons x ( append xs ( cycle input ) ) end .
I 'm not an expert on parsing levels , but setting everything to level 0 seems to work in the few cases I 've tried .
Defining an infix notation is probably more reasonable for append anyways .
In the German capital , Berlin , 36 % of children are considered poor
By Steve Rosenberg
BBC News , Berlin
If you want to know what child poverty looks like in Germany , do not go onto the streets ; go into homes , into living rooms and talk to people like the Thiel family .
Twelve - year - old Jasmin
Thiel and her twin brother Florian do not look poor .
They have a DVD player and a colour TV .
Jasmin is clutching a mobile phone .
If we have problems with our banks , the politicians come together to find a solution very quickly ...
Nobody comes together to help the children
Michael Kruse
Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk
But they are among the millions in Germany caught in a growing pool of poverty .
Much of what this Berlin family owns , from their furniture to their clothes , has been handed out by local charities .
The mother Andrea has no partner , no job , and receives a welfare cheque which barely covers the bills .
" Once I 've paid for rent and for electricity , " Ms Thiel explains , " I only have about 200 euros [ £ 172 ] left a month . "
" I 've got to buy all our food with that , plus all the things the kids need for school .
We usually run out of money before the month 's over . "
Single mothers Jasmin and Florian go to a local soup kitchen for their lunch .
It is in a children 's centre called Die Arche ( The Arc ) , which keeps poor children fed and off the streets .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
One girl , nine - year - old Anne - Marie , is rummaging in a basket of second - hand clothes .
" The shoes I 'm wearing now I found here , " she tells me .
" I got some trousers here , too , and a pullover . "
Anne -Marie is part of an astonishing statistic ; in Berlin 36 % of children are considered poor .
" Most of the children in Berlin live in families like you can find here in Die Arche , " says the centre 's spokesman , Wolfgang Boescher .
" The typical family is a mother without a husband .
She has two or three children from different men , and she has no job , she is not able to work , " he adds .
Shrinking economy Across Germany , one in six children live in " relative poverty " , which means in families whose monthly income is 60 % or less of the national average .
I think we will have an increase in child poverty around 2 - 3 % this year
Professor Hans Bertram
Among the causes of poverty here are the growing number of single mothers , many of whom struggle to find work ; the higher birth rate in lower income families ; and , some maintain , the controversial welfare reforms pushed through by the previous government .
It was not the global downturn which pushed these children into poverty , but with Germany 's economy expected to shrink by up to 6 % this year , there is concern that the recession is now placing even more youngsters at risk of hardship .
" I think we will have an increase in child poverty around 2 - 3 % this year , " predicts Professor Hans Bertram , one of Germany 's leading researchers into child poverty .
" Of course , if people are out of work they have a lot of problems to run a family . "
' Wrong priorities '
The German Society for the Protection of Children is even more worried .
Centres like Die Arche have been set up to keep children off the streets
It warns of a " massive " increase in child poverty , once the full effects of the recession kick in .
Germany is not alone .
Governments around the world appear to be losing the battle against child poverty .
In the UK , ministers have admitted it will now be " very difficult " to meet their target of halving child poverty by 2010 .
In the US , which already has one of the worst child poverty rates among industrialised nations , three million more children are expected to slip below the poverty line .
Charities have been criticising the German government for not doing enough to tackle the problem .
" If we have problems with our banks , or with our car producers , the politicians come together to find a solution very quickly .
They give money and credits , " says Michael Kruse of Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk .
Andrea
Thiel says most companies do not want to hire people her age " But when I tell them we have three million children who have no future and no money , nobody comes together to help the children .
I think it 's the wrong priority of our society . "
Back in their flat , the Thiel family sits watching TV .
It is one of the few family activities they can afford .
Even more debilitating than their lack of money is their lack of hope .
" I do n't have any job prospects at my age , I 'm nearly 49 , " says Ms Thiel .
" Most employers do n't want to hire people as old as me . "
" As for my daughter Jasmin , she 's given up at school because of the financial crisis .
She asks why she should study when she 'll end up without a job anyway . "

I never imagined I 'd print a press release in full .
Then , an hour ago , Howard Lovy e-mailed me the most incredible press release of all time ...
POMPANO BEACH , Fla . –
In response to rumors circulating the internet on sites such asFoxNews.com , FastCompany.com and CNET News about a “ flesh eating ” robotproject , CyclonePower Technologies Inc. ( Pink Sheets : CYPW ) and RoboticTechnology Inc. ( RTI ) would like to set the record straight : Thisrobot is strictly vegetarian .
On July 7 , Cyclone announced that it had completed the first stage ofdevelopment for a beta biomass engine system used to power RTI ’sEnergetically Autonomous Tactical Robot ( EATR™ ) , a Phase II SBIR projectsponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , Defense Sciences Office .
RTI ’s EATR is an autonomous robotic platform able to perform long - range , long - endurance missions without the need for manual or conventionalre - fueling .
RTI ’s patent pending robotic system will be able to find , ingest andextract energy from biomass in the environment .
Despite thefar - reaching reports that this includes “ human bodies , ” the public canbe assured that the engine Cyclone has developed to power the EATR runson fuel no scarier than twigs , grass clippings and wood chips – small , plant - based items for which RTI ’s robotic technology is designed toforage .
Desecration of the dead is a war crime under Article15 of the Geneva Conventions , and is certainly not somethingsanctioned by DARPA , Cyclone or RTI .
“ We completely understand the public ’s concern about futuristic robotsfeeding on the human population , but that is not our mission , ” statedHarry Schoell , Cyclone ’s CEO .
“ We are focused on demonstrating that ourengines can create usable , green power from plentiful , renewableplant matter .
The commercial applications alone for this earth - friendly energy solution are enormous . ” ( emphasis in the original )

Matthew Maguire ( r ) was seized along with 27 other hostages Nigerian militants say a British captive whom they were preparing to release will not now be freed .
Matthew Maguire has been held in the southern Nigerian oil swamps for almost nine months .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) had said Mr Maguire would be freed because 1 June was his birthday .
But the group later said the oil worker had refused to leave , out of solidarity with the group .
An e-mail statement from the rebels said : " Matthew Maguire has declined the gift of a release from captivity with an argument that he is now an advocate for change in the region . "
Mr Maguire was one of 27 hostages taken from an oil services boat in September - all the other hostages were released .
There has been fierce fighting in recent weeks between Mend and the army .
This has mostly been in Delta State , while it is believed that Mr Maguire is being held in Rivers State .
The rebels have warned the military not to try and attack them in an attempt to rescue Mr Maguire .
British hostage Robin Hughes , taken from the same boat as Mr Maguire , was released in April because he had fallen sick .
Kidnap industry
They were seized by a group of pirates operating in Nigeria 's oil coast , who then handed them over to Mend .
The other hostages were released within days .
Mend had said they would hold on to the British pair until Mend leader Henry Okah , currently facing the death penalty at a treason trial being held in secret , was released by the government .
Hundreds of foreign oil and construction workers - and many more Nigerians - have been kidnapped by militants since 2006 .
Militants who say they are fighting for a better deal from Nigeria 's oil revenue , fund their groups with kidnapping , extortion and oil theft .
Corruption and poor governance in the region has allowed militant groups to flourish , activists say .

Strong religious faith can comfort people who are dying of cancer , allowing patients to find meaning in their suffering and easing their passage out of life , experts say .
But faith can be a " double - edged sword , " says nurse Carol Taylor , director of the Center for Clinical Bioethics at Georgetown University .
Some terminally ill patients latch on to stories of biblical miracles , hoping against hope to be cured , instead of using their little remaining time to make peace with God and loved ones .
Yet even Taylor , who has counseled many dying patients , says she was surprised by the findings of a study in today 's Journal of the American Medical Association , which examined the choices of dying cancer patients who rely strongly on their religious faith to cope with their illness .
These patients were three times more likely than others to receive intensive , invasive medical procedures — such as being hooked up to a ventilator or getting cardiopulmonary resuscitation when their hearts stop — even in their last week of life , the study shows .
The new study shows that those who used " positive " religious coping — such as those " seeking God 's love and care , " as opposed to people tormented by the belief that God was punishing or abandoning them — were more likely to want doctors to do everything possible to keep them alive .
They also made fewer preparations for death , such as filling out " do not resuscitate " orders , writing living wills or giving someone power of attorney , according to the study of 345 patients .
The patients lived a median of about four months after entering the study .
Interestingly , those tormented by spiritual questions were not more likely to get aggressive care , the study shows .
Although researchers considered other factors that could have affected patients ' treatment choices , such as race , income or psychological distress , religion remained the most important factor .
The religious people in the study may have believed that God could work through aggressive medical procedures , says study author Holly Prigerson , associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
" We suspect they are waiting for a miracle , " Prigerson says .
" They are more likely to think that life is sacred and that their job is to prove their faith to God by staying alive as long as possible , so miracles can be performed . "
Yet aggressive procedures may intensify the physical suffering of people whose bodies are shutting down , says Taylor , who was not involved in the new study .
Patients who are hooked up to ventilator machines are n't able to talk , which can prevent them from having meaningful conversations with the people they 're leaving behind .
The caregivers of patients who die in these circumstances often suffer more grief , as well , according to background information in the study .
" Needlessly prolonging dying is n't a positive thing , " Taylor says .
" I would think someone with a mature religious faith would be more at peace , more able to accept death .
Certainly , you would n't be afraid to die . "
A growing number of studies show that doctors , nurses and chaplains could do much more to ease the spiritual suffering of terminal cancer patients .
A 2007 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology by Tracy Balboni , a co-author of the new paper , found that more than 70 % of patients felt their spiritual needs were n't met by hospital chaplains or others in the health care system .
Only about one - third of advanced cancer patients are told how long they can expect to live , an omission that can lead to needless physical and spiritual suffering , according to an October JAMA study .
More than 20 % of advanced cancer patients in the Medicare program start a new chemotherapy regimen — which can cause intense nausea , vomiting and weakness — within two weeks of death .
Many researchers are studying what causes some patients to get aggressive care in their final days .
Minorities , for example , are much more likely to get intensive care as they 're dying , according to a study published last week in Archives of Internal Medicine .
Research shows that such last - ditch attempts to prolong life are actually a sign of poor quality medical care , says Harvard University 's Amitabh Chandra .
While intensive care units can be life - saving for critically ill newborns or young people who 've been in a traumatic accident , for example , ICUs have much less to offer the very elderly or those with advanced cancers .
Often , seriously ill patients who enter the ICU gain only a few extra days of life .
Prigerson says her research suggests that doctors should be sensitive to the ways that religion shapes a patient 's treatment choices , and consider including hospital chaplains or psychiatrists in conversations with patients .

Recently in the news there have been stories about sightings of bright meteors and you might think you ’re never outside at the right time to see one of these .
You can see meteors about any time at night , as long as you ’re looking up .
Many times these are random meteors and you can be looking up for a long time before you ever see one meteor .
There are certain times of the year to go out and look up and see some meteors .
These times are called meteor showers .
During any one of these meteor showers you can see a number of meteors , many of them faint streaks of light and some bright streaks and once in a while a brilliant fireball .
The darker the sky is the more meteors you will see .
I have seen many meteors including a fireball , this meteor was so bright it cast shadows everywhere as if a spotlight was shining .
Sometimes you can even see the smoke trail left behind the meteor , and once in awhile you can actually hear them .

Best Meteor Showers
There are some good meteor showers to watch , and the nice thing is that these meteor showers can be predicted when they will happen so you can plan when to be out all night looking up .
Here is a list of the better meteor showers .
Some years they are better than other years .
The dates here are for 2008 and can change slightly each year .
Quadrantids Meteor Shower – January 4 th
Eta Aquarids – May 5 th
Perseids – August 12 - 13 , this meteor shower is the most popular because it ’s in mid summer and everyone goes out to watch and it is the most predicable .
Leonids – November 17 th , this shower at times can be spectacular like it was in the late 1990s or it can be a dud .

Geminids – December 13/14th .
Usually a very good meteor shower .
Just dress warm .
And there are many more minor meteor showers as well .
And some years the minor ones can be very good .
For most of these showers , the best time to watch the meteor showers is between midnight and sunrise .
Some of the brightest and largest meteors I have seen were just before sunrise .
The peak times change slightly each year for each shower , so you will need to find the peak date and time for each shower each year .
The moon can be a problem some years , if the moon is full at the same time the meteor shower is going on , you might only be able to see the brightest of them .
Each year this changes .
Use the web sites listed at the end of this article to find the current peak time for any meteor shower .
When you see the date and the time listed , it will usually be in GMT .
You can convert GMT to your local time and date here .

Where to Watch Meteors
The best place is the darkest place you can be , without streetlights and city lights .
Even a park in the city can be darker than a lot of areas in the city .
Going out to the country , mountains or beach will be a better place to watch a meteor shower .
Even close to the city , many astronomy clubs will have sites to go to during meteor shower peaks , called star parties .
Call your local observatory or astronomy club to find out .
Even for the summer showers , it can get pretty cool by sunrise , so take enough clothes to be comfortable , maybe a blanket or sleeping bag .
A lounge chair is best since you will be looking up most of the night , and if you are sitting in a chair it wo n't be long before your neck is really hurting .
Also take some misquote repellent as well .
What you do n’t need to see meteors with are binoculars or a telescope , since meteors cover a large portion of the sky , these items would actually hinder you from seeing meteors .
Hearing Meteors on Your FM Radio
In a way you can hear meteors on your FM radio .
What you will actually hear are other FM stations in distant cities .
This happens when the meteor burns up in the atmosphere and ionizes the layer ( the ionosphere ) that bounces radio waves .
Find a spot on the FM dial where there are n’t any local or nearby stations and you can keep your radio there and during a meteor shower , you will hear stations from cities as far away as 1000 miles , some of these will be less than a second long to 15 seconds or longer , these are called meteor pings .
Car radios are actually very good for this .

Without a doubt , the product that has the entire web buzzing right now is Google Wave , the search giant 's newly announced communication platform .
Earlier this week , we brought you detailed information on the new Google product in our article Google Wave : A Complete Guide , but now we want to explore exactly why everyone is so excited about Google Wave .
You 've probably heard people talk about Google Wave being a game - changer , a disruptive product , or maybe even as an email killer .
But while keywords and phrases like these grab people 's attention , they do n't explain why or how Google Wave could be a paradigm - shifter .
In this article , we explore these questions by highlighting some of Google Wave 's most unique and promising features .
By exploring these features , we can better understand the potential of this new technology .
1. Wiki -style functionality
The feature : While Google Wave works a lot like email or IM , there is a huge difference : you can edit not only your messages , but the messages of anybody within your wave .
You can reply to messages within a conversation string and reorganize conversations .
Why it 's game - changing :
There was a perfect example of how this changes communication during Google 's demo of the product .
A group of people are trying to plan a group dinner , and want to see who can come or not .
In email , you have a string of emails with yes or no , which can get messy .
In Wave , you can edit the original message with a section with who can or cannot go .
Replies can be made within a conversation string , rather than at the end , making conversations a great deal easier to track .
2. Wave Extensions
The feature : Wave extensions are 3rd- party improvements or applications within Google Wave .
There are two types : gadgets and robots .
Gadgets are just like Facebook applications , so you can run an app like an online game or a project management tool from within Wave .
Robots are smart , automated conversation participants .
They can detect keywords and respond , bring in outside information from services like Twitter , and more .
Why it 's game - changing :
It 's game - changing just as the Facebook platform or the Twitter application boom has been paradigm - shifting for both companies .
Imagine only needing to have Google Wave open to manage your Facebook , Twitter , project management , email , and even your video games .
You can make Google Wave your all - in - one communication tool .
3. Drag - and - drop file uploads
The feature :
In email , you have to search for files , and then attach them before sending .
Then you need to open them up when you actually receive the email .
Google
Wave ignores that entire process by allowing users to drag files from the desktop and dropping them .
Anyone can then see the files as they 're being uploaded .
Images are shown in an album format , music can be played , and docs can be quickly shared
Why it 's game - changing : Drag - and - drop file uploads makes Google Wave not only a communication platform , but a useful project management system .
Companies could use Google Wave as their communication and file - sharing platform .
Combined with Wave Extensions , you could build an entire project management platform and time management system better than anything on the market .
4. Wave Embeds
The feature : Wave Embeds is just like what it says - you can embed any wave onto a website .
Embeds can be customized and used for a multitude of purposes .
Why it 's game - changing : Embedding is not only an easy way to share conversations with millions of people , but is in fact a way to replace a lot of forms of communication .
Instead of a chatroom , you can add a Wave on your company 's website and do customer service through it .
Instead of static comments , imagine real - time conversations via Waves .
Conversations are easily shared with embeds .
5. Playback
The feature :
If you 're added to an email conversation late into the game , it can be a pain to parse all of the back - and - forth within an email conversation .
With Wave 's playback feature , you can actually see how the entire conversation developed from the start , making it incredibly easy to catch up on conversations .
Why it 's game - changing : Playback clarifies any conversation and makes it simple to get anyone up - to - speed .
Instead of " check your email , " it will become " just playback the wave " and you will have all the information that you need .
You could get someone up - to - speed within minutes , rather than hours .
6. Open-source
The feature : Google
Wave is not only extendable , but is an open - source project .
This means two big things .
First , developers can build their own version of Google Wave .
Second , Google
Wave can be hosted on your own server - just like an Exchange email server .
Why it 's game - changing :
You may not think of open - source as a feature , but this may be the most important aspect of Google Wave .
Open - source code fosters innovation by allowing developers to improve and correct code .
Developers have the freedom to create a Wave server for their company or to create a branded version of Wave .
Open - source is central to Google 's strategy to foster quick adoption .
And if people start using or even switching over to Google Wave , then it could very well be the game - changing communication tool that everyone has been waiting for .
Despite some justifiable criticisms of the Viking armoured vehicle ( many from this correspondent after the death of 10 soldiers ) , one commander told me it had saved nine of his soldiers ' lives , and was the only protected vehicle light enough to manoeuvre in the " Green Zone " of narrow bridges and roads , while providing an excellent fire - support platform with its medium or heavy machine gun .
Certainly , there is better protected transport that the MoD could purchase , but much of this week 's criticism is the legacy of the deployment of the vulnerable Snatch Land Rover , which is no longer used for operations ( although worryingly one was spotted outside a base in Sangin ) .
Sorry for the convenience .
Can we as a society come together and make an agreement , a pact , to banish all stupid sound effects from radio ads ?
I do n't know how many more whistles , klonks , screeching tires , sirens , and sad trombones I can take .
Do n't even get me started on that effect where they make it sound like one of the people talking is on a telephone .
Thank God for NPR .
Your Comments :
Games tend to have a very short life on store shelves ; if you do n't make your money back in the first few weeks , you 'll likely not have another chance .
But instead of accepting the status quo , Valve asked itself what happens if you continually update games and keep the online community engaged ?
It turns out that gamers keep buying , and buyers keep playing .
We caught up with Doug Lombardi , Valve 's vice president of marketing , to talk about what you get from continually evolving your games .
" Ongoing development for our products has been a staple for Valve since Half - Life 1 , " he told Ars .
" Whether it was shipping new maps for HLDM , full add - ons for free like Team Fortress Classic , or the Software Development Kit , which led to amazing mods such as Counter - Strike , Day of Defeat , etc ... , it has been a common practice here that is considered throughout the development of each product . "
There is also no set strategy for what comes after launch .
" The roadmap for every post - launch release , however , varies with each product .
Development for Team Fortress Classic , for example , happened before HL1 shipped , and it was originally planned to be a paid add - on .
Then , just before launch , the decision was made to add it to the first Game of the Year Edition , Half - Life : GoTY , and release it online , for free to existing owners of HL1 . "
The trick is to give the team the freedom to explore the game and find out what it needs , and you can't do that with any kind of map or strong pre-release plans .
" In similar fashion , new content for TF2 was planned before it shipped , but certainly every new item and achievement that has been made available during the course of the past 18 months was not set in stone years ago , " Lombardi explained .
" Keeping things a bit open allows Valve 's designers freedom to consider what 's working in the community and incorporate feedback into future releases . "
The question is , how do you know when to stop evolving a product and start throwing your efforts into the sequel ?
Most companies hoard ideas and updates , and when I bring up the question of whether new ideas should be released as an update or held for the sequel , Lombardi seems slightly impatient at the notion .
" Good idea .
I just spoke to Robin and we 're going to hold the next update for TF3 . "
" Seriously , that 's not how Valve approaches it at all .
We have no idea what TF3 is .
But with each update , we 're getting a better handle on TF2 . "
This is n't all rainbows and unicorns mixed with a heaping helping of fan service .
Left 4
Dead is game that has been handled with almost surgical precision to keep sales steady .
The game was released to positive reviews and strong sales , and now the free Survival Pack has been released to get gamers back into the title , and to draw in a new audience who may not have thought the game was worth the asking price in the past .
Of course , if that was n't good enough , Valve allowed players to try the game for a full 24 hours this Friday and the offer was extended .
To sweeten the deal even further , if the gamers who participated in the trial decided to buy , Valve added a sale that cut 40 percent off the cost of the game .
It 's a hellishly effective strategy to get your money .
All this happening together is no coincidence .
" The updates cause an incredible spike in sales .
And when the update is offered in concert with new Achievements , new media , such as a new ' Meet the ...' movie , and a promotion , such as a Free Weekend and / or limited - time price drop , the spike is even higher , " Lombardi told us .
" With every release , we witness a spike in sales on Steam and at retail . "
The strategy works .
Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 are still discussed on the gaming blogs , and they enjoy a strong online following that waits breathlessly for the next update .
When the sales start to dip again , Lord knows there will be another sale or content pack to keep interest up ... not to mention sales .
Brad , Angelina team up with FrontlineSMS project in Cambodia :
UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA PRESS RELEASE
Researchers from the University of Canberra are working with the Maddox Jolie - Pitt Foundation ( MJP ) , an organisation founded by philanthropists Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt , to trial a cost effective text - messaging system .
The project with the University of New England is funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research to help improve the lives of some of the poorest people in Cambodia .
The mobile phone system can be used to alert villagers about disease outbreaks , like tuberculosis and other important health and agricultural information , like pest problems in Samlaut , a remote and rural outpost in northwest Cambodia where MJP is implementing large scale integrated development interventions .
Although reports are showing that the percentage of Cambodia ’s population falling ill with TB declined in 2007 , Stephan Bognar , Executive Director of MJP said that Cambodia had approximately 495 new cases per every 100,000 .
Only Zimbabwe and South Africa had higher rates .
“ We need , therefore , to find effective tools to quickly disseminate information to isolated and rural communities . ”
The University ’s Dr Robert Fitzgerald says the researchers chose SMS text messaging as the information tool of choice because Cambodia has 85 per cent mobile phone coverage and texting can cost as little as 3 US cents .
The seed for the simple , but successful technology came from a project to help Cambodian farmers get better prices for their crops .
“ We wanted to help farmers access the price of maize or soybeans on demand , so they were in a stronger position to negotiate the sale of their crop , ” Dr Fitzgerald said .
“ Many of these farmers have to borrow money to plant their crop , in most cases paying 4 per cent interest per month . ”
“ Some traders and farmers knew some price information but that was not always shared , so the only way the farmer could find out about the price was to travel to town or ask nearby friends .
So now farmers can text the agricultural information server and straight away find out about the prices . ”
The FrontlineSMS system runs on any PC , with a GSM modem and a pre-paid SIM card .
The software is free and open source , and was developed by UK - based expert Ken Banks who designed the software back in 2005 specifically for Non-Government Organisations working primarily in Africa .
Dr Fitzgerald is working on a new project with his colleagues to expand the farmer SMS network to include more production and marketing information .
( Further details on the project , including future plans for expansion , are available via a guest blog post from Robert here .
The official University of Canberra press release is available here )

JERUSALEM , June 1 ( UPI ) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu says there will be no new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and illegal outposts there will be dismantled .
Speaking Monday before the Knesset 's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for the first time since becoming prime minister two months ago , Netanyahu said while he does n't intend to " freeze life in Judea and Samaria , " he wo n't allow any new settlements , the Israeli Web site Ynetnews.com reported .

" We wo n't build new settlements , " Netanyahu told lawmakers .
" The plan is to dismantle unauthorized outposts .
There are reasonable demands and unreasonable demands , " he said , referring to a request by U.S. President Barack Obama during a meeting last month in Washington to halt new settlement building .
" The settlements ' fate will be determined in the permanent ( Palestinian - Israeli ) agreement . "
Netanyahu 's comments came as Israeli security forces Monday evacuated the northern West Bank outpost of Nachalat Yosef .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak told reporters last week that Israel was not bowing to U.S. pressure in dismantling such outposts , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported .

Here at Language Log Plaza , we 've been following the linguistic angles of the Gov. Mark Sanford story ever since he mysteriously went " out of pocket . "
( See : " Out of pocket , " " The biggest self of self is indeed self , " " Doing stupid , " and " If I wanted to know that I knew that I knew . " )
But the lasting contribution of the Sanford saga to the English language may very well be the sudden spawning of a political euphemism : " hiking the Appalachian trail . "
Mark Peters is the resident euphemism expert on the Visual Thesaurus website , rounding up circumlocutions old and new for his monthly column , Evasive Maneuvers .
His latest column , " Hiking the Euphemistic Trail , " is a Sanford special .
Mark 's column begins :
Will the Appalachian trail ever be the same ?
Environmentally , I think so .
Linguistically ?
Not a chance .
I can't even look at websites like this and this without giggling like a schoolgirl who ate one of those four - foot - long Pixie Stix .
Let me put it this way …
If you have a dog , and that dog ever made a no - no on something precious , like an $ 800 carpet , then you have some idea of the kind of impact South Carolina Governor ( now known as " The Luv Guv " ) Mark Sanford has had on the Appalachian trail , specifically in the form of the atomic - wing - hot new euphemism hiking the Appalachian trail , which refers to sexual shenanigans , especially the adulterous kind that waylays political careers .
Mark anoints Sanford our " euphemizer laureate " and looks at how " hiking the Appalachian trail " stacks up against other adultery euphemisms .

Pedestrians , cyclists among main road traffic crash victims
Half of 1.27 million people who die in road traffic crashes every year are pedestrians , motorcyclists and cyclists , finds new WHO study .
15 June 2009 | Geneva / New York -
The first global assessment of road safety finds that almost half of the estimated 1.27 million people who die in road traffic crashes every year are pedestrians , motorcyclists and cyclists .
While progress has been made towards protecting people in cars , the needs of these vulnerable groups of road users are not being met .
The Global status report on road safety published today provides the first worldwide analysis of how well countries are implementing a number of effective road safety measures .
These include limiting speed , reducing drink - driving , and increasing the use of seatbelts , child restraints and motorcycle helmets .
Funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies , the report presents information from 178 countries , accounting for over 98 % of the world ’s population .
It uses a standardized method that allows comparisons between countries to be made .
" We found that in many countries , the laws necessary to protect people are either not in place or are not comprehensive .
And even when there is adequate legislation , most countries report that their enforcement is low , " said WHO Director - General Dr Margaret Chan .
" We are not giving sufficient attention to the needs of pedestrians , cyclists and motorcyclists many of whom end up in clinics and hospitals .
We must do better if we are to halt or reverse the rise in road traffic injuries , disability and deaths . "
" Traffic crashes are a leading cause of death , particularly among young people 5 to 44 years of age , " said Mr Michael R. Bloomberg .
" For the first time , we have solid data to hold us accountable and to target our efforts .
Road safety must be part of all transport planning efforts , particularly at this moment of focus on infrastructure improvements and road building by many countries around the globe . "
Road traffic death rates increasing
While road traffic death rates in many high - income countries have stabilized or declined in recent decades , research suggests road deaths are increasing in most regions of the world and that if trends continue unabated , they will rise to an estimated 2.4 million a year by 2030 .
In addition , road crashes cause between 20 million and 50 million non-fatal injuries every year and are an important cause of disability .
In many countries support services for road traffic victims are inadequate .
These avoidable injuries also overload already stretched health - care systems in many countries .
The report documents numbers of registered motorized vehicles in each country and action being taken to invest in public transport and encourage non-motorized travel such as walking and cycling .
Vehicle manufacturing standards and requirements for road safety audits were also reported , as well as the existence of formal pre-hospital care systems , including emergency telephone numbers .
Accurate statistics are crucial for understanding the state of road safety and measuring the impact of efforts to improve it .
The report found that underreporting of deaths occurs in many countries , and that few countries have completely reliable data on road traffic injuries .
The highest death rates are seen in the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions .
The lowest rates are among high - income countries , such as the Netherlands , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
Other highlights of the report include :
Less than a third of countries meet basic criteria for reducing speed in urban areas .
Less than half of countries use the recommended blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.05 grams per decilitre as a measure to reduce drink - driving .
While helmet laws exist in more than 90 % of countries , only 40 % have a law that covers both riders and passengers while also requiring that helmets meet a specified standard .
Only 57 % of countries have laws that require all car occupants to wear seat - belts .
This figure is only 38 % in low - income countries .
Half of all countries do not have laws requiring the use of child restraints ( e.g. , child seats and booster seats ) .
This figure masks considerable variation , with relevant laws in 90 % of high - income countries but only 20 % of low - income countries .
Only 15 % of countries have comprehensive laws which address all five of these risk factors .
Where laws on these risk factors are in place they are often inadequately enforced , particularly in low - income countries .
For example , only 9 % of countries rate their enforcement of speed limits as over 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 , while the corresponding figure for enforcement of seat - belt laws is 19 % .
“ More than 90 % of the world ’s road deaths occur in low - income and middle - income countries , while these countries only have 48 % of the world ’s vehicles , ” said Dr Etienne Krug , Director of WHO ’s Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability .
“ Our roads are particularly unsafe for pedestrians , cyclists and motorcyclists who , without the protective shell of a car around them , are more vulnerable .
These road users need to be given increased attention .
Measures such as building sidewalks , raised crossings and separate lanes for two wheelers ; reducing drink - driving and excessive speed ; increasing the use of helmets and improving trauma care are some of the interventions that could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year . "
The report also shows that road traffic injuries remain very relevant in high - income countries .
“ Even the top performers globally are often stagnating and still have considerable room for improvement in achieving a truly safe road transport system , ” Dr Krug said .

Have you seen all those magazine pics of Zac Efron , looking bare - chested and stubbly ?
Admit it .
You have .
The twinky star of Disney ’s High School Musical recently turned 21 .
Goodbye , Tiger Beat .
Hello , GQ !
Zac ’s got a butch new look .
But judging from his latest movie , 17 Again , he ’s still peddling the same outdated Disney values .
Especially when it comes to sex .
If you ’ve seen Freaky Friday or Big , you pretty much know the film ’s premise .
A corporate loser played by Friends ’ Matthew Perry wishes he could do it all over again and suddenly — PRESTO !
CHANGE-O! — he ’s back in his 17 - year - old body , courtesy of Zac .
At first , I was encouraged by the film ’s rating : PG - 13 for “ some sexual material . ”
Maybe Zac will even get to take his shirt off , I thought — unlike the G-rated High School Musical hits .
Turns out I was right .
And not only that , I did n’t even need to wait .
The first frame shows Zac , shirtless and sweaty , shooting baskets in his high school gym .
Score !
But when it comes to “ sexual material , ” that ’s the high point of the film .
The low point comes about half - way through , when Zac finds himself in a sex -ed class with his teenaged daughter .
As the teacher passes out condoms , Zac lectures the students on the merits of waiting for marriage .
Having sex , he tells them , is strictly for making babies .
Hearing his pleas , the kids in the class tearfully pass the prophylactics back to the front .
The rest of the movie is basically a thinly - veiled commercial for Christian family values , as Zac busts up his daughter ’s relationship ( just before she ’s about to get down and dirty ) and then gets back together with his own high - school sweetheart — the only woman he ’s ever fucked .
Boring !
And not to mention , typical of teen movies today .
Before 17 Again , the last teen hit was Twilight .
It ’s all about vampires , but not the kind who want to suck your … you know .
Twilight is the story of a Dracula clan that cherishes chastity and refuses to go all the way with its human prey .
Brit hottie Robert Pattinson , who plays a dreamy 17 - year - old vampire , makes it to the end of the movie without satisfying his sexual appetite .
The film ’s sequels , already in the works , promise more abstinence .
We should n’t be surprised :
The story ’s creator is a Mormon who swears she ’s never even seen an R - rated movie .
A decade ago , the big teen hit was the raunchy American Pie , featuring a group of kids who were excited about getting it on .
It spawned a host of sequels , as well as a queer imitator , Another Gay Movie ( not to mention its follow - up , Another Gay Sequel ) .
Unlike 17 Again and Twilight , those movies were n’t preachy .
They showed kids making their own decisions about sex and relationships instead of being cornered into one option , abstinence .
The Bush era of Christian conservatism is over .
Its icky values are finally being discredited .
Zac Efron is now legal in all 50 states .
Let ’s quit it with teen movies that show an unrealistic view of teen life .

This article is the subject of a legal complaint from Evony LLC .
After publication of this article , a representative of Evony LLC contacted us .
He said neither the company nor its owners were associated with internet fraud or scams .
He said Evony denied any suggestion that it had " ripped off " predecessor games and said a considerable amount had been invested in research and development to produce a unique game .
Evony said it did not charge players for sending a message to other players and was not responsible for nor did it encourage the use of spam messages referring to Evony .
Quite possibly .
If you 've been anywhere near the internet in recent weeks , you may well have noticed the vast number of promotions for a game called Evony – campaigns on websites featuring buxom fantasy queens ; countless Google ads and ( more disturbingly ) millions of spam comments left on blogs .
On the surface , Evony is a pretty standard online strategy game – a simulation in which players take the role of a medieval noble who must build up an empire .
But the way the game has been marketed has created a bit of a stir : the games marketer Bruce Everiss has charted the volume of spam being sent by its creators , while Jeff Atwood , a US programmer and blogger , has documented the ads ' increasingly racy nature – from a simple medieval warrior promising the game would be " free forever " , through a string of increasingly racy images ... until , finally , it was simply advertising itself by showing a pair of breasts .
" Thanks for showing us what it means to take advertising on the internet to the absolute rock bottom ... then dig a sub - basement under that , and keep on digging until you reach the white - hot molten core of the Earth , " he wrote last week .
It 's not just the advertising that has got the internet up in arms , however – the game itself has drawn criticism from many quarters .
Evony takes its inspiration from Civilization , the classic Sid Meier series .
In fact , its slavish devotion stretches not only to its original name – it was known as Civony until recently – but also to the details of the game itself ; a format so familiar that more than a few gamers to question whether Evony has simply ripped off its predecessors .
And as if bad advertising and tenuous intellectual property were not enough , the game is also under fire for its business model – a system that seems intent on getting players to spend as much money as possible .
Players are encouraged to buy in - game extras to speed their progress – but the confusing way the game prices its add - ons means that many users may not realise that a simple action , such as sending a message to another player , can cost 15 p a time .
All of this has swirled into a storm of criticism around Evony – except on the game 's own web forums , where mentions of its most controversial practices are deleted by moderators .
So if Evony is the world 's most despised game , who is behind it ?
It turns out that the site 's backers are equally unpopular .
Evony is the product of Universal Multiplayer Game Entertainment ( UMGE ) , a developer linked to a Chinese gold - farming operation called WoWMine .
That site has also come in for regular criticism , but the real kicker comes with the news that the company 's owners are being sued by Microsoft over allegations of click fraud .
Perhaps
Evony is n't the most hated game on the internet : but it certainly runs close .

The company that makes parts for popular electronic reader devices , including the Kindle , is buying out the company behind the technology used in the displays .
Though the two firms say it will be good for consumers , there are some claims it might limit competition .
The deal involves Prime View International of Taiwan , which is set on buying E Ink , based in Massachusetts , for $ 215 million .
Prime View is today responsible for the display screens on both the Amazon Kindle and the Sony Reader .
Electrophoretic Film : Otherwise Known As Electronic Paper
E Ink , a company started by Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) scientists , created the technology used to produce electrophoretic film displays , otherwise known as the leading form of ' electronic paper ' , or ePaper .
This technology helps produce displays with the appearance of paper that consume little power compared to traditional computer displays .
The company made its money by licensing this technology , with Prime View its biggest client .
Stock Market Flotation Not An Option
The sale price is only around three times E Ink 's annual revenue , a fairly small price for a flourishing industry .
When announcing the deal , the two firms predicted sales of electronic reading devices would rise twenty - fold between last year and 2012 .
( Source : gigaom.com )
The low sale price -- which means a poor return for several venture capitalist groups that helped fund E Ink -- may be a sign that the market still does n't see electronic readers as a competitor to traditional books and magazines .
However , the firm 's chief executive says sale options were limited because confidence on the U.S. stock market is so weak that there was little prospect of taking the firm public .
( Source : wsj.com )
Pricing In Question
The big question is what this means for consumers .
At best it would mean Prime View was able to produce displays more cheaply , sell them to manufacturers at a lower price , and have some of the savings passed on to consumers .
But there 's also the possibility that it could exploit the market .
Now that Prime View controls two of the major components in electronic readers , the firm will wield more power when it comes to deciding how the retail price is set .
It could also make sure that no other display manufacturers are allowed to use E Ink 's technology , further reducing competition .
Feingold Asks Obama to Clarify Position on Warrantless Wiretapping
Created : June 15 , 2009 15:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Responding to the controversial assertion by Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair on June 8 that warrantless wiretapping “ was n’t illegal , ” Senator Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) today sent a letter to President Obama asking him to make clear that he is not claiming that extraordinary executive authority to disregard the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA .
“ As a United States Senator , you stated clearly and correctly that the warrantless wiretapping program was illegal , ” writes Feingold .
“ Your Attorney General expressed the same view , both as a private citizen and at his confirmation hearing . ”
Feingold continues :
It is my hope that you will formally confirm this position as president , which is why I sent you a letter on April 29 , 2009 , urging your administration to withdraw the unclassified and highly flawed January 19 , 2006 , Department of Justice Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President ( “ NSA Legal Authorities WhitePaper “ ) , as well as to withdraw and declassify any other memoranda providing legal justifications for the program .
Particularly in light of two recent events , I am concerned that failure to take these steps may be construed by those who work for you as an indication that these justifications were and remain valid .
Feingold notes that in addition to Blair ’s comments ,
I asked your nominee to be General Counsel for the Director of National Intelligence , whether , based on the “ White Paper ” and other public sources , he believed that the warrantless wiretapping program was legal .
His written response to my question , which was presumably vetted by your administration , indicated that , because the program was classified , he could not offer an opinion .
Should he be confirmed , this position , too , risks conveying to the Intelligence Community that there may be classified justifications for not complying with FISA .
In fact , although Barack Obama the Senator and presidential candidate repeatedly spoke against warrantless wiretapping as practiced by the NSA under President George W. Bush , as president , he has not been clear on the issue .
He ’s sought to stymie at least one case involving claims of warrantless wiretapping on state secrets grounds , and urged a judge to dismiss a slew of lawsuits against telecom companies who allegedly cooperated with the Bush administration in the warrantless wiretapping program .
Recent reports also reveal that the NSA ’s surveillance program “ in recent months ” exceeded legal limits , and pending lawsuits claim that warrantless wiretapping is continuing under Obama ’s watch .
In his letter sent today , Feingold urged President Obama “ to formally renounce the legal arguments behind the previous administration ’s warrantless wiretapping and to demonstrate again your clear commitment to the rule of law in this area . ”
( Corrects supervisor ’s name )
LOS ANGELES , June 19 ( Reuters ) - Auditors poring over Los Angeles County ’s books to reduce a deep budget deficit have found 8,000 abandoned or unused phone lines costing taxpayers $ 1.5 million a year , the Los Angeles Times reported on Friday .
The discovery includes some phone lines that may never have served any legitimate government purpose , like one registered to a now - defunct ticket brokerage in Hollywood that the county has paid for 14 years .
“ This is government at its worst , ” County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told the Times .
“ We have a problem , no doubt about it .
But we are going to move quickly to fix it . ”
Because the auditors are only about halfway through their review , they predict that they may ultimately discover some 16,000 abandoned lines , with an annual cost to taxpayers of about $ 3 million in phone bills , the paper reported .
Los Angeles County faces a gaping budget hole that has officials contemplating worker layoffs and cuts in services , and department heads have been asked to cut their expenses by as much as 13 percent .

It astonishes me how many of my friends do n’t remember this 80 ’s classic .
This cartoon was so crazy that even when I was I kid I used to stare at the TV and think WTF !?
Are these guys serious ?
Thankfully yes , yes they were .
Hit the read link for more .
I wo n’t get into too much of a debate over He - Man ’s sexuality , but what other flamboyant man do you now of that lives with tigers ?
See where I ’m going with this ?
I ’m saying He - Man was probably gay .
As a matter of fact most of the characters on the show were probably gay .
With character names like Ram Man , Fisto , Trap Jaw and Reach Around what other conclusion could you come to ?
OK I may or may not have made that last one up …
Luckily as a youth I was too nieve to understand all of the homerotic undertones and just enjoyed the cartoon for the Saturday morning acid trip that it was .
It featured some of the cheesiest most cliche voice acting I have ever seen in a cartoon .
As a matter of fact I am more entertained by it now that I am an adult then I was when I was a kid .
Although that might be a sad commentary on me as a man .
I think I ’ve said too much .
Do yourself a favor and watch these videos .
If you ’ve never seen a He - Man cartoon before than you ’re welcome , because I just changed your life .
And if you do remember watching this as a child sit back , relax and enjoy a trip down memory lane .
A very gay trip down memory lane .

By now it ’s safe to say that this Yom Kippur , the tally of collective Jewish sins will be particularly long .
Between Bernie Madoff and the bust that roped five rabbis and three New Jersey mayors ( not to mention smaller misdeeds , like that prison bar mitzvah ) , it ’s been a tough year .
For a people so historically obsessed with how the outside world views them , they have of late found themselves quite frequently , uncomfortably , in a spotlight of shame , wondering what , exactly , have the chosen people been chosen for ?
Let ’s set aside the issue of piety , the question of how such religious men could commit such crimes .
We all know that religious observance is no guarantor of ethical behavior .
The question is of Jewish exceptionalism , and it is , to understate it , a thorny one .
Hitler designed an entire political philosophy — and attendant death machine — based on the belief that the answer to this question was a resounding “ yes . ”
But awkward as this may be , this is , from a different perspective , a view shared by many Jews themselves , like the man who sends me the same e-mail once a month about the number of Jews who have won Nobel Prizes .
( “ Remarkably , Jews constitute almost one - fifth of all Nobel laureates .
This , in a world in which Jews number just a fraction of 1 percent of the population . ” )
And it ’s not just kooks and your grandmother :
Even liberal , assimilated Jews ca n’t help but believe that there is something special — better , smarter — about their people .
Except when their people show up in handcuffs on the news — at which point the arguments turn to Jewish ordinariness :
Every group has its criminals , we are no better or worse than anyone else , to think any different is to hold Jews to a higher standard than other groups are held , etc .
Well , you ca n’t have it both ways .
The fact is that Jews are exceptional .
There can be no debate that various historical factors — including a communal reverence for intellectual acuity , along with centuries of marginalization — primed Jews for , first , survival , and then uncommon achievement .
The rub is that those very same factors might have predisposed them to distinction in less - savory domains .
Maybe we ca n’t have Philip Roth and Leonard Bernstein without Bernie Madoff and the informant behind the Jersey busts , Solomon Dwek .
Or maybe not .
Maybe , in fact , it is n’t Madoff and Dwek who are exceptional but rather average Jews who are .
That the sight of a Jewish criminal on the front page gives heartburn to Jews comprehensively disconnected from the crimes — including even those who profess to be comprehensively disconnected from any form of Jewish identity or culture — is the truly exceptional thing .
This ethnic attachment is a consequence not simply of fanatical closeness but of a long history in which Jews were judged collectively for everything they did , beginning with the crucifixion they did n’t do .
Indeed , it was precisely this quality that perhaps predisposed them to become victims .
Madoff ’s many Jewish clients trusted him because he was Jewish , and the Ashkenazic organ broker was willing to hear out a Syrian Sephardic Jew precisely because there was a yarmulke on his head .
But this very set of qualities , this instinct to trust because of a shared tribal history , is also what has inspired , among other things , a uniquely effective network of charities that serve tens of millions of Jews and non-Jews alike .
Here , too , exceptionalism works both ways .
Now Jews just have to accept it .

Ever Better Cryptanalytic Results Against SHA-1
The SHA family ( which , I suppose , should really be called the MD4 family ) of cryptographic hash functions has been under attack for a long time .
In 2005 , we saw the first cryptanalysis of SHA - 1 that was faster than brute force : collisions in 269 hash operations , later improved to 263 operations .
A great result , but not devastating .
But remember the great truism of cryptanalysis : attacks always get better , they never get worse .
Last week , devastating got a whole lot closer .
A new attack can , at least in theory , find collisions in 252 hash operations — well within the realm of computational possibility .
Assuming the cryptanalysis is correct , we should expect to see an actual SHA - 1 collision within the year .
Note that this is a collision attack , not a pre-image attack .
Most uses of hash functions do n’t care about collision attacks .
But if yours does , switch to SHA - 2 immediately .
( This has more information on this , written for the 269 attack . )
This is why NIST is administering a SHA - 3 competition for a new hash standard .
And whatever algorithm is chosen , it will look nothing like anything in the SHA family ( which is why I think it should be called the Advanced Hash Standard , or AHS ) .

Coach Fines Himself $ 10,000 After Drunken Night Out
Sydney Roosters coach Brad Fittler has had a tough time lately .
His team is mired in last place in Australia ’s National Rugby League .
Rumors have swirled that he is about to be replaced .
It ’s only natural that he might seek solace at the bottom of a bottle .
Unfortunately for Fittler , upon returning to his hotel after a drunken night out , he got off the elevator on the wrong floor and tried to break into the room that he thought was his , freaking out the two women who were inside .
The two occupants called the police , saying a “ creepy man ” with a “ hairy chest ” was trying to get into the room .
When the police arrived , they escorted Fittler back to his room .
Then it was time to apologize .
“ I take this opportunity to apologise for my behaviour on Thursday night , ” Fittler said in a press conference .
“ I brought embarrassment to the club , myself and my family .
I ’d also like to take this opportunity to apologise to the occupants of the room concerned .
As a result I ’ve fined myself $ 10,000 and that donation will be going to a suitable charity . ”
Let ’s hope he gets the suite number correct when he mails the check .

A security researcher has developed an interesting new class of attacks that exploit the problems caused by organizations using non-routable IP space on their internal networks , including one attack that compromises VPN users through the use of a persistent JavaScript backdoor .
A security researcher has developed an interesting new class of attacks that exploit the problems caused by organizations using non-routable IP space on their internal networks , including one attack that compromises VPN users through the use of a persistent JavaScript backdoor .
The attacks rely on the long - term caching policies of some browsers and take advantage of the collisions that can occur when two different networks use the same non-routable IP address space , which happens fairly often because the amount of address space is quite small .
The bottom line is that even a moderately skilled attacker has the ability to compromise remote machines without the use of any vulnerability or weakness in the client software .
“ If you ’re even vaguely clever , developing this might take you two hours .
It ’s not that difficult , ” said Robert Hansen , the researcher who wrote about the attacks in a white paper published this week , called “ RFC1918 Caching Security Issues . ”
Hansen , who is better known in the security community as Rsnake , worked out the techniques through research and discussions with fellow researchers Amit Klein and HD Moore over the course of several weeks .
RFC1918 refers to an IETF specification developed in 1996 for private intranets .
“ All you need is a mediocre amount of intelligence about VPNs , a mediocre understanding of how to inject iFrames , the ability to run a backdoor and a command and control server .
Put all of that together and maybe it ’s considered hard .
All of the pieces are there , it ’s just a matter of putting them together , ” Hansen said .
In one of the scenarios that Hansen describes in his paper , an attacker is able to force a VPN user to connect to an attacker - controlled network instead of the user ’s own corporate intranet through the use of injected iFrames and aggressive caching .
Once the user connects , his browser gives the attacker access to the user ’s cookies and the attacker delivers a JavaScript backdoor .
He then drops the VPN connections and when the user reconnects to his normal intranet , the attacker ’s backdoor controls the connection and requests instructions from a command - and - control server that the attacker owns .
One of the things that makes this technique possible is the widespread use of non-routable IP address space for corporate intranets .
Many companies use IP addresses that are not routable from the public Internet for their intranets , a tactic that is meant to protect the networks from attack .
But because the amount of non-routable IP address space most commonly used for intranets is so small–about 1280 addresses , Hansen estimates –collisions between networks often occur .
And because some popular browsers will cache credentials and IP addresses for a long time , an attacker can take advantage of these circumstances to gain control of user PCs .
And , as Hansen discovered , the browser cache is a hidden jewel for attackers looking to remain undetected for a long time .
“ The cache is a nice place to store persistent attacks long term .
If you store it in the cache , in order to find it you ’d have to go through every file to find the one that ’s going to be exploitable , ” he said .
“ It ’s difficult to do and it ’s a huge pain to recover from .
Forensics on this is a nightmare because attackers can cause the cache to be flushed if they so desire . ”
In addition to the VPN attack , Hansen lays out another scenario in his paper that involves a man - in - the - middle attack .
In that scenario , the attacker needs to compromise a device somewhere upstream from the victim , waits for the victim to connect to his intranet and then creates a series of malicious iFrames containing the malicious JavaScript code .
Once the user connects to one of these iFrames , the code downloads to the user ’s PC .
Then , when the user connects to his home or office RFC1918 network , the malware , which has been cached , connects the user to an attacker - controlled page .
“ This happens in the wild all the time .
People just do n’t realize it , ” Hansen said .
“ The man - in - the - middle variant requires a little more work because you have to do ARP spoofing or break into something upstream .
It ’s not super - hard but it requires a little more work than the VPN one . ”

On Anarchist Debate
Anarchism is a simmering influence in social struggles , which in recent times has put itself back on the map as a serious international movement with the upheaval in Greece and , to a lesser extent , the protests at the Republican National Convention ( although the latter mostly led to negative perceptions from the U.S. public nonetheless it made some impression and provoked a  surge in organizing ) .
Unfortunately , the incoherence and disorganization of so much of the anarchist scene ,  internationally and in the United States , remains a massive obstruction to serious activity .
Some significant steps are being made toward a more coherent movement , emphasizing popular struggles and involvement at a mass level .
However , the prevalence of ( ultra - ) sectarian and petty - argumentative attitudes , leading to a lack of constructive debate , is doing irreversible damage to the anarchist movement .
A basic problem here is the extreme difficulty of consolidating fragments of serious anarchist thought and activity , in a context permeated and distorted by bourgeois ideology .
This is not a simple issue of a few personalities  derailing all the other anarchists  efforts through confusion .
It affects every level of anarchist discourse in ways that are not reducible to a small chaotic element ( although such an element undoubtedly plays a big part ) .
A common perception from outside the scene is that confusion and sectarianism come naturally to anarchists because anarchism itself is ideologically confused and sectarian .
Of course , ironically more than a few of those making such an argument ( e.g. Marxists , Trotskyists , etc. ) are themselves ultra-sectarian , and talk of unification from them usually means subordination .
The deep and complex problems confronting anarchism cannot be understood from outside they can only be understood and confronted from a real anarchist perspective .
While we should not discard valuable contributions from any direction , it should never be forgotten that we are anarchists and that should never be subordinated or made secondary to more pragmatic considerations as long as means of resistance remain at our disposal .
It is important to make a distinction between theoretical and practical disagreements .
But again , that is no simple issue as practical differences are nearly always framed in theoretical terms , often obscuring concrete similarities or exaggerating differences unnecessarily .
This is also not helped by considerable theoretical differences within this or that tendency , to the extent that debating with one person might lead to entirely different perceptions than it would with another from the same camp .
The lack of programmatic thinking together with the scattered , isolated situation of so many anarchists is primarily responsible for such confusion , although there are other factors common to all groupings ( individual spinning  of ideas , theoretical nuances , etc. etc. ) .
A more long - term issue is simply the volume and variety of writings all identified as anarchist , frequently conflicting with each other in their content .
Of course , individuals must pick and choose valuable ideas while leaving out worthless ones .
However , that does not negate the central importance of ongoing debate to sharpen or improve on ideas .
The key point in all of this is criticality , as in the individuals ability to self - criticize and to criticize others at a practical and theoretical level through study , debate , action and reflection .
But criticism in that sense should be serious and thoughtful .
Controversy has its value in stirring up debate and pointing out problems , but then debate should be constructive and not petty if anything is to be gained from it .
Not to say criticism should be softened  one bit to avoid offending  its recipient , but even harsh criticism can be constructive if it is serious and pointed at real problems and not simply for sectarian or petty - personal reasons .
Consider one example that stands out .
There is an ongoing argument between insurrectionary  anarchists and  Platform organizational anarchists .
Both are part of revolutionary social and class - struggle anarchism , although there are some post - leftist insurrectional groupings that tend to denounce class - struggle or communist anarchists as disguised or recovering 
Marxists .
Being personally heavily influenced by elements of both insurrectional and  Platform  thinking , it is an interesting but frustrating debate , not least because it nearly always bogs down into sectarian name - calling and personal digs missing the real point .
For insurrectionists , there is a problem with neo - Platformists  attempting to  Bolshevize anarchism , identifying it with Leninism .
Between accusatory labels , there are serious criticisms of bureaucratization and a sort of wait for the masses  mentality that runs through  Platform  thinking , which can sometimes interfere with action .
In contrast , platformists point to anarchist isolation due incoherence and disorganization , arguing for a common line of action and theory to have a consistent presence in struggles .
That is usually accompanied by talk about a chaotic element responsible for anarchists  disorganization , many times pointing at insurrectional - types as a primary culprit .
Some of those are serious points that need debating .
Unfortunately , serious debate is obstructed writing - off a huge fraction of revolutionary anarchists through labeling as neo - Platform Leninists  or simplistically faulting insurrectionalism for alienating anarchism .
There is a lot value in both traditions  that it is simply stupid to dismiss .
Anarchism will only improve through serious debate , not useless sectarian labeling .
A writer like Bonanno is as important as any platformist writers , maybe even someone like Makhno .
The point is , sectarian attitudes are a hamper to serious debate .
By extension , sectarianism is an obstacle to serious improvement of anarchist theory and practice .
At a moment , as now , when anarchism is a bubbling influence on social upheavals , it is more important than ever for us to be critical .
But it is also more important than ever for us to debate constructively if anarchism is to be a serious influence .
Too much criticism directed inward is self - destructive and alienating .
Comradely criticism , pointed at real failings , is necessary for moving forward even if it is harsh criticism .
Anarchist denunciations of other anarchists , without constructive content , only destroy what little movement there is .
The most important thing now is to improve anarchism through debate and action .

Every single ingredient in this homemade oatmeal stout and Heath Bar ice cream is off my diet .
Still , I want .
This was a total success , if I do say so myself .
The ice cream base has a slight bitter flavor but also a bit of a toffee flavor from the stout .
The sweetness of the Heath bar is a good foil to that bitterness while the toffee in it helps bring out more of that toffee flavor .
The texture of the ice cream is beautifully creamy making a good base for the crunch of the Heath Bar .
This is a flavor I 'll definitely make again !

Guyology : Lesson 1
Sorry girls .
It 's science .
But , there 's one exception :
When Time=Rafaan 's love for Lauren , Interest approaches infinity .
Alt - Text : Guyology : Lesson 1
According to a blog post from Bestbuy ’s Chief Marketing Officer Barry Judge , several Dallas Bestbuy locations will be testing out the used video game market .
A few weeks ago , PlayStation LifeStyle reported on how Walmart was beginning a used - game trade - in program .
Bestbuy ’s system , is not much different .
To trade your game in , you must go to a certified Kiosk , then pop the game in .
The Kiosk will systematically scan your game , checking for functionality , and give a coupon voucher , that can be traded in for a gift card .
As Judge puts it :
“ It ’s a pretty slick system and one of the few trade - in programs to provide instant gratification ; you get the gift card on the spot and can redeem it on anything in the store – not just another game .
We ’ll also be testing the sale of used games in those stores , and some of the kiosks will even rent games and movies . ”
From the looks of it , Gamestop is going to have a lot of competition , and we may ( finally ) start to see reasonable prices on used games from the dominant gaming retailer .

Claim :
The state of Illinois uses photo radar in freeway work zones .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , June 2009 ]
Illinois will begin using photo radar in freeway work zones in July .
One mile per hour over the speed limit and the machine will get you a nice $ 375.00 ticket in the mail .
Beginning July 1st , the State of Illinois will begin using the speed cameras in areas designated as “ Work Zones ” on major freeways .
Anyone caught by these devices will be mailed a $ 375.00 ticket for the FIRST offense .
The SECOND offense will cost $ 1000.00 and comes with
a 90 - Day suspension .
Drivers will also receive demerit points against their license , which allow insurance companies to raise Insurance rates .

The SECOND offense will cost $ 1000.00 and comes withsuspension .
Drivers will also receive demerit points against their license , which allow insurance companies to raise Insurance rates .
This is the harshest penalty structure ever set for a governmental unit involving PHOTO speed enforcement .
The State already has two camera vans on line issuing tickets 24/7 in work zones with speed limits lowered to 45 MPH .
Photos of both the Driver ’s face and License plate are taken .
Pass this on to everyone you know who might be affected .
Origins :
The short and sweet of it is that the information contained in the above - quoted alert regarding traffic fines in highway work zones in Illinois is relatively accurate .
( We ’re not sure about that “ one mile per hour over the speed limit ” bit . )
However , it does include one confusing aspect , and that has to do with dates .
While the e-mail trumpets its news as something that will take place in July ( thereby leading many readers to assume it means this year ) , in truth these
laws and their associated penalties have been in effect in Illinois since 2005 .
Indeed , the e-mailed alert itself dates to May 2005 , which is when it first began bouncing from inbox to inbox .
Why it was suddenly resurrected in June 2009 and again in June 2010 and flung about anew is anyone ’s guess .
In July 2005 Illinois enacted tough new laws that targeted drivers who flouted work zone speed limits and by so doing endangered the lives of construction workers and other drivers .
The full description of these laws and their associated penalties is detailed in a 30 March 2005 Illinois Department of Transportation press release , but the following portion is the relevant part :
First - time work zone speeders , including those caught on camera , will be hit with a fine of $ 375 , with $ 125 of that sum going to pay off - duty State Troopers to provide added enforcement in construction or maintenance zones .
Two - time offenders are subject to a $ 1,000 fine , including a $ 250 surcharge to hire Troopers , and the loss of their license for 90 days .

Two - time offenders are subject to a $ 1,000 fine , including a $ 250 surcharge to hire Troopers , and the loss of their license for 90 days .
Starting in July [ 2005 ] , State Troopers will deploy specially equipped vans that can take photographs of drivers speeding in IDOT and Tollway construction and maintenance zones .
Tickets will be issued by mail to vehicle owners .
In addition , drivers who hit a worker are subject for up to a $ 10,000 fine and 14 years in prison .
Likely spurred by the renewal of interest in the e-mailed item , on 24 June 2009 the Illinois Department of Transportation issued an updated version of its 2005 press release .
These work zone “ slow down ” laws appear to be working .
The number of deaths in construction zones in that state has fallen from 44 in 2003 to 21 in 2007 and 31 in 2008 .
( On average , there are more than 7,000 crashes in highway work zones every year in Illinois , resulting in approximately 2,600 injuries . )
More than 8,000 speeding tickets have been issued via mail since 2006 when state police started using photo speed enforcement in construction zones .

Health Care and Taxes : 10 Worst States for the Rich
These states could see the top combined tax rates if health surtax is passed .
July 20 , 2009  --
The health care surtax touted by some members of Congress would bring a heftier tax bill to the richest Americans , but depending on where they live , some will take bigger hits than others .
Take for instance , Eugenia , a California housewife whose husband works in finance .
The Bay Area woman , who asked that her last name not be used , said her husband 's income usually tops $ 1 million per year .
California taxes its top income earners more than 10 percent , meaning that between state taxes , federal taxes , Medicare taxes and the proposed health care surtax , the couple would face a total tax rate of more than 56 percent on part of their income .
" It 's very sad , because my husband works almost 12 hours per day and can take only two weeks of vacation , and then he 's getting less than half of what he 's working for , " Eugenia said .
" On top of everything , we 're going to pay for everybody else 's health insurance . "
The proposed health care surtax now making its way through Congress is a three - tiered plan requiring a 5.4 percent surtax for couples with an adjusted gross income of more than $ 1 million and individuals with an AGI of $ 800,000 .
Households with an AGI between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 would face a 1 percent surtax and those with an AGI between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million would face a 1.5 percent surtax .
According to a report this month by the Tax Foundation , a tax research group based in Washington , D.C. , wealthy taxpayers in 39 states could pay a top tax rate higher than 50 percent by 2011 .
The report combined states ' average local tax rates , top state and federal rates with the 2.9 percent Medicare tax and the proposed 5.4 percent health surtax .
Just more than 400,000 households nationwide would be hit by the 5.4 percent surtax , according to Tax Foundation projections .
But opponents of the surtax still worry that the additional tax burden would have a disastrous impact .
" We 're looking at serious economic consequences -- tax avoidance , people leaving these states , a shifting income capital game , " said Rea Hederman , Jr. , a senior policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation .
" The fact is [ that ] we still have trillions of dollars in deficit .
We ca n't tax the rich forever . "
Surtax defenders , meanwhile , are singing a different tune .
" The public pretty much thinks the richer people in America ought to pay their fair share ; they do n't think they 're paying their fair share , " House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said recently on ABCNews.com 's " Top Line . "
Under the plan , according to projections done for the Associated Press :
A family of four making $ 450,000 a year would pay $ 103,600 in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 1,000 .
A single filer making $ 450,000 a year would pay $ 112,200 in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 7,100 .
A family of four making $ 800,000 a year would pay $ 220,800 in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 30,000 .
A single filer making $ 800,000 a year would pay $ 231,300 in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 30,700 .
A family of four making $ 5 million a year would pay $ 1.81 million in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 443,500 .
A single filer making $ 5 million a year would pay $ 1.83 million in federal income taxes , an increase of $ 452,000 .
Here are , according to the Tax Foundation 's report , the 10 states that would see the highest combined top - income tax rates if the surtax becomes law .
1. Oregon : 57.54 percent
Why is Oregon at the top of the list ?
Both state taxes and municipal income taxes are to blame .
Oregon 's legislators recently approved provisions for a new tax income rate of 10.8 percent for individuals with taxable incomes higher than $ 125,000 and an 11 percent top rate for the state 's wealthiest .
Lawmakers said the increase would raise $ 488 million to help balance the state budget .
Tax Hits From Coast to Coast
1. Oregon ( continued )
Oregon is also one of more than just a dozen states in the country that has municipal income taxes .
Municipal income taxes average 0.36 percent in the Beaver State .
2. Hawaii : 57.22 percent
Like Oregon , Hawaii's tax rate for its richest resident is 11 percent .
But what saved the Aloha State from making the top of this dubious list is that it does n't have municipal income taxes .
But Hawaii does have a lot of is tax brackets :
In May , state legislators voted to add three more income tax brackets , bringing the number of brackets to 12 -- the highest in the country -- and that includes the highest tax bracket of 11 percent .
Previously , the top tax rate was 8.25 percent for individual taxable incomes of $ 48,000 and couples ' incomes of $ 96,000 .
3. New York : 56.92 percent
The combined total top tax rate for the Empire State would be just shy of 57 percent if the surtax became law , but New York City 's elites would be hit harder .
The city levies its own local income tax of 3.65 percent for the richest Big Apple dwellers , including Mayor Michael Bloomberg , media mogul Rupert Murdoch and designer Ralph Lauren .
Thanks to that tax , these and other New Yorkers would pay a top combined rate of 58.68 percent .
According to the Tax Foundation , states with densely populated areas of wealthy people will have some of the highest combined top income tax rates under the surtax .
4. California : 56.58 percent
Looking to commiserate on taxes with a fellow billionaire ?
California would be a good bet .
More billionaires on Forbes Magazine 's 2008 list of the 400 richest Americans live in California than in any other state .
California 's big-earners include Oracle CEO Lawrence Ellison ( the third - richest man in the U.S. , according to Forbes ) and Google 's co-founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
In February , the state voted to increase the highest tax rate on taxable income greater than $ 1 million from 10.3 percent to 10.55 percent .
Legislators also voted for a 0.25 percent increase for all tax rates through the end of 2010 .
5. Rhode Island : 56.22 percent
The nation 's smallest state also has some of the biggest tax rates .
Rhode Island 's top tax rate of 9.9 percent applies to taxable incomes greater than $ 372,950 .
But some of Rhode Island 's wealthiest benefit from the state 's optional flat tax .
Instead of paying the top rate , taxpayers can choose to pay the flat tax rate , currently at 6.5 percent and expected to fall to 5.5 percent by 2011 , but can not take any exemptions or deductions .
In June , state legislators voted against raising the flat tax rate to 7 percent .
6. Maryland : 55.61 percent
Like Oregon , municipal income taxes earned Maryland a spot on this list .
Local rates are highest in Montgomery and Howard counties , and some cities including Baltimore and Bethesda levy their own income taxes .
In 2008 , Maryland 's " millionaire tax " raised the top income tax rate to 6.25 percent , but left alone the 5.5 percent tax for individuals in the next lowest tax bracket ( those making more than $ 500,000 ) .
A year later , one - third fewer millionaires were found on Maryland 's tax rolls , the Baltimore Sun reported .
Many believe that some of the state 's wealthiest moved to neighboring and lower - tax state of Virginia .
7. New Jersey : 55.46 percent
The Tax Foundation lists the Garden State 's expected 2011 top tax rate at 8.97 percent , and that was the number the group used in calculating the more than 55 percent combined rate for top-earners .
But it could be worse :
In June , New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine , himself a millionaire , approved an increase of the state 's income tax rate for the 2009 tax year to 10.75 percent for incomes more than $ 1 million .
It 's unclear whether the state government will try to preserve that rate in future years .
8. Vermont : 55.36 percent
Though the Green Mountain State has among the highest top rates in the country , Vermont 's rates have been on the decline .
In June , state lawmakers voted to drop the top rate from 9.5 percent to 9.4 percent for taxable income higher than $ 372,950 .
The rate will drop to 8.95 percent in 2010 .
9. Minnesota : 54.36 percent
Suffering from a $ 2.7 billion deficit , Minnesota is one of few states that has not raised taxes to balance its budget .
Earlier this year , Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed a bill calling for $ 1 billion tax increase and a temporary top rate increase to 9 percent for individual incomes over $ 141,250 .
The state 's current top rate of 7.85 percent applies to individuals with taxable income greater than $ 74,650 and couples with greater than $ 131,970 .
10 . Idaho : 54.32 percent
Idaho rounds out the 10 highest combined rates list with a state income tax rate of 7.8 percent -- just a little lower than Minnesota .
But most Idaho residents in the state 's top tax bracket would n't be snared by the health care surtax .
Taxable income as low as $ 24,736 is taxed at the 7.8 percent rate .

The Lenovo Thinkpad T400S Laptop keyboard .
Lenovo put nearly a year of research into two design changes that debuted on an updated ThinkPad laptop this week .
No , not the thinner , lighter form or the textured touchpad — rather , the extra-large " Delete " and " Escape " keys .
It may seem like a small change , but David Hill , vice president of corporate identity and design at Lenovo , points out , " Any time you start messing around with the keyboard , people get nervous . "
Computers get smaller and faster every year , but keyboard design remains largely stuck in the 19th century .
When Beijing - based Lenovo , which bought IBM 's personal - computer business in 2005 , looked into improving the keyboard on the new ThinkPad T400s , a $ 1,600 - and - up laptop for businesspeople , it knew it had to proceed with caution .
To understand Lenovo 's concern , turn the clock back to the 1800s .
Back then , fast typing would jam typewriters , so a keyboard layout that slowed down flying fingers was devised .
The commonly used " A " key , for example , was banished to the spot under the relatively uncoordinated left pinky .
Typewriter technology evolved .
Mainframe computing led to function keys and others of uncertain use today .
The PC era dawned .
Yet many laws of keyboard layout remain sacred , like the 19 - millimeter distance between the centers of the letter keys .
Tom Hardy , who designed the original IBM PC of 1981 , said companies have tried many times to change the sizes of keys .
That first PC had a smaller " Shift " key than IBM 's popular Selectric typewriter did , and it was placed in a different spot , in part because the industry did n't think computers would replace typewriters for high - volume typing tasks .
IBM reversed course with the next version to quiet the outcry from skilled touch - typists .
" Customers have responded with a resounding , ' Do n't fool with the key unless you can you can improve it , " ' said Hardy , now a design strategist based in Atlanta .
PC makers relearned this lesson in the past year , as netbooks — tiny , cheap laptops — have become popular with budget - conscious consumers .
Early models boasted screens measuring as little as 7 inches on the diagonal , requiring shrunken keyboards that many people found to be too small .
Some even repeated IBM 's mistake by cutting the size of the " Shift " key .
The computer makers have largely shifted focus to 10 - inch ( 25 - centimeter ) or larger netbooks , so that there 'd be room for near - standard keyboards or better .
Push - back from consumers has n't stopped companies from testing and even manufacturing keyboards with unconventional designs over the years , in some cases demonstrating that people could learn to type faster than on standard QWERTY keyboards , so - called because of the arrangement of the top row of letters .
During Hardy 's time at IBM , researchers came up with ball - shaped one - handed keyboards that he said were faster than standard ones .
" A lot of those things never passed the business planners and the bean counters because they were concerned about manufacturing something that was just basically an experiment , " Hardy said .
Ones that did get made have remained niche .
Paul Bradley , an executive creative director at the global design group Frog Design , said makers of ergonomic keyboards that also improved typing speed were counting on concern over carpal tunnel syndrome during the dot - com boom of the 1990s to drive demand , but the market never materialized .
If ever there were a time to make radical changes to the keyboard , now might be it .
As evidence , Bradley noted the high tolerance many younger people show for tapping out cell - phone messages on tiny keypads using only their thumbs .
Lenovo is on a more conservative course .
In designing the new ThinkPad , it installed keystroke - tracking software on about 30 employees ' computers ( They volunteered ) .
On average , they used the " Escape " and " Delete " keys 700 times per week , yet those were the only " outboard " keys , or non-letter keys , that had n't been enlarged .
Lenovo made those two keys about twice as long in the vertical direction to fit the way people reach up , rather than to the side , and then deliberately whack those keys , said Hill , the Lenovo executive who was at IBM for nearly 20 years before the 2005 sale to Lenovo .
The new design cuts down on accidental taps of the " End " and " Insert " keys , too .
The new keyboard is n't perfect .
Hill called " Caps Lock " a frustrating hangover from typewriter days , a key that can introduce garble , emulate shouting or foil password entries without the user noticing .
" I think maybe sometime in the future , we should maybe entertain removing it , " he said .
" It 's one of those things you kind of have to approach with caution .
There might be some people out there who just really like their ' Caps Lock ' key for whatever reason . "

Campaign to boost sales of the Zimbabwean using useless currency wins top award at Cannes Lions advertising festival
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A campaign to boost sales of the Zimbabwean , a newspaper that attacked Robert Mugabe 's regime by using the troubled country 's almost worthless bank notes to make billboard adverts , has won the top award in the outdoor category at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival .
The campaign to promote sales of the newspaper , which is published in the UK and South Africa , used the Zimbabwean currency as an advertising medium on posters and billboards to raise awareness of the dire state of the country under Mugabe .
Straplines used in the poster campaign included " Thanks to Mugabe this money is wallpaper " , " Z$ 250,000,000 cannot buy the paper to print this poster on " , " It 's cheaper to print this on money than on paper " , and " Fight the regime that has crippled a country " .
The ads , by South African agency TBWA / Hunt / Lascaris / Johannesburg , won the Cannes Lions Grand Prix award for outdoor advertising .
The Zimbabwean campaign also won a gold lion in the media category .
The agency said one of the most " eloquent symbols " of the state the country is in , with rampant inflation , was to use the Zimbabwean currency .
The newspaper faces a 55 % " luxury import " tax to get copies into Zimbabwe , making it unaffordable to most locals .
To get more copies of the paper into the hands of Zimbabweans it has to be subsidised , which is done by raising awareness and sales outside the country .
The Zimbabwean newspaper , which carries the slogan A Voice for the Voiceless , targets Zimbabweans living in the UK and the 2 million living in Southern Africa , mainly South Africa and Botswana .
Wilf Mbanga , the founder , editor and publisher of the Zimbabwean , lives in Britain after being forced to leave Zimbabwe when he was branded an enemy of the people .
He has written for the Guardian 's Comment is Free blogging website .
UK ad agency DDB London won a bronze lion at Cannes in the outdoor category for a campaign for Harvey Nichols in Bristol .

Predictions of $ 250 a barrel on fears for oil reserves , hopes of economic recovery and hedging against weak dollar
The price of oil burst through the $ 71 a barrel mark today amid revelations that proven reserves had fallen for the first time in 10 years and predictions that the price could eventually hit $ 250 .
The latest high – from lows of $ 30 only four months ago – came on the New York Mercantile Exchange , where the cost of July deliveries rose by $ 1.35 to $ 71.36 .
This comes on top of a $ 2 rise the day before as investors rushed into the market on the back of lower stockpile figures , higher demand estimates and speculation against further falls in the dollar .
" I would n't be surprised if we 're testing $ 80 in a week or two , " said one analyst , while BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , questioned whether $ 90 could be the " right " value .
Kuwait 's oil minister , Sheikh Ahmad al - Abdullah al - Sabah , put some of the rise down to signs of recovery in Asia but warned that overall demand was still weaker than last year .
Opec would not raise supply at current oil prices but did not rule it out " if it reached $ 100 " , he said .
Alexei Miller , chairman of the Russian energy group Gazprom , raised the stakes further when he reiterated last year 's estimates of $ 250 a barrel .
" This forecast has not become reality yet , given that the [ credit ] crisis gained momentum and exerted a powerful impact on the global energy market .
But does this mean that our forecast was unrealistic ?
Not at all . "
The latest surge has also raised fears that higher energy costs could snuff out the nascent economic recovery .
Shares on Wall Street 's Nasdaq index fell 1 % .
The febrile atmosphere in oil markets was fed by the publication of BP 's Statistical Review of World Energy , which showed that the world 's proven crude reserves had fallen by 3bn barrels to 1.258tn by 2008 from a revised 1.261tn in 2007 .
Declines in important producers such as Russia and Norway offset rises in new areas such as Vietnam , India and Egypt .
The figures did not include Canada 's tar sands , which are put at 150 bn barrels .
The drop is partly attributed to a drop in exploration drilling due to the precipitous fall in oil prices last year but also to the end of " easy " oil .
Conflict this week in the Amazon and speculation about Arctic drilling underlined how oil companies are pushing into environmentally sensitive places to find new reserves .
Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , insisted there was enough crude to last 42 years at current consumption levels , roughly the same as last year .
Adherents of " peak oil " – the theory that the maximum rate of oil production has been reached – believe supplies will run out much sooner because of growing demand .
The BP boss said : " Our data confirms that the world has enough proved reserves of oil , natural gas and coal to meet the world 's energy needs for decades to come . "
Higher prices allowed companies to invest in finding further reserves while not choking off demand , he said .
" There is a rational argument to say that somewhere between $ 60 to $ 90 a barrel is the right sort of level , " he said .
Global oil consumption fell 0.6 % to 81.8 m barrels a day in 2008 , the first decline since 1993 and the largest drop for 27 years .
North Sea output dropped 6.3 % to its lowest level for three decades .
By contrast , gas use rose by 2.5 % globally and 16 % in China .
The use of coal , the heaviest emitter of climate - changing carbon , rose 3.1 % , with Chinese demand up 6.8 % , leaving it with a market share of 43 % despite more high - profile announcements about its commitment to renewables .
BP says it is difficult to compare " primary " carbon fuels with renewable sources of electricity .
BP notes that globally solar capacity rose nearly 70 % and wind by 30 % year on year but says renewables only generated 1.5 % of global electricity and therefore began at a low base .
But it notes these sources are playing an increasingly important role in some countries with wind power providing 20 % of total electricity generation in Denmark , 11 % in Spain and 7 % in Germany .
Despite the 2008 rise in coal consumption , the BP data showed growth in the use of the fuel continued to decline compared with 2007 when it rose 5 % and five years ago when it went up by 8 % .
But the coal figures will alarm environmentalists and increase the calls for companies and governments to speed up trials on " clean coal " technology and the use of carbon capture and storage .
China has promised to increase its use of renewables : Zhang Xiaoqiang , vice - chairman of the China 's national development and reform commission , says the country may produce as much as 20 % of its energy from wind and solar by 2020 .

A LEFT -WING PRO - NUCLEAR ENERGY PERSPECTIVE , FIGHTING FOR A SAFE , CLEAN AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE WHERE GENERATION IS FOR HUMAN NEEDS AND NOT FOR PROFIT
BONN , Germany ( Reuters ) - Climate change is turning the oceans more acid in a trend that could endanger everything from clams to coral and be irreversible for thousands of years , national science academies said on Monday .
A 40,000 tonne coal ship sits about 100 metres ( 330 feet ) from Nobbys Beach after running aground near the coal port of Newcastle on Australia 's east coast June 8 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Tim Wimborne
Seventy academies from around the world urged governments meeting in Bonn for climate talks from June 1 - 12 to take more account of risks to the oceans in a new U.N. treaty for fighting global warming due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
“ To avoid substantial damage to ocean ecosystems , deep and rapid reductions of carbon dioxide emissions of at least 50 percent ( below 1990 levels ) by 2050 , and much more thereafter , are needed , ” the academies said in a joint statement .
The academies said rising amounts of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas emitted mainly by human use of fossil fuels , were being absorbed by the oceans and making it harder for creatures to build protective body parts .
The shift disrupts ocean chemistry and attacks the “ building blocks needed by many marine organisms , such as corals and shellfish , to produce their skeletons , shells and other hard structures , ” it said .
On some projections , levels of acidification in 80 percent of Arctic seas would be corrosive to clams that are vital to the food web by 2060 , it said .
And “ coral reefs may be dissolving globally , ” it said , if atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide were to rise to 550 parts per million ( ppm ) from a current 387 ppm .
Corals are home to many species of fish .
“ These changes in ocean chemistry are irreversible for many thousands of years , and the biological consequences could last much longer , ” it said .
The warning was issued by the Inter - Academy Panel , representing science academies of countries from Albania to Zimbabwe and including those of Australia , Britain , France , Japan and the United States .
UNDERWATER CATASTROPHE
Martin Rees , president of the Royal Society , the British science academy , said there may be an “ underwater catastrophe . ”
“ The effects will be seen worldwide , threatening food security , reducing coastal protection and damaging the local economies that may be least able to tolerate it , ” he said .
The academies ’ statement said that , if current rates of carbon emissions continue until 2050 , computer models indicate that “ the oceans will be more acidic than they have been for tens of millions of years . ”
It also urged actions to reduce other pressures on the oceans , such as pollution and over - fishing .
Arundhati Roy has two voices .
The first , dramatically personal and playful , was the one in which she wrote her extraordinary debut novel , The God of Small Things , a semi-autobiographical account of growing up in rural Kerala .
The second voice is flatter and angrier , more urban and distrustful of the quirks of the individual .
She describes it as " writing from the heart of the crowd " .
It is this voice that she has used exclusively in the 12 years since her novel was published , in four collections of non-fiction - the latest of which , Listening to Grasshoppers : Field Notes on Democracy , was published last week .
Roy , now 47 , describes the difference between the two voices as the difference between " dancing and walking " .
It is a long while since Roy 's writing has danced .
She says she pedestrianised her imagination not out of choice , not at all , but because there seemed nothing else to do .
" If I could , " she says , " I would love to spend all my time writing fiction .
With the non-fiction I wrote one book that I wanted to write and three more that I did n't . "
This compulsion - towards reporting and polemic - Roy blames in part on the success of The God of Small Things .
She wrote her novel for four and a half years entirely in secret ; even her husband , the film - maker Pradip Krishen , did not know of its existence until it was finished .
And she wrote it for herself .
She had written a couple of film scripts before that and had come to despise the collaborative creative process .
The book was an exercise in downshifting .
She imagined when it was published that it would sell " maybe 500 copies in Delhi . "
In fact , it sold 6 m copies worldwide and won her the Booker Prize .
" The prize , " she says now , " was actually responsible in many ways for my political activism .
I won this thing and I was suddenly the darling of the new emerging Indian middle class - they needed a princess .
They had the wrong woman .
I had this light shining on me at the time , and I knew that I had the stage to say something about what was happening in my country .
What is exciting about what I have done since is that writing has become a weapon , some kind of ammunition . "
The essays in Listening to Grasshoppers are her collected hand grenades from the last eight years .
Roy says the process of putting them together has been " totally sad for me in a way - to see that six years ago you said something was going to happen and then it happened .
It is not as though I am a genius or a witch .
When you start seeing the way the whole machine works , the structure of what is happening is so clear . "
That machine is the engine of free market " progress " that politicians in Delhi call " Indian Shining " .
Roy sees it as the destruction for multinational corporate profit of everything that her nation should care about .
Her book begins with a question : " Is there life after democracy ? " and goes on to count the ways that successive Indian governments and businessmen have waged a repressive war on the poor and on minorities , and have pursued devastating environmental destruction for economic and political gain .
She has just returned from the Chhattisgarh region , which is " being targeted by corporates for its wealth of iron ore .
In the name of fighting Maoist rebels , hundreds of villages have been forcibly evacuated and almost 40,000 people moved into police camps . "
It is , she says , heartbreaking to see what is going on , " the levels of violence , the levels of dispossession ; if that was happening in Iran or some other country that did n't have a free market and a democracy it would have been on the front pages every day .
Because it is India it does not rate a mention . "
In her stride , she goes on to describe the " building of a hundred dams in the high Himalayas .
When you see what is being done it is like it is being done to your own body . "
In 2002 Roy was briefly imprisoned for her protests against the Narmada dam project .
When she talks of these things now - and of the horror of the ongoing war in Kashmir - it is with a rawness and a weariness that makes you half - expect her to scream with anger .
" Time is running out , " she says , " rivers are running dry .
But you can not fight against dams .
It does n't involve just people ; it involves a whole eco system and cropping patterns .
But you cannot have an armed struggle against a rising river . "
While the Indian miracle takes place , she says , the country is host to more than a third of the world 's undernourished children .
Only her compatriots could have celebrated the victory of Slumdog Millionaire on Oscar night .
" The fact that the film - not even an Indian film - won these prizes sent people into orbit .
But it is an odd movie for a country to be proud of .
What were we celebrating ?
Child poverty ?
If it was n't so tragic it would be comical . "
When I ask her where she places her hope , Roy shrugs .
She is tiny in stature , but her disillusion can fill a room .
She has no faith in conventional politics to change anything .
Obama " might be a symbol , " she concedes , but nothing " about the relation of American capitalism with the rest of the world will alter ...
To answer your question , it 's not about my hope , it 's about my DNA .
There are people who are comfortable with power and people who are distinctly uncomfortable and made to question it . "
In this respect , Roy is very much her mother 's daughter .
Before Arundhati was born , Mary Roy was a visible and vocal campaigner for women 's rights .
As a divorcee she set up an experimental girl 's school ; Arundhati was her star pupil .
Does she feel like a creation of her mother ?
" No .
We are temperamentally very different , " she says quickly .
" My mother runs a huge institution ; she has hundreds of people working for her , and I am completely a loner , I do n't even have a secretary or anybody .
I am almost terrified of that .
In my head I want to feel I can be anywhere .
There is a sort of recklessness that being a loner allows me . "
Roy left home as soon as she could , initially to become an architect and then to follow other dreams .
" When I was 18 , " she has written elsewhere , " I chose freedom over the safety of a home , good clothes and Johnson 's baby lotion .
The fortunate thing was that I did n't need to be married , or oppressed , or beaten to decide that I wanted independence at all costs . "
Roy speaks a lot about her activist mother but her father disappears from her story .
What became of him ?
" My parents separated when I was two , and I never saw my father until I was 24 or 25 , " she says .
" He was an alcoholic , completely .
He died last year .
I did n't really know him but I was there at the end .
My aunt used to look after him and I used to help sometimes but you could n't talk to him , not really ... "
She must have felt that as an absence ?
" I think that in some ways , " she says , " the fact that my father was missing from my life was not a bad thing .
For one thing it gave my mother a lot of space to indulge her personality , and she needed at least enough space for two people !
And it allowed me to avoid any kind of paternal battles .
Just by experience I was a natural born feminist , I did n't have to be schooled .
That is how it was . "
Roy made a decision quite young not to have kids .
Was that another strategy to protect her freedom ?
" Well in a way , growing up , I had always had kids .
At my mother 's school - when I was four I was looking after kids who were three .
I did quite a lot of teaching .
By the time I was 16 I never wanted to see another child again ! "
She draws strength for her struggles from other writers ; Noam Chomsky , John Berger are names that crop up repeatedly .
" I see them occasionally , I read them .
There is a shared affection I think . "
If she had n't won the Booker Prize , does she believe she would have written more novels by now ?
" I have no idea if I would have written more or less or none at all , " she says .
" But it did change things .
Now I feel that I am ready to do it again , in some ways , but I am not finding the space .
It is a difficult choice for me when there is always something happening .
In a philosophical sense I know I am insignificant , but in the current moment I can make a bit of a difference . "
That belief makes her a constant irritation to Indian politicians ; she is the scourge of the Hindu nationalists , of the BJP in particular .
She rather relishes the role .
" For the past decade or so they have tried both ways to keep me quiet , " she says , smiling . "
They have tried putting me in prison and they have tried giving me awards .
In the run up to these elections the home minister LK Advani was mentioning me by name at rallies , you know , denouncing me as an anti-national ... "
I suggest to her that part of the freedom she covets is perhaps the freedom to fail ; I have the sense , talking to her , that she distrusts intensely the idea of herself as a literary icon .
" It is true , " she says , " that success is the most boring thing , it is tinny and brittle , failure runs deeper .
Success is dangerous .
I have a very complicated relationship with that word .
I think that I was quite a grown - up child , and I have been a pretty childish adult .
When I was very small this mad uncle of mine who is one of the main characters in my novel took me on one side and showed me this horrible bauble .
He said ' Do you want this ? '
I was maybe three or something , and of course I did .
He said , ' Well I will give it you as long as you promise to fail . '
That idea has certainly stayed with me . "
It is hard , talking to Roy , to see where she finds the joy in her life that glittered in some of the sentences of her novel .
Her husband has just written a book about the trees of Delhi , which has become a surprise bestseller .
Is that a passion they share ?
They have , she says , a different relationship to nature .
" He was a person who grew up in Delhi and I grew up on the river in Kerala .
I was frightened of being stuck there and married off to some dull Syrian Christian boy so I used to dream always of escape to the big city .
My husband 's dreams went in the other direction . "
So they have found common ground in their city 's trees ?
" He is a much more methodical person than me , he likes to name things .
If I go into the forest I can appreciate its beauty but I almost immediately want to know the politics of it .
I want to know who is buying the mangoes , what is under the ground . "
As we talk , Roy from time to time expresses her concern not to be presented as a personality .
" You know , this is not the life of Arundhati ... I have no interest in that at all . "
She hates to be boxed in , she suggests , even in a profile .
Does she worry , I wonder , about losing the smaller voice , the individual one ?
" Well , if I lose it , so what ? " she says .
" I am writing bits of fiction but then I get derailed by something happening . "
Does she ever think a novel might sometimes be a more affecting way to express her politics ?
She says she does n't know .
And then she goes on to describe the brutal economics of bauxite mining in the state of Orissa .

A teenage girl sexually assaulted by a 48 - year - old man ended up missing a lot of school after the Sept. 14 incident .
Meetings with police and the Northampton County Children , Youth and Families Division are responsible for some of the absences , the 15 - year - old girl 's mother says .
Emotional upheaval is responsible for the rest .
Even when her daughter was in school , her mother says , she was n't focused on learning .
As a result , the girl failed math , English and gym , meaning she'd have to repeat her ninth - grade year at Liberty High School unless she attends summer school .
The victim's mother says she started receiving phone calls and notices about her daughter 's absences , but Bethlehem Area School District officials did not respond as expected when she explained the situation to them .
The girl is willing to attend summer school , but her mother could n't afford the $ 400 tuition by Wednesday -- a deadline set by the the district .
The victim's mother says the district did n't give her enough time to come up with the money -- she 's a single mom who also cares for her ailing mother -- and refused to extend the deadline until Friday .
Friday is when the man who sexually assaulted the girl , Osvaldo Correa , of Bethlehem , is being sentenced .
The victim 's mother had hoped the judge would make her daughter 's tuition part of his restitution .
Crime Victims Council of the Lehigh Valley Executive Director Suzanne Beck said the mother and daughter should n't have to wrangle with the district over the education of a child .
Read the complete story linked above , then tell us if you think the district is being unreasonable by posting a comment .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Energy Secretary Steven
Chu announced on Friday plans to restart the country ’s first clean coal power project , scrapped by the previous Bush administration as too expensive .
Under an agreement with the non-profit FutureGen Alliance , the Energy Department will take the first steps toward developing the first U.S. commercial scale - carbon capture and storage project , to be located in Mattoon , Illinois .
“ Not only does this research have the potential to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. , but it also could eventually result in lower emissions around the world , ” Chu said .
The FutureGen project was scrapped by the Bush administration due to a ballooning price tag of some $ 1.8 billion .
But a congressional report released in March accused the Bush administration of inflating the cost in order to scrap the project .
President Barack Obama and other Illinois politicians have expressed support for the project in their home state .
“ For nearly a year and a half , the people of Illinois have endured delays , reversals and disagreements over costs and funding of FutureGen , ” Illinois Senator Dick Durbin said .
“ Today , patience and perseverance pay off -- FutureGen at Mattoon is finally ready to move forward , ” he said .
The new agreement calls for a restart of preliminary design activities and updating the cost estimate , the department said .
Once these activities and others are completed in early 2010 , the department and the alliance will decide whether to continue with the project .
The Energy Department expects to spend about $ 1.07 billion on the project , with $ 1 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
Not all environmental groups , however , embrace the concept of clean coal .
Several groups , including the Alliance for Climate Protection , Natural Resources Defense Council and the League of Conservation Voters , launched a multi-million dollar campaign last winter against clean coal , calling it a myth .
They contend that coal - fired power plants are major carbon emitters contributing heavily to climate change .
The technology to capture and store carbon in an environmentally safe way is commercially untested and not yet cost competitive , they say .

The number of whales killed and sold as ‘ incidental bycatch ’ along the coasts of Japan and South Korea may equal the amount of whales caught through legal whaling , threatening populations of minke , western gray , humpbacks , fin whales , and Bryde ’s whales .
“ The sale of bycatch alone supports a lucrative trade in whale meat at markets in some Korean coastal cities , where the wholesale price of an adult minke whale can reach as high as $ 100,000 .
Given these financial incentives , you have to wonder how many of these whales are , in fact , killed intentionally . ”
– Scott Baker , Marine Mammal Institute
Although only about 150 whales are caught each year in Japan ’s legal whaling industry , another 150 may enter the markets of Japan and South Korea from animals killed as bycatch in other fishing activities .
Japan and South Korea are the only countries that allow the commercial sale of bycatch whales , and a survey of whale products on the market leads some scientists to believe that large amounts of it is being labeled bycatch .
Scott Baker , a cetacean expert with the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University , and Vimoksalehi Lukoscheck , of the University of California - Irvine , presented the results of a study at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) in Portugal , which found that nearly 46 % of the minke whale products they examined in Japanese markets originated from a coastal population .
The coastal population of minke whales has distinct genetic characteristics , and is under protection by international agreements .
Baker and his colleagues have developed genetic methods for identifying the species of whale - meat products in order to determine the origin of the animals , which helps when trying to determine the actual number of whales killed for market each year .
Japan has reported only about 19 minke whales killed through bycatch in recent years , but new regulations covering the commercial sale of bycatch whales have been approved , and the number of whales reported as killed is on the rise .
The country wants to begin a coastal whaling program , and is looking to the IWC for an agreement on the issue , but Baker says that any such arrangement should be scrutinized because there are no accurate population counts to determine the level of a sustainable harvest .
Illegal whale hunting can be done using the cover of bycatch labeling , but no one knows the extent to which it occurs .
Korean police seized 50 tons of minke whale meat in Ulsan in 2008 as a result of an investigation into an organized illegal whaling operation , and this may only represent a small portion of the whale poaching that actually goes on .
Market surveys found other protected species for sale , including humpback and fin whales , but one species in particular , the western gray whale , is at greater risk in these illegal whaling operations due to its small population , estimated to be only 100 .

Scientists from the Pittsburgh University ( USA ) suggested a new method for treating insomnia – using a special cooling cap .
They studied the effect of reduction of temperature on the activity of the core of the brain in people suffering from insomnia .
As it turns out , brain activity and metabolism are reduced in people without insomnia as they fall asleep , on the other hand , they stay the same in people suffering from insomnia .
Based on the data received from the studies , the scientists designed a special cooling device , which generally looks like a bathing hat .
During the experiment , the “ cap ” helped improve sleep , reduce metabolism and activity of the brain for 5 out of 8 participants .
The scientists joke , saying that it is very possible that in the near future this head cooling cap will become very popular .

Emacs Lisp revived

Hi all ,
I finally started real work on implementing the elisp compiler and just
pushed a first start - off code to branch elisp .
It is however not yet
usable for anything , but also already has some very few things done .
Some important points I 'd like to mention and welcome comments :
1 ) In implementing all those special forms like progn , prog1 , if , while ,
... I think it is best to translate a basic set directly to TreeIL via
the compiler , but also implement some ( where that 's reasonably possible )
simply as elisp macros ( or even some things as functions ) .
What do you
think about this plan ?
2 ) It seems that elisp uses nil as false value ( and does not have a
dedicated false ) ; so the question raises , should be then always use #f
for nil , or maybe TreeIL 's void ?
But some experiments show that void is
rather interpreted as true :
tree - il@( guile-user ) > ( if ( void ) ( const 1 ) ( const 2 ) ) 1 scheme@( guile - user ) > ( if ( if #f 0 ) 1 2 ) 1
Not related , but I came across it : ( if ( begin ) 1 2 ) gives an error ,
do n't know if that 's expected .
I think I remember already reading some discussion about this topic in
general for Guile 's elisp support ; so what should we do here ?
My code
so far uses #f as nil , BTW .
3 ) I still have n't got building lexical constructs in TreeIL working
( and I figure that named - lets for compiling the while - construct are even
more interesting ) , but will hopefully manage to do so soon ...
Yours , Daniel

In yesterday 's CHART OF THE DAY we noted the similarities between this current rally and the famous rally between 1929 and 1930 .
Today , David Rosenberg picks up on the same thing , and fills it out a little more .
California Assemblymember Tom Ammiano has introduced a bill to legalize cannabis in California .
The bill quite sensibly recognizes that California can't have a legal market while the drug remains banned under federal law …
I 'm not sure I understand what Mark Kleiman means by this :
Why not ?
California has a legal market for medical marijuana , which remains illegal under federal law .
There has been federal interference , but the vast majority of dispensaries in California remain in operation .
Patients can generally obtain medicine legally and conveniently , despite anything and everything DEA has done to undermine California law .
I 'm sure the DEA would like us to think that we can't legalize marijuana , and that might go a long way towards explaining why they keep doing these ridiculous raids that everyone hates .
But there is no reason that California or any other state can't legalize marijuana as long as the votes add up .
Sure , the feds will likely show up and makes a mess here and there , but in case nobody noticed , those actions consistently lead to greater public support for changing marijuana laws .
If we 've learned anything from what 's been happening in California for the past decade , it is that the federal government can't even come close to stamping out marijuana reform at the state level .
Imagine this : 1 ) California voters pass ballot initiative creating regulated marijuana sales .
2 ) Shops begin opening in LA , San Francisco .3 ) DEA raids high - profile operations , big headlines , big protests .
4 ) Federal charges brought against defendants .
First jury trial ends in surprise acquittal .
5 ) Number of new businesses opening exceeds number of raids being conducted .
6 ) Voters in Nevada , Oregon pass ballot initiatives creating regulated marijuana sales ... Is any of this impossible ?

As the costumed superhero known as the Green Cross Man , he told the children of the 70s to Stop , Look and Listen .
Now , the British actor best known as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars films has become the unlikely hero of a very different campaign .
Diagnosed with prostate cancer at the start of the year , Dave Prowse MBE has found himself raising awareness of men's health .
" There 's this terrible embarrassment , " says the former bodybuilder and weightlifter .
Darth Vader 's been very very good to me
" You 've got to get over to men that there is no embarrassment in going to the doctor and letting the doctor probe around and having a look to see how you are .
" It does n't worry me in the slightest and it should n't worry any man . "
The 72 - year - old , who is married with three children , only discovered he had prostate cancer through his charity work .
At a golf tournament in aid of the Prostate Cancer Charity , he was asked to present the cheque to a representative .
She happened to ask if he had had a PSA test , which is recommended in all men over 50 .
READ MORE about prostate cancer " The lady said : ' Thank you very much , and by the way , have you ever been tested for prostate cancer yourself ? ' " he recalls .
" I said : ' No , I 'm perfectly all right thank you very much , and I 'm not having any problems on that side of things . ' "
As the Green Cross man in the 1970s
But the conversation lingered in his mind , and when he visited his GP a few months later for an unrelated matter , he asked for the blood test .
A biopsy revealed suspicious signs , and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer .
He was treated with radiotherapy and medication , and says the only after - effect was an occasional " hot flush " .
Because the disease was caught early , the future now looks good .
Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK , accounting for almost a quarter of male cancers
Each year , nearly 35,000 men are diagnosed and more than 10,000 die from the disease
Most men with early prostate cancer are diagnosed because they have problems with bladder habits
" As far as I 'm concerned , I 've been given the all clear , " he explains .
" We had a letter from the surgeon saying as far as the future was concerned the prognosis was excellent .
That basically is it . "
He is now keen to carry on travelling the world to appear at Star Wars conventions .
" Darth Vader 's obviously been very very good to me , " he says .
" I did the first three movies - Star Wars , Empire ( Strikes Back ) and ( Return of the ) Jedi , which took me from ' 76 to ' 82 .
" But the interesting thing of course is that since Star Wars came out , a whole culture has expanded worldwide in what I call the fandom business .
" And wherever you go , people turn up literally in their thousands . "

ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Common dolphins , once a frequent sight in the Mediterranean , may soon be extinct in Greece ’s Ionian Sea due to overfishing , environmentalists warned on Wednesday .
WWF and a dozen other environmental organizations said research showed numbers of dark - grey , white - bellied dolphins had decreased from 150 to 15 in 10 years in protected areas in the Ionian , between Greece and Italy .
“ It is called the common dolphin but the problem nowadays in the Mediterranean is that it ’s not common at all anymore .
It is endangered .
It is about to be extinct , ” WWF Greece - based expert Giorgos Paximadis said .
“ Overfishing has caused the destruction of the marine environment and the dramatic decrease of common dolphins , ” Paximadis told Reuters , adding that it deprived the dolphins of their food .
The environmental groups urged Greece to take measures , including the adoption of larger mesh size for all bottom - set nets , restrictions on trawling and on recreational fishing as well as stronger penalties for illegal fishing .
The common dolphin population in the Ionian Sea is one of the last in the Mediterranean , Paximadis said .
“ As they are on the top of food web , it shows that the rest of the marine web is not healthy , ” he said .
Three other species of dolphins in Greece , including the bottlenose dolphin , are considered vulnerable but not yet in danger of extinction , he said .
Computer scientists have only begun to realize the potential of quantum computing and algorithms , where computers use quantum principles to store data in qubits .
One thing that could help in the development of algorithms is the " quantum walk , " which involves the movement of a particle as a superposition of all possible states .
Until recently , quantum walks were a theoretical construct .
However , according to Science , physicists in Germany are now able to make cesium atoms arranged in an optical lattice perform a physical quantum walk .
Quantum walks were first proposed by physicist Richard Feynman and are , in terms of probability , the opposite of a random walk .
A random walk might be modeled by a person flipping a coin , and for each flip he steps left for heads and right for tails .
In this case , his most probable location is the center , with the probability distribution tapering off in either direction .
A quantum walk involves the use of internal states and superpositions , and results in the hypothetical person " exploring " every possible position simultaneously .
When a quantum walker flips a coin , it directs him to move one way , but he maintains an " internal state " that moves the other way , making him a superposition of both directions of movement .
During a quantum walk , as the quantum object takes more steps , it becomes " delocalized " over all available positions , as if its presence is blurred .
A second feature of quantum walking is matter - wave interference , as when the person flips heads and next flips tails .
The second step makes the new superposition overlap the old one , and the new superposition can either amplify the old position or remove it .
After all this occurs and the desired number of steps have been taken , an attempted observation will collapse the superposition and " resolve " the object to a single position .
As previously mentioned , a random walk 's probability distribution has a single peak tapering off in either direction .
A quantum walk 's probability distribution generally has two peaks placed evenly on either side of the starting position .
However , this distribution can vary depending on the initial internal state of the particle doing the walking , which can cause the final position to strongly favor one side or the other .
While it has been asserted that quantum walks might be observable in many different systems , it has long been a theoretical construct .
This has changed with scientists ' ability to realize a quantum walk with laser - cooled cesium atoms held in the potential wells of a one - dimensional optical lattice .
Using Hadamard - type gates , which perform a sort of Fourier transform on the atoms , the cesium atoms ' physical and internal states can be shifted , resulting in a distribution of locations like that seen in a theoretical quantum walk , with two peaks or one heavily - favored off - center peak .
The authors of the new paper were able to replicate the theoretical quantum behavior on walks of up to ten steps and could refocus the delocalized particle backwards through the gates to its initial site on the lattice .
The ability to conduct quantum walks has enormous implications for the field of computer science .
Quantum algorithms abandon the use of transistors and bits in favor of " qubits , " or quantum binary digits .
While a bit can only hold one piece of data , like a 0 or 1 , a qubit can hold a superposition of all possible states of data ( a 0 , a 1 , or both ) .
Furthermore , a qubit can be entangled with other qubits to hold all possible collective states — three qubits can simultaneously hold states 000 , 001 , 011 , and so on , covering all combinations .

A wild Amur tiger is a rare sight
The world 's largest cat , the Amur tiger , is down to an effective wild population of fewer than 35 individuals , new research has found .
Although up to 500 of the big cats actually survive in the wild , the effective population is a measure of their genetic diversity .
That in turn is a good predictor of the Amur tiger 's chances of survival .
The results come from the most complete genetic survey yet of wild Amur tigers , the rarest subspecies of tiger .
At the start of the 20th Century , nine subspecies of tiger existed , with a total world population of more than 100,000 individuals .
Human impacts have since caused the extinction of three subspecies , the Javan tiger , Bali tiger and Caspian tiger , and world tiger numbers could now have fallen to fewer than 3000 .
The Amur tiger , or Siberian tiger as it is also known , is the largest subspecies which once lived across a large portion of northern China , the Korean peninsula , and the southernmost regions of far east Russia .
The Amur tiger most likely derived from the Caspian tiger , recent research has shown .
What is remarkable about the Amur tiger is how much lower the effective population size is than the census size
Biologist Michael Russello
During the early 20th century , the Amur tiger too was almost driven to extinction , as expanding human settlements , habitat loss and poaching wiped out this biggest of cats from over 90 % of its range .
By the 1940s just 20 to 30 individuals survived in the wild .
Since then , a ban on hunting and a remarkable conservation effort have slowly helped the Amur tiger recover .
Today , up to 500 are thought to survive in the wild , while 421 cats are kept in captivity .
However , the genetic health of the tiger has n't improved , according to a new analysis published in Molecular Ecology .
Little variation Michael Russello and Philippe Henry of the University of British Columbia , in Kelowna , Canada led a team drawn from universities in Canada , Japan and the US in a bid to analyse the genetic profiles of the remaining wild Amur tigers .
They sampled nuclear DNA found within the scat samples of an estimated 95 individuals found throughout the Amur tiger 's range , likely constituting up to 20 % of the remaining population .
The study sampled the amount of variation within the DNA from more tigers , across a broader geographic , than any previous research .
" Although the census population size of Amur tigers is closer to 500 individuals , the population is behaving as if it were the size of 27 to 35 individuals , " says Russello .
That 's the lowest genetic diversity ever recorded for a population of wild tigers .
The effective population of any group of animals will be lower than the number that actually exist , due to factors such as non-breeding individuals or a skewed sex ratio .
" However , what is remarkable about the Amur tiger is how much lower the effective population size is than the census size , " says Russello .
Population split Another important finding to emerge from the study is that the remaining Amur tigers are segregated into two populations that rarely intermingle .
The majority of Amur tigers live among the slopes of the Russian Sikhote - Alin Mountains , with 20 or fewer living separately in Southwest Primorye in Russia .
The two groups are separated by a corridor of development between Vladivostok and Ussurisk , and the genetic analysis showed that perhaps just three tigers had managed to cross the divide , reducing the effective size of the wild population further .
" There is little sharing of genes across the development corridor , suggesting that these two populations are fairly discrete , " says Russello .
" In actuality , it seems that Amur tigers are residing in two , fairly independent populations on either side of the development corridor between Vladivostok and Ussurisk , further lowering the effective size for each from 26 to 28 for Sikhote - Alin and 2.8 to 11 for Southwest Primorye . "
That means more work needs to be done to open up this barrier segregating the tigers .
If that does n't happen , then it 's likely that the Southwest Primorye population will continue to dwindle .
That could also kill off the prospect of reintroducing Amur tigers to China , as those in Southwest Primorye are living closest to their former Chinese range .
Captive resource
The news is not all bad for the Amur tiger , however .
Russello and Henry 's team also analysed the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 20 captive Amur tigers , to see if they retained any unique genetic features since lost by the wild tigers .
" There are gene variants found in captivity that no longer persist in the wild , " says Russello , which suggests that the captive program has done a good job of preserving the genetic diversity of the subspecies .
" Now that it is known which individuals possess which gene variants , managers will be able to selectively breed to help preserve the unique and rare gene variants , " says Russello .
" The implication is that this variation may be used to re-infuse the wild population sometime in the future if reintroduction strategies are deemed warranted . "

It was n’t always like this for him however …
Brody grew up in a household where he felt very controlled by his mother .
Growing up , he always felt restricted and like he could n’t do what he really wanted to do , and he did n’t have a strong masculine role model from his father either and he was pretty angry and frustrated about that .
He was never able to have any real success or connections with women throughout his entire life living with his parents .
Fast forward a bit later and Brody moved out of his parents home , and left to college , where he started doing a bit of work on himself reading a few books , improving himself and becoming his own man .
It was there in college that Brody met his first girlfriend and had his first serious relationship .
The relationship was okay , and they had their ups and downs , but after 2 1 / 2 years of being together , she decided to dump him and to leave him .
And when she left , Brody was actually very devastated by that .
He felt like he ’d screwed up , did n’t really understand women and what they wanted , he was n’t being the best man he could be , he did n’t have a great social life or social skills to turn to and his confidence was just shot and gone .
He felt totally alone , frustrated , angry , sad and rejected , and ended up entering the deepest depression of his life .
He then became and remained severely depressed for about 1 1/2 years .
Then , one day , in the depths of his depression , Brody was starting to feel that he ’d had enough .
He was feeling that he just had this dark , black hole in his chest .
He had no idea what to do in his life in order to make things better , and his life just was n’t working at all and he was extremely lonely .
It was at this point that he actually started thinking about killing himself .
His mind had started going there , and he was seriously beginning to consider that option .
However , as if by magic , in that moment a stronger and wiser part of himself finally WOKE UP and said “ Hey !
Yes , you could kill yourself and go down that path …
But what if instead you did WHATEVER IT TOOK TO NEVER EVER EVER HAVE TO FEEL THIS WAY EVER AGAIN !? ”
And that ’s what he decided to do .
He then put his stake in the ground and said to himself ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !
And this is going to go on NO LONGER !
He then began his new journey of studying everything that he could get his hands on in relation to women , dating , becoming the best man he could be and building his confidence and social skills .
He ended up changing his college studies from Biology to Communications & Interpersonal relationships which he received his degree in because he was so passionate about mastering this area of his life .
He ended up also investing in dozens and dozens of different workshops , trainings , bootcamps and seminars on communication , relationships , psychology and dating and ended up spending well over $ 10,000.00 in order to finally master these new skills , insights and secrets .
The frustrating thing for him however with this process , is that after going through all of this new information and training , he STILL was n’t able to really attract and connect with the kind of high - quality women that he really wanted to be with .
He then decided that enough was enough , and he found a man who he resonated with and who had the kind of results that he really wanted to have in his romantic life and he decided to hire him as his dating coach .
The coach cost him quite a bit of additional money , and he was pretty scared about that and had to put a lot of the investment onto credit cards , but he knew that the investment would be well worth it for the results that it could help him create in his life and the alternative was literally death .
His new dating mentor then took him under his wing and helped him to explore his own inner psychology , mindset & beliefs as well as helped him build the skills and have the right strategies to really attract and keep a high quality women .
He also held him accountable and helped him to stay committed to his goals and to taking the right new action steps to create these new results that he really wanted to create .
It was then working with his new coach that Brody FINALLY had his big breakthrough and the new results that he ’d been looking for all along .
He then went through an amazing phase where he dated and was with dozens and dozens and dozens of amazing , beautiful , super - high quality women , and he learned a ton about himself and what he wanted from that phase .
And then shortly after that phase and still working with his dating mentor he finally met his amazing , beautiful , intelligent , supportive & loving wife Antia , who he ’s never felt more confident about , loved or been in a happier relationship with in his whole life .
He was excited about meeting Antia because he finally felt like he attracted a woman who he could be connected to on all levels and really enjoy life together and live a bigger purpose and help improve the world together as well .
So having gone through that entire journey of rejection to relationship and having struggled as bad as he had in order to get to the amazing life and relationship that he was able to create .
THAT is why Brody then became so passionate and excited about wanting to help other single successful men to overcome their dating frustrations & challenges and find and have the same level of amazing happiness , confidence , fulfillment and success that he was able to create in his romantic life as well .
And that ’s why he ’s now been helping tens of thousands of single successful men all over the world for over 14 + years to have that same success in their dating & romantic relationships and meet the amazing women , girlfriends and wives that they now have to share their life & be happier with as well …

Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman ( Conn. ) sides with the Republicans , as he often does on foreign policy .
Lieberman said Obama should be speaking out , and dismisses the theory that doing so would incite anti-American sentiment .
“ My sense of human nature and the conversations I ’ve had with people who have been to Iran and talked to Iranians is that we ’re their hope and they need to hear from us , ” Lieberman said .
In recent days we have witnessed the passionate presence of millions of women and men , the old and the young , and ethnic and religious minorities in Iran , people who want their government to recognize their most basic right , the right to freely , independently , and transparently elect , a right that in most societies around the world is not only recognized officially but for whose protection no effort is neglected .
In the current situation , we witness threats , arrests , killings , and naked persecution , which threaten to grow in dimension and lead to the shedding of innocent people 's blood thus bringing a rise in popular protests and not in their decline .
Iranian society is facing a deep political and economic crisis .
Million - strong protests , which have manifested themselves with a silence that is replete with meaning , have become a pattern that is growing in area and dimension , a growth that demands a response from any responsible person and organization .
The Autobus Workers Union in an announcement issued before the elections declared , " in the absence of the freedom for political parties , our organization is naturally deprived of a social institution that can protect it . "
" Workers of the Autobus Workers Union consider their social involvement and political activity to be the certain right of each member of society and furthermore believe that workers across Iran as long as they submit the platforms of presidential candidates and a practical guarantee about campaign slogans can choose to participate or not participate in elections . "
The fact that the demands of the vast majority of Iranian society go far beyond those of unions is obvious to all , and in the previous years we have emphasized that until the principle of the freedom to organize and to elect is not materialized , any talk of social freedom and labor union rights will be a farce .
Given these facts , the Autobus Workers Union places itself alongside all those who are offering themselves in the struggle to build a free and independent civic society .
The union condemns any kind of suppression and threats .
To recognize labor - union and social rights in Iran , the international labor organizations have declared the Fifth of Tir ( June 26 ) the international day of support for imprisoned Iranian workers as well as for the institution of unions in Iran .
We want that this day be viewed as more than a day for the demands of labor unions to make it a day for human rights in Iran and to ask all our fellow workers to struggle for the trampled rights of the majority of the people of Iran .
With hope for the spread of justice and freedom ,
Autobus Workers Union
Neda , a 27 year old philosophy student
In 1970 , when Gil Scott - Heron first wrote his poem , " The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , " later released as the lead track on Pieces of a Man , there was neither Twitter nor Facebook .
So now everyone is saying the Revolution will be tweeted .
OK , the machinery of oppression in Iran has moved to grab control of the news and re-shape the story .
Social networking sites are making that next to impossible for them .
But , let 's not forget that the revolution in Iran is not just on computer screens and cell phones .
The blood is real .
Neda was a real person , a young woman with hopes and aspirations who was shot down and died horribly in the gutter .
This video is absolutely horrific and I do n't recommend you watch it unless you 're ready to shed some tears for our sisters and brothers in Tehran :
While bloodthirsty vampires on the political right , your McCains , Pences , Liebermen and Cantors -- whose only desire is to see blood running in the streets of Tehran -- do whatever they can to inflame emotions and offer Iranian patriots false hope , the entire world is viscerally mourning for Neda .
And Twitter is part of that at #neda .
Mousavi , no friend of the West by a long shot , says he 's prepared for martyrdom -- he tweeted it -- but Neda is already dead .
Unlike him , she never ordered the deaths of 30,000 political prisoners or funded Hezbollah .
President McCain , President Graham , President Lieberman are wrong -- always ... about everything .
But it is their cranky , crackpot voices -- voices Charles Pierce explains so very well in Idiot America -- that dominate the incendiary , trivial , ratings - hungry mass media .
In the House last week only one lonely member of Congress , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , spoke out for a rational approach to Iran .
Fortunately , there is somewhat more sanity in the Senate -- at least on one side of the aisle .
When 's the last time you read anything positive about Arlen Specter at ?
I guess he woke up and remembered he was a Democrat yesterday : “ I think the president is doing the right thing .
If we ’re seen as siding with the insurgents , we run the risk of turning momentum against them . "
Too difficult a concept for the doddering and deranged McCain ?
Lieberman on the other hand , is n't senile ; he 's working for the Likud to do all he can to foment discord and mayhem .
They need to hear exactly what Obama is saying .
But that is n't what the neo-Cons want .
They want a message like the one George H.W. Bush gave the Iraqi Shi'a in 1991 -- or the CIA gave the Hungarians in 1956 : rise up against your oppressors and we will help you .
They rose up -- and were slaughtered by the thousands .
Irresponsible inciters , safely back in Washington , shed a collective crocodile tear for them .
Meanwhile , without McCain and without Mike Pence and without Howard Berman , the Iranian people -- or at least the middle class of North Tehran -- may well be delegitimizing the fascist dictatorship and the Supreme Leader .
And if Al Giordano is correct , the revolution is spreading from the middle class to the working class .
Here 's a translation of a declaration from the striking Autobus Workers Union of Iran .
( Gee this could be the first time Mike Pence , Eric Cantor , John Boehner and Richard Burr havebeen on the same side as a union ! )

MPP Condemns Prison Sentence for Medical Marijuana Defendant Charles C. Lynch
Law - Abiding Medical Marijuana Collective Was Licensed by City
CONTACT : Bruce Mirken , MPP director of communications , 415-585-6404 or 202-215-4205
Aaron Smith , MPP California policy director , 707-575-9870
LOS ANGELES , CALIFORNIA — The Marijuana Policy Project strongly condemned today 's federal sentencing of Charles C. Lynch , a California medical marijuana provider who worked scrupulously to follow state and local laws but now faces one year and one day in federal prison .
" Years from now , Mr. Lynch may well be remembered as the last American to go to federal prison for a mistake , the final victim of an already repudiated policy well on its way to the ash heap of history , but whose mean - spirited effects still linger , " said MPP executive director Rob Kampia .
" This sentence is a cruel and pointless miscarriage of justice .
Mr. Lynch and his attorneys say they plan to appeal , and we hope they succeed .
With federal law enforcement at the Mexican border so overwhelmed that traffickers coming through with up to 500 pounds of marijuana are let go , even one more penny spent persecuting a man who is not a criminal in any rational sense of the word is an outrageous waste of resources . "
In February , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that henceforth the Drug Enforcement Administration would only conduct enforcement actions against medical marijuana defendants who were violating both state and federal law , reversing the Bush administration 's policy of ignoring state medical marijuana laws .
Lynch 's medical marijuana collective was licensed by the city of Morro Bay , and officials routinely inspected the facility to monitor compliance with state and local laws .
But because federal law makes no statutory allowance for medical marijuana , all evidence related to California 's medical marijuana law was barred from his trial .
With more than 27,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

Mr Biti says Zimbabwe has managed so far without any foreign aid
Zimbabwe 's economy could grow by between 4 % and 6 % this year , according to the country 's finance minister .
Tendai Biti said steps would be taken to restrict central bank activities such as borrowing .
Separately , US President Barack Obama pledged $ 73 m ( £ 44 m ) in aid to Zimbabwe , after meeting Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House .
The Zimbabwean economy has been battered by years of hyperinflation and economic contraction .
Mr Tsvangirai is on a tour of the US and Europe trying to drum up financial support .
President Obama praised Mr Tsvangirai's efforts in Zimbabwe , saying " we 've seen progress from the prime minister " .
But he added that the aid would not be going to the government but directly to the people of Zimbabawe , as the US still had concerns about " consolidating democracy , human rights and rule of law " in the country .
Growth predictions
Finance Minister Tendai Biti was speaking at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town .
" I think we will be able to achieve a growth rate of at least 6 % , although conservatively it will be 4 % in 2009 , " he told journalists .
The fact that the government was able to address Zimbabwe 's economic problems " without any cent from anyone " , he added , showed that " we can do it with or without huge financial resources " .
Zimbabwe 's economy has been shrinking for years .
It contracted by 6.1 % in 2007 , according to the International Monetary Fund .
The power - sharing government of President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Tsvangirai - sworn in in February - has said the country needs about $ 10 bn ( £ 6 bn ) to stabilise its economy .
Foreign donors have said they will only consider aid once Zimbabwe 's government creates a democracy .

With the countless number of ridiculously tall skyscrapers planned for around the world , it is remarkable the controversy an 82 - story skyscraper for Midtown Manhattan can create .
Three years ago , MoMa completed an $ 858 million expansion , yet the museum is still in need of additional room to house its growing collections .
The Modern sold their Midtown lot to Hines , an international real estate developer , for $ 125 million .
Hines , in turn , asked Pritzker Prize Laureate French architect Jean Nouvel to design two possible solutions for the site .
“ A decade ago anyone who was about to invest hundreds of millions on a building would inevitably have chosen the more conservative of the two .
But times have changed .
Architecture is a form of marketing now , and Hines made the bolder choice , ” reported Nicolai Ouroussoff for The New York Times .

We ’ve all heard them .
Usually , they happened to a friend of a friend ’s second cousin , and in almost every case they ’re completely untrue .
Still , some urban legends have managed to gain a remarkable amount of credibility .
From creepy folklore to rumors about celebrities and politicians , here are the top ten urban legends that have managed to gain a popular following .
10 . The Automatic 4.0
This one has been making its way across college campuses since the 1970s , and it ’s been popping up as a plot point in movies and TV shows for years .
It says that any college student whose roommate commits suicide will automatically receive a 4.0 grade point average for the semester as part of the college ’s bereavement policy .
Other versions tweak it a bit to include murder or an accident , but all stick to the basic principle of dead roommate=good grades .
Not a word of the story is true , of course , and it ’s said that the rumor most likely started out as a joke among stressed out college students .
9. Mr. Rogers Was a Navy Seal
Fred Rogers and his classic children ’s show Mister Rogers ’
Neighborhood were legendary in the TV world , so it was only a matter of time before a few scandalous rumors started floating around about him .
Probably the most popular and downright ridiculous was the legend that claimed Rogers was a Navy Seal during the Vietnam War , and that he had numerous confirmed kills as a sniper .
This same rumor often asserted that the only reason Rogers wore sweaters was to cover up all the tattoos he had gotten during his time in the service .
Both tales are completely untrue , but this is one urban legend that refuses to die , and it is often applied to other clean - cut , wholesome celebrities , most notably John Denver .
8. Bloody Mary
Although it ’s more folklore than an urban legend , the Bloody Mary story is so old and well known that it had to make this list .
A common game at children ’s slumber parties , the story states that the ghost of Mary Worth , a woman who was supposedly executed for being a witch , will manifest when summoned .
This usually involves going into a darkened room and shouting her name three times , at which point her face will appear in a mirror .
There are a number of variations on the story , with some claiming that the face of Satan appears or that the mirror turns red , and others stating that the name must be said 13 times , but all follow this same general theme .
7. JFK and the Jelly Doughnut Speech
The story dates back to 1963 , when then - President John F. Kennedy traveled to Germany to give a speech .
Wanting to express solidarity with the people of Berlin , Kennedy said to them “ Ich bin ein Berliner , ” which translates to English as “ I am a Berliner . ”
But since a “ Berliner ” was also a certain kind of popular pastry in Germany at the time , many have surmised that the phrase translated to the crowd as “ I am a jelly doughnut , ” and over the years a number of stories have surfaced saying Kennedy was nearly laughed off the stage after saying it .
It ’s hard to say where the story originated , but it has been proven to be a myth , and reports have shown that not only did Kennedy have the phrase translated by a professional interpreter before using it , but that the crowd understood him perfectly .
6. Cokelore
Over the years , there have been so many urban legends about the popular soft drink Coca - Cola that they ’ve been given their own name : Cokelore .
Probably the most famous urban legend in this regard is the old claim that eating Pop Rocks candy and then drinking Coke will cause stomach damage .
Meanwhile , another legend says that the acids in the soda can dissolve a tooth if it ’s left in a glass of the drink overnight , and still another asserts that mixing Coke with aspirin produces a drug - like high .
All these claims are false , but another popular claim , that Coke originally contained cocaine as a part of its formula , is verifiably true .
The drink was created in the 1880s , and even after the negative aspects of cocaine were uncovered , the company continued using trace amounts of the drug in its soda until the 1920s .
5 . The Good Samaritan
The Good Samaritan legend has been around for years , and it ’s been attributed to a number of famous rich people , from Bill Gates to Nat King Cole .
As the story goes , a motorist stops to help a man change a flat tire .
The man asks for the motorist ’s address so that he might send a reward .
A few weeks later , the motorist receives a thank you note in the mail with a check for $ 10,000 signed by a famous celebrity .
The story tends to vary depending on whom the grateful celebrity is , with one popular version claiming that Donald Trump paid off a helpful stranger ’s mortgage .
Trump himself has even tried to confirm this , but all proof points to it being nothing more than an often - repeated rumor .
4. Walt Disney Is Cryogenically Frozen
This is another rumor that ’s been around for a long time , and it seems that everyone has heard it at some point or another .
It says that Walt Disney arranged for his body to frozen upon his death in the hope that future technology would be able to bring him back to life .
No one ’s exactly sure how this one got started , but records show that Disney was cremated when he died in 1966 .
It is suspected that the amount of secrecy surrounding his funeral , coupled with his reputation as an inventor , led to the creation of this long - standing myth .
3. The Sewer Alligator
This story , one of the most popular of all urban legends , asserts that the New York City sewer system is infested with deadly alligators .
In the most popular versions , the animals were brought north from Florida by people who wanted to keep them as pets .
When the gators started getting too big and violent , they were released into the sewers .
This story dates back to the 1930s , when sensationalist newspapers started reporting countless stories of alligators being found in and around New York City , with some even claiming that police were making regular trips underground to hunt the creatures down .
Nearly all of these stories are false , and the few that are true almost undoubtedly concern animals that escaped from local zoos , but the sewer alligator story has continued to be passed down through the years , and it still exists today in many different forms .
2. The Vanishing Hitchhiker
One of the oldest and most often repeated urban legends , the vanishing hitchhiker story comes in many forms .
The most popular version involves a man who picks up a young hitchhiker ( usually a girl ) on a deserted country road .
He drives her to her house , but when he turns to say goodbye he finds that she has inexplicably disappeared from the back seat of the car .
Confused , the man rings the doorbell of the house , whereupon he learns that the girl has been dead for years , killed in a car accident on the very spot where he picked her up that night .
There are a number of variations of this story , and it dates back so far that earlier versions take place on horseback or in covered wagons .
1. The Kidney Heist
The most ubiquitous and persistent urban legend , “ the kidney heist ” story has been immortalized on the internet , TV shows , and even a few movies .
It supposedly dates back to 1997 , when an e-mail started circulating warning people of a new and frightening crime that was catching on in some cities .
In most versions , a business traveler is relaxing in a bar when a stranger strikes up a conversation and then offers to by them a drink .
After taking a few sips , the traveler becomes woozy and then blacks out , only to awaken in a hotel room bathtub covered with ice .
There is a phone next to them , and a note that says to call 911 immediately .
When the paramedics arrive , the person learns that their kidney has been harvested by people who hope to sell it on the back market .
This story is completely false , but it has been circulating for years , and its appearance on the internet is one of the oldest e-mail hoaxes .
In order to quell the rumor , The National Kidney Foundation has even asked supposed victims of the crime to contact them , but to this date they have n’t had any takers .
A scary tale , but still an urban legend .

Mike and Barbara Stanbro have stellar credit and a hearty retirement nest egg .
He put in 30 years working high - paying tech jobs and came out of retirement in March for a six - figure consulting gig with a booming local tech firm .
So how is it that their longtime bank turns them down for a $ 10,000 line of credit ?
And why can't they refinance a mortgage that 's half the value of their Yamhill County home ?
The reason serves a warning to any baby boomer or retiree who thinks , to counter the shocks of the recession , they might want to start their own small business or re-enter the work force as a consultant .
Be prepared for a credit environment in which entrepreneurial income can actually count against you .
Here 's the cautionary tale :
The Stanbros retired early -- she in 2004 at 50 , he in May 2007 at 55 -- sitting on a seven - figure nest egg , a rolling seven - acre spread in the wine country with a view of the Cascades and plans to spend winters in warmer locales .
" We have both worked hard so that we would be able to retire young , " Barbara told The Oregonian in an e-mail .
Mike had climbed the ranks to direct software engineering at both Synopsis Inc. and Credence Systems Corp .
Barbara earned a master 's degree and worked as a licensed clinical social worker .
Short - term work
Last year , of course , the couple saw their nest egg drop nearly 40 percent with the plunging market .
Mike knew his skills were still ripe , so in March he began consulting for Flir Systems Inc .
The Wilsonville thermal - imaging camera maker , growing both sales and profits , is a rare bastion of corporate stability .
" We do n't need for him to work for very long , " Barbara explained .
" We just did n't want to keep taking distributions from our retirement account because it was eroding the principal . "
That same month , they decided to take advantage of the drop in mortgage interest rates and applied for a $ 300,000 refinance .
They planned to use the proceeds to pay off a $ 200,000 balance on a $ 350,000 home equity line of credit at Wells Fargo , where they 'd banked since 1981 .
Their trouble started when the mortgage broker called Wells Fargo to verify the payoff amount .
Wells
Fargo froze their line of credit to make sure they did n't exceed the stated payoff .
The Stanbros had used that line not only to buy their fifth - wheel trailer and the truck that towed it but as overdraft protection on their checking account .
At the bank 's suggestion , they tried to keep that overdraft protection by opening a $ 10,000 personal line of credit .
This might seem a bit too complicated .
They took the home equity loan so they would n't erode their nest egg , which will have to see them through many years ahead .
Did they really need the line of credit ?
Maybe not , Barbara said , but they were n't used to tracking their monthly expenses closely .
Denied
The subsequent denial by Wells Fargo incensed the couple .
" With 28 years of good credit with the bank , we are now informed that we are not trustworthy , " said Barbara , noting the bank had received $ 25 billion from the U.S. Treasury to foster lending .
" I am so angry I could spit . "
They worried it spelled doom for their refi , too .
A May 30 e-mail from Safe Harbor Mortgage Co. in Lake Oswego confirmed their fears .
" Changing from a W - 2 employee to a 1099 contract employee has caused a major obstacle for the underwriter , " wrote Rosa Garza , a senior mortgage consultant with the Lake Oswego - based lender .
" Although you have been an Engineer for 30 years , have substantial income and savings , underwriting is requiring a two year history of the 1099 income . "
The Stanbros are understandably angry .
Between the value of their home and their retirement portfolios , their assets are four times the value of the refi they seek .
" From where we sit , this looks like discrimination against retired people , " Mike wrote in an e-mail to Garza .
In response , a spokesman for Wells Fargo said the bank can't consider stock holdings for an unsecured line of credit .
" We have no guarantees the customer will use those investments to pay back the loan , " Tom Unger , a Wells Fargo spokesman , explained in an e-mail .
" We wish we could have done more to help these customers . "
From the perspective of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration -- federal entities that insure or purchase most refinanced loans -- a lot can go wrong in the first months of self - employment , lenders note .
That 's why lenders say the Stanbros " have to season their income , " said Frank Frazzitta , president and owner of two - year - old Safe Harbor Mortgage .
Options dwindle
At one time , the Stanbros could have tried something called a " stated income loan , " also known as a " liar loan . "
But lenders wo n't touch those now because abuses -- by subprime lenders and unfit borrowers alike -- during the credit - crazed days partly led us to the current economic crisis .
Now , as Robin Helt , a mortgage production manager at First Tech Credit Union , points out , " The people who could truly take advantage of it and use it wisely are wiped out by the bad apples who abused it . "
This roadblock is something other baby boomers and seniors could encounter .
Many are being forced back to work after their retirement accounts dropped while others are considering consulting the next logical progression from long careers working for someone else .
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects consulting jobs to account for one - third of the 4 million new professional and business services jobs expected through 2016 .
As of May 31 , nearly 750 clients had used services at Portland Community College 's Small Business Development Center .
That approaches the 900 served in all of 2008 , said director Tom Lowles .
The Stanbros ' experience miffed him , too .
" I 'm irritated and appalled , frankly , " Lowles said .
" In the good old days ... I can't imagine they'd be turned down .
They were throwing the money out the door before . "
What can you do to avoid this fate ?
Get your financial ducks in a row .
You 're going to need two years of self - employed income before most lenders will give you money .
Or , you 'll need to shop around and settle for a loan at a higher interest rate .
Do n't disclose the new business if you do n't have to .
Helt of First Tech suggests the Stanbros apply for the loan without claiming the income ; that is , do n't even mention it on the form .
But Barbara said this scenario would have meant a refi payment of nearly 40 percent of their retirement disbursements and disability income , so she 's not sure they would qualify .
Take retirement account or annuity distributions consistently .
Showing that you 've drawn from an IRA regularly over 12 months will help you get a loan sooner , First Tech 's Helt said .
Try a small community bank .
Jeff Sumpter , founder and chief lending officer at Lewis & Clark Bank , a 2 1/ 2 - year - old bank in Oregon City , said his bank would lend to the right person and consider self - employment an advantage .
" We 're not operating off of some check sheet , " Sumpter said .
" We try to know the customer , know the person and make a decision . "
The trade - off is you 'll pay a higher interest rate .
Because the smaller bank keeps your loan on its books , there 's no secondary market buyer to help defray its risk .
And the bank needs to recover enough money to pay interest to its own bank depositors .
" You can find big differences in community banks , where I might make a loan where a bank across the street does not , " Sumpter said .
" What we 're really trying to do is have them as customers . "
Plan ahead .
Make sure you can manage your current debts for two years .
" You probably want to have that particular plan in place before you retire rather than right after , " Frazzitta said .
Why ?
" You 're going through a period of great change , " he added .
And change spooks lenders these days .
Of course , this economy has undergone tremendous change -- change few retirees could have foreseen .
So it 's not surprising the Stanbros would be caught in this situation .
For now , the Stanbros have left Wells Fargo and scrapped plans to refinance , hoping to pay off their debts once their nest egg recovers .
Their credit score has fallen from 840 to 796 thanks , presumably , to inquiries from lenders .
They do n't want to ding it any further .
" I feel like it 's a missed opportunity ( to save money ) through no fault of our own , " Barbara said of the experience .

Her death shocked a nation and led to a police hunt for her killer which continues today .
Ten years after Jill Dando was killed with a single bullet to the head , confidential minutes disclosed to The Independent reveal for the first time how the BBC responded to the cold - blooded murder of its most popular television presenter .
The first reports alerting BBC staff reached the corporation 's head of news , Tony Hall , during a senior managers ' meeting at Broadcasting House on the morning of 26 April 1999 .
A telephone call to Mr Hall said that Ms Dando , 37 , had been attacked outside her London home but did not say she was dead .
Nevertheless it was serious enough for him to leave the meeting and return to Television Centre in White City .
From there , he relayed the news to the director - general , John Birt , still chairing the executive meeting , that the TV news presenter and host of Crimewatch and Holiday had died .
A confidential minute , headed " any other business " , one of five documents discoclosed under the Freedom of Information Act , says : " Tony Hall reported that Jill Dando had been attacked outside her home and he and Matthew Bannister left the meeting to return to the programme - making base .

" Later , DG confirmed that Jill Dando had been killed , a shocking and deeply saddening piece of news : the Committee observed a moment 's silence . "
By the time the Board of Governors met a few days later it was clear that Jill Dando 's death was cold - blooded murder .
Security was now of prime concern as senior staff believed that the attack could be part of a wider operation against the BBC .
Mr Hall told the meeting he had himself been named by a caller to the BBC who claimed responsibility for Ms Dando 's death .
The confidential minute notes : " A call had been received from someone with a mid-European accent , claiming that Jill Dando 's death was linked to Nato action in Serbia , and that Tony Hall would be next . "
The threat was taken very seriously by the BBC which stepped up security and asked all staff to wear name badges .
Bag searches and scans were introduced for visitors along with tighter rules on escorting visitors from reception and stronger security for couriers and commercial deliveries .
Similarly tight security measures were adopted for outside broadcasts .
All BBC presenters and other high - profile staff were offered advice about how to cope under these new working conditions .
Mr Hall and his family were moved from their home into a hotel .
But while the BBC was taking the threat extremely seriously , the same may not have been true of the police .
The board of governors minute notes : " The police were sceptical about the claim but had advised that care needed to be exercised . "
This may have been a key moment in the investigation .
But instead the police homed in on Barry George , a loner already known to the police , who had been seen in the area at the time of the shooting .
His conviction was quashed last year , prompting criticism of the early investigation .

Oblivious to the police inquiries at the time , BBC staff were paying tributes to the loss of a much loved talent .
That week , Sir Christopher Bland , chairman of the board of governors , expressed the board 's sorrow at her death , saying he had written on the board 's behalf to her fiancé and family .
" She had touched many people in the BBC and her murder was a particularly awful event , " said Sir Christopher .
Tony
Hall said he could not remember anything which had hit staff so badly : " Jill Dando had been a wonderful , warm , person and very professional . "
A minute 's silence had been observed in the News Centre and much time had been spent talking to staff , helping them cope with a very personal loss and to carry on doing a professional job , the report said .
Matthew Bannister , then chief executive of BBC production , added that counselling had been offered to staff on Crimewatch and on Holiday .
Mr Birt said Ms Dando had represented the quintessential face of the BBC .
" She had sterling personal qualities , with no element of the prima donna .
She was a stalwart member of the team and a true loyalist to the BBC .
Her murder was simply devastating . "
As for the coverage of Jill Dando 's death , BBC governor Dame Pauline Neville - Jones said that while outsiders shared the BBC 's sense of devastation , it was important , " to keep matters in proportion " .
Mr Hall said the most difficult programme to get right had been the Six O'Clock News , where all the staff had worked with Jill .
" It had been right to reduce the coverage at nine . "
Finally Sir Christopher read out a letter he had received from Nick Ross , Jill Dando 's colleague at Crimewatch , expressing appreciation for the support provided by management .
Four days after the murder , a BBC weekly programme review board met to discuss the network 's coverage of her death .
Alan Yentob , then the BBC director of television , acknowledged that everyone in the newsroom had been deeply affected but said that it was , " it was very unusual situation to have to report on the murder of a close associate " .
Jane Lush , a close friend of Jill Dando and controller of daytime television , said that in Monday night 's " hurriedly compiled tribute " they had aimed at simplicity and to show the breadth of her work .
It was what they believed Jill would have wanted .
She said that several former colleagues had turned up to help with the tribute .
William Wyatt , chief executive of BBC broadcasting , said it had been an " excellent " programme , adding that everyone had , " behaved well in very difficult circumstances " .
He commended News 24 ( launched two years previously ) and the bulletins , especially Michael Buerk 's piece on the Nine O'Clock News .
Mr Wyatt said Jill Dando , " embodied old - fashioned virtues but was a completely modern person ...
This was a tragedy which was not yet over . "
And he predicted that there would also be " difficult decisions for her programme - makers " .
Two years later Barry George was on trial for Jill Dando 's murder .
A meeting of the programme review board on 9 July 2001 ( after the guilty verdict ) made it clear that the BBC had wanted to be ready on the day with a special programme about the killing , and that executives were concerned about viewing figures .
Lorraine Heggessey , BBC1 controller , explained that she had decided on a 7 pm broadcast slot , regardless of whether or not there was a verdict that afternoon , rather than saving it until the next day .
But she added that it was " unlucky having Tim Henman against it " .
A high - profile murder
11.47am , 26 April 1999 Jill Dando shot dead on the steps of her home in west London .
Pm , 26 April 1999 Tony Hall is told at Broadcasting House that Jill Dando has been attacked .
He later phones John Birt to say she has died .
Six months later
The murder investigation team had spoken to more than 2,500 people and taken more than 1,000 statements .
With little progress after a year , the police focused on the odd behaviour of a man who lived around half a mile from Dando 's home .
29 May 2000 Barry George charged with murder .
2 July 2001 George convicted .
He was later sentenced to life .
29 July 2002 Court of Appeal rejects George 's claim that key evidence was flawed .
20 June 2007 New scientific doubts over gunshot residue lead to George 's conviction being quashed .
1 Aug 2008 George unanimously acquitted in retrial .
June 2009 Scotland
Yard says the murder inquiry remains open and is under review .

Expect " shock and awe in science " from a repaired and upgraded Hubble Space Telescope .
This is the prediction from a Nasa astronomer who has worked on the mission since its inception .
If all goes completely to plan on Hubble Servicing Mission 4 , the orbiting observatory will be reborn as the most productive telescope in history , with even greater powers to probe the Universe 's deep history and help cosmologists make sense of one of their biggest problems - " dark energy " .
Over five long days of well rehearsed but exhausting work on Hubble , the astronauts on the shuttle Atlantis have the task of installing a new panoramic camera and a latest - generation spectrograph .
A spectrograph is an instrument for measuring the chemistry , temperatures and motions of celestial objects .
The servicing spacewalkers also have the goal of bringing back to life what was Hubble 's most important camera ( the Advanced Camera for Surveys ) and another defunct spectrograph .
Both of them were knocked out by electronics failures .
According to David Leckrone , project scientist at Nasa Goddard Spaceflight Centre : " For the first time since 1993 , Hubble will have a full set of first class hi-tech scientific instruments onboard .
It 's not just one camera and one spectrograph .
It 's a variety of instruments covering a lot of capabilities and are used for different purposes . "
Any astronomer around the world can apply for time to observe with the orbiting telescope .
Dr Leckrone has high hopes for the combination of massed human brain power and the telescope 's new and repaired hardware .
Between these vast films and fingers of galaxies are even more immense voids of very nearly empty darkness
" You couple that global intellect with that set of tools and you produce shock and awe in science with Hubble , " he told the BBC .
It is not as though Hubble has failed to shock with its data and inspire awe with its images already .
The tally of the telescope 's historic achievements is unmatched by any other observatory , since the first shuttle servicing mission in 1993 corrected the blurring problem with Hubble 's main mirror .
•
Hubble was the first instrument to fix the Universe 's age at about 13.7 billion years .
•
Hubble was the first to analyse the chemical make - up of the atmosphere of planets beyond the solar system .
•
It was one of two telescopes to make the first direct images of planets orbiting another star - historic images made public last November .
Hubble was also at the forefront of unveiling the existence of dark energy : the name coined for a mysterious and pervasive force which appears to be inflating the Universe at an ever increasing speed .
Cosmologists had assumed that for most of the 14 - odd billion years since the Big Bang , the Universe 's expansion had been slowing down .
In the mid-1990s Hubble - along with the ground - based Keck telescope in Hawaii - made the key measurements on distant exploding stars , supernovae , which showed otherwise .
A direct image of a planet orbiting another star
More details
It was the most shocking cosmological revelation since the 1920s when astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe was expanding .
The mystery of dark energy may be a little clearer , if not solved , with the new camera the astronauts are going to install .
This is the Wide Field Camera 3 - an instrument with the dimensions of a street telephone box .
Like Hubble 's existing , but currently dead , Advanced Camera for Surveys , the WFC - 3 has a sensitive detector which can form images of very distant galaxies in the same wavelengths of light our eyes perceive .
These objects are so faraway , their starlight started its journey across the cosmos just under 13 billion years ago .
The camera catches them as they were at that early time - though only just .
They are very faint .
But the new Wide Field Camera will make its great advance by virtue of a second detector chip , sensitive to wavelengths of light in the infrared part of the spectrum .
This will let astronomers use Hubble to see deeper with more detail .
This is because visible light from stars that has travelled from very far away in the cosmos has been " stretched " en route as the Universe itself has expanded .
Its wavelengths are widened - or " red- shifted " - in proportion to the distance it has crossed .
So if a galaxy or supernova is well beyond 13 billion years away , all of its light reaches us as infra-red radiation .
The WFC - 3 will seek out even earlier galaxies According to Steven Beckwith - professor of astronomy at University of California , Berkeley , and former director of the Space Telescope Science Institute - the new Wide Field Camera should help to characterise the nature of dark energy .
Thanks to its infrared vision , it will be able to pick up large numbers of supernovae too distant and red-shifted for other instruments .
Studies of the light from each exploding star will allow astronomers to get a better idea of how fast or slowly the Universe was expanding at different times in its early history .
Plotting this is vital in the challenge of figuring out what dark energy is .
Theorists have come up with many possibilities but none fit with our current understanding of physics .
Steven Beckwith said : " I think the new instrument will let us zero on those few ideas that could be right and get rid a lot of bad ideas .
But I do n't think it will tell us the answer . "
The problem of dark energy aside , the new Wide Field Camera will give us a deeper view into the early Universe in general : the epoch when the first galaxies and stars came into being .
To date Hubble has seen back to 900 million years after the Big Bang .
Steven Beckwith says that with WFC - 3 , the telescope 's view will extend to 400 million years after creation .
Hubble has stunned and surprised us
It is almost anyone 's guess what astronomers will see , although theory would suggest the earliest mini-galaxies of stars should have formed by then .
They would be untidy ill - formed blobs lacking the size and regular shapes of " modern day " galaxies like our own Milky Way .
They would be populated by stars much more massive and burning more fiercely than our Sun .
This is how astronomers picture the first galaxies and stars that formed out of dark gaseous debris created in the Big Bang .
Exactly when that happened and starlight began to flood across the Universe is unknown .
Steven Beckwith speculates that Hubble 's new camera might pin-point the " Cosmic Dawn " , if it broke more than half a billion years after the Big Bang .
The refurbished Hubble will be able to look even deeper
The other new instrument for Hubble is the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) .
COS is also the size of a phone booth .
It does not make spectacular images but its kind of work is just as important for astronomers .
Spectrographs make measurements of the motions , temperatures and chemical make - up of galaxies , stars and planets .
What distinguishes COS is its great sensitivity to very faint objects and that it works at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum - a " flavour " of light radiation largely screened out by the Earth 's atmosphere .
COS team member Mike Shull at the University of Colorado , Boulder , describes the instrument as " a very fancy prism which takes the light from Hubble 's mirror and spreads it out into its component colours . "
" Every element whether it is helium , oxygen or carbon has a unique set of fingerprints that get imprinted on the light . "
The imprinting of particular wavelengths at tell - tale intensities reveals which chemical elements are present in distant planets , stars , galaxies or even the great expanses of space between galaxies .
In the past 20 years , astronomers have found that galaxies are not uniformly distributed across the sky .
Galaxies are concentrated along a filamentary network called the Cosmic Web .
Between these vast films and fingers of galaxies are even more immense voids of very nearly empty darkness .
But there is something in them - a vanishingly tenuous amount of gas .
' Gas accounting ' Mike Shull wants to use COS to discover which particular elements are there and to measure how much is there .
He says it is possible there is as much as 20 % of the original hydrogen and helium created out of the Big Bang lingering in these great interconnected voids .
It is gas that never made it into stars and galaxies but it may do in due course .
The plan is to use the light from brilliant and distant objects called quasars , which will have sampled the composition of the voids during its passage across billions of light years of space .
The imprinted information in the spectrum of this light will reveal the quantity and make - up of the inter - galactic gas at different times .
Because this gas may be destined eventually for stars and galaxies , there should be important insights into the big picture of how galaxies grow from their small sizes at the Cosmic Dawn to form the modern day spiral behemoths such as our own Milky Way .
According to Mike Shull , astrophysicists have begun this inter-galactic accounting but progress has been very slow for the lack of an efficient instrument to do the job .
" Right now , there 's only 20 or 30 places we 've looked to sample this gas .
With COS we 'll be 20 to 30 times more sensitive but moreover we 'll be more efficient .
So something that used to take 20 or 30 orbits of Hubble time , we can do in one orbit . "
Listen to Science in Action this week on BBC World Service for more coverage of the Hubble servicing - including an interview with mission astronaut John Grunsfeld on the challenge of installing and repairing the telescope 's instruments .

Trying to get a handle on 2D graphics rendering performance can be a difficult task .
Obviously , people care about the performance of their 2D applications .
Nobody wants to wait for a web browser to scroll past tacky banner ads or for an email client to render a screen full of spam .
And it 's easy for users to notice " my programs are n't rendering as fast with the latest drivers " .
But what developers need is a way to quantify exactly what that means , in order to track improvements and avoid regressions .
And that measurement is the hard part .
Or at least it always has been hard , until Chris Wilson 's recent cairo - perf - trace .
Previous attempts at 2D benchmarking
Various attempts at 2D - rendering benchmark suites have appeared and even become popular .
Notable examples are x11 perf and gtkperf .
My claim is that these tools range from useless to actively harmful when the task is understanding performance of real applications .
These traditional benchmarks suites are collections of synthetic micro-benchmarks .
Within a given benchmark , some tiny operation , ( such as " render a line of text " or " draw a radio box " ) , is performed hundreds of times in a tight loop and the total time is measured .
The hope is that these operations will simulate the workload of actual applications .
Unfortunately , the workload of things like x11 perf and gtkperf rarely come close to simulating practical workloads .
In the worst case , the operation being tested might never be used at all in modern applications , ( notice that x11 perf tests things like stippled fills and wide ellipses which are obsolete graphics operations ) .
Similarly , even if the operation is used , ( such as a GTK + radio button ) , it might not represent a significant fraction of time spent rendering by the application , ( which might spend most of its time drawing its primary display area rather than any stock widget ) .
So that 's just the well - known idea to not focus on the performance of things other than the primary bottlenecks .
But even when we have identified a bottleneck in an application , x11 perf can still be the wrong answer for measurement .
For example , " text rendering " is a common bottleneck for 2D applications .
However , a test like " x11 perf aa10text " which seems like a tempting way to measure text performance is far from ideal .
This benchmark draws a small number of glyphs from a single font at a single size over and over .
Meanwhile , a real application will use many glyphs from many fonts at many sizes .
With layers and layers of caches throughout the graphics stack , it 's really not possible to accurately simulate what " text rendering " means for a real application without actually just running the actual application .
And yes , I myself have used and perhaps indirectly advocated for using things like x11 perf in the past .
I wo n't recommend it again in the future .
See below for what I suggest instead .
What do the 3D folks do ?
For 3D performance , everybody knows this lesson already .
Nobody measures the performance of " draw the same triangles over and over " .
And if someone does , ( by seriously quoting glxgear fps numbers , for example ) , then everybody gets a good laugh .
In fact , the phrase " glxgears is not a benchmark " is a catchphrase among 3D developers .
Instead , 3D measurement is made with " benchmark modes " in the 3D applications that people actually care about , ( which as far as I can tell is just games for some reason ) .
In the benchmark mode , a sample session of recorded input is replayed as quickly as possible and a performance measurement is reported .
As a rule , our 2D applications do n't have similar benchmark modes .
( There are some exceptions such as the trender utility for mozilla and special command - line options for the swfdec player . )
And coding up application - specific benchmarking code for every interesting application is n't something that anyone is signing up to do right now .
Introducing cairo - perf - trace
Over the past year or so , Chris " ickle " Wilson has been putting a lot of work into a debugging utility known as cairo - trace , ( inspired by work on an earlier tool known as libcairowrap by Benjamin Otte and Jeff Muizelaar ) .
The cairo - trace utility produces a trace of all cairo - based rendering operations made by an application .
The trace is complete and accurate enough to allow all operations to be replayed with a separate tool .
The cairo - trace utility has long proven invaluable as a way to capture otherwise hard - to - reproduce test cases .
People with complex applications that exhibit cairo bugs can generate a cairo - trace and often easily trim it down to a minimal test case .
Then after submitting this trace , a developer can replicate this bug without needing to have a copy of the complex application nor its state .
More recently , Chris wrote a new " cairo - trace -- profile " mode and a tool named cairo - perf - trace for replaying traces for benchmarking purposes .
These tools are currently available by obtaining the cairo source code , ( either from git or in the 1.9.2 development snapshot or eventually the 1.10 release or later ) .
Hopefully we 'll see them get packaged up so they 're easier to use soon .
With cairo - perf - trace , it 's a simple matter to get rendering performance measurements of real applications without having to do any modification of the application itself .
And you can collect a trace based on exactly the workload you want , ( as long as the application you are interested in performs its rendering with cairo ) .
Simply run :
cairo - trace -- profile some - application
Which will generate a compressed file named something like some - application .$pid.lzma .
To later benchmark this trace , first uncompress it :
lzma -cd some - application .$pid.lzma > some-application .
trace
And then run cairo - perf - trace on the trace file :
cairo - perf - trace some - application .
trace
The cairo - perf - trace utility will replay several iterations of the trace , ( waiting for the standard deviation among reported times to drop below a threshold ) , and will report timing results for both the " image " backend ( cairo 's software backend ) and whatever native backend is compiled into cairo , ( xlib , quartz , win32 , etc. ) .
So one immediately useful result is its obvious to see if the native backend is slower than the all - software backend .
Then , after making changes to the graphics stack , subsequent runs can be compared to ensure regressions are avoided and performance improvements actually help .
Finally , Chris has also established a cairo - traces git repository which collects useful traces that can be shared and compared .
It already contains several different browsing sessions with firefox , swfdec traces ( one with youtube ) , and traces of poppler , gnome - terminal , and evolution .
Obviously , anyone should feel free to generate and propose new traces to contribute .
Putting cairo - perf - trace to use
In the few days that cairo - perf - traces has existed , we 're already seeing great results from it .
When Kristian Høgsberg recently proposed a memory - saving patch for the Intel driver , Chris Wilson followed up with a cairo - perf - trace report showing that the memory - saving had no negative impact on a traced firefox session , which addressed the concern that Eric had about the patch .
As another example , we 've known that there 's been a performance regression in UXA ( compared to EXA ) for trapezoid rendering .
The problem was that UXA was allocating a pixmap only to then use software - based rasterization to that pixmap ( resulting in slow read - modify - write cycles ) .
The obvious fix I implemented is to simply malloc a buffer , do the rasterization , and only then copy the result to a pixmap .
After I wrote the patch , it was very satisfying to be able to validate its real - world impact with a swfdec - based trace .
This trace is based on using swfdec to view the Giant Steps movie .
When running this trace , sysprof makes it obvious that trapezoid rendering is the primary bottleneck .
Here is the output of cairo - perf - trace on a GM965 machine before my patch :
[ # ] backend test min(s ) median (s ) stddev . count [ 0 ] image swfdec- giant - steps 45.766 45.858 0.11 % 6 [ 0 ] xlib swfdec - giant - steps 194.422 194.602 0.05 % 6
The performance problem is quite plain here .
Replaying the swfdec trace to the X server takes 194 seconds compared to only 45 seconds to replay it only to cairo's all - software image backend .
Note that 194 seconds is longer than the full video clip , meaning that my system is n't going to be able to keep up without skipping here .
That 's obviously not what we want .
Then , after my simple just - use - malloc patch I get :
[ # ] backend test min(s ) median (s ) stddev . count [ 0 ] image swfdec- giant - steps 45.792 46.014 0.37 % 6 [ 0 ] xlib swfdec - giant - steps 81.505 81.567 0.03 % 6
Here the xlib result has improved from 194 seconds to 81 seconds .
That 's a 2.4 x improvement , and fast enough to now play the movie without skipping .
It 's very satisfying to validate performance patches with real - world application code like this .
This commit is in the recent 2.7.99.901 or the Intel driver , by the way .
( Of course , there 's still a 1.8 x slowdown of the xlib backend compared to the image backend , so there 's still more to be fixed here . )
The punchline is that we now have an easy way to benchmark 2D rendering in actual , real - world applications .
If you see someone benchmarking with only toys like x11 perf or gtkperf , go ahead and point them to this post , or the the cairo - perf - trace entry in the cairo FAQ , and insist on benchmarks from real applications .
It was Darwinian theory that did away with the werewolf .
For much of recorded history , humans have reserved their greatest fears for dog - human hybrids like the werewolf .
These beasts were once thought to be real , hiding behind every tree waiting for the unsuspecting traveler .
But , argues Brian Regal , assistant professor of the history of science at Kean University in Union , New Jersey , USA , the publication of Charles Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species 150 years ago focused minds on a different kind of monster – ape - men such as the Yeti , Bigfoot and Sasquatch .
Regal will present his thesis in July at the annual meeting of the British Society for the History of Science in Leicester , UK .
He will use period artwork to chart the ‘ evolution ’ of the werewolf into Bigfoot .
From the late 19th century onwards , stories of werewolf encounters tailed away significantly , says Regal .
“ The spread of the idea of evolution helped kill off the werewolf because a canid - human hybrid makes no sense from an evolutionary point of view , ” he says .
“ The ape - human hybrid , however , is not only evolutionarily acceptable , it is the basis of human evolution . ”
Today , in Darwin ’s bicentenary year , werewolves have been relegated to films .
When it comes to the actual monster scene , it ’s Bigfoot that now dominates .
Via Marc Ambinder , check out this e-mail from McCain campaign aide Nicolle Wallace to Sarah Palin , dated October 4 , 2008 -- before Palin 's infamous " palling around with terrorists " attack line :
Governor and Team : rick [ Davis ] , Steve [ Schmidt ] and I suggest the following attack from the new york times .
If you are comfortable , please deliver the attack as written .
Please do not make any changes to the below without approval from steve or myself because precision is crucial in our ability to introduce this .
The line they suggested :
This is not a man who sees American as you and I do -- as the greatest force for good in the world .
This is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country .
Here 's the line Palin delivered :
Our opponent ... is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough , that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country .
This is not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America .
Ambinder got his hands on the e-mails from an advance copy of a new book on the 2008 campaign by Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson of The Washington Post .
This seems sure to spark another blaze between Palin 's defenders -- who will claim this as a vindication , that she is in fact a loyal Republican teamplayer -- and her detractors , who have tried to pin John McCain 's loss on her shoulders .
At the end of the day , Palin still must take responsibility for delivering the line , but it 's valuable to know that she was n't going rogue -- she was following orders from the HQ .
She deserves all the grief she 's gotten for delivering the line , but so to do John McCain and the GOP operatives who ran his campaign .

In an interview published today , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates declared that the American public is “ pretty tired ” of the seemingly endless war in Afghanistan , and said he believed that forces had to turn the situation around in a year .
If , or most likely when , that does n’t happen , Gates says that the US could lose public support for the war , and the public might conclude that the conflict has become “ unwinnable , ” adding “ after the Iraq experience , nobody is prepared to have a long slog where it is not apparent we are making headway . ”
The US launched its invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 , and President Obama made escalation of the war a top issue of his 2008 election campaign and the centerpiece of his early administration .
The dramatic increase in US troops committed to the war is seen as open - ended , and last week Gates suggested that the US might send even more than previously acknowledged .
Yet far from “ a long slog where it is not apparent we are making headway , ” the war could more accurately be described as a long slog where the insurgency seems to be making considerable headway in recent years .
Violence is forever breaking new records , and America ’s European allies are increasingly discontented with the rising death tolls .
Despite years of war and no real ( positive ) progress , popular opposition for what has been called “ the forgotten war ” has so far failed to materialize in the US .
But with President Obama putting the focus on the war with his endless escalations and promises of new strategies , it seems like the public may finally form an opinion .
Gerald H. F. Gardner , who provided the statistical underpinnings for the landmark Supreme Court case that resulted in the prohibition of sex discrimination in newspaper want ads , died Saturday in Pittsburgh .
He was 83 .
The cause was leukemia , said his wife , Jo Ann Evansgardner .
Dr. Gardner , a geophysicist by profession and a mathematician by training but a social activist by temperament , taught at several universities , including the Carnegie Institute of Technology ( now known as Carnegie - Mellon University ) , Rice University and the University of Houston .
He worked for more than two decades for the Gulf Research and Development Company , a subsidiary of Gulf Oil , contributing to significant advances in applied seismology , or methods for finding oil and natural gas deposits .
But Dr. Gardner , a shy man who was uncomfortable in a lecture hall , was most formidable behind the scenes as a social activist , especially on behalf of women ’s rights .
He and his wife were among the earliest members of First Pittsburgh NOW , itself an early chapter of the National Organization for Women , which was founded in 1966 .
Trivia
Eddie Murphy said he did not go to any of the casts ' infamous drug parties after the show wrapped .
" They we 're too old , " he said , referring to the rest of the cast .
He said he would go hang out at local singles bars and dance clubs for people in their 20s , instead .

Hi Readers –
I ’m thinking of starting a new feature , Free -Range Kids Outrage of the Month ( Or Maybe Even Week ) .
Like that idea ?
Let me know .
And send outrages !
Meantime , here is Outrage # 1 , sent by a reader in suburban Texas .
This is a note from the local public grammar school about a holiday party :
“ Our Winter Holiday parties will be Friday , December 19 , with K - 2 celebrating from 1:00 - 1:45 and grades 3 - 5 will celebrate from 2:00 - 2:45 …
Please remember that each adult attending the party must have a volunteer background check completed and reported .
If you have not completed this process please do this immediately . “
That ’s right – you need a background check to ATTEND YOUR CHILD ’S CLASS PARTY .
One woman apologized on the neighborhood ’s message board for not being able to help out at her daughter ’s kindergarten shindig .
And why was that ?
“ By the time I decided to go , there was not enough time for the school to do a background check on me .
And their policy is if you want to be a volunteer , you have to go through the background check , it usually takes two weeks .
The teacher told me I could still go to the party , but I cannot help or interact with any children except my own .
I was supposed to just stand back and watch . ”
Clearly , even if you are the mother of a child in the class , you are out to molest all the other students ( in public ) and cannot so much as hand them a cupcake , you disgusting perv .
Great message to send kindergarteners :
Most adults are out to get you !
There is n’t just ONE boogey man .
There are about 27 per classroom !
Or actually , about 54 , since moms and dads are BOTH suspect !
Now kids , no long faces !
Throw out your paper plates and go make a maximum security prison with your blocks .
That ’s where most mommies and daddies belong .

It 's no secret that social media 's played an important - maybe even historic - role in the Iran election protests that have swept the nation into discord and disarray .
Many social media companies have made a contribution towards opening the flow of communication within and out of Iran , YouTube included .
As we reported earlier this week , thousands of Iran - related videos are being uploaded to YouTube every day , revealing first - hand accounts of the crisis to the world .
Some are incredible , some are eye - opening , and other shock you to your very core .
We 've included ten of these incredible videos , in a chronological order that helps provide context to the crisis in Iran .
Be prepared , for these videos can evoke some very strong emotions :
1. Saturday , June 13th
This was one of the first Iran election protests videos to be spread around the web .
Translate , the video's title is " Saturday 23 June . "
In actuality , this video was taken on Saturday , June 13th in what we believe to be Tehran .
2. June 13th : Riot in tehran streets after election day
This now well - known video has over 400,000 views .
You can see the green masks of the Mousavi movement onn clear display .
3. June 13th : BBC - Protest against Iran election results
The BBC was on top of the Iran crisis .
This popular video is an incredible on - the - ground report .
4. June 14th : Iranians protest against election results , police intervene
This is one of the first videos that shows the police getting involved in breaking up the crowds that formed not long after the elections .
There are cries , screaming , running , burning wreckage , and many angry citizens .
5. June 14th : Iran Election Protest in Paris
The protests have not just been inside of Iran .
There have been demonstrations in cities across the world in support of Mousavi's Green Movement .
This well - produced video comes out of Paris .
6. June 17 : Protesting in Silence - Tehran
Silence .
7. June 19th : Poem for the Rooftops of Iran
From the video 's description : " A woman speaking about the state of her country while filming the rooftop shouting of " Allah - o Akbar " in Iran on Friday June 19th "
The poem and the background noise make this video evoke emotions that are unlike most of the other videos coming out of Iran .
8. June 20th : Basij Milita have opened fire into crowds
This unedited video from the BBC is a display of how the violence has escalated in all of Iran .
9. June 20 : Wounded Girl Dying [ GRAPHIC CONTENT ]
WARNING : The following video is very graphic , disturbing , and involves the death of an Iranian woman .
DO NOT WATCH unless you feel capable AND are old enough .
Nevermind the crisis in Iran - this is one of the most brutal videos I have ever seen in my life .
That is why I have provided multiple warnings about this one , but I feel that it is important to include it for several reasons :
- Social media is raw , and that YouTube allows you to get the uncensored version of things .
We can not be blind to that fact .
-
This is , in my mind , the most incredible of all the videos coming out of Iran .
- Sometimes , you have to see everything to really understand what 's going on .
Things are very , very bad in Iran , period .
With all of that said , this video is just gut - wrenching .
10 . June 20th : Tehran Tazahorat
You can't help but be amazed by the sheer number of people in the streets .
THis video has been passed around a lot recently in social circles , and for good reason .
It 's incredible , just like all of the videos here .
YouTube shows us a progression
As I built this post , I saw a progression of events through the video .
Unfortunately , it was n't a good one .
It puts on display escalating violence , mayhem , and turmoil .
Iran is a nation in chaos , and as we monitor the situation , we must realize that social tools provide us with unfettered access to the situation .
Sometimes , that access can be disturbing .
The flip side though is that we can truly know what 's going on in Iran .
This way , we really stay informed .
If you have more videos from Iran , we encourage you to share them within in the comments , or to just share your thoughts on these videos .
A group of angry gamers has commemorated Valve 's announcement of a sequel to the hit zombie - killer Left 4 Dead by forming a Steam Group dedicated to boycotting it .
When I heard that Microsoft and Valve had announced Left 4 Dead 2 I said to myself , " Hey , that 's cool .
A follow - up to a hit videogame is about as surprising as a sunrise but I 'm always up for a little more zombie - shootin ' . "
Good news , right ?
Not necessarily .
It seems lot of people were unhappy about the announcement , which they see as a betrayal of Valve 's " promise " to support Left 4 Dead with new content , and over 3000 of them have joined a new Steam Group called L4D2 Boycott ( NO - L4D2 ) , complaining about everything from Valve 's lack of commitment to Left 4 Dead to the new game 's overly colorful " visual aesthetic " and crappy fiddle music .
The group 's manifesto :
Significant content for L4D1 was promised , and never delivered
Valve put little faith in L4D1 since they almost certainly started working on L4D2 right after release
The fact that L4D2 is nearly identical to L4D1 will decimate the community for both games
The announced date is not nearly enough time to polish content or make significant gameplay changes
The new character designs seem bland and unappealing so far
L4D2 is too colourful to fit in with L4D1 's visual aesthetic
The fiddle - based horde music is extremely disliked , though the differently orchestrated music is otherwise welcome
L4D2's release will result in a drop in quality and frequency for L4D1 content , even compared to before
The community has lost faith in Valve 's former reputation for commitment to their games post - release
Is it really all that bad ?
Left 4
Dead 2 may be more of an incremental update than an all - out zombie revolution but that 's hardly unusual in a sequel and given Valve 's track record , producing a follow - up to a major hit game in the span of a single year strikes me as a step in the right direction , not something to complain about .
Half - Life 2 came out four - and - a - half years ago and we do n't even have a release date for Episode 3 yet !
The L4D2 Boycott group is growing fairly quickly , although it 's impossible at this point to say whether that 's a sign of widespread discontent or merely that people really like to join online social groups .
But if either one sounds like your cup of tea , feel free to join the rage party at steamcommunity .com .

The more these kids learn , the more they earn .
A new cash - for - grades scheme is giving kids cash for getting good grades -- and studies show it 's improving the way middle - schoolers perform .
Students who participate in the Sparks program in New York City , which pays seventh - graders up to $ 500 for their performance on state tests and in the classroom , showed a 40 percentage point jump in reading and math scores , the New York Post reported .
" It 's an ego booster in terms of self - worth , " Rose Marie Mills , principal at MS 343 in Mott Haven , told the Post .
" When they get the checks , there 's that competitiveness -- ' Oh , I 'm going to get more money than you next time ' -- so it 's something that excites them . "
The more than 8,000 kids in the program have earned over $ 1.25 million collectively in the two years the Harvard University - based program has been active .
The kids say the cash incentive gives them a reason to study -- and something to look forward to when the school day ends .
" It 's all we talk about , " said Alize Cancel , a 13 - year - old at IS 286 in New York City who has earned $ 180 in the program .
" Every day we ask our teachers , ' Did we pass ?
When do we get paid ? ' " she said .
" It made me study more because I was getting paid . "
Similar programs that will trade cash for good grades are set to be launched in Chicago and Washington , D.C .

Enlarge By Steve Marcus for USA TODAY Professional poker player Annie Duke , to the right of the dealer , competes during a special 40th annual No - Limit Hold 'em , one of the three events featured in the World Series of Poker .
Coverage of this year 's World Series of Poker will be different from the last few years .
ESPN decided not to film the $ 50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event , which incorporates five poker disciplines .
While the event has become prestigious among poker die - hards , it does n't translate well to television and the ratings suffered .
WSOP UPDATE : Main Event to crown new champion Instead , ESPN will be airing coverage of three events from this year 's WSOP : the 40th anniversary $ 40,000 buy - in No - Limit Hold 'em event , the Ante Up for Africa event and the Main Event .
This year 's Main Event will have unprecedented coverage , with more televised hours than ever .
These changes have n't come without controversy , though , because a scheduling conflict has forced ESPN to scramble .
WSOP organizers agreed that it made sense to add another day before the final table takes place in November , citing that the Main Event should be a test of poker skills rather than endurance .
In past years , players routinely played 12 - plus hour days back - to - back - to - back .
With the added day , there is a different problem .
The pace of players being eliminated appears to be ahead of last year 's pace .
ESPN 's challenge is that it is committed to filming approximately three hours of footage on each day of the Main Event .
That would n't normally be difficult , but the added day of play , plus the tournament director 's decision to play fewer levels a day than originally scheduled , gives the network less flexibility .
Rather than creating three exciting hours of television from a 10 - to 12 - hour day , ESPN will have to find stories to tell in a shorter time period .
What that means is that the poker fanatics might get more of what they want .
True poker fans want to see more of the nitty - gritty hands and less of the standard , all - in confrontations with AK racing against QQ .
True fans want to see the little things that pros such as Phil Ivey do to amass large stacks of chips .
A lot of those " nothing " hands — while less exciting than the all - in confrontations — are interesting for a totally different reason .
There is also a dispute about whether the tournament organizers made the right decision by cutting some of the days short .
Many feel that by shortening days , it will produce disastrously long days at the late stages of the tournament , from about 45 players down to the final nine .
This year 's WSOP structure , however , has been the best in history .
It 's the same as last year 's , only the players started with 30,000 chips rather than 20,000 .
Theoretically , the more chips in play would make the tournament last longer .
In recent play , however , we have n't seen that at all .
Players are dropping at an astounding pace , and there 's really no explanation for it outside of total randomness .
This year 's bubble to make it into the money ( 664th place ) lasted a record 1 hour , 48 minutes .
When it gets down to 10 players left to make the final nine for November , expect another long , drawn - out battle .

There is something interesting in the latest CNN / Opinion Research poll .
Beyond finding that there is no current GOP favorite for the 2012 nomination , the poll also contained favorability ratings for notable national Republicans at the top of the list were moderates Colin Powell and John McCain .
At the bottom were Rush Limbaugh and Michael Steele .
Here is the full list courtesy of The Page :
George W. Bush : Favorable : 41 % Unfavorable : 57 %
Advertisements
Dick Cheney : Favorable : 37 % Unfavorable : 55 %
John McCain : Favorable : 58 % Unfavorable : 37 %
Sarah Palin : Favorable : 46 % Unfavorable : 43 %
Newt Gingrich : Favorable : 36 % Unfavorable : 35 %
Mitt Romney : Favorable : 42 % Unfavorable : 29 %
Mike Huckabee : Favorable : 45 % Unfavorable : 25 %
Rush Limbaugh : Favorable : 30 % Unfavorable : 53 %
Colin Powell : Favorable : 70 % Unfavorable : 18 %
Jeb Bush : Favorable : 33 % Unfavorable : 40 %
Michael Steele : Favorable : 20 % Unfavorable : 24 %
If the leadership of the GOP had any clue at all , they would learn something from these numbers .
The Republicans with the highest favorability ratings are the moderates .
It is no surprise that Powell is the most popular Republican .
He seems to have been holding this title for almost 20 years now .
The surprise is that George W. Bush has done so much damage to the family name that even Jeb Bush is in the 30s .
It is no big shock that the nation is still split over Sarah Palin .
This is probably going to be the case for her entire political career .
It is a bad omen for the GOP in 2012 than none of their potential top contenders are as popular as the candidate who lost in 2008 .
Huckabee , Romney , and Palin are bunched together in a big pack of mediocre .
Bush and Cheney are still toxic for the GOP , which is why top Republicans should send Dick Cheney back to his secure and undisclosed location as soon as possible .
As bad as Bush and Cheney are , Limbaugh is even more poisonous to the GOP .
These approval ratings confirm the notion that as long as the GOP is listening to Cheney and Limbaugh , Democrats have nothing to fear .

Subject : GADTs in OCaml
We present a simple , pure , magic - free implementation of a form of GADTs in OCaml that is sufficient for the common applications of GADTs such as data structures with embedded invariants , typed printf / scanf , tagless interpreters .
The implementation is a simple module , requiring no changes to the OCaml system .
The implementation is so trivial that it should work on any ML system ( although , like nested data types , GADTs are n't very useful on an SML system without support for polymorphic recursion ) .
Our examples include : - enforcing invariants on data structures : statically ensuring that in a tree representation of an HTML document , a link node is never an ancestor of another link node ; - typed printf / scanf sharing the same format descriptor , which is first - class and can be built incrementally ; - simply typed lambda - calculus with constants and higher - order abstract syntax .
This is essentially the example of Hongwei Xi's et al POPL 2003 paper .
The complete code with the implementation and examples is available at http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/GADT.ml
The GADT notation turns out lightweight .
However , GADTs are often inductive , and so we need polymorphic recursion to process them .
That adds some ( relatively small ) notational overhead .
Mainly , GADTs are often used with existentials -- so often that Haskell makes existential quantification implicit in GADT declarations .
OCaml , alas , lacks such notational conveniences , and so existentials ( which must be encoded via double - negation ) are n't pretty .
Smart constructors -- which can be build mechanically , perhaps with a suitable caml p4 macro -- ease the pain .
We learned the lesson that common GADTs are available in OCaml here and now .
We can truly write the published examples that motivated GADTs , without too much violence to their notation .
We can translate GADT code from Haskell , more or less mechanically .
No changes to the OCaml type system or the type checker are necessary .
Of course changes such as explicit existential quantification , better support for rank - 2 types , etc. shall be greatly appreciated -- but they are not necessary to start using and enjoying GADTs .
Hopefully the present implementation lets one get a taste of GADTs and write code that seems to require them .
The end of GADT .ml points out to a more efficient implementation , which perhaps can be the basis for the native OCaml implementation .
As shown by Patricia Johann and Neil Ghani : Foundations for Structured Programming with GADT .
POPL 2008 .
the essence of GADTs is the EQ GADT , which implements the following interface : type ( 'a , 'b ) eq val refl : ( ' a , 'a ) eq val apply_eq : ( ' a , 'b ) eq -> ' a -> 'b
The value of the type ( 'a , 'b ) eq witnesses the equality of two types .
The function apply_eq relies on the witness when performing type coercion .
To be precise , the genuine GADTs provide a more general function for the Leibniz principle val apply_eq : ( ' a , 'b ) eq -> ' a tau -> 'b tau for any type tau .
Our implementation supports only those tau that are functors ( that is , admit a map operation ) .
That seems sufficient however for all the common examples .
The following trivial implementation is genuinely safe , meaning it never leads to segmentation faults , even in principle .
module EQ = struct type ( 'a , 'b ) eq = Refl of ' a option ref * 'b option ref let refl ( ) = let r = ref None in Refl ( r , r ) let symm : ( ' a , 'b ) eq -> ( ' b , 'a ) eq = function Refl ( x , y ) -> Refl ( y , x ) let apply_eq : ( ' a , 'b ) eq -> ' a -> 'b = function Refl ( rx , ry ) -> fun x -> rx :=
Some x ; match !ry with | Some y -> rx :=
None ; y | _ -> failwith " Impossible " end ; ;
We show briefly one of the examples from GADT.ml : typed printf / scanf sharing the same format descriptor ( which is first - class and can be built incrementally ) : let tp2 = sprintf ( f_lit " Hello " ^^ f_lit " world " ^^ f_char ) '!' ; ; (* val tp2 : string = " Hello world ! " *) let ts2 = sscanf tp2 ( f_lit " Hello " ^^ f_lit " world " ^^ f_char ) ( fun x -> x ) ; ; (* val ts2 : char * string = ( ' ! ' , " " ) *) (* Formats are first - class and can be constructed incrementally *) let fmt31 ( ) = f_lit " The value of " ^^ f_char ^^ f_lit " is " ; ; (* val fmt31 : unit -> ( ' a , char -> ' a ) fmt *) let fmt3 ( ) = fmt31 ( ) ^^ f_int ; ; (* val fmt3 : unit -> ( ' a , char -> int -> ' a ) fmt *) let tp3 = sprintf ( fmt3 ( ) ) ' x ' 3 ; ; (* val tp3 : string =
" The value of x is 3 " *) (*
What we print , we can parse back *) let ts3 = sscanf tp3 ( fmt3 ( ) ) ( fun x n -> ( x , n ) ) ; ; (* val ts3 : ( char * int ) * string = ( ( 'x ' , 3 ) , " " ) *)
The example is a straightforward re-implementation of the Haskell code http://okmij.org/ftp/typed-formatting/PrintScanI.txt
http://okmij.org/ftp/typed-formatting/PrintScan.hs
In particular , the GADT defining a domain - specific language of format descriptors is written in OCaml as follows : type ( 'a , 'b ) fmt = | FLit of < m_flit : 'w. ( ( 'a , 'b ) eq -> string -> 'w ) -> 'w > | FInt of < m_fint : 'w. ( ( int -> ' a , 'b ) eq -> 'w ) -> 'w > | FChr of < m_fchr : 'w. ( ( char -> ' a , 'b ) eq -> 'w ) -> 'w > | FCmp of < m_fcmp : 'w. ( ' a , 'b , 'w ) fcmp_k -> 'w > (*
The standard encoding of existentials *) and ( ' a , 'c , 'w ) fcmp_k = {fcmp_k : 'b. ( ' b , 'c ) fmt * ( ' a , 'b ) fmt -> 'w} ;;
We can ( mechanically ) define smart constructors : let f_lit x = FLit ( object method m_flit : 'w. ( ( 'a , 'b ) eq -> string -> ' w ) -> 'w = fun k -> k ( refl ( ) ) x end ) ; ; (* val f_lit : string -> ( ' a , 'a ) fmt *) let f_int =
FInt ( object method m_fint : 'w. ( ( int -> ' a , 'b ) eq -> ' w ) -> 'w = fun k -> k ( refl ( ) ) end ) ; ; (* val f_int : ( ' a , int -> ' a ) fmt *)
We show one interpreter of the DSL , to format values into a string : type print_sig = {pr : ' a 'b. ( ' a , 'b ) fmt -> ( string -> ' a ) -> ' b} ; ; let rec printer = {pr = function | FLit x -> fun k -> x#m_flit ( fun eq x -> apply_eq eq ( k x ) ) | FInt x -> fun k -> x#m_fint ( fun eq -> apply_eq eq ( fun x -> k ( string_of_int x ) ) ) | FChr x -> fun k -> x#m_fchr ( fun eq -> apply_eq eq ( fun x -> k ( String. make 1 x ) ) ) | FCmp x -> fun k -> x#m_fcmp {fcmp_k = fun ( a , b ) -> printer .pr a ( fun sa -> printer .pr b ( fun sb -> k ( sa ^ sb ) ) ) } } ; ; let sprintf fmt = printer .
pr fmt ( fun x -> x ) ; ; (* val sprintf : ( string , ' a ) fmt -> ' a *)
The code is rather straightforward .
One can build many similar interpreters , e.g. , to direct the output into any suitable data sink .
No changes to the format descriptor or the library is needed .
[ The picture above is from the New York Post , it makes false or misleading claims ( highlighted ) about propsed healthcare taxes .
It is part of an alarmist trend in the reactionary press which makes what could be a bi-partisan issue appear necessarily polarized ] .
Having lived in America for 10 years , its a great place – but there are two things that feel broken , the legal system ( with opportunistic litigation and judges who legislate ( on both sides of the political spectrum ) ) and the healthcare system ( with its bureaucracy , mercenary feel and lack of universal coverage ) .
In healthcare the culture of litigation compounds the problems of both medicine and the law , and its failings should anger those on the left for its patent social unfairness and the right for its obviously inefficient free market failings .
Solving this should be a bi-partisan call to arms , but it has become a polarizing force through lies and deception .
A proposal to increases taxes by miniscule ( 1 % ) and overhaul the whole system is being spun by knee - jerk reactionaries as a huge tax hike on the middle classes .
As an outsider who has experience of multiple countries healthcare , I feel compelled to share my anecdotal experience of it in the US .
Despite having healthcare coverage here , it was cheaper for me to pay for a doctors visit in France where my wife is from and buy an antibiotic out of my own pocket than claim against my insurance and pay the co-payment .
If I lived there or in another european country such as the UK , ( but not Ireland ) , this would be free with a nominal fee for prescriptions ( less than $ 20 ) – and contrary to perception I would pay about the same in taxes .
In Switzerland , I would pay for the mandatory healthcare ( about half of the US rate , but with better service and results ) but in the end it would be a wash because of lower taxes .
But its not just about day to day coverage .
A health insured friend in the US who had a heart attack received a $ 300,000 bill after finding that his insurance company only paid 90 % .
A friend of my wife is nearly bankrupted by her treatment for cancer .
The worst part is that many people in the US do not seem to know that its only there that this happens .
In every single other industrialized nation the threat of being bankrupted by medical bills does not exist .
And treatment in the US is vastly different from anywhere I ’ve been ( I have lived in 4 other countries ) .
Nearly every time I go to the doctor I am sent for some kind of test – this seems like a good thing and who am I to argue , I am not a doctor ?
But when I asked a doctor in the UK ( after having been sent for a brain scan for dizziness that was a drug side - affect ) I was told that the risk of the scan was possibly higher than the chance of disease .
What may have been happening is that the doctor had to minimize his risk of being sued by increasing my health risk .
This abrogation of responsibility which seems to me to contradict the hippocratic oath also manifests itself in the annoying habit of giving you a choice for every treatment .
When there are two people in the room making a health decision , a fully qualified medic and a trained architect , apparently the architect ( me ) has to make the choice .
If you wanted to have an operation in a creative and unusual , but life threatening , way , you might want want to ask me .
But I ’d recommend a doctor .
Yet when I say to a doctor , ‘ well you choose from your recommendations ’ he says ( me ) the architect should .
The responsibility problem is often not the Doctor ’s fault .
My sister , who is a doctor in the UK was told not to offer to help Americans if they fell ill while flying .
The reason was fear of being sued .
Litigation is just one part of the reason why US healthcare is a massive rip - off costing 40 % more than anywhere else in the world with no better results .
For the capitalists amongst us , US heathcare is a DMV - like Byzantine rats nest of paperwork , unnecessary ass - covering treatment and co-payment drug costs which exceed buying them directly off the Internet .
And that is if you have healthcare .
If you are one of the 46 million Americans , the only people in any developed country that do n’t , then your life expectancy is less than if you lived in Libya .
What the Obama administration is proposing is to replace inefficient Stalinist style corruption with something economically far less socialist than the US military .
So what ’s the problem ?
Max Fischer is a precocious 15 - year - old whose reason for living is his attendance at Rushmore , a private school where he's not doing well in any of his classes , but where he's the king of extracurricular activities - from being in the beekeeping society to writing and producing plays , there 's very little after school he does n't do .
His life begins to change , however , when he finds out he's on academic probation , and when he stumbles into love with Miss Cross , a pretty teacher of the elementary school at Rushmore .
Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume , wealthy industrialist and father to boys who attend the school , and who also finds himself attracted to Miss Cross .
Max 's fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle , and how he sets about resolving it is the story in the film .

A MONTH of tramping around Europe has given your correspondent a chance to see how effective the new e-passports are at border crossings .
Between them , his family holds American , Japanese and British passports , each recently renewed .
Unlike previous ones , the e-passports contain biometric data embedded in a radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) chip , along with the usual mugshot and optical bar - code .
Although all new passports conform , more or less , to standards laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation , each country implements the requirements somewhat differently .
The new American passport sets the gold standard .
It has additional features built into it that make it especially hard to counterfeit .
The Japanese passport runs a close second , while the British version comes a poor third .
AFP
So far , the only biometric details stored in the new chipped passports are facial measurements , including the distance between the holder 's eyes and the positions of the nose , mouth and ears .
The measurements — extracted from passport photographs using facial - recognition software — are digitally encoded and stored in the RFID 's memory along with a digitised photograph and personal details .
The two main justifications for adding chips to passports are that they improve security at border crossings and speed up immigration procedures .
Your correspondent thinks this is poppycock .
Take speed .
The immigration officer still has to open the e-passport , read its contents and then swipe its bar - code through an optical reader to get the bearer 's file up on a screen ready to ask a few questions .
There , normally , the procedure would end .
Next , however , the e-passport has to be placed over an inductive reader that provides the radio - frequency energy to power up the passive RFID so it can spit out its data .
Moments later , the chip 's contents appear on the screen , ready to be compared with those printed in the booklet .
If the two sets of information agree , the passport is accepted as authentic .
In other words , all the chip does is confirm what is printed in the passport .
What it does not do is prove the holder is the person he or she claims to be — no more so than a traditional passport did .
If the person has a reasonable likeness to the photograph — and therefore similar biometric details — a stolen e-passport could readily be accepted .
Or if the passport is a fake and the chip cloned , it could just as easily pass muster .
As always , it will come down to the experienced eye of the immigration official — whether it's a chipped passport or a traditional one .
How easy is it to clone an e-passport ?
The RFID chip is not supposed to divulge any data until the reading machine on the immigration official 's desk authenticates itself by presenting an encrypted digital key .
This has to match another encrypted key that is generated from a string of data scanned into the system from the optical bar - code printed in the passport .
Only when the two keys match can the chip be unlocked .
That , at least , is the theory .
Unfortunately , not all countries have implemented the “ passkey ” part of the process as well as they might have done .
Even the European Union admits that the security of its e-passports was “ poorly conceived ” .
Indeed , no sooner had European authorities introduced the new chipped passports than a Dutch one was hacked live on television , with the participants gaining access to the owner 's digital photograph and personal details .
Days later , a handful of British e-passports were given the same treatment .
Part of the problem is the encryption keys themselves .
Because they depend on familiar groupings — such as passport numbers , places of birth and birth dates — they tend to be highly structured sequences that are quite easy to guess .
That makes it possible for hackers to decode such keys in minutes rather than hours .
Also , because RFIDs broadcast their encrypted contents over the air , eavesdropping is easy .
The official range of an e-passport 's RFID is supposed to be no more than ten centimetres ( four inches ) .
But with $ 100 worth of hobbyist gear , Israeli researchers managed to skim encrypted data off e-passports from several feet away .
A student at Cambridge University in Britain went further , intercepting e-passport transmissions some 50 metres ( 160 feet ) away .
That was enough for State Department officials in Washington , DC , to insist that American e-passports be fitted with metal sleeves to shield them , when closed , from prying electronic eyes .
The measures seem to be reasonably effective , though e-passports that get wedged open slightly by keys or loose change can still be read electronically from a distance .
Slightly open passports could leave holders vulnerable to physical attack .
Each country encrypts data in a characteristic way that terrorists could use to identify the nationality of the person carrying the chipped passport .
To demonstrate the point , a firm called Flexilis used a partially opened American e-passport tucked in the pocket of a dummy to trigger an explosion as it passed a dustbin containing a small charge .
As vulnerable as e-passports are to electronic eavesdropping and cloning ( which their non-chipped predecessors were not ) , they are nowhere near as bad as the new generation of chipped identity cards that are finding their way into people 's pockets .
Since June 1st Americans re-entering the country by land or sea from Canada , Mexico , Bermuda and the Caribbean have had to carry at least an Enhanced Driving Licence or a PASS card — picture IDs the size of a credit - card with the bearer 's identification number stored in an RFID chip .
Certainly , chipped ID cards speed things up at borders .
All you have to do is hold the little plastic card to the windscreen as you approach the checkpoint , and a scanner reads your unique identification number .
Your file is immediately downloaded from a central database for the immigration officer to see on a screen .
The officer can then wave you through or hold you momentarily for questioning .
Speedy they may be , but chipped ID cards are horrendously insecure .
When prompted , they broadcast their unique identifier in plain text , without any form of encryption or authentication , to anyone who is listening .
And because they are designed to be interrogated from distances of ten metres or more , they are a doddle to intercept .
Making matters worse , they rely on the same RFID tags used by retailers , and can therefore be “ locked ” or “ killed ” remotely by wireless commands .
The scope for identity theft , chaos or worse is unlimited .
Bizarrely , you can enter America on one of these pieces of plastic .
What on earth were the authorities thinking ?
Embarrassed officials are now appealing to people carrying such ID cards to keep them safely tucked away in metal sheaths .
Truth be told , shielding them merely reduces the range from which they can be read .
The current record is 65 metres .
Meanwhile , the British government is scrambling to avert a similar fiasco .
Earlier this month , the Home Office announced a change of heart , saying its proposed national ID card scheme would not now be compulsory .
It also deferred ordering equipment for making the cards until autumn 2010 — after the next election .
Britain 's opposition parties have gone further , promising to scrap the hated ID card system altogether , along with the central database that would hold comprehensive files on everyone in the land .
With a change of government expected next year , Britons may yet be spared the insanities Americans are now having to put up with .
Top graduating senior is an intellectual superstar
Emma Shaw Crane spent her teens riding horses and making mischief at her Waldorf school in Santa Rosa , Calif .
She filled out her application to the University of California , Berkeley , while recovering from typhoid on a beach in southern Mexico .
Growing up among activists and anarchists , Shaw Crane said she never expected to be admitted to a top research university .
( Peg Skorpinski photo )
But like her thick , tawny hair , Shaw Crane 's life is full of twists and turns .
Today , she has landed a coveted prize as UC Berkeley 's top graduating senior , selected to receive the University Medal and address thousands of her peers at Commencement Convocation on May 22 .
She also will receive a $ 2,500 scholarship .
Shaw Crane has a perfect 4.0 GPA and a resume packed with research , community projects and awards - including a Fulbright scholarship to work on AIDS research and education in Colombia .
Her major is Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in race , gender and political economy , and her minor is Global Poverty & Practice .
She speaks fluent Spanish and conversational Arabic .
A native of the tiny farming town of Graton , Calif. , she has worked with political prisoners and alternative high school students on poetry and radio essays .
Tall and glowing with health , Shaw Crane practices the Brazilian martial art of capoeira .
While an omnivore , she lives in a vegan cooperative called the Mango House .
" Here , in short , is a young woman who is not only an intellectual superstar , but a deeply generous and committed activist who will make a very real difference in the world , " wrote geography professor Gillian Hart , chair of the Development Studies Program , part of International & Area Studies , in her letter recommending Shaw Crane for the University Medal .
A self - described child of privilege , Shaw Crane was born to Tom Crane , a physician , and Susan Shaw , a social worker and community organizer , in the fall of 1985 .
Her younger brother , Adam , is a rock climber who scales the world 's peaks .
From preschool through the 12th grade , she attended Summerfield Waldorf School & Farm in Santa Rosa , where she frequently ran wild , but managed to keep up academically .
She met her high school sweetheart while in after - school detention .
At age 8 , during the 1994 indigenous uprising in Chiapas , Mexico , she accompanied her father and a forensic team with Physicians for Human Rights to investigate the military torture of indigenous people in the rural highlands .
At 12 , during a school trip to El Salvador , she heard testimony from women whose children had died or disappeared during the 1980 - 92 civil war .
" One of my early memories is of dead bodies on a basketball court , " she said .
In high school , she volunteered to help day laborers negotiate jobs with prospective employers : " It was my introduction into the double world in my hometown , which is 40 percent white , upper - middle class , organic wine , Whole Foods crowd , " she said .
" But underneath that , in spaces that are n't visible publicly , is a destitute immigrant labor population that drives the whole economy . "
After graduating from Summerfield , she took a " gap " year off , and returned to Central America where she interned for a local organization called COMPPA ( Popular Communications for Autonomy ) giving workshops on community media at indigenous people 's organizations in rural Mexico , Guatemala and Honduras .
The women she worked with convinced her to use her privilege to get the kind of top - notch education that they could never obtain .
And so she applied to UC Berkeley and Oberlin College , a private liberal arts institution in Ohio .
She was accepted to both , but chose UC Berkeley because she wanted to be close to her family in Graton .
For someone who had graduated with a class of just 12 students in a farm town , the UC Berkeley campus was crowded and overwhelming , but it felt less so when she moved into the Sherman Hall women 's co-op and made close friends .
Academically , she was drawn to African American Studies and found her home there .
She was also inspired by Ananya Roy , a city and regional planning professor , and enrolled in her class , " Global Poverty : Challenges and Hopes for the New Millennium . "
Roy was similarly impressed with Shaw Crane , and urged her to join a discussion section restricted to graduate and Ph.D. students : " She produced a graduate paper that earned her an ' A ' in the class .
But to end the story here captures only one dimension of Emma , her academic rigor and brilliance , " Roy wrote in her nomination letter .
" Emma combines such gifts with a lovely modesty and grace ... her undergraduate and graduate colleagues never knew that she was in fact doing double the work - all with a big smile on her face . "
While Shaw Crane excelled academically , she also sought out community work : " When I came to Berkeley , I was very clear I was not going to be a weekend , once - a - year activist , " she said .
During her freshman year , she was hired by Prison Radio , a project of the Redwood Justice Fund in San Francisco .
There , she produced radio essays and even traveled to Peru to interview political prisoners who were members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement .
In the spring of 2008 , she studied abroad at the American University of Beirut , in Lebanon , where she took courses in environmental design , archeology and Arabic language .
During that semester , she visited refugee camps and witnessed Hezbollah 's occupation of West Beirut .
She returned to UC Berkeley and plunged into her Global Poverty & Practice minor , which is offered by the campus 's Blum Center for Developing Economies .
While other global poverty minors traveled abroad to do their " practice , " she bused a mile south of campus to Berkeley Technology Academy , an alternative high school attended mostly by African American and Latino youth who have been expelled from mainstream high schools .
At " B - Tech , " she coordinates a poetry and media program , producing CDs and a book of the students ' poems and essays .
She has also served as a health educator to the school 's young women , a task that has sensitized her to the sexism , racism and violence in these students ' daily lives :
" The teachers and students at B - Tech are like family .
I know students ' parents , siblings , aunties .
It 's a beautiful community to be a part of . " she said .
" That 's why I choose to work locally . "
Also part of her extended family are the student poetry teachers in the Poetry for the People program in the campus 's African American Studies Department , where she teaches an upper - division poetry class in American Cultures .
Of course , not everything comes easily to Shaw Crane .
She counts math and statistics among her challenges .
" I have a 4.0 GPA because I have tremendous sense of responsibility , " Shaw Crane said .
" If I 'm here , I need to be busting ass and doing as well as I can because there are a lot of people who deserve to be here , but are not . "

Spotting the fake psychic or a scam is a real tough task to be established .
It is something that is to be done with extra care and research about the person whom you wish to meet .
This could be possible with more interaction with the authentic advisors who would know about the drawbacks
and reliability of the person .
A Psychic Reading ?
Receive one from Net - Psychics
Psychics are persons who could assist in developing yourself .
But there are a lot of people who are not the reliable ones as many might be fake psychics .
There are different methods to spot the fake psychics .
People go after the psychic reading , psychic numerology and even tarot card reading , but if it is not to the right person then you might be in great trouble .
Always look out for the real psychics who are gifted with the power and those who are working on the psychic network lines .
They convey different
messages and if they are fake messages then it might leave you in trouble .
Searching for the solution of your problems with your relation , your love or anything related to your life then the answer would be to check out a psychic who could help out .
He is the person who will be able to guide you to the success of your life with various instructions and most
important he could point out your weakness and those things which are to be improved in your life .
A real psychic is a person who is reliable and you should always makes sure that you meet the fool proof identity as to visit that person who has a excellent reputation outside .
It is important to ensure the credentials of the psychic whom you are going to meet .
But there are also psychics who have got a good feedback every where , never ever think that the person who responds to your call is completely perfect as there might be some fakeness in him too .
So it is always advised to visit after a good research about him .
Another way that most of fake psychics use to fool is by the fake feedback that they own .
This is cunning way which is used to fool you .
You might be in dilemma as how to select the authentic psychic and in which means .
The most significant thing to be known by you is that you should have knowledge about the psychic and most importantly not all
authentic psychics have a remarkable and plenty of feedbacks .
The real person will be having great feedbacks but along with the bad ones too .
As a person will not be cent percent perfect .
So his work might cause him some drawbacks which might be noted by his patients in the feedback .
So due to this reason an authentic psychic will have a combination of both good and bad feedbacks .
But a
fake psychic might have excellent and outstanding feedback without even a single drawback .
So take necessary steps to check in that person in detail as some of them are exclusively perfect and authentic psychic .
To be more precise , spotting a fake psychic is really a tough task which is to be implemented and worked only with more interactions and experiences with others and authentic advisors .
But one thing to be noted is that if you find something unbelievably good then they are sure to be fake ones .
So always get note of these before you choose your psychics .

Bloomberg reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing to investigate Apple 's disclosures regarding Steve Jobs ' health during the early January period leading up to the announcement that Jobs would be taking a six - month medical leave of absence .
The report is a follow - up to Bloomberg 's January report about the investigation .
" The issue here is : Did Apple or Jobs make misleading disclosures , tested by what they knew at the time ? " said Robert Hillman , a securities law professor at the University of California , Davis .
" A disclosure could be misleading if it's a partial truth . "
Whether the SEC will ultimately be able to take action against Apple or Jobs is unknown , given the uncertainty about the situation and the " murky " laws regarding disclosure of the health of companies '
CEOs .
Regardless of the extent to which a company has a duty to reveal health matters , it is clear that once a company chooses to speak about an issue , it must do so truthfully .
While there has to be some measure of confidentiality around the health of executives , any disclosures need to be accurate and complete , said Jahan Raissi , a former SEC enforcement attorney .
" Once you open your mouth and start to speak on a topic , you have to say something completely truthful , " said Raissi , who is now a partner at Shartsis Friese LLP in San Francisco .
" If what you omitted is material , thats a problem . "
On that basis , the SEC is focusing its inquiry on what events may have transpired between January 5th , when Jobs and Apple announced that he was suffering from a " hormone imbalance " for which the treatment was " relatively simple " and January 14th , when Jobs announced that he was taking a leave of absence due to the medical issue being " more complex " than originally thought .
Jobs ' health issues ultimately required him to undergo a liver transplant , although he was still able to meet his stated timeline in returning to work by the end of June .
Will Congress expand wildly popular program ?...
UPDATE : House approves increased funding ; bill now awaits Senate action
Desi Doyen Byon

As we related in yesterday 's ' Green News Report , ' the federal auto - stimulus program Car Allowance Rebate System ( CARS ) --- popularly nicknamed ' Cash for Clunkers ' --- launched this week in earnest .
The program is intended to help spur consumers to trade in old gas guzzlers with a virtual cash rebate of up to $ 4500 , in exchange for purchasing a car , truck , or SUV with better ( even just slightly better ) mileage .
After compromising on an initially proposed $ 4 billion program , Congress approved $ 1 billion in funding for the program , to be paid directly to car dealers , with a deadline of November 1st to file the paperwork .
Well , not long after airtime yesterday , and just four days after the program began in full , ' Cash for Clunkers ' appears to have been so wildly popular that it had already run out of money .
According to the New York Times , the Transportation Department had asked car dealers around the country to stop offering the rebate program while officials determine the next course of action .
By late this morning , however , they report , the White House has issued a statement that the program will continue at least through this weekend .
" There 's apparently too many clunkers and not enough cash , " the Times ' Richard Change notes .
As of yesterday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had said the program was not suspended , as had initially been reported , and that the administration was " assessing the situation . "
He added , " all valid CARS transactions that have taken place to date will be honored . "
Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood is said to be working with Congress to discuss ways to increase funding to extend the wildly popular program .
With the rebates ranging from $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 --- dependent on the miles per gallon of the trade - in compared to the new car purchased --- the $ 1 billion in funding was intended to cover about 250,000 new cars .
Dealers have been collecting applications for the rebates since July 1st , in advance of the publication of the final rules and qualifying vehicles on Monday .
Although the Department of Transportation reports a backlog of applications waiting to be processed , they reported they had already received approximately a quarter million applications as of Thursday night .
UPDATE : The U.S. House passed a bill late Friday to provide an additional $ 2 billion in funding for the CARS program , by diverting funds from a Department of Energy loan guarantee program .
The Senate is expected to act next week , although CNN.com reports the " bill will face tough opposition in the Senate . "

Waterboarding .
It ’s all we seem to discuss when comes to American torture .
Whenever you see people discussing " enhanced interrogation " on your TV , chances are they ’ll be throwing around the same tired arguments , all revoling around waterboarding .
Why , of all the things we ’ve done to our suspected ( and not - so - suspected ) terrorist detainees , is waterboarding the issue ?
Why confine the rapidly dwindling debate to that single technique ?
We ’ve engaged in a lot of other practices that qualify universally as torture .
Are sleep deprivation or " Palestinian hanging " not controversial enough ?
Is solitary confinement too mundane ?
How about sodomy ?
Is that something we consider unremarkable ?
" This is highly consistent with the events Amir described , including a traumatic injury and subsequent scarring process .
Examination of the peri-anal area showed signs of rectal tearing that are highly consistent with his report of having been sodomized with a broomstick . "
– Physicians for Human Rights
That ’s right , sodomy .
Forcible anal penetration .
The documentation of this and other forms of sexual humiliation is too extensive to be denied or pawned off on a couple of redneck privates .
And we know now that sexual humiliation techniques were among those discussed and approved by the National Security Principals Committee , a White House group including Dick Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , Colin Powell , George Tenet , and John " History will not judge this kindly " Ashcroft .
I do n’t want to come off as minimizing the horror of controlled drowning .
It ’s just that there ’s something about forcible anal rape that brings the torture issue into sharp focus .
Just once , I ’d like to hear one of these American Enterprise Institute psychos , the ones that always trot out to defend the Neocons ’ freakish obsessions , have to defend shoving a flashlight up a guy ’s ass .
I want to hear Frank Gaffney or Jonah Goldberg tell me why I should n’t be fucking mortified that raping prisoners was considered within tolerable interrogation practices by my country .
I want Glenn Beck to justify butt - raping a suspect .
The next time I hear some idiot refer to Jack Bauer in defense of torture , I want to ask him what he thinks of Jack Bauer rogering terrorists with a broomstick .
You ’ve never seen that in the hours of not - so - subtle pro-torture TV drama we ’ve seen since 2001 , have you ?
Never saw Andy Sipowicz cornhole a skell on NYPD blue ?
Or Michael Chiklis on The Shield making a suspect drink his pee ?
Me neither .
Something tells me that might have hurt their ratings .
" He also recalled having been forced to wear soiled underwear , often for weeks or months at a time .
' I had diarrhea and I was in handcuffs .
I was making my toilet in my underwear and I was very dirty .
That was very painful .' ... When he asked to see the doctor he was told that 'we brought a medicine to you . ’
Laith explains that , in fact , ' They brought to me bottles [ of ] urine and [ they ] told me if you do not drink these now we will bring your mother and sisters .
Because I was hearing the voices of women and children , I [ believed him and ] drank it .
I was in handcuffs and they poured the urine [ into my mouth ] and sometimes I vomited from that but when I vomited they kept on pouring [ the urine ] on my head … I died at that time . '
He said that he was forced to drink urine from the soldiers on eleven different occasions . "
– Physicians for Human Rights
The key to winning the debate on torture is to eradicate any illusions about just what this was , which is sick , twisted , and freakish beyond any usefulness in gathering information .
And it becomes very clear in the light of a rectally inserted lightstick .
Raise the specter of White House - authorized sexual abuse , and anyone who does n’t shrink away from defending it will be doomed to be remembered as the guy who defended ass - rape and forced urine - drinking , which is the very least an American should suffer for trying to justify brutally raping prisoners .
But no one will pull the trigger .
Even as more proof is revealed , nobody seems to mention the sodomy .
The torture debate is limited to waterboarding alone .
Why ?
Forget the 48 photos Obama has flipped on releasing ( like the putz he ’s turned out to be ) .
There are known photos — you can see them at Salon.com — of a female prisoner being raped , and a male .
Not to mention the kinky naked slave - stacking and forced masturbation -- and the prisoner with a banana up his ass .
We blared Metallica at them 24 hours a day while they shat themselves , chained to the floor .
We kept them in coffin - sized boxes for hours on end .
We hung them from the ceiling .
We made them jack each other off .
We beat some of them to death .
Many have lost their minds .
Some these people were guilty of nothing but being in Afghanistan or Iraq and being swept up as part of an intelligence “ mosaic . ”
" Perhaps most important are the anal scars that were observed .
Not only are these scars highly consistent with anal trauma ( i.e. , as would result from forced sodomy or penetration with an object ) , these scars are in a location where accidental injuries would not occur . "
– Physicians for Human Rights
The inevitable dunderhead response , " they beheaded our people , " is a sickness unto itself .
From Abu Ghraib to Gitmo , we ’ve suffered countless such humiliating comparisons , judging ourselves by the lowest standards current events can offer .
Sorry , but it is not enough to say we are n’t as bad as Saddam Hussein or the scumbags that killed Daniel Pearl .
The very idea that we should measure our own conduct by theirs is a total failure of self - respect .
Only the worst kind of scumbag can excuse himself by saying , " I ’m incrementally better than the Taliban . "
" These brainstorming meetings at Guantanamo produced animated discussion .
' Who has the glassy eyes ? ' [ Guantanamo Judge Advocate Diane ]
Beaver asked herself as she surveyed the men around the room , thirty or more of them .
She was invariably the only woman in the room , keeping control of the boys .
The younger men would get excited , agitated , even : ' You could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas . ' " – Phillipe Sands , Torture Team : Rumsfeld ’s Memo and the Betrayal of American Values
What ’s so sick about it is that the sexual nature of the torture seems so unnecessary .
I mean , even if we were going to torture them , we could have stuck to waterboarding , pulling some fingernails or just beating the shit out of them .
But menstrual blood smeared on their faces ?
Ass rape ?
What kind of people do that ?
What possible purpose does that serve that outweighs becoming known as the country that ass - rapes people ?
We could n’t get enough answers , or false confessions , or whatever we were looking for , from regular brutality ?
We had to go all BDSM on these people ?
The upshot is this : America is the country that rapes its prisoners .
We ’re sex criminals .
That ’s our thing now .
And Obama ’s refusal to " look back , " i.e. prosecute these incredibly serious crimes , ensures that it ’s our permanent legacy .
No national reputation can survive this simply by shrugging it off .
We used to be seen as a bastion of freedom and decency around the world .
That shit is over , folks .
We ’re like the Soviet Union with better movies now .
When we talk about human rights , we are an international joke .
And when we talk about torture , we stick to waterboarding , because nobody , not even the " liberals , " are willing to face what we ’ve done .

Sheena Matheiken , founder of The Uniform Project , has challenged herself to wear the same dress for 365 days as an exercise in sustainable fashion .
To prove her point , she had seven of the exact same dresses created for her ( to avoid any stinkiness ) , that she can accessorize any way she wants – but she has to wear the same dress all year and says at her website she ’d like to “ think of it as wearing a daily uniform with enough creative license to make it look like I just crawled out of the Marquis de Sade ’s boudoir . ”
So far , so intriguing .
This exercise is also a worthy fundraiser and all contributions will go toward Akanksha ’s School Project to fund uniforms and other educational expenses for slum children in India , where Matheiken was raised and schooled .
Please visit Matheiken ’s site to see how you can participate or donate to her cause .
At the very least , how you can help the poor girl accessorize enough to put her through a full year of wearing ( gulp ) the same old , same old .
In the meantime , I wrangled my own posse of designers to answer the question :
In light of The Uniform Project , do you think you could design a dress that could multi-task for a woman for a whole year ?
Bahar Shahpar :
I could and I would .
Very excitedly so .
Repurposing and reimagining beyond a normally acceptable level is right up my alley .
In fact , I was just approached by a forward - thinking friend to do just that .
But I would n’t do a dress .
I ’m just going to put it out there : Long Live the Onesie .
LAEKEN :
LAEKEN ’s vision could absolutely be translated into developing a dress versatile enough to be worn 365 ways , as seen in the Uniform Project .
We love the idea of multi-functional pieces .
For example : a zipper in the back of a dress so that it may be worn tighter or looser ( seen in our fall 2009 collection ) or a jacket with removable sleeves so that it may also be a vest ( seen in fall 2008 ) or the Osaka dress from spring 2009 that has two different ways that it can be worn .
We would create something very unique , true to LAEKEN ’s edgy spirit but simple enough to be accessorized , dressed up or dressed down , comfortable and perfect for the transition from day to night .
Alabama Chanin :
We have been striving to make multitask dresses and clothing since the beginning of the company .
I love a dress that can be used as a night gown , for gardening , to go to work , dinner and a party – perhaps with a washing in between .
MothLove :
I believe MothLove dresses are meant to be worn under the same constructs as the Uniform Project .
I had no intentions of putting boundaries around my line , as I think that can stunt its potential !
What is important to me is that MothLove creates pieces intended to be worn however the wearer chooses , interpreting the “ artists ” creation in their own way …and even that has cause for constant “ re-interpretation . ”
When that happens the real magic happens and a new spirit evolves … your spirit evolves .
MothLove is highly adaptable , designed in grey scale for wearability and relevance beyond a season or a trend ; meant to be the favorite piece you pull out of your closet routinely .
The dresses stand alone , yet are easy to layer and accessorize , keeping the focus on conscious consumption and creativity .
I really only meant to make something that allows a woman to feel natural , pure and pretty .
I do n’t think we allow ourselves that privilege enough .
And in that , I hope the wearer can feel the love and devotion I have in making each piece .
cmarchuska :
I think designers will have to view design with more functionality instead of creativity since this one dress uniform will have to last a whole year .
In general , I think this is the direction fashion is headed during these tough economic times because consumers want pieces that are classic , affordable and can be worn to various occasions .
This also speaks directly to the sustainable fashion movement , which focuses on classic pieces that the customer will want to hold on to for years instead of tossing out trendy clothing each season and contributing to more waste and less sustainability .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) -
For a growing number of oil traders , there ’s a new math at work in the traditional career calculus : why take the stress , long hours and uncertainty of a Wall Street job when the easy money is in physical trading ?
While investment banks and hedge funds nurse the painful wounds of constricted credit markets , lessened liquidity and more restrictive remuneration schemes , oil majors like BP BP.L and independent traders like Vitol are raking in record profits by filling up storage tanks or exploiting global arbitrage .
The shifting jobscape is causing at least some to reverse a career path that in the past would have begun at a global oil major , possibly pausing at an independent trading house on the way to a Goldman Sachs GS.N or Morgan Stanley MS.N seat .
“ Though it ’s not clear that corporations will be able to match the compensation that banks offer , I ’ve heard several people say that they are thinking hard about whether the work / life trade - off is worth it with reduced remuneration , ” said Andy Awad at Greenwich Associates , a consultancy that conducts annual studies of the Wall Street commodity trading sector .
While the flow is unlikely to become a torrent , it could bring about considerable change : oil companies and trading firms may find themselves better able to challenge the banks in the area of offering third - party risk management ; the banks may find themselves increasingly struggling to trade in physical markets , which have proven to be a cash cow this year .
In one regard oil companies and banks are already growing marginally more similar :
Many oil companies took more risk on their energy trading desks last year , while many of the biggest investment banks took less , according to corporate filings .
REVELLING IN CONTANGO
Fortunes have changed dramatically from a year ago .
U.S. banks now face a major overhaul of over - the - counter derivatives regulation that could crimp their free - wheeling style , while oil companies and trading houses are raking in windfall profits from the market ’s contango structure , in which low prompt prices and higher long - dated prices allow them to make money simply by storing oil in tankers or onshore .
Whether the roughly $ 500 million contango - related profit boost to BP ’s first - quarter earnings can be sustained is open to debate , but the British giant has been reinforcing its trading unit , which was pared sharply in recent years .
BP last month hired Henrik Wareborn -- who had run Lehman Brothers ’ European commodity trading team since 2005 -- as its new head of global crude trade , sources have said , digressing from the standard oil industry practice of promoting from within .

It also hired ex-Goldman energy marketer Priya Bhandari for its risk management arm , the website SparkSpread.com reported , and has hired Giovanni Serio , part of the Goldman Sachs research team , a trade source based in London said .
“ I ’m always interested in good people .
Given what ’s going on in the industry , some of these traders may see BP as a more attractive place , ” Timothy Bullock , chief operating officer for integrated oil supply and trading at BP , told Reuters last week when asked whether more bankers were seeking industry jobs .
Bankers have also moved to independent traders like Vitol , Trafigura or Hess , which operate with fewer restrictions , far less scrutiny and far more physical assets than most banks .
SHAKEN MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE
The biggest impact may be felt by Goldman and Morgan Stanley , which face their most serious challenge to decades of commodity trading dominance after the woes of last autumn , when they surrendered their investment bank status to survive .
Both lost market share in the business of hedging commodity prices for corporations last year to aggressive up and comers like JP Morgan JPM.N and BNP Paribas BNPP .
PA , according to a Greenwich Associates survey of 362 companies released in May .
But for the independent middlemen and cash rich corporations that deal more in supertankers and storage tanks than swaptions and dollar / commodity spreads , times have rarely been better .
While liquidity in derivatives markets has only now begun to recover from last year ’s collapse , traffic in the physical markets required to move crude oil from Nigeria to Houston , or diesel fuel from South Korea to Europe , barely missed a beat .
“ We have seen an immense movement of physical players from the financial markets into the physical markets , ” says Victor Peeke , director of recruitment firm Prime Energy Partnership .
This has emboldened oil companies to take a bit more risk , based on Value at Risk ( VaR ) metrics reported in the companies ’
20 - F SEC filings , a measure of how much money the trading desk could lose in a day , up to 95 percent or higher probability .
While an inexact measure that traders say can be highly subjective , the VaR figures show firms including Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Chevron CVX.N increased their risk .
For a graphic of VaR for banks and oil firms click :
VaR : here
By contrast , many banks pared the amount of money they wager on commodities last year , with the notable exception of a big increase at Goldman Sachs , according to their SEC filings .
But bankers making the move may be the exception rather than the rule , and the talent arbitrage window may not last for long .
Investment banks are rapidly finding their feet again , and competition for top talent remains fierce in a market that remains a relative bright spot compared with other asset classes .
“ I believe there is a window of opportunity at the moment before the U.S. banks hand back the government money and before the European banks get their risk appetite back , ” said Tom James , an independent consultant and long - time commodities risk management executive .
“ But the U.S. banks are handing money back faster than I expected , so there may only be another 12 months . ”
And not all companies will be ready to welcome them back .
“ We ’re getting calls almost every day , they ’re all looking to come back , ” said one senior trader with a major global oil firm , a sentiment echoed by several of his peers at other companies .
“ But for us , the culture clash means it ’s unlikely to work . ”
A federal judge yesterday found Usenet.com liable for just about every copyright infringement claim on the books : direct infringement , inducement of infringement , contributory infringement , and ( just for good measure ) vicarious infringement .
Not content to be loud and proud about its pro-pirate agenda , Usenet.com also resorted to stonewalling legal questionnaires , sending employees to Europe to avoid depositions , wiping hard drives , and failing to turn over e-mail after being sued in 2007 by the music labels .
The recording industry 's high - octane litigation campaign has on many occasions suffered from " poor targeting , " but it 's hard to see any complexities in this case .
When Usenet.com employees privately suggested that the service 's tag line should be " piracy , porno , and pictures — Usenet , " " Usenet is full of music and movies so get your pirate on ! , " or " Bless the Usenet and all that it steals ! , " it 's clear they knew why people were paying $ 4.95 to $ 18.95 a month for the privilege of accessing the newsgroups .
And not only did they know , they allegedly took steps to encourage the infringement .
What Usenet.com knew
Usenet.com is a commercial provider of access to the venerable Usenet newsgroups , the most highly - trafficked of which are " binaries " groups used to share music , movies , pictures , etc .
There was a time not so many years ago when most ISPs and college campuses provided full access to newsgroups ; as binary groups exploded in popularity and bandwidth , use soared and most cracked down , offering only a limited subset of groups or cutting off access altogether .
Those who wanted to turn newsgroups into a widespread file sharing mechanism had to resort to paid providers like Usenet.com .
Tinkering with the data was enough to show that the company could exert and was exerting control over the material on its servers , but Usenet.com never got to mount a vigorous DMCA safe harbor defense for an even simpler reason : the judge refused to allow it .
The service might sound a bit like Google — a service that merely provides access to legal and illegal content alike without discrimination or particular intent to traffic in copyright infringement .
But that was n't the case at Usenet.com , as the judge 's order indicates .
The Usenet.com marketing department tried to target young people who use file - sharing programs and convince them that Usenet.com was " a safe alternative to peer - to - peer file sharing programs they were getting shut down . "
The website " also had pages devoted to certain popular recording artists and expressly promoted the availability of ' free music ' and MP3 files for download . "
Usenet.com went so far as to insert meta tags into its website HTML that included terms like " warez " and " kazaa . "
When a subscriber called technical support after having trouble downloading copyrighted material , " employees did at times recite Defendants ' official policy against assisting with potentially infringing conduct , " but still " went on to assist the subscriber in any event . "
Usenet.com tutorials on how to use the service used infringing music files as examples .
Finally , Usenet.com performed its own customer survey which showed that 42 percent of its responding subscribers said the downloading music was a " primary " reason for signing up .
Dropping mines in your own safe harbor
It still might be argued ( and Usenet.com did try to argue ) that the entire enterprise operated like any user - generated content site .
That is , it was users ( and not Usenet.com ) there were uploading and downloading the infringing files in question in the lawsuit .
This principle , in fact , has been crucial to the growth of the Internet in the US over the last decade and is codified in in the law as a " safe harbor " under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
As we noted when the case first began , this was likely to be the major defense :
One potential roadblock for the RIAA 's latest lawsuit may come courtesy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
The DMCA 's Safe Harbor provision provides protection for ISPs from copyright infringement lawsuits as long as they take down offending material once they are served with a notice of infringement .
The biggest question in the trial is whether Usenet.com qualifies for Safe Harbor protection under the DMCA .
" Whether the Safe Harbor applies is the central legal question that is going to be raised , " EFF senior staff attorney Fred von Lohmann told Ars .
That failed in this case , however , for two reasons .
First , the judge noted that Usenet.com was not actually a " passive conduit " through which user information passed without filtering and without control .
Usenet.com " took active measures to create servers dedicated to MP3 files and to increase the retention times of newsgroups containing digital music files , " noted the judge in his order .
Usenet.com also took plenty of steps to control subscriber access to material , including automated filtering and human review to block pornography and block access to certain users .
That tinkering with the data was enough to show that the company could exert and was exerting control over the material on its servers , but Usenet.com never got to mount a vigorous DMCA safe harbor defense for an even simpler reason : the judge refused to allow it .
Safe harbor defense was disallowed after a repeated pattern of evidence spoliation and stonewalling from Usenet.com .
When the recording industry tried to do discovery in the case , it received little material .
Only after it tracked down a former employee and took testimony from her did the industry find out about all sorts of missing material .
A motion to compel production of this evidence was held in October 2008 , and for the first time Usenet.com lawyers admitted that they were " in possession of seven computer hard drives that had belonged to Defendants ' employees . "
Bad news , though — four of the hard drives had been wiped .
Later , the lawyers admitted that all seven hard drives had been wiped .
Why had they been wiped , and where had they come from ?
The story changed several times .
First , the drives had been found in storage after being purchased blank from eBay and never used .
Second , all hard drives had been pulled directly from active employee workstations back in June 2008 .
Third , the drives were wiped when they were upgraded to Windows Vista in early 2008 .
None of this made much sense to the judge , who pointed out that the drives had been " wiped " by special data - destroying programs , not simply had their files deleted , and that this had apparently happened in June 2008 , well after the litigation began .
The strange episode of the hard drives also fit with other oddities .
Usenet.com fired most of its employees during the lawsuit , then let them take their corporate computers home " without making certain that the material was preserved . "
Usenet.com sent some of its employees to Europe at corporate expense during the height of the discovery process , then allegedly " attempted to persuade employees to remain out of the jurisdiction for a longer period , illustrating one more in what appears to be a series of bad faith tactics . "
Two of the employees , after returning home , " allegedly evaded service , " and the Usenet.com boss " provided misleading information concerning these witnesses ' contact information and employment status . "
There 's more — much more — and the judge was n't pleased with any of it .
As a sanction , he barred Usenet.com from asserting an affirmative safe harbor defense at trial .
Without being able to mount that defense , Usenet.com had no real case to make , and the judge simply issued a summary judgment to the recording industry .
An injunction and damages award will be drawn up in the next few weeks .
Steven Marks , General Counsel for the RIAA , said in a statement this morning , " This decision is another example of courts recognizing the value of copyrighted music and taking action against companies and individuals who are engaging in wide scale infringement .
We hope that other bad actors who are engaging in similar activity will take note of this decisive opinion . "
First a Pilot Project with 500 Homes
“ Smart grid ” is the new big thing in the world of green , and despite some fuzziness on the definition of what a smart grid actually is , an update to our energy grid to make it “ smarter ” and more efficient is definitely overdue .
The city of Amsterdam is the latest to join the party with a new pilot program that will be managed by IBM and Cisco , along with the Dutch utility Nuon .
500 homes will be outfitted with energy management systems , including smart meters and energy monitors .
It is expected that the lucky people part of the pilot program will save on energy costs and reduce their CO2 emissions by “ at least 14 percent . ”
This should help Amsterdam reach its goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2025 .
IBM writes :
Through this project , IBM and Cisco aim to demonstrate how intelligence throughout the electrical grid can dramatically reduce outages and faults , improve responsiveness , handle current and future demand , increase efficiency and manage costs . [...]
“ Giving the citizens of Amsterdam more information and better control over their energy use will cut down on costs and consumption as well as reduce their overall impact on the environment , ” said Marthin de Beer , senior vice president of Cisco ’s Emerging Technologies Group .
“ Innovative cities like Amsterdam recognize the opportunity in using the standards - based intelligent communications network as a platform for economic development , better city management and improved quality of life for citizens .
With this pilot , we hope to demonstrate how smart and connected communities can be more energy conscious and more green . ”
Make Energy Consumption Something Visible
That ’s definitely the key thing ; empower people by giving them more information to make better informed choices .
To most people , energy consumption is invisible , and it is not always clear how their actions have an impact .
They think about energy only when times come to pay their bills , and even then it ’s not quite clear how that energy is used .
But give people clear information on the current electricity rate ( if time - of - use pricing is implemented , and it should since it helps smooth down peaks , reducing the need for new power plants to be built ) and which appliances in their homes are using the most energy , you create a feedback loop that nudges people in the right direction .
It ’s the same principle as the LCD screens showing MPG in hybrid cars ; they teach people how to drive more efficiently .
There ’s no reason the same ca n’t happen with home energy use .
Everybody wants a lower electricity bill , and most people would like to do something good for the environment .
Just give them the tools …

Heather ’s story is not one many Toronto cyclists may be used to hearing .
Although it begins with what is for many an all too common experience – having one ’s bike stolen – the tale finishes with a scene that would n’t seem out of place in a James Bond film or Tom Clancy novel .
Complete with an improvised set - up at the appropriately named ‘ Castle Frank ’ subway station , a team of undercover cops , nervous yet supportive friends and a tinted ‘ old - school ’ SUV , Heather ’s story is nothing short of spectacular .
It begins on the Friday night of the long weekend in May , while Heather was having a drink with friends at a bar in Kensington .
“ I had a feeling and I do n’t normally have that feeling , ” recalled Heather , who was anxious over her bike which she had parked outside to a post - and - ring .
“ It ’s a nice enough bike that I do n’t normally take it out at night , ” she explains , making it all the worse when , to her shock , she emerged from the bar only to find both her bike and lock nowhere to be found .
Hearing about her loss the following day , a friend jokingly searched Kijiji for a similar bike to Heather ’s .
He found one selling for $ 750 and light - heartedly sent her the link via Facebook .
Remarkably , her friend had actually stumbled upon Heather ’s stolen bike , identifiable not only by its make and colour , but by its loosened front brakes mentioned in the description – an adjustment Heather always makes to avoid going head over her heels in case she has to stop suddenly .
In disbelief , she called the number provided and arranged to meet with her potential bike thief for Tuesday .
Following the phone call , she filed a stolen bike report to a cop who , as Heather describes , was completely uninterested in her story and just wanted to take down her info and be done with it .
After giving the cop her purchasing order for the bike , its serial number and description , he referred her to the OPP whose jurisdiction includes online fraud .
The number led to a dead end , however , since not only was the office closed for the long weekend , but the line turned out to be for cases related to child pornography .
Understandably frustrated at the cop ’s apparent disinterest , she consulted with some friends and decided to just try confronting the potential thief on Tuesday with an offer of $ 100 along with several friends and photos to prove that it was indeed her bike .
Tuesday afternoon rolled around and sure enough , she got a call from her bike thief confirming their meeting that evening at six o’clock outside Castle Frank Station .
She quickly texted several friends to meet at Castle Frank and went on Facebook to print off some photos of her riding her bike .
By coincidence , the friend who had originally found the link to her stolen bike happened to be on Facebook chat , so upon seeing Heather online , he asked for an update on her stolen bike search .
Upon hearing that she was “ about to go get my bike back gangster style , ” her friend freaked , telling her about how there was an active bike mafia in Toronto and that her plan was a terrible idea .
Getting increasingly nervous , Heather decided to try the cops one more time .
It was now almost 5:45 and the clock was ticking .
After giving the police her information and being put on hold twice , she finally met with a voice on the other end of the line : “ Heather , is this Heather ?
We are going to get this bike back for you , do you trust us ? ”
She did , and after telling the cop her story he gave her these instructions : “ You ’re going to take the subway to Castle Frank Station ; you ’re going to go up the escalators ; you ’re going to go out the front doors ; on your right hand side is Bloor Street ; wait there .
Two unidentified police officers are going to approach you .
Do you understand ? ”
She did , and headed off to Castle Frank to the cheers of her coworkers , all of who were well aware of her coming rendezvous .
Just before Heather entered the subway , she remembered to text her friends – who were all converging on Castle Frank from all over the city – the new plan : “ Pretend u do n’t know me .
Cops involved . ”
Heather arrived at Castle Frank , went up the escalator , out the doors and to the right .
Looking around , she noticed a man conspicuously reading a newspaper nearby who turned out to be her boss .
He flashed a quick smile at her before quickly burying himself back in his paper .
On a grassy patch to her left lay a “ hippie ” – another friend of Heather ’s friends , she realized – who acted lost in thought , staring at the leaves hanging overhead .
Continuing to survey the spot , Heather noticed a couple sitting across the street wearing big sunglasses despite it not being a very sunny day .
Upon closer inspecting , she saw that they were her friends , pretending to make - out while keeping an eye on her .
Taking in the scene , her phone rang .
“ Private number , ” the screen read .
Answering it , she heard a deep voice say “ Heather , this is District 14 .
We ’re in a bit of a bind here .
Traffic is really heavy ; we ’re going to be a little late .
How are you holding up ? ”
Reassuring the cop that she was doing fine , Heather was told to wait and that , whatever she did , do n’t contact the bike thief .
All of a sudden , her bike appeared , ridden by a man Heather could only assume was the guy looking to meet her .
“ He rides up right next to me , ” she recalls , “ my bike is within arms length .
I could touch it if I wanted to . ”
Looking around , the man on her bike waited to see if anyone would respond , knowing a woman of Heather ’s age might be watching from nearby .
Heather looked away , giving him no response .
After a minute or two of waiting , the man biked across the street where he circled slowly , watching the street .
Moments later , a hefty and heavily tattooed man wearing a raggedy old outfit approached her : “ Hi there Heather , how ’re you doing there ? ”
It was a cop , Heather soon found out , and after telling him that her bike was across the street , he told her to wait there and hopped into an old - looking SUV with tinted windows and disappeared across the street .
After several minutes of waiting , her phone rang again .
It was the same cop , this time asking her to cross Bloor and go and sit on the very bench where her sunglasses - wearing friends were pretending to be making out .
Sitting down next to them as if they were strangers , the cop then told her to hop into another tinted SUV parked on the street .
The next thing she knew , the SUV took off around the corner , as her friends looked on in shock .
The SUV , it turns out , was full of more undercover cops who told her they were going to park the car and go to meet the bike thief who was already chatting to the first group of cops .
They left Heather in the parked SUV and disappeared around the corner .
A paddy - wagon drove by soon after and the next thing Heather knew , the cops had re-emerged from around the corner and were walking by towards her .
Casually rolling alongside on of them was her bike .
The thief had been arrested , she was told , and that – other than her still missing helmet – her bike was in perfect condition .
As Heather returned to Castle Frank reunited with her lost bike , her friends threw off their acts and came to congratulate her .
Speaking about her experience , Heather remarked afterwards how her attitude towards the police has changed .
“ Now every time I bike past a cop car , I say hi to them as my friends because I never thought they were fans of cyclists . ”
The cops also told her that they would be continuing to conduct more ‘ bike strikes ’ in the hopes that such strong responses to bike thefts will discourage larger operations like those of Igor Kenk .

The demand was one of the conditions set by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he backed the creation of a Palestinian state for the first time .
He also asked that a Palestinian state be demilitarised .
Palestinians have rejected the conditions .
The US has called Mr Netenyahu 's stance an " important step forward " .
The EU said Mr Netanyahu 's comments were a step in the right direction , but not enough to raise relations with Israel to a higher level .
Egypt was the first Arab state to recognise Israel and a key mediator in Middle East peace negotiations .
The vision which the Israeli prime minister presented ... is flawed and lacks many elements
Egyptian foreign ministry
Key excerpts of speech Send us your comments Mr Mubarak said on Monday that he had told Mr Netanyahu that peace talks should be resumed .
" I have also told him loud and clear that the call for recognising Israel as a Jewish state would complicate matters and abort the chances of peace , " the state - run Mena news agency quoted Mr Mubarak as telling military officials .
" I even warned him that this particular call would not be met by a favourable response from Egypt or beyond . "
The Egyptian foreign ministry said it would continue to support US and international peace efforts , but that " the vision which the Israeli prime minister presented ... is flawed and lacks many elements . "
Mr Mubarak was responding to Mr Netanyahu 's speech on Sunday in which he endorsed a Palestinian state for the first time .
Israeli Arabs ' fears
In the speech , weeks after US President Barack Obama urged him to agree a two - state plan , Mr Netanyahu said the Palestinians must accept Israel as a Jewish state .
He said a Palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
A Palestinian official has said the Israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two - state solution " paralysed " the peace process , while a Hamas spokesman in Gaza called on Arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards Israel .
BBC Arab Affairs analyst Magdi Abdelhadi says Palestinians suspect that Mr Netanyahu has moved the goal posts .

Recognising the Jewish nature of the Israel state would in effect mean that they will have to forgo one of their key demands : a negotiated settlement for the problem of the Palestinian refugees - those who either fled or were forced to leave their homes when Israel was established in 1948 .
He adds that Israel regards the return of refugees as tantamount to the destruction of Israel as a state with a Jewish majority .
But the issue of the Jewish nature of Israel is arguably far more objectionable to the Palestinians who live inside Israel , otherwise knows as Israeli Arabs , he says .
They are opposed to defining Israel as a Jewish state , because they fear that , in their eyes , such a move would make them into second class citizens not only de facto but also de jure .
In Israel , Mr Netanyahu 's words have drawn criticism from the left for not going far enough and from his own right - wing coalition for going too far .
A White House statement said Mr Obama believes a solution " can and must ensure both Israel 's security and the fulfilment of the Palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes Prime Minister Netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .

Once we thought the phone network was a “ natural ” monopoly .
But history proved otherwise .
Look beyond the electric grid ’s “ natural monopoly ” and look backwards at telecom deregulation and the internet to see how big the Smart Grid can be for America .
I want to cover my home ’s roof with solar cells that generate electricity .
I want a co-generation unit ( heat and power ) in my basement .
That sounds like the internet : freedom to plug in your own personal devices .
Today , we blog , upload videos to YouTube , FTP files to our websites and download music ( legally , of course ) .
We can buy a dot - com address and launch a website in an hour .
Bits of information flow in and out of our house driven by our media hunger or creativity .
If the electric grid was open and smart ( it is neither ) , we might all be creating a bit of power from our rooftops or our basements or we ’d sell a promise NOT to use power for an hour on a hot day .
But the grid is not designed to track and control thousands of small devices .
It only thinks big , ordering power plants to turn on and asking factories to turn off to avoid brownouts .
Like the phone network in 1983 , today ’s grid is closed , dumb and hostile to interconnection .
If geeks ran the power grid , we would buy photovoltaic systems by mail order from Dell and install them on our roof ( hopefully on the south side ) .
Sears would sell co-generation units to heat our homes in the winter and we ’d sell the excess power back to the grid in the summer .
On a July day , when air conditioning loads peaked , a smart grid with real - time pricing might turn off my water heater and air conditioner for fifteen minutes to free up power so downtown offices can stay cool .
In August of 2003 , 50 million people lost power because an Ohio utility did n’t trim the trees !
And a nuclear power plant in Florida went offline after a wire was severed .
In contrast , the internet was designed for war : nuclear war .
If Dallas were bombed , the internet would reroute .
The internet is very flat with no vulnerable points to shoot at .
There is no central management that can be knocked out by a missile or a tree .
By design , no one “ runs ” the internet because central management would have been a point of vulnerability .
Despite its military origins , the internet is open and so innovation is rampant .
Lay people ( and my teenager ) can easily add components .
It is a paradox that the internet ’s architects created a fault tolerant network to survive nuclear Armageddon , while power planners fostered a centralized network that would wither under the same assault .
The internet was created from scratch by engineers who were not protecting investments in generation .
When I was a kid in Scotland , I clung to the electric heater in the morning as the last bit of warmth faded .
Every house had a clock that turned off the heat at 7 AM .
Power was scarce .
Industry had priority during the day .
But today , a clock that could turn off your home appliances would be on the leading edge of the Smart Grid .
When this recession is over , the best source of power will be a smart grid that can shed loads as needed and can shunt wind power where it is needed .
Conservation ( “ demand side management ” in industry jargon ) is the lowest cost solution and it needs a smarter grid .
Smart grid and smart billing are also needed so we can get paid for our home - grown solar power .
You can bet that there wo n’t be many new jobs in Boston or the Bay area making the copper or towers for the power transmission lines that are a hot topic in Washington .
But “ building ” a software - and IQ - intensive smart grid ……… that is an opportunity that these tech growth regions understand .

Mushroom
Every so often I get an email asking me if the thing in the attached photo is a mushroom or a toadstool .
I want to say :
What the fuck does that even mean ?
But I do n't .
I just click " delete " and move on with my life .
" Mushroom " is n't a scientific term .
I once had a very good teacher who defined poetry as " any text someone asks you to consider as poetry . "
I 'm inclined to do more or less the same with " mushrooms . "
They are fungi , but they are definitely not all fungi ( a category that would include , for example , ring worm and the bluish mold that appears on your bread ) — so where you want to draw the " mushroom " line within the fungi is up to you .
That said , one good way of understanding mushrooms , I think , is to consider them as spore factories .
Most of the time , the fungal organism in question spends its time as vegetative mycelium , looking nothing like the " mushroom " thing we 're talking about .
But when the reproductive urge takes hold ( that 's called " personification " ) , the fungus produces a spore factory — a structure to make babies and send them out into the world .
Perhaps the organism designs a stem or a pseudostem , preparing to lift the spore - producing shop floor high enough so that the spores will easily catch air currents .
Perhaps a cup is created , or a cap , to hold the floor .
Asci or basidia , the actual spore - producing machines , are erected all across the floor .
Some organisms increase the factory capacity immensely by increasing the floor size with gills , false gills , or tubes .
Sometimes the factory adds safety features : veils are erected to cover and protect the machinery until the spores are ready .
As soon as the spores are released , the factory shuts down .
The " mushroom " wilts , decays , and eventually disappears .
But the organism itself continues , perhaps in the same place , if the mycelium has not run out of nutrients — or somewhere else , when spores land in just the right places , germinate , and develop into mycelia .
Pictured to the left is probably the most iconic " mushroom " in the world , Amanita muscaria var .
muscaria .
The Mario Kart mushroom .
The old - farm - woman - bending - over - in - her - polka - dotted - dress mushroom .
The hookah - smoking - caterpillar - Lewis - Carroll mushroom .
Amanita muscaria is one of the more complex and elaborate ( and beautiful ! ) spore factories ; it features a long stem , a universal veil to protect the construction of the factory , a partial veil to protect the spore - producing machinery , and the perfect timing required to raise the cap up and expand it to break the veils and release spores .

Meeting with Microsoft's Scott Austin to talk about Xbox Live , there was little expectation of sexy reveals or big news , and what we saw during the briefing was n't flashy in any way .
But there was still some really good news for Xbox 360 owners : Microsoft is getting set to update Xbox Live in a number of ways to make it easier to find and buy content .
The big news is that games will be priced in your local currency , and you 'll be able to buy with a credit card , bypassing the point system altogether .
That 's not all .
" We 're going to have 30 or more games launching in August , worldwide , in all markets .
We 'll also be adding new content in all of our markets weekly , " Austin explained .
This is the Games on Demand service that was announced after the Microsoft press conference : you 'll now be able to buy full - sized , big - name titles directly from Xbox Live and download them to your console .
Austin walked us through the process of buying a game through the service .
" What you 'll see here for the first time on the buy screen is we 'll be showing the price in the local currency , " he said , and there was something akin to a gasp in the room .
" And we 're going to allow people to purchase with a credit card . "
He points out that gamers will still have the choice to pay with Microsoft points , if they want .
The ability to see the real price of the game , and then to be able to pay directly with your credit card instead of buying a block of points is a huge step forward .
The licensing model for the Games on Demand purchases will also mirror that of Arcade games .
" We keep the license information on the Live servers , so the user who purchased it can roam to another console and play the game there . "
This also allows gamers to delete the entire game to free up hard drive space , and then redownload whenever they 'd like .
We 're told to expect pricing on the games to be comparable to what you would see at retail .
When asked about day and date releases with new games , there is no information .
" We have n't determined that , " Austin said .
That 's not a " no , " so there is a possibility that new games will be released both as a physical and digital product .
All this content has the potential to make finding quality games and add - ons more difficult .
Do n't worry , Microsoft has you covered .
" One thing that customers have been asking for is more information about games , " Austin said .
The New Xbox Experience offered expanded game pages , and that was nice , but moving forward you 'll get even more data , directly from the community .
" Especially for community games or game add - ons that do n't get a lot of coverage or reviews , " says Austin .
" So we 're introducing user ratings . "
All content in the marketplace this summer will be able to be rated , with an easy - to - use five - star scheme .
If you find a little - known game you love , rate it .
If you think a piece of content sucks , give it a single star .
You 'll also be able to organize data by these rankings , so you can look at Xbox Live Arcade games or game add - ons that are five - star rated , weeding out lower - quality releases .
This should make browsing through content much easier .
We were also shown a new marketplace for avatar clothing , so if you 'd like to buy a Halo - or Splinter Cell - themed shirt for your avatar , you will be able to do so .
If you want to give your avatar an RC mini-Warthog , it will cost you 320 Microsoft points , or $ 4 .
Games will also soon have the ability to give you awards , so your avatar can gain items by playing games .
That 's right : you 'll soon have awards to deal with on top of achievements .
Microsoft has many ways of making you feel like you 're earning things while playing the games .
The Avatar Marketplace notwithstanding , these additions and updates will go a long way to strengthen Xbox Live as a digital distribution platform .
The ability to buy full games without having to muck about with a point system simplifies things drastically .
Being able to rate content and games will give the community feedback about what 's worth buying , as well as show publishers what works and what does n't .
The ability to redownload purchased games or download them to a friend 's console is also user - friendly .
Microsoft wants your Xbox to be the best way of buying games , and these moves go a long way toward making that a reality .
The full list of SIGGRAPH 2009 talks is finally up here .
Talks ( formerly known as sketches ) are one of my favorite parts of SIGGRAPH .
They always have a lot of interesting techniques from film production ( CG animation and visual effects ) , many of which can be adapted for real - time rendering .
There are typically some research talks as well ; most are “ teasers ” for papers from recent or upcoming conferences , and some are of interest for real - time rendering .
This year , SIGGRAPH also has a few talks by game developers – hopefully next year will have even more .
Unfortunately , talks have the least documentation of all SIGGRAPH programs ( except perhaps panels ) – just a one page abstract is published , so if you did n’t attend the talk you are usually out of luck .
The Cameras and Imaging talk session has a talk on the cameras used in Pixar ‘s “ Up ” which may be relevant to developers of games with scripted cameras ( such as God of War ) .
From Indie Jams to Professional Pipelines has two good game development talks : Houdini in a Games Pipeline by Paulus Bannink of Guerilla Games discusses how Houdini was used for procedural modeling in the development of Killzone 2 .
Although this type of procedural modeling is fairly common in films , it is not typically employed in game development .
This is of particular interest since most developers are looking for ways to increase the productivity of their artists .
In the talk Spore API : Accessing a Unique Database of Player Creativity Shodhan Shalin , Dan Moskowitz and Michael Twardos discuss how the Spore team exposed a huge database of player - created assets to external applications via a public API .
The Splashing in Pipelines talk session has a talk by Ken Museth of Digital Domain about DB - Grid , an interesting data structure for volumetric effects ; a GPU implementation of this could possibly be useful for real - time effects .
Another talk from this session , Underground Cave Sequence for “ Land of the Lost ” sounds like the kind of film talk which often has nuggets which can be adapted to real - time use .
Making it Move has another game development talk , Fight Night 4 : Physics - Driven Animation and Visuals by Frank Vitz and Georges Taorres from Electronic Arts .
Fight Night 4 is a game with extremely realistic visuals ; the physics - based animation system described here is sure to be of interest to many game developers .
The talk about rigging the “ Bob ” character from Monsters vs .
Aliens also sounds interesting ; the technical challenges behind the rig of such an amorphous – yet engaging – character must have been considerable .
Partly Cloudy was the short film accompanying Pixar ’s 10th feature film , Up. Like all of Pixar ’s short films , Partly Cloudy was a creative and technical triumph .
The talk by the director , Peter Sohn , also includes a screening of the film .
Although film characters have more complex models , rigs , and shaders than game characters , there are many similarities in how a character translates from initial concept to the ( big or small ) screen .
The session Taking Care of Your Pet has two talks discussing this process for characters from the movie Up .
There is also a session dedicated to Character Animation and Rigging which may be of interest for similar reasons .
Another game development talk can be found in the Painterly Lighting session ; Radially Symmetric Reflection Maps by Jonathan Stone of Double Fine Productions describes an intriguing twist on prefiltered environment maps used in the game Brutal Legend .
The two talks on stylized rendering methods ( Applying Painterly Concepts in a CG Film and Painting with Polygons ) also look interesting ; the first of these discusses techniques used in the movie Bolt .
Real - time rendering has long used techniques borrowed from film rendering .
One way in which the field has “ given back ” is the increasing adoption of real - time pre-visualization techniques in film production .
In this talk , Steve Sullivan and Michael Sanders from Industrial Light & Magic discuss various film visualization techniques .
The session Two Bolts and a Button has two film lighting talks that look interesting ; one on HDRI - mapped area lights in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , and one on lighting effects with point clouds in Bolt .
The Capture and Display session has two research talks from Paul Debevec ’s group .
As you would expect , they both deal with acquisition of computer models from real - world objects .
One discusses tracking correspondences between facial expressions to aid in 2D parametrization ( UV mapping ) , the other describes a method for capturing per-pixel specular roughness parameters ( e.g. Phong cosine power ) and is more fully described in an EGSR 2009 paper .
Given the high cost of creating realistic and detailed art assets for games , model acquisition is important for game development and likely to become more so .
Flower is the second game from thatgamecompany ( not a placeholder ; that ’s their real name ) , the creators of Flow .
Flower is visually stunning and thematically unusual ; the talk describing the creation of its impressionistic rendering style will be of interest to many .
Flower was one of two games selected for the new real - time rendering section of the Computer Animation Festival ’s Evening Theater ( which used to be called the Electronic Theater and was sorely missed when it was skipped at last year ’s SIGGRAPH ) .
Fight Night 4 was the other ; these two are accompanied by real - time rendering demonstrations from AMD and Soka University .
Several other games and real - time demos were selected for other parts of the Computer Animation Festival , including Epic Games ‘ Gears of War 2 and Disney Interactive ‘s Split Second .
These are demonstrated ( and discussed ) by some of their creators in the Real Time Live talk session .
The Effects Omelette session has been presented at SIGGRAPH for a few years running ; it traditionally has interesting film visual effects work .
This year two of the talks look interesting for game developers : one on designing the character ’s clothing in Up , and one on a modular pipeline used to collapse the Eiffel Tower in G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra .
Although most of the game content at SIGGRAPH is targeted at programmers and artists , there is at least one talk of interest to game designers : in Building Story in Games : No Cut Scenes Required Danny Bilson from THQ and Bob Nicoll from Electronic
Arts discuss how interactive entertainment can be used to tell a story .
As one would expect , the Rendering session has at least one talk of interest to readers of this blog .
Multi-Layer , Dual - Resolution Screen - Space Ambient Occlusion by Louis Bavoil and Miguel Sainz of NVIDIA uses multiple depth layers and resolutions to improve SSAO .
Although not directly relevant to real - time rendering , I am also interested in the talk Practical Uses of a Ray Tracer for “ Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs ” by Karl Herbst and Danny Dimian from Sony Pictures Imageworks .
For years , animation and VFX houses used rasterization - based renderers almost exclusively ( Blue Sky Studios , creators of the Ice Age series , being a notable exception ) .
Recently , Sony Pictures Imageworks licensed the Arnold ray - tracing renderer and switched to using it for features ; Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is the first result .
Another talk from this session I think is interesting : Rendering Volumes With Microvoxels by Andrew Clinton and Mark Elendt from Side Effects Software , makers of the procedural modeling tool Houdini .
The micropolygon - based REYES rendering system ( on which Pixar ’s Photorealistic Renderman is based ) has fascinated me for some time ; this talk discusses how to add microvoxels to this engine to render volumetric effects .
Above , I mentioned previsualization as one case where film rendering is informed by game rendering .
A more direct example is shown in the talk Making a Feature - Length Animated Movie With a Game Engine ( by Alexis Casas , Pierre Augeard and Ali Hamdan from Delacave ) , in the Doing it with Game Engines session ( which I am chairing ) .
They actually used a game engine to render their film , using it not as a real - time renderer , but as a very fast renderer enabling rapid art iteration times .
All of the talks in the Real Fast Rendering session are on the topic of real - time rendering , and are worth attending .
One of these is by game developers : Normal Mapping With Low - Frequency Precomputed Visibility by Michal Iwanicki of CD Projekt RED and Peter - Pike Sloan of Disney Interactive Studios describes an interesting PRT - like technique which encodes precomputed visibility in spherical harmonics .
Finally , the Rendering and Visualization session has a particularly interesting talk : Beyond Triangles : GigaVoxels Effects
In Video Games by Cyril Crassin , Fabrice Neyret and Sylvain Lefebvre from INRIA , Miguel Sainz from NVIDIA and Elmar Eisemann from MPI Informatik .
Ray - casting into large voxel databases has aroused interest in the field since John Carmack made some intriguing comments on the topic ( further borne out by Jon Olick ’s presentation at SIGGRAPH last year ) .
The speakers at this talk have shown interesting work at I3D this year , and I look forward to seeing their latest advances .

Glenn Beck was on The View today , where after being called out on a story he used on his radio show involving meeting Whoopi Goldberg and Barbara Walters on a train , he admitted that he does n’t check facts .
Beck said that he is not a journalist .
He is a commentator on life .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Beck got called out on his lie , and Barbara Walters said , “ You are an investigative reporter . ”
Beck said , “ No , I am not . ”
She said , “ You are a reporter . ”
Beck said , “ No , I am not . ”
She asked , “ So , you check no facts at all ? ”
Beck said , “ No , I am a commentator .
I commentate on life . ”
Barbara Walters then asked Beck numerous times if he checks his facts , and he would n’t answer her question .

Glenn Beck learned a valuable lesson today .
He should never go on The View if Barbara Walters , who in a previous professional life was a serious journalist , is on the show .
You can tell that her mind was blown by the idea that Beck has millions of viewers and listeners , but checks no facts .
This is how television news has changed .
Twenty years ago , Beck would not have gotten a job in television news without basic journalism skills .
It is not that hard to have both strong opinions and check facts .
However , it is difficult to find a media figure on the right who actually uses facts instead of bluster and personality .
People like George Will , and the late William F. Buckley do n’t exist in any numbers in conservative media .
Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh have replaced serious conservative conversation .
On the left , there are still people like Bill Moyers willing to intelligently discuss issues , but there is no equivalent on the right except for the above mentioned Will .
Since Glenn
Beck does n’t bother to fact check , this is why millions of people should not rely on him as a valid source of information .
Beck has said in a number of interviews that he views himself as an entertainer , but too many people take his show for fact .
I wish that I could say that was a problem limited to just a few people , but in cable news today , confrontation has replaced information , because arguments sell more ad time .
Update : :
Beck blames illness , but says The View interview was ridiculous :
In the previous post we reviewed Hans Zantema ’s algorithm for solving longest segment problems with suffix and overlap - closed predicates .
For predicates that are not overlap - closed , Zantema derived a so - called “ windowing ” technique , which will be the topic of this post .
A brief review : the longest segment problem takes the form :
max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs
where segs :: [ a ] → [ [ a ] ] , defined by segs = concat ∘ map inits ∘ tails returns all consecutive segments of the input list ; p ◁ is an abbreviation for filter p , and max# :: [ [ a ] ] → [ a ] returns the longest list from the input list of lists .
In words , the task is to compute the longest consecutive segment of the input that satisfies predicate p .
A predicate p is suffix - closed if p ( xs ⧺ ys ) ⇒ p ys .
For suffix - closed p , Zantema proposed a technique that , from a high - level point of view , looks just like the right solution to such problems .
We scan through the input list using a foldr from the right to the left , during which we try to maintain the longest segment satisfying p so far .
Also , we keep a prefix of the list that is as long as the currently longest segment , which we call the window .
If , when we move one element to the right , the window ( now one element longer than the currently longest segment ) happens to satisfy p , it becomes the new optimal solution .
Otherwise we drop the right - most element of the window so that it slides leftwards , retaining the length .
Notice that it implies that we ’d better represent the window using a queue , so we can efficiently add elements from the left and drop from the right .
Derivation of the algorithm is a typical case of tupling .
Tupling
Given a function h , we attempt to compute it efficiently by turning it into a foldr .
It would be possible if the value of the inductive case h ( x : xs ) were determined solely by x and h xs , that is :
h ( x : xs ) = f x ( h xs )
for some f .
With some investigation , however , it would turn out that h ( x : xs ) also depends on some g :
h ( x : xs ) = f x ( g ( x : xs ) ) ( h xs )
Therefore , we instead try to construct their split ⟨ h , g ⟩ as a fold , where the split is defined by :
⟨ h , g ⟩ xs = ( h xs , g xs )
and h = fst .
⟨ h , g ⟩ .
If ⟨ h , g ⟩ is indeed a fold , it should scan through the list and construct a pair of a h - value and a g -value .
To make it feasible , it is then hoped that g ( x : xs ) can be determined by g xs and h xs .
Otherwise , we may have to repeat the process again , making the fold return a triple .
Segment / Prefix Decomposition
Let us look into the longest segment problem .
For suffix - closed p it is reasonable to assume that p [ ] is true — otherwise p would be false everywhere .
Therefore , for the base case we have max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ [ ] = [ ] .
We denote function application by ▪ to avoid too many parentheses .
Now the inductive case .
It is not hard to derive an alternative definition of segs :
segs [ ] = [ [ ] ] segs ( x : xs ) = inits ( x:xs ) ⧺ segs xs
therefore , we derive :
max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) = max# ∘ p ◁ ▪ ( inits ( x : xs ) ⧺ segs xs ) = ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : xs ) ) ↑# ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs )
where xs ↑# ys returns the longer one between xs and ys .
It suggests that we maintain , by a foldr , a pair containing the longest segment and the longest prefix satisfying p ( that is , max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ) .
It is then hoped that max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : xs ) can be computed using max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ xs .
And luckily , it is indeed the case , implied by the following proposition proved in an earlier post :
Proposition 1 : If p is suffix - closed , we have : p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : xs ) = finits ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ xs ) where finits ys = p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : ys ) .
Proposition 1 says that the list ( or set ) of all the prefixes of x : xs that satisfies p can be computed by the longest prefix of xs ( call it ys ) satisfying p , provided that p is suffix - closed .
A naive way to do so is simply by computing all the prefixes of x : ys and do the filtering again , as is done in finits .
This was the route taken in the previous post .
It would turn out , however , to come up with an efficient implementation of f we need some more properties from p , such as that it is also overlap - closed .
The “ Window ”
Proposition 1 can be strengthened : to compute all the prefixes of x : xs that satisfies p using finits we do not strictly have to start with ys .
Any prefix of xs longer than ys will do .
Proposition 2 : If p is suffix - closed , we have : p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : xs ) = finits ( take i xs ) where finits ys = p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : ys ) , and i ≥ length ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ xs .
In particular , we may choose i to be the length of the longest segment :
Lemma 1 : length ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs ≥ length ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ xs
Appealing to intuition , Lemma 1 is true because segs xs is a superset of inits xs .
Remark : Zantema proved Proposition 1 by contradiction .
The purpose of an earlier post was to give a constructive proof of Proposition 1 , which was considerably harder than I expected .
I ’d be interested to see a constructive proof of Proposition 2 .
Now we resume the reasoning :
max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) = max# ∘ p ◁ ▪ ( inits ( x : xs ) ⧺ segs xs ) = ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : xs ) ) ↑# ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs ) = { Proposition 2 and Lemma 1 } let s = max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs in ( max # ∘ finits ▪ ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ) ↑# s
Define window xs = take ( length ∘ max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs ) xs , the reasoning above suggest that we may try the following tupling :
max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs = fst ∘ ⟨ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs , window ⟩
Maintaining the Longest Segment and the Window
The task now is to express ⟨ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs , window ⟩ as a foldr .
We can do so only if both max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) and window ( x : xs ) can be determined by max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs and window xs .
Let us see whether it is the case .
Maintaining the Longest Segment
Regarding max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) , we have derived :
max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) = { as shown above , let s = max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs } ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ) ↑# s
Let s = max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ xs .
We consider two cases :
Case p ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) .
We reason : ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ) ↑# s = { see below } ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ↑# s = { since the LHS is one element longer than the RHS } x : take ( length s ) xs = { definition of window } x : window xs
The first step is correct because , for all zs , p zs implies that max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ zs = zs .
Case ¬ p ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) .
In this case ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ) ↑# s must be s , since ¬ p zs implies that length∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ zs < length zs .
Maintaining the Window
Now consider the window .
Also , we do a case analysis :
Case p ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) .
We reason : window ( x : xs ) = take ( length ∘ max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) ) ( x : xs ) = { by the reasoning above } take ( length ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) ) ( x : xs ) = { take and length } x : take ( length ( take ( length s ) ) xs ) xs = { take and length } x : take ( length s ) xs = x : window xs Case ¬ p ( x : take ( length s ) xs ) .
We reason : window ( x : xs ) = take ( length ∘ max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs ▪ ( x : xs ) ) ( x : xs ) = { by the reasoning above } take ( length s ) ( x : xs ) = { take and length } x : take ( length ( s - 1 ) ) xs = x : init ( window xs )
The Algorithm
In summary , the reasoning above shows that
⟨ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs , window ⟩ = foldr step ( [ ] , [ ] )
where step is given by
step x ( s , w ) | p ( x : w ) = ( x : w , x : w ) | otherwise = ( s , x : init w )
As is typical of many program derivations , after much work we deliver an algorithm that appears to be rather simple .
The key invariants that made the algorithm correct , such as that s is the optimal segment and that w is as long as s , are all left implicit .
It would be hard to prove the correctness of the algorithm without these clues .
We are not quite done yet .
The window w had better be implemented using a queue , so that init w can be performed efficiently .
The algorithm then runs in time linear to the length of the input list , provided that p ( x : w ) can be performed in constant time -- which is usually not the case for interesting predicates .
We may then again tuple the fold with some information that helps to compute p efficiently .
But I shall stop here .

The Oscar - winning composer of the sickly sweet " You Light Up My Life " is actually , prosecutors say , a dirty old serial rapist monster .
We should have known .
Joseph Brooks won the Oscar for " Best Song " in 1977 , and proceeded to use that credential to help him lure starry - eyed young women to his apartment , where he got them drunk and raped them under the guise of " auditioning " them for a part that would launch their careers .
He was allegedly assisted by his " 42 - year - old female personal assistant , Shawni Lucier " — when you add the " F , " that spells Lucifer !
The pair would put ads on Craigslist and talent sites saying that an award - winning composer was looking for a pretty 18 - 22 year old girl to help with her career .
In reality , cops say , Brooks had the rapes meticulously planned out .
Brooks primarily targeted victims from Washington state and Oregon — including former " American Idol " contestant Loretta Spruell , of Seattle — so they would be tired from traveling by the time they arrived in New York , authorities said .
He allegedly hoped that would leave them without the energy to put up a fight .
Lucifer the assistant would pick the girls up at the airport , reassure them , and drive them over to Brooks ' place , where he would spring his trap :
Once Brooks had his prey inside his apartment , he used the oldest trick in the book , cops said .
He allegedly told the women they were trying out for the role of a prostitute , and the scene they were depicting involved drinking glasses of wine " repeatedly and quickly . " ...
Brooks then turned into a monster , urging them to take off their clothes and ultimately forcing himself on them , authorities said .
Brooks is facing 82 counts of rape , sexual assault , and other charges , and he says he 's innocent .
Anyone who could make that song is predictably despicable .

OTTAWA – At the time it was hailed as groundbreaking .
Fill out a one - page form , pay a $ 5 fee and Canadians had the right to ask for any federal government record .
The introduction of the Access to Information Act in 1983 put Canada on the cutting edge .
" We were amongst the leaders in the world , " says Robert Marleau , the federal information commissioner .
But the leader has become the laggard after 26 years of " static decline , " Marleau says .
" Since then it 's been the same song and dance , no effort by any government to have this legislation or these processes keep pace with time , change and technology , " he said in an interview .
Today , the access to information system is collapsing from a combination of neglect and bureaucrats foiling citizens ' right to know through foot - dragging and fees .
The tale of what 's happened to the Access to Information
Act is just as easily the story of Canadian democracy in recent decades as benign neglect , calculated power grabs and public apathy erode principles and institutions .
Power is being concentrated in the Prime Minister 's Office .
MPs , for years mere props in the production , are now more useful to their leaders as partisan attack dogs .
They preach accountability but hide their expenses .
Cabinet ministers are also becoming increasingly sidelined and more government business than ever is being done in the dark , far from the prying eyes of Canadian voters .
Canadians who are fighting to stay engaged in the process increasingly feel their elected officials no longer represent their interests .
More importantly , more and more Canadians are tuning out .
That lack of outrage merely allows elected officials to avoid the transparency that the system was supposed to demand .
" Our national political and administrative institutions are not in good shape , " political scientist Donald Savoie says .
" We got there by being complacent , by not focusing on the real important things .
We 're focusing on the message of the day ... not on the real fundamental functioning of our institutions .
" I 'm not optimistic .
I think we 've thrown fundamental policy debates out the window . ''
For a nation that has had three general elections in less than five years – and teetered on the brink of yet another last week – the idea that democracy is on the decline may seem odd .
But even elections drive home the concern .
Voter turnout in federal elections , especially among the young , is dropping , from 75 per cent in 1979 to 58 per cent in last October 's election .
" Young people are disturbed by the diminishing role of the member of Parliament .
Party discipline ... has eliminated the freedom of the member of Parliament to express his or her views or to represent the constituency as it ought to be represented , " former Prime Minister John Turner told a session during the Liberals ' spring convention .
Fixing the problem will require a prime minister who seeks less power , not more , and more assertive MPs willing to stand up for their constituents , rather than their parties .
And citizens must reclaim their voices in the political process .
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN overnight .
Instead , this trend has been in the works over decades with both Progressive Conservatives and Liberals in government , though many observers agree that the worrisome trends have accelerated since Prime Minister Stephen Harper took power in 2006 .
University of Toronto political science professor Lorraine Weinrib charges that Harper has an " extended track record " of showing disdain for the principles and practices at the heart of Canada 's constitutional system .
" While Harper touts the democratic principle as his ideal , his actions align with another principle – an all - powerful executive authority that makes his own rules , " she writes in an essay for a book titled Parliament Democracy in Crisis .
She notes how the Conservatives cancelled the court challenges program , which provided funding for court challenges by rights advocates .
Harper himself has challenged the non-partisan officers of Parliament , such as the head of Elections Canada and the ethics commissioner .
Savoie , a long - time observer of parliamentary traditions in both Canada and Britain , bemoans the shift of power away from MPs and cabinet members to non-elected advisers around the PM .
" We now know that cabinet has been disempowered , " said Savoie , who holds the Canada Research Chair in Public Administration and Governance at the Université de Moncton .

" Power and influence in Ottawa is centred around court government , around the Prime Minister , around lobbyists , around spin doctors and our democracy has been bastardized , if you like , by lobbyists who only have one interest – their self - interest , " he says .
Liberal MP
Bob Rae has the perspective of someone who served in Parliament from 1978 to 1982 , left for provincial politics and now has returned to Ottawa .
He says debates at committees and in the Commons these days are " ritualistic , " as if MPs are merely going through the paces .
" This is the least populist , the most centralized , the most disciplined approach to government that I 've seen in a long time , " Rae said .
In his mind , reversing that trend will require MPs to flex their collective muscle and return power back to Parliament , though he 's not confident that will happen .
" I 'm not sure we 've got the willingness right now on the part of enough people who are in Parliament to really address it , " Rae said .
" It 's almost as if you need a prime minister who is prepared to say ' I actually want less power . '
A prime minister who said , ' We need to restore how Parliament is supposed to work , ' " Rae said .
Add to that mix a batch of rookie MPs – 205 have been there less than five years – with little institutional memory of Ottawa , little respect for their political rivals , and reluctant to flex their political muscle against their party leaders .
" That is a problem .
They come in and think that all this yelling and hollering is the way it should work , " Progressive Conservative Senator Lowell Murray said .
WHILE OTTAWA is seen as ground zero , the roots of the problem are found across the country among everyday citizens .
In short , look in the mirror .
Marleau complains Canadians know too little about the institutions that govern them .
He points to last fall 's parliamentary showdown as proof when the notion of the Liberal - NDP coalition was dismissed as " unconstitutional . "
The coalition may have been politically unpalatable .
But it was perfectly legal under Canada 's parliamentary system .
And yet complaints about the coalition as a " coup " found a ready audience among Canadians , something Marleau finds worrisome .
" We do not do a good job in Canada about teaching and learning about our basic institutions . "

ISRAELI Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a U.S. demand to suspend plans to build more homes for Jews in East Jerusalem saying he would not take orders over Israeli settlement in the disputed area .
New friction with Washington over the project to build 20 apartments in a part of Jerusalem captured by Israel in a 1967 war could deepen the most serious rift in relations between the two allies in a decade .
Israeli officials said the State Department had summoned Michael Oren , Israel 's ambassador to Washington , and told him plans for the construction approved this month by Israel 's Jerusalem municipality should be suspended .
" We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and buy ( homes ) anywhere in Jerusalem , " Mr Netanyahu said , calling the city Israel 's united capital , a claim that is not recognised internationally .
" I can only imagine what would happen if someone would suggest Jews could not live in certain neighbourhoods of New York , London , Paris or Rome .
There would certainly be a great international outcry , " he said at the weekly cabinet meeting .
" We cannot accept this edict in Jerusalem . "
The White House declined to comment .
Mr Netanyahu and President Barack Obama are already at loggerheads over the U.S. leader 's call for Israel to freeze Jewish settlement on occupied land Palestinians want for a state .
Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , due back in the region soon , and Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak have been trying to work out a settlement deal that would include initial steps by Arab countries to normalise relations with Israel .
But constraints on Jewish settlement in Jerusalem could put a heavy strain on Mr Netanyahu 's coalition , in which the future of the holy city is a red - flag issue for Jewish religious and ultranationalist partners .
Responding to Mr Netanyahu 's comments , Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said the Israeli leader had to realise that " settlements and peace are two parallels that do not go together " .
Abandoned Hotel
Israel annexed East Jerusalem and declared all of the city its capital after the 1967 war .
Palestinians say Jewish settlement on occupied land could deny them a viable state .
The housing project is within a compound in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood where the now - defunct Shepherd Hotel stands .
It was bought in 1985 by an American Jewish millionaire who has been funding Jewish housing projects in East Jerusalem .
Israel 's Jerusalem municipality said its planning committee , acting in " full transparency " , gave approval for the 20 apartments and pledged to preserve " the historic structure " at the site .
Palestinians have questioned the legality of the acquisition , saying the compound had belonged to the former grand mufti , the leading Muslim cleric in Jerusalem , Haj Amin al - Husseini .
He went into exile in 1937 and died in 1974 .
Israel designated the plot as " absentee property " after the 1967 war .

Perhaps the real reason Dick Cheney emerged from his eight years in an undisclosed location ?
With his sustained blitz of television appearances and speeches , former Vice President Dick Cheney has established himself as perhaps the leading Republican voice against President Obama .
Not a bad time , then , to be in the market for a multimillion - dollar book contract .
Mr. Cheney is actively shopping a memoir about his life in politics and service in four presidential administrations ...
It makes sense .
Why would Cheney care about salvaging his or George Bush 's legacy ?
After all , when told that two - thirds of the American people did n't think the war in Iraq was worth fighting , his one word response was , " So ? "
He does n't give a rat 's ass what anyone thinks about the Bush / Cheney administration .
A multimillion - dollar book deal ?
Now that 's something he 's willing to fight for .
These Senators have sent a letter to Senate leadership , saying :
We appreciate the work that has been done by Seantors on the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions and Finance committees , but in the view of [ CBO Budget Director Elmendorf's ] statement , there is much heavy lifting ahead .
We support the efforts of Finance Committee members to produce a bipartisan bill , despite calls from both sides of the aisle to rush forward quickly or delay indefinitely .
While we are committed to providing relief for American families as quickly as possible , we believe taking additional time to achieve a bipartisan result is crucial for legislation that affects 17 percent of our economy and every individual in the U.S .
We look forward to working with you to develop legislation that is vital to the well - being of the American people and urge you to resist timelines which prevent us from achieving the best result .
While they say this delay is in the best interests of the American people , the facts say otherwise .
There is a real human cost , here in Maine and nationally , for every day we without health care reform .
And there is no logical reason for the delay .
The House of Representatives is almost done marking up a health reform bill that has the support of a wide coalition , including the American Medical Association .
The HELP Committee has passed a health reform bill that lowers costs for Americans and gives us a choice of our private health insurance or a public health insurance option .
The President is deploying all of his resources to pass these historic reforms .
And the Senate Finance committee , where Senators Snowe and Collins serve , has been working on health care reform since January , a full six months .
Why is more time needed ?
As Senators Snowe and Collins ' letter stated , the Senate Finance Committee has been unable to come to a bipartisan deal on health reform , because Republicans have been reluctant to join Democrats in supporting health reform that helps the American people .
This is not a reason to delay reform any longer .
It is more important that we get health reform that gives us quality , affordable health care for all than getting health reform a few Republicans can support .
It is their choice whether to join us in passing historic reform Mainers need so desperately .

It was last Friday .
I had just gotten up from a SWEET game of Warcraft on my PC .
Anyway , I realized I was dangerously low on Mountain Dew , so I threw on my lucky green sweat pants and my trenchcoat to walk 3 blocks to the convenience store .
I figured if I had enough change , I might even pick up some Slim Jims , but I digress ...
On my way back to my apartment , Dew and Slim Jims in hand , I saw you and your friends walking into the Jazz club across the street .
You seemed so comfortable and cool dressed to the nines for an evening of drinks and dancing with those closest to you .
It was then that I knew I had to meet you .
Although I had never been in that particular establishment , I followed you in .
You probably would have seen me , but I was slowed by an argument with the doorman over my attire .
After a few minutes , I think I had him convinced I looked ok , but then he proceeded to ask me for $ 10 just to walk into the bar .
I could n't believe they wanted to charge me just to get in .
I , of course had no money , having spent every spare cent on caffeine and sticks of processed beef .
I walked back to the convenience store and failed in my effort to return the goods I had so recently purchased .
Luckily , the store had an ATM , so I pleaded with the checker to hold my purchases behind the counter for a short time , and I withdrew $ 20 from the cash machine .
Armed with my fresh $ 20 bill , I marched to the Jazz Club , paid the $ 10 cover , and went looking for the woman of my dreams .
I saw you immediately , near the bar with your friends .
You were at the end of the group with some space next to you , so I settled in close .
You noticed me once or twice as I cleared my throat nervously trying to think of what to say .
It sounded like you may have commented on my trenchcoat to one of your friends , but I could n’t be sure .
I finally bumped you to get your attention .
I may have bumped to hard as I noticed you spilled some of your drink on your shirt .
Sorry about that .
ME : So ...
Do you come here often ?
YOU : No. ( you turn back to your friends ) ME : Me neither .
I hate bars .
I can't come to terms with why anyone would want to pay such high margins on watered down drinks they could make at home for a fraction of the cost ...
( I trail off noticing you are n't listening ) I regroup and lean in close to your ear ... ME : What are you drinking there ?
YOU : ( barely looking over your should back to me ) A gin and tonic .
ME : Can I buy you one ?
YOU : I already have one , see ... ( you hold up your drink sarcastically ) ME : Well then , can I reimburse you for the one you are drinking ?
YOU : What ?
( looking at me now ) ME : Let me pay you back for that one .
YOU : Whatever .
( looking puzzled and annoyed ) ME : How much was it ?
YOU : What ?
ME : How much is a gin and tonic ?
YOU : Five dollarsME : Jesus Christ !
What fool pays $ 5 for a freakin’ drink ?
That 's robbery !!!
YOU : Get away from me .
ME : ( embarrassed by my outburst )
No , no , no .
I said I 'd pay you for it , so I will .
( reaching in my pocket )
Do you have change for a $ 10 ?
You : What ?
ME : I only have a ten dollar bill ?
Do you have five dollars change ?
YOU : ( turning to face me completely and folding your arms as your friends quiet down to watch our interaction )
Actually , this drink was $ 6 with tip .
ME : What ?
YOU : My drink .
It was $ 5 plus $ 1 for tip !
ME : Damn , this is getting expensive .
Ok , do you have $ 4 change for my $ 10 .
YOU : No .
ME : Well , then I 'll have to get change from the bartender .
YOU : Do n't bother .
Leave me alone .
( you turn back to your friends as they erupt in laughter ) I spend 10 mintues trying to get the bartender 's attention .
I can't blame him much because he was very busy serving so many other morons begging to be robbed of their hard earned dollars .
When he finally gets to me , he tells me he wo n't give me change , but I can buy a drink and will get change from that .
I tell him I would n't dream of paying such inflated prices for frozen water and a few drops of our country ’s last legal poison …
He goes on to the next patron .
Frustrated , I go to the bathroom to pee and think about my next move .
I ’m pretty sure if I can just pay you for that drink that we will soon be making hot monkey love back at my apartment .
However , I am disappointed at how much dating is already costing me , and how many obstacles one must overcome to simply buy a girl a drink .
I start to plan my speech to you about how I may have jumped into this relationship too quickly , and that maybe we should just be friends .
While washing my hands in the sink , I notice there ’s a bathroom attendant .
He is smiling and waiting with fresh paper towels for me .
Next to him is his tray of tips stacked with dollar bills .
I drop my ten dollar bill on the tray , as the attendants smile widens .
Then , I pick up a pile of ones and begin counting them .
The bathroom attendant gets very hostile and grabs the cash from my hand .
I wrestle with him over the wad of cash .
One of the bouncers must have been just outside the bathroom .
I was sure that he would understand my story , and we could get everything sorted out .
Boy was I wrong .
He did n’t want to hear anything .
He just grabbed me by my trench coat and ripped me out the bathroom door and toward the exit .
I yelled “ I LOVE YOU ” to you as he dragged me past your group .
You replied loudly for all to hear FUCK OFF CREEP !!!
I know we ’re meant for each other .
Give me another chance .

Is the U.S. Interior Department wrongly withholding information that will reveal whether taxpayers are being ripped off in a controversial oil and gas royalty program ?
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) seem to think so , according to a lawsuit they filed today .
Interior claims that disclosure of bidding and contracting information about its Royalty - In - Kind ( RIK ) sales would reveal oil company trade secrets .
The Royalty - In - Kind Program is responsible for managing Minerals Revenue Management ’s ( MRM ) commercial oil and gas sales activity .
The RIK Program is currently selling over 800,000 MM - Btu of natural gas per day and over 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day .
Simply put , Interior acts as an oil broker , selling this oil and gas in order to obtain its shares .
Royalty payments on oil and gas from offshore tracts and public lands are one of the federal government ’s greatest sources of non-tax revenues , making over $ 4 billion in 2007 .
RIK allows companies to pay federal royalties in the form of oil or natural gas rather than cash .
An investigation last September found that Interior employees ( 19 RIK marketers and other RIK employees – approximately 1/3 of the entire RIK staff ) were engaging in sex and drug parties with oil officials , and 8 of the 19 employees received gifts exceeding the allowable limit .
In an April report , the Government Accountability Office concluded that Interior ’s “ reports to the Congress did not fully describe the performance of the royalty - in - kind program and , in some instances , may have overstated the benefits of the program ” .
The lawsuit comes in response to the the Interior ’s April 20th denial to yield to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for the records needed to determine whether RIK is yielding the appropriate return to the federal government .
The request was denied on the somewhat contradictory grounds that the information relates “ solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the agency ” and consists of “ trade secrets ” and confidential commercial oil company data .
The purpose of the PEER lawsuit is to “ [ try ] to find out whether the Royalty - In - Kind program collects as much as it should or whether it benefits oil companies at the expense of the taxpayer , ” stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch .
The Interior ’s refusal to disclose the prices that oil companies pay for RIK oil makes it difficult to gauge the effectiveness of the program .
The Interior ’s stance also appears at odds with pledges by President Obama to run an open , transparent government .
The President said of the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) that “ [ FOIA ] , which encourages accountability through transparency , is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government .
At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike . ”
He went on to say that “ In the face of doubt , openness prevails .
The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears . ”
“ We believe that Interior ’s stated bases for withholding these documents is without merit and will not withstand scrutiny , ” said Christine Erickson , who filed the suit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
“ What oil companies bid or pay the federal government should be a matter on public record and certainly does not qualify as a trade secret . ”

Revolutionary ultrasonic nanotechnology that could allow scientists to see inside a patient ’s individual cells to help diagnose serious illnesses is being developed by researchers at The University of Nottingham .
The new technique would utilise ultrasound technology — more commonly used to look at whole bodies such as fetal scanners — to look inside cells .
The components of the new technology would be many thousand times smaller than current systems .
The technology would be tiny enough to allow scientists to see inside and image individual cells in the human body , which would further our understanding of the structure and function of cells and could help to detect abnormalities to diagnose serious illnesses such as some cancers .
The work by the Ultrasonics Group in the Division of Electrical Systems and Optics has been deemed so potentially innovative it has recently been awarded a £ 850,000 five - year Platform Grant by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) .
Ultrasound refers to sound waves that are at a frequency too high to be detected by the human ear , typically 20 kHz and above .
Medical ultrasound uses an electrical transducer the size of a matchbox to produce sound waves at much higher frequencies , typically around 100 - 1000 times higher to probe bodies .
The Nottingham researchers are aiming to produce a miniaturised version of this technology , with transducers so tiny that you could fit 500 across the width of one human hair which would produce sound waves at frequencies a thousand times higher again , in the GHz range .

Dr Matt Clark of the Ultrasonics Group , said : “ By examining the mechanical properties inside a cell there is a huge amount that we can learn about its structure and the way it functions .
But it ’s very much a leap into the unknown as this has never been achieved before .
“ One of the reasons for this is that it presents an enormous technical challenge .
To produce nano - ultrasonics you have to produce a nano - transducers , which essentially means taking a device that is currently the size of a matchbox and scaling it down to the nanoscale .
How do you attach a wire to something so small ?
“ Our answer to some of these challenges is to create a device that works optically — using pulses of laser light to produce ultrasound rather than an electrical current .
This allows us to talk to these tiny devices . ”
The new technology may also allow scientists to see objects even smaller than optical microscopes and be so sensitive they may be able to measure single molecules .
In addition to medical applications , the new technology would have important uses as a testing facility for industry to assess the integrity and quality of materials and to detect tiny defects which could have an impact on performance or safety .
Ultrasonics is currently used in applications such as testing landing gear components in the aero industry for cracks and damage which may not be immediately visible or may develop with use .
The group is also looking at developing new inspection techniques for inspecting engineering metamaterials — advanced composites that are currently impossible to inspect with ultrasound .
These materials offer huge performance advantages allowing radical new engineering but can't be widely used because of the difficulty of inspection .
Dr Clark added : “ We are also applying our technology to nanoengineering because we have to match the enormous growth in nanotechnology with techniques to inspect the nanoworld .
As products and their components become ever tinier , the testing facilities for those also need to be scaled down accordingly .
In NEMS ( nanoelectromechanical ) and MEMS ( microelectromechanical ) based machines there is an increasing demand for testing facilities which offer the same capabilities as those for real - world sized devices .
( CNN ) -- Iranians wounded during protests are being seized at hospitals by members of an Islamic militia , an Amnesty International official told CNN .
Ayatollah Ahmed Khatami says rioters in Iran will be " firmly " dealt with if they continue to protest .

" The Basijis are waiting for them , " said Banafsheh Akhlaghi , western regional director of the human rights group , referring to the government 's paramilitary arm that has cracked down on protesters during the violent aftermath of the June 12 presidential election .
Amnesty International has collected accounts from people who have left Iran and expatriates with relatives there who say the Basij has prohibited medical professionals from getting identification information from wounded demonstrators who check in , Akhlaghi said on Saturday .
They are also not allowed to ask how the injuries happened , and relatives are hard pressed to find the wounded .
Once the patients are treated , the militia removes them from the hospital to an undisclosed location , she said .
Iran has restricted international news agencies , including CNN , from reporting inside the Islamic republic .
However , CNN has received similar accounts , including that of a woman who arrived in the United States from Iran with a broken ankle and thumb .
Watch reports of the crackdown on protesters at their homes »
The woman , who did n't want to be identified for fear of her safety , said she was injured in a rally , but was too scared to go to a hospital .
Instead , a doctor came to her home to treat her .
" The point is , when they are being taken to the hospital they do n't actually get there , " her friend who accompanied her told CNN last week .
" Just like the reporters are being told not to report what they really see .
Hospitals , administrative levels , are being told to stay out of the public because they 're saying you 're accusing the regime of being hostile . "
Amnesty International is also reporting the detention of at least 70 scholars and eight politicians -- most from former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami 's administration -- in addition to several opposition activists and international journalists .
More than two weeks into turmoil , Iran 's leaders turned up the heat Friday as a high - ranking cleric warned protesters that they would be punished " firmly " and shown no mercy .
" Rioters and those who mastermind the unrest must know the Iranian nation will not give in to pressure and accept the nullification of the election results , " said Ayatollah Ahmed Khatami during Friday prayers in Tehran , according to Iran 's state - run Press TV .
" I ask the Judiciary to firmly deal with these people and set an example for everyone , " Khatami said .
Khatami also blamed demonstrators for the death of Neda Agha - Soltan , the young woman who emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition after her death a week ago was captured on a cell phone video .
Khatami said the foreign media had used Neda for propaganda purposes .
Human Rights
Watch , citing interviews with people in Iran , said Friday the Basij is carrying out brutal nighttime raids , destroying property in private homes and beating civilians in an attempt to stop nightly rooftop chants of " Allahu Akbar " ( God is great ) .
The nighttime chanting is emblematic of the protests 30 years ago during the Iranian revolution , which toppled the monarchy of the shah .
" While most of the world 's attention is focused on the beatings in the streets of Iran during the day , the Basiji are carrying out brutal raids on people 's apartments during the night , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director for Human Rights Watch .
Residents from northern Tehran neighborhoods told Human Rights Watch that the Basij fired live rounds into the air , in the direction of buildings from which they believed the chants were sounding .
Basij members kicked down doors and " when they entered the homes , they beat " people , a resident said .
The rights group said it had collected similar accounts of violence from several other neighborhoods .
Such accounts also are consistent with numerous accounts CNN has received of nighttime roundups of opposition activists and international journalists from their homes .
Amateur videos sent to CNN also show members of the Basij , wearing plain shirts and pants and wielding clubs and hoses , dispersing protesters and beating a handful of Iranians at a time .
Unrest in Iran erupted after the presidential elections in which hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner .
Ahmadinejad 's chief rival , Mir Hossein Moussavi , called the results fraudulent and has asked for a cancellation of the vote .
Watch how Mideast cartoonists are capturing the unrest »
Members of Iran 's National Security Council have told Moussavi that his repeated demands for the annulment are " illogical and unethical , " the council 's deputy head told the government - run Iranian Labor News Agency .
On Saturday Ahmadinejad slammed U.S. President Barack Obama , a day after Obama labeled as " outrageous " violence against demonstrators disputing election results .
" Did n't he say that he was after change ? "
Ahmadinejad asked Iranian judiciary officials in a speech .
" Why did he interfere ?
Why did he utter remarks irrespective of norms and decorum ? "
The National Security Council , which includes dozens of political leaders , assists Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's unelected supreme leader .
Together , they set the parameters of regional and foreign policies , including relations with Western powers , and the country 's nuclear programs .
The Guardian Council , which approves all candidates running for office and verifies election results , has declared that there will be no annulment of the votes .
However , it has reminded opposition candidates they have until Sunday to lodge any further complaints about the vote .

The United States has a long history of provoking , instigating , or launching wars based on dubious , flimsy , or manufactured threats .
The most egregious case was the U.S. invasion of Iraq , in 2003 , which was based on bad intelligence that Baghdad had active weapons - of - mass - destruction programs .
The repercussions are still playing out sixteen years ( and more than four thousand American deaths ) later .
Intelligence is completely irrelevant to major policy decisions .
Such decisions are matters of judgment , and knowledgeable , ordinary citizens are just as capable of making these determinations as political leaders allegedly in possession of " secret information . "
Such " secret information " is almost always wrong -- and major decisions , including those pertaining to war and peace , are made entirely apart from such information in any case .
The second you start arguing about intelligence , you 've given the game away once again .
This is a game the government and the proponents of war will always win .
By now , we all surely know that if they want the intelligence to show that Country X is a " grave " and " growing " threat , they will find it or manufacture it .
So once you 're debating what the intelligence shows or fails to show , the debate is over .
The war will inevitably begin .
...
To repeat : the decision to go to war is one of policy , and the intelligence -- whatever it is alleged to show -- is irrelevant .
Do n't argue in terms of intelligence at all .
If you do , you 'll lose .
The administration knows that ; many of its opponents still have n't figured it out , even now .
I therefore repeat my major admonition , and give it special emphasis : NEVER , EVER ARGUE IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE AT ALL .
It is always irrelevant to major policy decisions , and such decisions are reached for different reasons altogether .
This is true whether the intelligence is correct or not , and it is almost always wrong .
On those very rare occasions when intelligence is accurate , it is likely to be disregarded in any case .
It will certainly be disregarded if it runs counter to a course to which policymakers are already committed .
The intelligence does not matter .
It is primarily used as propaganda , to provide alleged justification to a public that still remains disturbingly gullible and pliable -- and it is used after the fact , to justify decisions that have already been made .
Acquiescence in Executive war , [ Fulbright ] wrote , comes from the belief that the government possesses secret information that gives it special insight in determining policy .
Not only was this questionable , but major policy decisions turn " not upon available facts but upon judgment , " with which policy - makers are no better endowed than the intelligent citizen .
Congress and citizens can judge " whether the massive deployment and destruction of their men and wealth seem to serve the overall interests as a nation . "
...
The belief that government knows best was voiced just at this time by Governor Nelson Rockefeller , who said on resumption of the bombing , " We ought to all support the President .
He is the man who has all the information and knowledge of what we are up against . "
This is a comforting assumption that relieves people from taking a stand .
It is usually invalid , especially in foreign affairs .
" Foreign policy decisions , " concluded Gunnar Myrdal after two decades of study , " are in general much more influenced by irrational motives " than are domestic ones .
It is all too rare that states overcome illusions , and the United States is no more an exception than Germany , Italy , England , or France before it .
The function of intelligence anywhere is far less to encourage rational behavior -- although sometimes that occurs -- than to justify a nation 's illusions , and it is the false expectations that conventional wisdom encourages that make wars more likely , a pattern that has only increased since the early twentieth century .
By and large , US , Soviet , and British strategic intelligence since 1945 has been inaccurate and often misleading , and although it accumulated pieces of information that were useful , the leaders of these nations failed to grasp the inherent dangers of their overall policies .
When accurate , such intelligence has been ignored most of the time if there were overriding preconceptions or bureaucratic reasons for doing so .
The craft of CIA analysis was designed to be an all - source operation , meaning that we analysts were responsible - and held accountable - for assimilating information from all sources and coming to judgments on what it all meant .
We used data of various kinds , from the most sophisticated technical collection platforms , to spies , to - not least - open media .
Here I must reveal a trade secret and risk puncturing the mystique of intelligence analysis .
Generally speaking , 80 percent of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media .
It helps to have been trained - as my contemporaries and I had the good fortune to be trained - by past masters of the discipline of media analysis , which began in a structured way in targeting Japanese and German media in the 1940s .
But , truth be told , anyone with a high school education can do it .
It is not rocket science .
The simple truth was , Polk wanted more territory .
No president in American history had ever been so frank in his aims for seizing real estate .
...
Perhaps to dignify the nakedness of Polk 's land lust , the American citizenry had got itself whipped into an idealistic frenzy , believing with an almost religious assurance that its republican form of government and its constitutional freedoms should extend to the benighted reaches of the continent then held by Mexico , which , with its feudal customs and Popish superstitions , stood squarely in the way of Progress .
To conquer Mexico , in other words , would be to do it a favor .
Since Americans ' narcissism is so all - encompassing , and because the superior value of American lives and goals as compared to those of all other peoples is regarded as an axiom never to be questioned , let 's put these horrors in terms that Americans might understand .
Let 's make it about you .
For ease of computation , we 'll use approximate figures .
Assume the U.S.'s war crimes have resulted in one million deaths .
That is roughly 1/26 of the total Iraqi population .
An equivalent number of American deaths would be 11.5 million people .
3,000 Americans were murdered on 9/11 .
In terms of casualties , 11.5 million deaths represent 3,800 9/11s -- or a 9/11 every day for ten and a half years .
Let me repeat that : a 9/11 every day for ten and a half years .
Perhaps you think these casualty figures are highly inflated .
Fine .
Cut them in half .
That 's a 9/11 every day for a little over five years .
Every day .
Do you begin to understand now ?
Please give your serious consideration to my profoundly upsetting personal dilemma .
I am basically a serene , tranquil soul , trying my utmost best to navigate successfully ( and serenely , and tranquilly ) through a world beset with , well , insanity .
Not merely insanity , but violent insanity .
And not simply violent insanity , but violent insanity bolstered by nonstop hatred , and the desire to eliminate all traces of " the Other . "
And " the Other " is anyone who does not belong to any particular individual 's tribe , however that tribe may be defined ( on a racial , religious , political or other basis , and / or some combination of these factors ) .
Such hatred and eliminationist desires are not conducive to sustaining and enhancing serenity and tranquillity .
Not hardly .
So there I am , minding my own tranquil affairs , when I happen upon an article in The article concerns the question of whether Trump is leading the United States into a war with Iran , either intentionally or " inadvertently " (!!! -- more on that point in a moment ) .
It begins with a hint of promise , , it appears the author might have more than a glancing familiarity with facts and history :
Hey , not bad , you 're thinking , right ?
The balance of the first paragraph and the second paragraph concern a confrontation with Iran that the Reagan administration engineered in 1986 .
The article presents a straightforward case of deliberate American provocation , which succeeded in getting the desired response .
Then we have the beginning of the third paragraph : No .
No , no , no , no , no , no .
NO .
O farewell , serenity !
Tranquillity , farewell !
Please note that these two sentences are the totality of what this author has to say in the article about the criminal and illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Yet these two sentences provide conclusive evidence that this author understands next to nothing about U.S. foreign policy and the forces that direct it , and also reveal that the author has entirely internalized ( perhaps inadvertently ! ) the norms and values of American exceptionalism .
You may think that is a lot to claim on the basis of two sentences .
I shall now explain .
Take the first sentence : " The most egregious case was the U.S. invasion of Iraq , in 2003 , If you read commentary on current events with any regularity ( and you have my utmost sympathy if you do , as well as my condolences forlost serenity ) , you will recognize this formulation : it appears that many of our analysts and " experts " now attribute the invasion of Iraq to " bad intelligence .
"
Over a period of more than ten years , I have written numerous articles ( at least 15 or 20 major essays , as well as many shorter entries ) examining the entirely fraudulent nature of " intelligence " in general .
I have also examined many particular instances of " intelligence " being entirely , often grievously wrong -- and " intelligence " is almostwrong .
Here , I will provide only a brief summary of the argument , but I will provide links for those who are interested in the details of the reasoning and evidence involved ( either for the first time , or as a reminder ) .
From " You , Too , Can and Should Be an ' Intelligence Analyst ' "
In the same article , I later wrote : For newer readers , here are two notable statements of this principle that I have often referenced .
From Barbara Tuchman : From Gabriel Kolko : Many ( most ) people ( doubtless including the author ofarticle ) will nonetheless insist that " intelligence " is of vital significance , and that it depends on specialized knowledge , , " secret information . "
That , too , is a lie .
Here is Ray McGovern , who worked for the CIA ( also excerpted in my article , " You , Too , Can and Should Be an ' Intelligence Analyst ' " ) :
As I noted in the earlier article , after much additional reading and analysis , I concluded that the 80 % figure is almost certainly too low ; I now think the more accurate figure would be 90 % , or even 95 % .
For still more about the colossal fraud of " intelligence , " I refer you to " Played for Fools Yet Again : About that Iran ' Intelligence ' Report , " which contains a lengthy excerpt from Chalmers Johnson about the decades - long failures of the intelligence agencies .
You can also consult " ' Secret Information ' : Giving Up Your Life for a Vicious Lie . "
The first half of this essay describes how the pattern of willingly and enthusiastically providing obedience to authority figures , in part because the young child believes the authority figures ' claims that they have " secret information " denied to the child , is set in very early childhood , while the second half examines how the " intelligence " fraud cashes in on the severe damage inflicted on the child , now that she / he is an adult .
As for the claim that the invasion of Iraq resulted from " bad intelligence " : c'mon .
I mean , Millions of people around the world passionately protested against the imminent invasion of Iraq .
It was entirely obvious to them that Iraq represented no serious threat to the U.S. , as that fact was obvious to anyone with ten functioning brain cells .
Moreover , a multitude of evidence establishes beyond all question that the Bush administration knew Iraq represented no serious threat to the U.S.
The decision to invade and occupy Iraq was one of -- a policy to which the key players had been committed since the early 1990s .
They made no secret about it ; to the contrary , they announced their preferred policy for the Middle East at every opportunity .
That policy , in brief , was that the United States had the right ( and the responsibility , they would often add ) to shake up and rearrange the Middle East as the U.S. determined was necessary .
To be clear : this policy was a fully bipartisan affair , and a policy to which both Democrats and Republicans ( with a few notable exceptions ) were fully committed .
As noted above , , whatever it may have shown .
The decision was one of policy , period .
In some of my essays mentioned above , I noted that I was well aware that my views about " intelligence " were those of a small minority , and that I was astonished by how difficult it was to convince people even to consider altering their traditional view .
Moreover , I have continued to watch as some people who have finally agreed me about this quickly revert to their previous , standard opinion about " intelligence , " after some time has gone by .
All of this confirms my view on another , related subject : that the damage inflicted on us as young children can last a lifetime .
In this case , as in almost every case , the child is taught thatis the primary virtue .
The child is also taught that the authority figures in its life have " secret information " that is utterly inaccessible to her / him , and that she / he must therefore trust them completely , without any question whatsoever .
This perfectly maps the adult 's conviction that " important " government officials are privy to information that informs their decisions , information to which ordinary citizens can never have access , and that we must therefore obey the officials without question .
Most people are unable to alter these beliefs to any significant degree once they are adults .
That most people still fail to grasp this issue results in one small benefit for the perceptive observer : watching " serious " writers , like theauthor , eagerly offering an explanation of the Iraq war which is George W. Bush 'sHey , do n't blame me !
The intelligence made me do it !
I suspect thewriter would not consciously choose to provide succor and comfort to Bush in this manner -- but that is precisely what she has done .
I will mention only briefly one aspect of thearticle which reveals the author 's bias to the careful reader .
In addition to the Iran episode involving the Reagan administration and Iraq , the article mentions the Vietnam War , the Spanish - American War , and the Mexican - American War .
I feel compelled to mention that a much more colorful discussion of the loathsome lies and intentions behind the Mexican - American War will be found in Hampton Sides ' work , which I excerpted here .
For example : Do you notice any significant omissions from the article 's list of the U.S. 's " long history of provoking , instigating , or launching wars based on dubious , flimsy , or manufactured threats " ?
I can think of two , neither of which is lost in the mists of time : Kosovo and Libya .
Curious , that .
Both of those war crimes were deliberately instigated under Democratic administrations , and very recent ones .
Both involved a monumental series of lies , including claims of atrocities that never happened .
( " Oh , but weto stop a genocide ! " Except the genocide )
For a lengthy discussion of Kosovo , please consult this post ; on Libya , you may consult " If Pictures Were Arguments ...
Let 's turn our attention to the second of the 's sentences about the vast war crime of the Iraq invasion and occupation : " The repercussions are still playing out sixteen years ( and more than four thousand American deaths ) later . "
Here , thewriter has adopted an additional role .
You may remember the old joke about the attorney who gestures to his client , a young man who is accused of brutally murdering both his parents , and who is obviously and unquestionably guilty .
" But Your Honor !
Surely we must be able to show some compassion .
He is barely a young man , he 's only 23 -- and he 's all alone in the world .
He 's an orphan ! "
Yeah , it 's truly heartbreaking to see the pain of a vicious murderer over the crimes he reveled in committing .
Four thousand entirely unnecessary American deaths is certainly a tragedy -- although it must always be kept in mind that the U.S. was the aggressor in a war of choice , a war of aggression against a non-existent threat .
And there is no draft ; therefore , every American soldier involved in the Iraq invasion and occupation was there by choice .
No , that is not the end of the inquiry ; these moral questions of responsibility and judgment are complex .
" No , I Do Not Support ' The Troops ' " discusses these and related issues .
Thefails to mention that , in its brutal war of aggression , the U.S. completely destroyed an entire country , destabilized an already exceedingly dangerous area of the world -- and it unleashed a genocide of world historical proportion .
This is not even acknowledged .
I confess that , even after many years of writing about these issues , this kind of self - blinded , narcissistic self - absorption , to the exclusion of even a passing awareness of the pain and horror our government inflicts around the world , still takes my breath away .
I repeat here part of what I wrote in the essay linked immediately above .
I include this excerpt because I think I utilized a strategy that is useful in trying to break through this wall of resistance : That the United States government is fully prepared to do this again , either with regard to Iran or perhaps , in time , elsewhere , is a crime so hideous as to be almost beyond contemplation .
But make no mistake : whatever future conflicts may occur -- and barring the unimaginable case of another country attacking the U.S. ( which , given the certainty of an utterly obliterating counterstrike from the U.S. , would appear to be virtually impossible ) -- they will not be " accidental " or " inadvertent . "
Every war the U.S. has ever fought was the result of deliberate calculation , often over an extended period of time , and a course decided upon to achieve certain desired goals ( usually , territory coveted for resources and / or for the markets that would be provided to the U.S. ) .
My series Dominion
Over the World contains nine essays which chart the development and implementation of the U.S. policy of global hegemony .
The bipartisan elite Establishment continues to believe that the U.S. is entitled to dictate events around the world .
Yes , even the sainted Obama believes this one .
You can not be elected to national office in this country unless you believe it .
Oh , yes , the odd Senator or Representative might get through now and then -- you have to reinforce the people 's faith in " democracy " and its wondrous workings ! -- but that 's not enough to change the direction of events .
But if the U.S. government should go down this route once more , there will not be fires hot enough in Hell to punish their putrid , rotted souls .

Sitting across the table from me was Chet Faliszek .
He was one of the project leads on Left 4 Dead .
I was sitting with my arms crossed , and I told him how much I love Left 4 Dead .
He told me how much he enjoys Ars Technica .
We have officially gotten the formalities out of the way .
" People are pissed , " I told him .
" Well , some are , " he responded .
That 's something of an understatement .
I 've been getting e-mails , texts , phone calls , and tweets from readers and friends enraged over Valve releasing a sequel to Left 4 Dead so quickly .
This is a company that has reinvented Team Fortress 2 since its release , and every update was free .
Left 4 Dead received the Survival Pack , and now there is a sequel coming to the PC and 360 this year .
Faliszek knew that he had to do some damage control ; he told Ars he was texting prominent map makers from the community minutes after the announcement to let them know that their work would not be affected negatively by the sequel .
He was eager to address the anger .
" Team Fortress gets to do these nice little discrete units of content , they get to do a map , there 's an internal consistency and an internal world that happens . "
He described the content updates as " clean little things . "
Bite - sized updates that add to the game , and over time change things .
It 's not nearly that easy with Left 4 Dead , where one change affects nearly everything else .
Besides , why inch along with an update or content pack every now and again ?
Everyone on the team was excited about working on more Left 4 Dead , and in fact , the team behind the game has increased slightly in size since launch .
That 's rare : in most cases development teams are scaled back after the product is released .
" We had some meetings about it , and we all talked about our ideas , and everyone was pretty focused and thoughtful , a lot of the same ideas were happening , " Faliszek told me .
The team wanted better storytelling , they wanted swamps , and they wanted to include New Orleans .
" We wanted the Director to be smarter , but to be smarter it needed more special infected in its stable .
For example , the Charger that we see today . "
I had just gotten done playing the game , and the Charger is indeed a nasty critter .
If you 're being too defensive , if you 're grouped together too tightly , the Director may send the bull - like Charger to bum rush your party , knocking the team apart .
Imagine a tank that comes straight at you , but is slightly easier to kill .
" It just became very clear that this was a cohesive , singular statement we wanted to make , not a more slow update thing ... too much stuff was tied together with too many other things .
The Common Infected — now there is destruction in different parts of their body , to ship all the new Common Infected , even with an update , would be a huge thing . "
So the team brought their concepts and ideas to create a sequel to Gabe Newell , and even he was skeptical about the idea .
According to Faliszek , he expressed his doubts , and claimed this move was against the character of the company .
" To Gabe 's credit , and he 's a great guy to work for , he said if this is what you want to do , if this is what you 're excited about , go do it . "
A true sequel
The SDK will be coming out of beta in the next week or so , and Faliszek points to that to prove that Left 4 Dead will still be updated .
Also , all the maps created with the SDK will work on the sequel .
As for playing old maps with old characters but new creatures and melee ?
" We have some additional work to do there , we 're talking about how to do that .
That 's what we want to do . "
While he claims it 's not an insurmountable amount of work , mixing old and new content would require new dialog to be recorded for the situations with the new enemies and weapons , as well as new animations .
It 's something Valve wants to do , but they 're not sure when it will be accomplished .
The game will ship with five new campaigns , new weapons , new characters , new Special Infected , updated Common Infected , melee weapons ... and a new game mode .
" We 're not talking about that yet , " I 'm told .
The point is that this is n't a new coat of paint and a new level or two ; this is a full sequel .
Left 4
Dead 2 will also include some more storytelling than what we 're used to from the series .
" Not only are we telling the story of these characters , but we 're telling the story of this world , we 're seeing how things fall apart , and a new way of interacting with the infection . "
Faliszek confirmed that there is a notebook somewhere deep in the bowels of Valve with the story of Left 4 Dead , detailing the world and why things are the way they are .
There is even a Left 4 Dead dictionary with different terms for areas and infected that describe how the Director will handle things in that area .
" Having a language to describe these things in makes it a lot easier , " he explained .
He also hints that the characters from the two Left 4 Dead games may meet in the future .
" My dream is to have 16 characters , going through the world , having their experiences and their own views . "
Valve has piles of concepts for characters ; the possibilities are limitless .
A few other tidbits : Microsoft gave Left 4 Dead 2 the codename " Carnation " so the surprise announcement would n't be revealed before E3 .
We talked about how many people enjoy killing TSA employees in the airport areas of Left 4 Dead , and Faliszek detailed a story about being yelled at by an airport official over a can of shaving cream .
" He would n't stop yelling !
I do n't know what he thought would happen , but it just got to the point where I was ready for him to arrest me . "
His dream was to include a no - nonsense lady from the DMV as a character , but she did n't make the cut .
As for the resentment over the timing of the sequel , he 's just hoping all of you give it a fair shake .
" We want to wait and weed through the comments , I 'm already getting e-mails , and I 'm responding to them , " he said .
He talked about the reaction to the Orange Box , how people were angry about " buying " Half - Life 2 again .
" And looking back , was the Orange Box a ripoff ?
Give us a fair shake on this , read more about it , find out about it , we 've already let people play it here ...
After that , if you want to vent , post to the forums .
We do read them , we read all the forums , we read [ the Ars forums ] .
You can e-mail me at ChetF@valvesoftware.com , or I 'm Chet on Steam .
Hit me up , we can play some games and talk about it . "

In recent headlines , the city of Ghent in Belgium has taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint and has made the brave decision to ask its citizens to go meatless one day a week .
Every Thursday will be veggie day .
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm
According to a 2006 report by the United Nation 's Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , entitled Livestock 's Long Shadow : it stated that livestock production is responsible for 18 percent of all greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions which is more than all the cars , trains and planes combined .
However a recent report published by the World Watch Institute stated that the livestock sector is responsible for 51 % of all greenhouse gases .
Due to the impact that meat has on the environment , we need to reduce our consumption of this carbon intensive product as an effective solution to the climate change crisis .
This petition calls for Taiwanese officials to take action now that will show Taiwan ’s commitment to tackling Climate Change .
We urge the government to promote every Monday as a day when the citizens of Taiwan will abstain from meat products in an effort to protect the environment and halt global warming .
We call on everyone ’s support in expressing to Taiwanese officials the need for Taiwan to adopt and promote a meat free Monday .
So please sign this petition and forward it to your friends and family .

Programmer Dabreegster posted this intriguing trailer ( not just in its presentation , but also in its mysterious storyline ) yesterday for his current project , MnemonicRL , a " real - time multiplayer roguelike with ASCII effects , immersive static towns , random dungeons , eight classes , and easy scripting . "
If you watch the video all the way through , you 'll catch a glimpse of a multiplayer conversation around the 04:15 mark .
According to the programmer , his custom PerlRL engine helps the game step onto new ground by offering several single - and multiplayer modes , but he has n't yet decided on how he 'll execute the multiplayer gameplay , and is still figuring out what to do with permadeath and leveling .
Dabreegster promises an open beta soon for MnemonicRL , and plans to eventually release the game for Windows , Mac , Linux , and all platforms supporting Perl .

High - End Graphics With Specialized Cooling
Air , Electricity , and Water
If you have the necessary cash at your disposal , you can use it to buy some fabulous graphics cards armed with elaborate cooling solutions .
You wo n't get much in the way of non-standard cooling at price points under $ 150 .
However , for $ 300 , you should get a card that 's capable , quiet , and cool .
And when it comes to 3D graphics cards that retail for $ 500 or more , you 'll also hear talk about how such expensive boards should include fancy extras , like liquid cooling .
Regardless of how you feel about liquid inside your PC , you have to give it up for EVGA 's GeForce GTX 295 , for example , which lets the company quietly offer impressive performance from its dual - GPU board .
As seasoned lab rats , we 're used to standard cooling fans on graphics cards .
Once you apply a significant gaming load , you get accustomed to hearing fans spin up akin to a jet engine .
By contrast , this water - cooled graphics card is dead silent .
You start the testing , brace yourself for an acoustic barrage , and then nothing happens .
Great stuff , right ?
Dual - GPU architectures ask a lot from their coolers because these designs cram the processors , memory , and power circuitry of two boards into a single package , simultaneously doubling power and thermal requirements , which large heatsinks and powerful fans work hard to displace .
Compared to BFG's air - cooled GeForce GTX 295 , MSI 's GeForce GTX 280 has an easier job — its HydroGen - series card includes only one GPU , making it easier for MSI to pack all of its cooling resources onto a single circuit board .
It also makes for a solid - performance product , as the integrated water cooler allows for high clock speeds , letting this older - generation graphics card keep up with the newer GeForce GTX 285 models .
Have no fear if you 're reluctant to go the water cooling route .
Instead , you can turn to optimized air - cooling alternatives .
Nvidia does a good job managing thermals with its massive two - slot reference coolers , but they 're often loud and large .
With its specialty models , MSI improves upon this design significantly ( both in terms of cooling performance and aesthetics ) .
The company 's GeForce GTX 285 SuperPipe is a classic example .
It uses long ( 8 mm diameter ) heatpipes and twin fans to figuratively blow Nvidia 's reference fans away .
On the ATI front , there 's a bit of a duel taking place between the MSI Radeon HD 4870 X2 and the Palit Revolution 700 Deluxe version of the same card .
Here , loud and cool compete against quiet and cooler .
Thanks to its 40 nm manufacturing technology , the Radeon HD 4770 is also notable in that it is very quiet , energy efficient , and cool .
It delivers enough speed at high - quality settings to keep up with some of the quicker high - end cards featured here .
You can check out its benchmark results in our tables and we plan to conduct additional tests for other models soon .
Ed. :
We 're keeping tabs on availability of the Radeon HD 4770s , and right now they 're nearly impossible to find .
We still recommend the card to anyone who can get their hands on it , but there are plenty of other options out there if you are n't able to wait .

Con un cargo oficial y relaciones de alto nivel todo es posible en México , desde fabricar culpables para tapar un crimen hasta hacer negocio a costa de la seguridad de niños ajenos .
A donde volteemos , los grandes problemas de este país tienen beneficiarios , siempre pertenecientes — o cómplices — al poder político .
Vea si no la portada impresa del periódico de hoy .
El gobierno federal pagará mil 500 millones de pesos a un grupo de ejidatarios cuyas tierras fueron expropiadas para construir un puerto industrial en Tamaulipas .
Dicen los magistrados que no se “ justificó ” la utilidad pública del puerto .
Como si no fuera obvio que 2 mil 500 millones de dólares en la zona , con su consecuente creación de empleos , es de interés público .
Para entender el fallo hay que saber que los litigantes fueron el primer procurador panista , Antonio Lozano Gracia , y el controvertido líder , también panista , Diego Fernández de Cevallos .
Revise ahora la nota sobre el juicio de amparo que busca liberar a decenas de detenidos por el caso Acteal .
Hace 12 años el gobierno de Zedillo , urgido de resultados tras la matanza de 45 indígenas , construyó un proceso penal lleno de pruebas fabricadas que junto con algunos culpables llevó a la cárcel a 60 presuntos inocentes .
En manos de la Suprema Corte está el asunto que , hoy sabemos , fue pospuesto hasta después de las elecciones , no vaya a ser que la decisión de los ministros afecte la campaña de algún partido .
La muerte de 44 niños en Sonora suma otro ejemplo .
Destapó la inseguridad de las estancias infantiles y la sospecha de tráfico de influencias en las guarderías subrogadas por el IMSS — también promovidas por la Sedesol — y , curiosamente , una de las más importantes políticas sociales del Presidente .
Como estas tragedias , muchas otras se deben a nuestra clase gobernante , aferrada a beneficiarse a costa del interés público .
América Latina acumula suficientes desplomes de sus clases políticas como para que la nuestra no considere poner sus barbas a remojar .
You do n’t have to suffer with pests or harm the environment trying to get rid of them just to enjoy all of the outdoor activities of the season .
There are many eco-friendly ways to approach pest control , whether the problem is slugs on your patio or a snake in the pool .
We no longer have to rely on harsh chemicals to enjoy the summer .
Natural Insect Repellants
Cedar oil is a natural , non -toxic insect repellent .
It can be used to repel mosquitoes , fleas , ants , cockroaches and other insects .
It ’s safe for your skin and even has a pleasant smell .
Pets and pet bedding can also be treated with cedar oil to control fleas .
Citronella oil is another natural mosquito repellent and is often used in outdoor candles , while the Mosquito Plant , or Citrosa Geranium , is often grown on patios for its mosquito - repelling qualities .
Beneficial Insects
Beneficial insects are natural predators of other insects that can cause damage in the garden .
Live specimens and eggs are available commercially , but by providing a favorable habitat through plantings that provide cover for these insects , you can attract them to your property .
Create the right environment and you can have an army of beneficial insects go to work for you .
Solar - Powered Repellents
Solar powered pest control products are a relatively new green product on the market .
Solar panels on the top of the unit collect energy from the sun while the spike is buried underground .
The device periodically shakes , sending vibrations through the ground to disturb and frighten animals .
Models are available to repel moles and other vermin and at least one company makes a solar powered snake repellent .
However , many gardeners are happy to see snakes in the garden , as they are natural predators of the smaller mammals that cause the most damage .
Humane Relocation : Trap and Release
A very humane way of dealing with a pest problem is the trap and release method .
There are a variety of no-kill traps available to safely capture an unwanted animal so that it can be relocated in the wild .
Special care must be taken when relocating animals to ensure their survival .
They should be relocated early in the day to an area that provides plenty of food , water and shelter .
Glue traps are also available to help capture and relocate snakes .
When it is time to release the snake , vegetable or mineral oil loosens the glue .
Wash Bad Bugs Away
Aphids can often be removed from ornamental plants simply with a blast of water from the hose .
The tiny mouths of the aphids remain stuck to the plant , while the bodies wash away .
To control scale and other parasitic insects in the garden , Neem oil or insecticidal soap can be sprayed directly on the plant and insect - infestation .
These products are safe for the plants and the environment .
Banish Snails and Slugs
Snails and slugs can destroy delicate plants overnight .
These soft - bodied pests come out after dark and wreak havoc in the garden .
To control the population , a shallow dish of beer can be placed among the plants that need protection .
Slugs especially love beer and will fall in and drown .
Diatomaceous earth and crushed eggshells sprinkled among plants also help prevent slug and snail damage as they will not cross a barrier that will damage their soft undersides .
Attract Birds
Many wild birds are natural predators of the insects we wish to eliminate .
You can attract wild birds to your home by creating a favorable habitat for them .
By providing water in a bird bath , hanging bird feeders filled with food for the bird species you wish to attract and planting brightly colored flowering plants for hummingbirds , who like nectar , you can lure birds in to do your dirty work for you – naturally .
Skunks : Handle with Caution
If you have a skunk problem , there may be no pleasant way to solve it .
Baby skunks have a functioning scent gland from the time they are born , so care must be taken not to startle them .
Skunks are nocturnal animals and usually will visit you in the night to find a meal .
You can discourage skunk activity on your property by making sure all garbage is secure inside a lidded trash can and putting away all pet food before turning in for the night .

Introduction by Joseph Salerno
It is my great and distinct pleasure to introduce the Henry Hazlitt Lecturer , Peter Schiff .
Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , is familiar to everyone who has watched financial coverage in the last year .
He is famed for being the most vocal financial economist to have perfectly predicted the crash .
He also happens to be a dedicated student of the Austrian school .
He is the author of the prophetic Crash Proof and , most recently , The Little Book of Bull Moves in Bear Markets .
Whenever he speaks about finance and economics , he also seeks to teach sound economic theory , writing for publications such as the New York Times and the Washington Post .
Today he will speak on the relationship between theory and practice in financial markets .
Peter Schiff
I just looked at the topic for my speech about thirty seconds ago before I walked in the door .
But apparently I ’m talking about why is it that people did n’t see this coming , or should people have known that this meltdown was coming .
I do n’t know .
Is there anyone in this room that was surprised by the economic meltdown ?
Does anybody think it ’s over ?
Anybody ?
Raise your hand if you think it ’s over .
And does anybody think that the government solutions are going to work or that they ’re going to help ?
Is there anybody ?
One .
All right .
So , I guess there ’s really no reason for me to speak here .
I do n’t know that I ’m going to tell anybody anything they do n’t know .
But , if you want to indulge me , I guess I could talk about it a little bit anyway .
But I do n’t know why so few people seem to understand what was going to happen .
I guess when you ’re living inside a bubble , it ’s very difficult to actually see what ’s going on , from your point .
But I lived through two of them , because I ’m a stockbroker .
I lived through the NASDAQ bubble .
And to me , at that point in time , it seemed pretty obvious what was going on , in 1997 , ’ 98 , ’99 .
It seemed obvious to me that these companies that people were touting could n’t possibly be worth the prices that people were paying .
Yet nobody seemed to be able to figure that out back then .
Everybody seemed to be living in this new era , and the Internet had captured everybody ’s imagination .
To me , I could n’t see the difference between the Internet , really , and a catalog or a telephone .
People were saying that everybody ’s going to buy everything on the Internet .
Why ?
Why are n’t people just shopping by telephone ?
Or why are n’t they just buying everything in a Spiegel catalog ?
It did n’t seem that it was any different .
And I knew that the valuations they were putting on a lot of these companies , I knew they ’d come out with a company , maybe it ’d be Doorknobs.com , or whatever it was .
And you ’d say , " Well , gee , even if they sold every doorknob in the world , they could n’t possibly be worth the multiples that they ’re trading at . "
And of course they did n’t even make any money selling them .
And the whole idea behind so much of the e-commerce was just nonsense .
The idea that it was more cost effective to individually FedEx items to people , as opposed to letting them show up and buy them and put them in their cars and leave .
There ’s no way .
There are certain items that lend themselves to online sales , but most items did n’t , but it did n’t matter .
Everybody was going public .
And people were getting rich , but none of the people were getting rich because the businesses were successful .
The people were getting rich because suckers were buying their stock .
The guy that started eToys lived in my apartment building in downtown Los Angeles .
And I started my company , Euro Pacific Capital , about the same time he started his .
He made a lot more money than I did , but he did n’t make a profit .
He never made a profit .
But he made a lot of money because he found people to buy into his idea .
And at one point , eToys was worth more than Toys " R " Us .
I remember when I was trying to get clients , back when I was starting out at Euro Pacific Capital , and I was trying to get people to buy foreign stocks .

And I remember one country I was active in was New Zealand , and I remember trying to convince people who owned shares of stocks , like Yahoo , why they should sell their Yahoo and buy a stock in New Zealand .
I would point out that Yahoo was worth twice the entire country of New Zealand ; every stock they had , all the real estate .
I ’d say , " What would you rather own , this entire country ? "
The dividend yield on the New Zealand stock market was over a billion dollars a year .
That was the dividend yield .
Yet Yahoo was trading for more than twice the value of that whole stock market .
I said , " What would you rather own , this company that just got started a couple years ago , or this whole country ?
And you could take all the dividends . "
No .
No one cared ; they wanted Yahoo .
But it was just all nonsense , but nobody saw it .
Of course , after the Internet bubble burst , everybody was talking about how crazy it was .
And the politicians were ready to throw people in jail and they vilified Wall Street .
But it did n’t last very long .
The whole thing was , in a year or two , we just moved right from that stock - market bubble , almost seamlessly , into the real - estate bubble , and nobody could see that there was any similarities .
There was one .
Somebody recently put together another one of those Peter Schiff videos .
There was one that somebody made , this " Peter Schiff Was Right " video that was on YouTube that I know about a million three hundred thousand people have seen .
But someone else put together a CNBC version of that recently and I happened to watch it .
And there was one particular clip he put on with me and Mark Haynes , and I ’m talking to him about this impending collapse and the economy and the real - estate market .
And Mark Haynes just says to me , he says , " Peter , bubbles are like a once in a lifetime occurrence , we just had one . "
He said , " Do you expect me to believe that we have another one within ten years ? "
And he was just incredulous that there could be another bubble so close to the stock - market bubble .
But , of course , they were really interrelated .
It was almost like the same bubble , because we never really had the fallout from the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble .
We simply replaced one bubble with a bigger bubble , and we postponed the consequences of the unwinding of the imbalances until right now .
And , of course , we ’re still trying to postpone it .
But I think , at this point , the damage has been so great and the problems are now so huge that I do n’t think there ’s another economic rabbit they can pull out of their hat at this point .
We ’re just going to have to face it now .

And , basically , what happened is , why did we have a stock - market bubble ?
We had a stock - market bubble because the Federal Reserve was too easy ; they were too loose in the 1990s .
Interest rates were too low , we created too much money , and that fed the investments in the stock market .
And we had a lot of malinvestments .
Companies were created that never should have existed .
They were created not because they could generate a profit , but because they could go public , because investors wanted these stocks .
It did n’t matter that they could n’t make money .
So what did they do ?
They took land , labor , and capital ; they took all the factors for production , and they combined them in ways that actually destroyed value .
But it did n’t matter , because these companies got financing .
The Fed made the financing cheap , so they were able to flourish .
They were able to flourish despite the fact that they were losing money .
The saying used to be , they ’d lose money on every sale but they ’d make it up on volume .
And , so , but as long as they could raise money .
And when I was working at Euro Pacific Capital , I would see deals and people would send me prospectuses on new companies they wanted to fund .
I remember one I got from a small Internet company that was , I do n’t remember .
They were — I do n’t know if it was a browser or whatever they were , or a service where you go on the Internet , a provider .
I do n’t even remember what they did .
But it was a small start - up , and they had their prospectus and they were coming around looking to raise money .
And they were trying to raise , I do n’t know , five or ten million dollars .
They were n’t public yet .
But they were selling a little small piece of their company , so they were valuing their company at about fifty million dollars .
Now , these guys were in their twenties .
They probably started the company less than a year ago .
I remember saying , " Well , how could you possibly think your business is worth fifty million dollars ? "
I said , " You have no assets , you ’ve got no revenues , you ’ve got no customers .
It ’s like , you do n’t have anything .
I could recreate your entire business from scratch myself for next to nothing .
And yet you want me to pay you five million dollars to get five percent of this thing ?
Why would I do that ? "
And all they kept telling us , " Well , you do n’t understand , we ’re going to go public , and you ’re going to make a lot of money . "
And I said , " You think you ’re going to find people to pay even more than this in a public offer ?
How are you ever going to make any money ? "

SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 25 — Google is calling on the computer industry to create a simpler and more efficient power supply standard that it says will save billions of kilowatt - hours of energy annually .
In a white paper to be presented Tuesday on the opening day of the Intel Developer Forum here , two leading data center designers at Google will argue that the industry is mired in inefficiency for historical reasons , dating to the introduction of the first I.B.M. PC in 1981 .
At that time , standard power supplies , which convert high - voltage alternating current to low - voltage direct current , were required to provide multiple output voltage , which is no longer necessary in today ’s PC’s .
The Google plan calls for a shift from multivoltage power supplies to a single 12 - volt standard .
Although voltage conversion would still take place on the PC motherboard , the simpler design of the new power supply would make it easier to achieve higher overall efficiencies .
