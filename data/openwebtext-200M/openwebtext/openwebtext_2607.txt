Energy baron T. Boone Pickens has been loud and clear with his message about fuels for commercial fleet vehicles and heavy - duty trucks : Natural gas is the way to go .
“ A battery will not move an 18 - wheeler , ” he ’s wont to say .
But the Pickens Plan is n’t just about big rigs .
It also calls for switching over delivery trucks and municipal fleet vehicles , or as he puts it , “ Any vehicle which returns to the ‘ barn ’ each night where refueling is a simple matter . ”
On that front — lighter duty fleet vehicles used for in - town treks —
Pickens has a new challenger .
Rolling into the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville , Ky. , on Thursday will be electric and plug - in hybrid models from the company Electric Vehicles International .
Although it was founded in 1989 and launched in Mexico several years ago , EVI is a newcomer to the U.S. market .
EVI ’s two models , launched earlier this month at the Work Truck Show in Chicago , can be customized according to fleet managers ’ specifications and delivered in 60 days , according to an announcement from the company today .
Variations can include the number of battery packs ( lithium - phosphate made by Valence ( s VLNC ) , or lead - acid by Trojan ) and leased over several years , depending on the range needed for a particular fleet .
With one pack , EVI spokesperson Luka Keck tells us , the all - electric range will be about 40 to 60 miles .
Two packs would do for 120 to 125 miles — enough for in - town deliveries , but certainly not for a cross-country haul .
They ’re not pretty , but for the fleet market , they do n’t really have to be .
More important is the fact that they meet federal requirements for on - road driving , so they are n’t limited to campus shuttling .
Keck said fleets “ could feasibly have as many battery packs as you want , but it would take away from your payload with each pack . ”
For longer distances , EV1 ’s hybrid option ( which has an engine fueled with liquefied or compressed natural gas or propane as backup ) would be more practical .
For now , Pickens can keep using his 18 - wheeler sound byte .
But depending on how U.S. companies and municipalities respond to EVI — and in what direction , and far , diesel prices go — the race for fleet contracts could get more interesting .
You ’re resolved : toxic chemicals are out of your life .
Now how about your fellow creatures ?
Our pets deserve natural care too , but fleas are often the biggest pet problem we have to buy chemicals for – or do we ?
Here are some non -toxic flea care ideas to help you keep your animal companions – and your home – safe and organic .
B vitamins and garlic are natural insect repellents , so supplement your pet ’s diet with a pet safe vitamin .
Healthier animals are more resistant to pests and diseases , too .
It might take a few weeks to notice the effects , so consider this part of your long term flea treatment .
Regular flea combing is essential to making sure eggs and insects never stay on your pet long enough to matter .
Simple daily brushing pays off !
Plus , it helps you bond with your little buddy .
Castorand Pollux makes a flea collar infused with naturally insect repelling essential oils .
Keep the environment flea - free too .
Use diatomaceous earth or boric acid to keep fleas and other pesky bugs at bay .
These are minerals that cut up bug ’s stomachs , without having any toxic effect on humans and animals .
Biological control :
There ’s a nematode , called the ‘ killer roundworm ’ , that feeds on flea larvae , and you can buy bottles of it , add water , and spray the tiny worms around your yard .
Supposedly they will die out once they run out of fleas to eat , but I ’d do a little more research before introducing another species into the garden .
Ask your vet about it .
And we love to hear your personal pet stories , so let us know what has and has n’t worked for you .

“ Outrageous . ”
That ’s what Lawrence Summers , director of the National Economic Council , called the $ 165 million in new bonuses to be paid out by the troubled insurance giant American International Group , which has received more than $ 170 billion in public bailout funds .
Members of both parties joined Mr. Summers on Sunday morning in criticizing AIG , which posted a loss of $ 61.7 billion — the largest corporate loss in history — during the fourth quarter of last year .
Rep. Barney Frank , Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said the AIG leaders who approved the bonuses should n’t stay in power .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said the payments do little to boost public confidence .
“ This is an outrage , ” Mr. McConnell said .
“ And for them to simply sit there and blame it on the previous administration or claim contract — we all know that contracts are valid in this country , but they need to be looked at . ”
AIG is paying out the executive bonuses to meet a Sunday deadline , but the troubled insurance giant has agreed to administration requests to restrain future payments .
The Treasury Department determined that the government did not have the legal authority to block the current payments by the company .
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has asked that the company scale back future bonus payments where legally possible , an administration official said Saturday .
This official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue , said that Mr. Geithner had called AIG Chairman Edward Liddy on Wednesday to demand that Mr. Liddy renegotiate AIG ’s current bonus structure .
Mr. Geithner termed the current bonus structure unacceptable in view of the billions of dollars of taxpayer support the company is receiving , this official said .
In a letter to Mr. Geithner dated Saturday , Mr. Liddy informed Treasury that outside lawyers had informed the company that AIG had contractual obligations to make the bonus payments and could face lawsuits if it did not do so .
Mr. Liddy said in his letter that “ quite frankly , AIG ’s hands are tied , ” although he said that in light of the company ’s current situation , he found it “ distasteful and difficult ” to recommend going forward with the payments .
Mr. Liddy said the company had entered into the bonus agreements in early 2008 before AIG got into severe financial straits and was forced to obtain a government bailout last fall .
The large bulk of the payments at issue cover AIG Financial Products , the unit of the company that sold credit default swaps , the risky contracts that caused massive losses for the insurer .
A white paper prepared by the company says that AIG is contractually obligated to pay a total of about $ 165 million of previously awarded “ retention pay ” to employees in this unit by Sunday .
The document says that another $ 55 million in retention pay has already been distributed to about 400 AIG Financial Products employees .
The company says in the paper it will work to reduce the amounts paid for 2009 and believes it can trim those payments by at least 30 percent .
Bonus programs at financial companies have come under harsh scrutiny after the government began loaning them billions of dollars to keep the institutions afloat .
AIG is the largest recipient of government support in the current financial crisis .
AIG also pledged to Mr. Geithner that it also would restructure $ 9.6 million in bonuses scheduled to go a group that covers the top 50 executives .
Mr. Liddy and six other executives have agreed to forgo bonuses .
The group of top executives getting bonuses will receive half of the $ 9.6 million now , with the average payment around $ 112,000 .
This group will get another 25 percent on July 14 and the final 25 percent on Sept. 15 .
But these payments will be contingent on the AIG board ’s determining that the company is meeting the goals the government has set for dealing with the company ’s financial troubles .
The Obama administration has vowed to put in place reforms in the $ 700 billion financial rescue program in an effort to deal with growing public anger over how the program was operated during the Bush administration .
That anger has focused in part on payouts of millions of dollars in bonuses by financial firms getting taxpayer support .
In his letter , Mr. Liddy told Mr. Geithner , “ We believe there will be considerably greater flexibility to reduce contractual payments in respect of 2009 and AIG intends to use its best efforts to do so . ”
But he also told Mr. Geithner that he felt it could be harmful to the company if the government continued to press for reductions in executive compensation .
“ We cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses , which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers , if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury , ” Mr. Liddy said .
Mr. Summers and Mr. McConnell appeared on ABC’s “ This Week With George Stephanopoulos ” ; Mr. Frank , on “ Fox News Sunday . ”

HANNAH FLEURY'S analysis of the objective interests of Israeli workers in her letter " What will win justice for Palestine ? " is spot on .
I think it 's crucial for Palestinian solidarity activists to have clarity on that question in order to build a strong boycott , divestment , sanctions ( BDS ) movement .
We need to be able to persuade well - meaning allies on the left against such soft Zionism .
I think part of the difficulty is that Israel is a colonial enterprise with unique historical qualities .
Those of us who unhesitatingly fight anti-Judaism and champion the self - determination of oppressed nationalities get accused of inconsistency when it comes to the Jewish state , and baseless accusations of anti-Semitism often follow .
There is much to be said about this .
However , deciding on how to relate to Israeli workers should take account of the actual history of the workers ' movement in Israel .
The Zionist labor movement led the colonization of Palestine .
A racist collective approach to settling the land was articulated as the best way to effect Palestinian dispossession .
The " socialist " veneer of the kibbutzim was engineered to motivate this goal .
Mapai ( the Israeli Workers ' Party , forerunner of Labor ) and its Histadrut ( the Israeli federation of trade unions ) were needed by the weak capitalist class to oversee construction of the economy and state .
This collaboration was called " constructive socialism . "
It has as much in common with internationalist workers ' power as Germany 's " National Socialism " did .
This class partnership has been at the root of what binds the left and right wings to the supremacy of the Zionist security state .
Needless to say , Palestinians face extreme discrimination in employment .
There is zero contradiction in progressives supporting Palestinian demands for their rights in direct opposition to the Zionism of Israeli workers .
It is our job to blast any liberal veneer from decades of racist murder .
Silas Wain , Carlisle , Pa .
The police officer suspended following the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests has been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter after a second postmortem examination showed the newspaper vendor did not die of a heart attack .
The findings released today show Tomlinson , who was thrown to the ground by a Met officer during the protests , died from an abdominal haemorrhage .
The dramatic shift led the Independent Police Complaints Commission to confirm that the officer under investigation in connection with the alleged assault had been questioned about manslaughter .
Tomlinson 's family believe today 's findings make a manslaughter charge against the officer more likely .
His son Paul King said : " First we were told that there had been no contact with the police , then we were told that he died of a heart attack ; now we know that he was violently assaulted by a police officer and died from internal bleeding .
As time goes on we hope that the full truth about how Ian died will be made known . "
Tomlinson , 47 , collapsed and died moments after being attacked from behind by a Metropolitan police territorial support group ( TSG ) officer on 1 April at about 7.20 pm .
The constable , whose identifying badge number was not on display , has not been identified .
He had been trying to make his way home from work when he was confronted by police , hit with a baton and thrown to the ground .
Initially , police said he had previously had no contact with the police , and alleged that medics were impeded from helping him as " a number of missiles – believed to be bottles – were being thrown at them " .
A couple of days later , the Guardian published a photograph of him lying at the feet of police officers , along with the testimony of three witnesses who described him being hit with a baton or thrown to the ground by police .
The IPCC criticised the Guardian for upsetting Tomlinson 's family and briefed other journalists that there was " nothing in the story " that he had been assaulted by an officer .
It was only when video footage emerged that the officer responsible was suspended and a criminal inquiry launched .
An initial postmortem , by the Home Office pathologist Dr Freddy Patel , found that Tomlinson died after suffering a heart attack .
But Dr Nat Cary , the pathologist who carried out a second postmortem at the request of the IPCC and Tomlinson 's family , concluded that while there was evidence Tomlinson suffered hardening of the arteries in his heart , it was not serious enough to kill him .
Jules Carey , of Tuckers , the solicitor representing Tomlinson 's family , said today that " the video footage of the unprovoked and vicious assault on Ian by the police officer would easily justify charges of assault being brought against the officer .
The findings of Dr Nat Cary significantly increase the likelihood that the officer will now face the more serious charge of manslaughter . "
He said the family had been aware of the findings of the second pathology report for a week and had been forced to endure " continuing reports in the press that Ian died of a heart attack " .
Carey added : " The IPCC opposed the disclosure of Dr Cary 's findings until they satisfied themselves that it would not prejudice their investigation of the officer .
It is of some comfort to the family that the record is now being put straight , but they hope that the IPCC investigation will be expedited and thorough , and that there will be a prompt referral to the CPS for charge . "
A statement from the City of London coroners court said : " Dr Cary 's opinion is that the cause of death was abdominal haemorrhage .
The cause of the haemorrhage remains to be ascertained .
Dr Cary accepts that there is evidence of coronary atherosclerosis but states that in his opinion its nature and extent is unlikely to have contributed to the cause of death . "
The IPCC has previously said CCTV footage showed Tomlinson walking up King William Street after 7 pm and approaching one of several police cordons opposite the Bank of England .
Denis O'Connor , the chief inspector of constabulary , who will carry out the review , said this week he would examine all aspects of the Met 's public order policing , including techniques such as kettling – the containment of thousands of protesters inside police cordons for hours at a time .
O'Connor has been called in by the Met commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , who said the move had been prompted by concern over policing of the G20 protests .
The Met will scour its own surveillance footage of the demonstrations in the City of London to search for further evidence of police misconduct .
Evidently I ’m not the only one who ’s seeing what ’s happening .
I ’ve been writing for years about how we ’re approaching a volatile social situation due to the tension between those with and those without .
My essay called “ A Future Divided ” loosely handles a number of scenarios along these lines , and a recent report from the U.N. just comes out and states it .
High levels of inequality can lead to negative social , economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies , ” said the report .
“ [ They ] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity .
The report goes on to talk about how race is a major factor in the inequality in U.S. cities , giving the example of New York as the 9th most unequal city in the world :
In western New York state nearly 40 % of the black , Hispanic and mixed - race households earned less than $ 15,000 compared with 15 % of white households .
The life expectancy of African - Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in China and some states of India , despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries .
I find it very odd that the Upper West Side in NYC is full of some of the richest people in the world , and yet it ’s surrounded by what equate to third world nations .
Walking around in Queens you can feel it .
The place is completely run down , people do n’t trust each other , and it seems most are struggling just to survive .
People are not happy , and the fact that the super - rich are a “ stone ’s throw ” away is catastrophe with a lot of potential energy .
To continue to ignore this is completely asinine .
The only solution is to lift everyone and eliminate the massive levels of inequality .
We have to take all steps necessary to stop creating more pain in the world ; it only magnifies at an exponential rate .
In short , the strategy of the elite to isolate themselves from the poor is not a strategy –just ask the French .
Former first lady Nancy Reagan praises Obama 's executive order regarding stem cell research .
Nancy Reagan praises Obama
Under fire from congressional Republicans for lifting restrictions on stem cell research , President Barack Obama got a powerful endorsement for his move Monday from Nancy Reagan , the former president ’s wife .
“ I ’m very grateful that President Obama has lifted the restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , ” she wrote in a statement released shortly after Obama reversed the Bush administration limits .
“ These new rules will now make it possible for scientists to move forward .
I urge researchers to make use of the opportunities that are available to them and to do all they can to fulfill the promise that stem cell research offers . "

Nancy Reagan has been an outspoken advocate of stem cell research — and scientists hope that the research could someday lead to a cure for Alzheimer ’s disease , which afflicted her late husband , Ronald Reagan .
Her statement also illustrates how support for the research crosses party lines , even though many in the anti-abortion movement strongly oppose the research on moral and ethical grounds .
Reagan continued , “ Countless people , suffering from many different diseases , stand to benefit from the answers stem cell research can provide .
We owe it to ourselves and to our children to do everything in our power to find cures for these diseases — and soon .
As I ’ve said before , time is short , and life is precious . ”
In a talk that a producer friend described as " Along with Rich Vogel 's talk , the two best hours of production talks ever at GDC , " Rod Fergusson , executive producer of Epic Games spoke about his methodology for producing Gears of War 2 .
His most salient point was that producers should work with the team to fix a release date early , once it 's possible to have a vision for the project scope , and then stick to that date , barring extreme circumstances .
In the traditional " iron triangle " of important elements of production , there 's schedule , scope , and resources .
Fergusson paraphrased Jim McCarthy , author of " The Dynamics of Software Development " in saying , " In software there are thousands of variable .
Every project has risks and issues .
But what if you could take just one of those variables , and fix it ?
Just lock it .
Hold it to a certain value , and let that help you gauge your other problems . "
For Fergusson , that variable is the schedule , but of course you need a belief that the ship date is both realistic and unchangeable .
" One of the great things is it creates a clear goal for the team , " he says .
It proves there 's an actual light at the end of the tunnel .
" They say you need constraints to have creativity and prioritization . "
To supplement this , at the beginning of Gears 2's development , 16 project areas were asked what they thought were the five most important things to push forward in the next game , compared to the first , and they used that list to define the actual feature scope and schedule .
These main points then should be grouped to form the " pillars " of the game , according to Fergusson .
This is essentially something like " engaging co-op experience , " which is supported by things like individual difficulty levels in co-op .
Pillars are good talking points for the press , and also help determine what 's going on the back of the box .
" If you ca n't talk to the press about ' here are the four most important things about the new game , ' you 're kind of lost , " he says .
Pillars also help when it comes time to cut or add features .
" The question is does it support a pillar ?
If someone comes and says I really like open - world ideas , we 're going to say well that 's great , but that 's not one of our pillars , " he says .
But if there 's something to add that really will support a pillar , he 's all for it .
Cut early , cut often is a mantra for many , and Fergusson believes this is necessary when managing scope .
At the same , time , do n't completely throw it away .
He gave an anecdote about an artist spending 45 days modeling an " Uber Reaver " for Gears 1 , but they realized they did n't have the time or resources to animate something that would only be in the game once .
However , they saved the model for the second game , and the work did n't go to waste .
Fergusson reminded attendees to always keep test burden in mind , as well .
What a programmer may call a " one- line change " is n't the only cost .
" It 's also it 's four weeks of five testers doing this test plan , " reminds Fergusson .
Crunch
" I am a believer that if you 're going to make a great game , and there is that caveat , I believe that crunch is necessary , " Fergusson says .
" I believe it 's important because it means your ambition is greater than what you scheduled out .
Going in with that idea that crunch is necessary means you can plan for it .
It should n't be a surprise .
Crunch should be driven by the ambition of the team , and not the inaccuracy of the schedule . "
But he cautions that crunch should be managed by milestones , or some other regular method .
" It 's a marathon , not a sprint , " he says , though realistically " It 's a marathon for a really long time , then at the end it is a sprint . "
He also believes in empathetic crunches .
" If we 're going to crunch early for something , we made them teamwide .
Everything can benefit from getting more done .
If the artists were on schedule , then they crunched and they got ahead . "
This sometimes led to more being added to the game , or simply more human resources later on .
At the end of the project though , they keep crunches as small as possible , because having fewer hands on the project later helps polish .
He cautions though , that people have limits .
" Working later than 2 am is a net loss .
The productivity of the person who 's doing that to themselves ultimately ends us costing them at the end of that week , " he says .
Epic has put a " go home law " in the company handbook as a result .
" Every crunch is different for every team , " he says .
" If you 're not doing it because of mistakes in the schedule , but through planning , it 's much easier to go to your team and ask them how they want to crunch . "
If they have that light at the end of the tunnel , in terms of a fixed launch date , crunch becomes much more manageable .

GOP Senator to AIG execs : ' Resign or commit suicide ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday March 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Grassley backtracks some on controversial remark Senator Charles Grassley delivered perhaps the most stinging rebuke yet to AIG executives responsible for their firm 's near collapse .
Rather than live in dishonor he suggested that the executives commit ritual suicide like the Japanese samurai of feudal times .
" I suggest , you know , obviously , maybe they ought to be removed , " said Grassley in a radio station interview Monday .
" But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they 'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say , I 'm sorry , and then either do one of two things : resign or go commit suicide . "
This is not the first time the Republican from Iowa , who is the top ranking GOP member of the Senate Finance Committee , has issued harsh criticisms of corporate executives but it 's the first time he 's suggested suicide .
" And in the case of the Japanese , they usually commit suicide before they make any apology , " Grassley said .
Grassley spokesman Casey Mills hastened to do damage control by saying that the senator is n't calling for AIG executives to kill themselves , according to a report from the Associated Press .
" Senator Grassley has said for some time now that generally speaking , executives who make a mess of their companies should apologize , as Japanese executives do , " Mills said .
" He says the Japanese might even go so far as to commit suicide but he does n't want U.S. executives to do that . "
The federal government owns 80 percent of AIG thanks to a $ 170 billion bailout .
The company lost $ 62 billion last quarter but that hasnt stopped AIG from deciding to issue $ 165 million in bonuses to the very division viewed responsible for the companys near collapse last year .
Public outrage at the bonuses is growing at an alarming rate .
On Tuesday , The Washington Post reported that AIG was concerned enough to station guards outside AIG Financial Products .
The Post reported that death threats and angry letters have flooded e-mail inboxes of the division , which is located in Connecticut .
" Irate callers lit up the phone lines .
Senior managers submitted their resignations .
Some employees did n't show up at all . "
" It 's a mob effect , " one senior executive said told The Post .
" It 's putting people 's lives in danger . "
 Some political analysts fear public anger has reached a tipping point ,  said CNN reporter Carol Costello .
 Voters are beyond angry and maybe even more leery of government bailouts and of course that could make things much more for difficult for President Obama although he and many others are trying to force AIG to give those bonuses back . 
AIG has said theres nothing it can do as it is bound by pre-existing contracts obligating it to pay out the bonuses to employees and executives .
AIG chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said voiding the bonuses could lead to serious legal , as well as business consequences ,  for the company .
Congress will hold a hearing on Wednesday that will cover the AIG bonuses .
Liddy is scheduled to testify .
 The auto workers had a contract to .
They re being asked to modify it ,  pointed out Rep. Carol Maloney ( D - NY ) to CNN , referencing the compromises agreed to by the United Auto Workers union that were necessary in order for the federal government to agree to the auto bailout in late 2008 .
Maloney has plans to introduce legislation that will tax any bonus compensation at 100 percent .
Update : Grassley says suicide remark was just rhetoric but backtracks later Grassley defended his controversial remark on Tuesday when he was asked about it by MSNBC's David Shuster .
" I hope you recognize rhetoric , " Grassley said .
" I should n't even have to answer that question ... This is n't the first time you heard me say this , that we need to have that deep bow before the American people with some sort of an apology , remorsefulness ...
Taxpayers are entitled to that and not giving out bonuses in this instance is a small recognition that things are n't right and that they owe the taxpayers a lot . "
Shuster , however continued to press Grassley for his suicide remark saying , " I think the issue is because so many Americans have had experience with suicide in their own lives or own families that it 's jarring to hear a member of the U.S. Senate bring it up .
I wonder if you regret that ? "
" I think I 've stated that you ought to be able to tell rhetoric when you hear it , " Grassley returned , still refusing to soften his statement .
However , Grassley backtracked not long after in a conference call with reporters where he said executives should n't commit suicide but should offer a formal apology to the public as is done by Japanese executives when caught in a scandal .
" What I 'm expressing here obviously is not that I want people to commit suicide .
That 's not my notion , " Grassley said Tuesday .
" But I do feel very strongly that we have not had statements of apology , statements of remorse , statements of contrition on the part of CEOs of manufacturing companies or banks or financial services or insurance companies that are asking for bailouts . "

Concerning the Release of Book Two
Okay folks , here 's the deal ....
Whatever release date you 've heard for book two is simply untrue .
There is no release date because the book is n't finished yet .
I 'm working on it right now .
Or rather , I would be working on it if I was n't writing this blog .
Yeah .
It sucks .
I wish it was finished too .
My life would be really great right now if book two were done .
I 've been avoiding writing this blog for a while .
It 's not fun to write , and it 's not going to be fun for most people to read .
The truth is , I 'd much rather work on the book .
But recently , a remarkably courteous and lucid e-mail from a fan made me realize that a lot of people out there are more curious than pissed about it .
So .
There 's the news .
The Wise Man's Fear wo n't be out for a while .
This wo n't come as a surprise to many of you .
Especially those who know not to trust everything Amazon says .
Plus , I 've been pretty open about the fact that I 'm still working on revisions .
You see , even if I finished the book today and it was perfect , it could n't be on the shelves by April .
It takes a long time to get a book into print .
Months and months .
There are a lot of steps .
Since many of you will be disappointed by this news , I figure the least I can do is explain why it 's taking so long .
If you do n't care about that , skip down to the bottom and check out " The Upside . "
That 's the good news .
For the curious among you , here are some of the reasons
My revisions are taking so long .
My book is long .
Over the last six weeks , I have written roughly 60,000 words .
Pretty good words if I do say so myself .
To give you a bit of perspective , there are entire novels that are only 60,000 words long .
Stardust , for example .
Coraline was only 30,000 words long .
( I mention these two because I just listened to an interview with Neil Gaiman . )
That means that since the beginning of the year , I 've already written an entire novel 's worth of text .
The Name of the Wind is bigger than that .
It was over 250,000 words .
The Wise Man's Fear is looking to be even longer , maybe more than 300,000 words .
Why did my book need these 60,000 words ?
Well , I realized part of the book was n't as well - developed and satisfying as it needed to be .
It needed more action , more tension , more detail .
It needed to be re-worked , expanded and generally betterized .
It took 60,000 words to do the job .
My book effectively ate an entire novel 's worth of text .
A short novel , admittedly .
But still , it gives a sense of perspective .
My book is different .
In case you had n't noticed , the story I 'm telling is a little different .
It 's a little shy on the Aristotelian unities .
It does n't follow the classic Hollywood
So what * is* the structure then ?
Fuck if I know .
That 's part of what 's taking me so long to figure out .
As far as I can tell , my story is part autobiography , part hero 's journey , part epic fantasy , part travelogue , part faerie tale , part coming of age story , part romance , part mystery , part metafictional - nested - story - frame - tale - something - or - other .
I am , quite frankly , making this up as I go .
If I get it right , I get something like The Name of the Wind .
Something that makes all of us happy .
But if I fuck it up , I 'll end up with a confusing tangled mess of a story .
Now I 'm not trying to claim that I 'm unique in this .
That I 'm some lone pioneer mapping the uncharted storylands .
Other authors do it too .
My point is that doing something like this takes more time that writing another shitty , predictable Lord of the Rings knockoff .
Sometimes I think it would be nice to write a that sort of book .
It would be nice to be able to use those well - established structures like a sort of recipe .
A map .
A paint - by - numbers kit .
It would be so much easier , and quicker .
But it would n't be a better book .
And it 's not really the sort of book I want to write .
I 'm still pretty new to all of this .
Two years ago , I was a part - time teacher .
I was poor , obscure , and pretty content to stay that way .
I learned to write as a happy , carefree nobody .
No deadlines .
No editors .
No stress .
Since then I have somehow become an international bestselling author .
I 've paid off my credit card debt .
I own a house .
I own a car .
I get fanmail and invitations to conventions .
And , honestly , for big parts of this time I have been pretty miserable .
The reason for this is Psyke 101 simple .
Stress is caused by change , and the last two years of my life have been nothing but change .
Some bad .
Some good .
But it all boils down to the stress of suddenly having a completely different life .
It 's taken me the better part of these two years to get my feet under me again .
It 's been hard for me to get back to the familiar headspace where my good writing happens .
I 'm glad to say I seem to have finally made it .
My writing is finally going well .
I 've made great additions to the book over the last three months , where before that when I sat down to write it was like masturbating with a cheese grater .
( Vaguely amusing , but mostly painful . )
Not only do I seem to be back in my happy place , but I 've managed to do it without destroying my relationship , developing a substance abuse problem , or getting all twisted up and bitter inside .
I 'm pretty pleased about that .
Best of all , I feel like myself again .
But it was a long , slow while in coming .
I am obsessive .
A week or so ago , I wrote a sentence that was n't quite right .
It bothered me like a popcorn husk stuck in the back of my throat .
The problem was the word ' girlish . '
It was n't the right word .
Close , but not right .
I thought about it when I went to bed that night .
I thought about it in the shower .
And the next day when I was driving into town to buy groceries it came to me .
' Childlike . '
That was it .
The perfect word .
You need to understand that I am a freak , and words are just the tip of the iceberg .
The order of scenes , characterization , tension and subplot .
I obsess about these things .
I do n't want them good .
I want them perfect .
I like to think this obsessive attention to every little thing is a part of what makes my books worth reading twice .
Worth telling your friends about .
Worth writing smutty yaoi fanfic about .
But it takes time .
One word down .
299,999 to go .
I have a life .
Last but not least , I do have a life .
I have everyday things that need doing .
I have a sidewalk to shovel , a lawn to rake , groceries to buy , and dishes to do .
These things take time .
Okay .
I lie .
Sarah does the dishes .
I have a job .
Part of that is writing book two , true .
But part of it is also working with my foreign translators .
We 've sold The Name of the Wind in 27 countries so far , and there are a lot of seemingly innocent things in the first book that are important later on .
I have to try to make sure these things are not lost in translation .
That takes time .
Part of my job is also going to conventions , doing readings or workshops .
I have taxes to manage .
( And I fucked that up this year , let me tell you . )
Part of my job is talking with movie people , or game people , or comic book people .
This takes time .
Also , I like to have fun .
I have a girlfriend who is good at kissing .
I like to play boardgames .
I enjoy role playing , though I do n't get much chance these days .
I like reading books and watching movies .
These things are important .
Without them I would become a dry , joyless husk of a man .
A dry , joyless husk cannot write a book that is full of wonderful things .
" Gee Pat , what can I do to help ? "
Goodness .
What a considerate question .
Thanks for asking .
In concrete terms , there 's not much you can do to speed book two along .
Ultimately , nobody can write it but me .
That said , it would be nice if everyone was conscious of the fact that I am a person , not a whirling machine that does nothing but churn out
It would also be nice if folks avoided bitching to me about the delay .
It 's really counterproductive .
I actually do read all my e-mail and the comments on my blog .
When someone goes out of their way to snipe and bitch at me ...
Well , the best possible outcome is that it makes me tired and depressed .
At worst it makes me think things like , " You little fucker , I 'll be damned if I write you a book !
I 'm going to play Spore for 15 hours just to spite you ! "
Now I 'm not saying you can't be pissed .
Feel free .
And I 'm not saying you should n't express those honest emotions .
Do n't keep it bottled up .
It 's not healthy .
What I * am * asking is that you do n't bring your frothy rage round here to my house .
Screed away on your own blog , curse my name on a discussion board , punch your pillow .
By all means , vent your spleen .
Just do n't vent it at me .
It makes me hurty inside .
I say that as a joke , but like most jokes it has a grain of truth to it .
That 's the reason I 've turned the comments off for this blog .
I know they would break down roughly like this :
30 considerate , supportive comments .
20 touching , heartfelt comments .
15 funny comments
10 comments saying , " Meh , I already knew . "
5 passive - aggressive snarks masquerading as one of the above .
1 comment from some anonymous frothy dickhole .
And you know which comment I 'd focus on ?
Yeah .
The last one .
It would sit there like a steaming turd in my bowl of cereal .
It does n't matter how delicious the cereal is .
It could be Fruity Pebbles , or even Cookie Crisp .
But in a situation like this it does n't matter .
You can't just eat around it .
All you can do is focus on the turd .
That 's why I 've turned the comments off for today .
I 'm really fond of y'all .
Over this last year , interacting with my readers has been one of the true , rare joys in my life .
You have shown yourselves to be intelligent , funny , and generous .
And many of you continuously surprise me with how are gracious and kind - hearted you can be .
Many of you are enthusiastic to the point where it gives me a tingle .
I 'm not just glad to have you as readers , I 'm proud to have you as readers .
You are my Cookie Crisp , and I do n't want one turd to spoil how I feel about you .
Good lord .
I 'm pretty sure I just wrote a completely new sentence .
I 'd be willing to bet what I just wrote up there has never , ever been said before in the history of history .
Hallmark should turn that into a Sweetest Day card .
I 'd buy one .
Okay .
We good here ?
Yeah .
We 're good .
Let 's move on to ....
The upside .
A while back , I was thinking to myself , " This fictional release date is going to cause problems .
My lovely readers will be powerfully ensaddened .
What could I possibly do to ease the sting of it a little ? "
Then someone sent me a
So here is the silver lining .
I 'm going to hold a lottery , and the winner will get to have their name in book two .
Maybe your name , or your mom's , or your kid's .
Your choice .
Now I 'm not saying that I 'll stick * any * name in .
If your WOW character is named Wonkerbee Bumchuck , it just wo n't work .
But I 'm sure the two of us will be able to get to a place where you 're happy , and the name is a welcome addition to The Wise Man's Fear rather than something that compromises the integrity of the story .
I 'm still working out the mechanics .
But it will be free , and it will be open for everyone .
When I get all the details worked out , I 'll make an announcement here on the blog .
This is my way of apologizing for the delay .
It 's also my way of thanking you all for being gracious and patient with me .
This I appreciate more than words can say .
Fondly ,
pat
Okay folks , here 's the deal .... Whatever release date you 've heard for book two is simply untrue .
There is no release date because the book is n't finished yet .
I 'm working on it right now .
Or rather , I would be working on it if I was n't writing this blog .
Yeah .
It sucks .
I wish it was finished too .
My life would be really great right now if book two were done .
I 've been avoiding writing this blog for a while .
It 's not fun to write , and it 's not going to be fun for most people to read .
The truth is , I 'd much rather work on the book .
But recently , a remarkably courteous and lucid e-mail from a fan made me realize that a lot of people out there are more curious than pissed about it .
So .
There 's the news .
wo n't be out for a while .
This wo n't come as a surprise to many of you .
Especially those who know not to trust everything Amazon says .
Plus , I 've been pretty open about the fact that I 'm still working on revisions .
You see , even if I finished the book today and it was perfect , it could n't be on the shelves by April .
It takes a long time to get a book into print .
Months and months .
There are a lot of steps .
Since many of you will be disappointed by this news , I figure the least I can do is explain why it 's taking so long .
If you do n't care about that , skip down to the bottom and check out " The Upside . "
That 's the good news .
For the curious among you , here are some of the reasons
My revisions are taking so long .
Over the last six weeks , I have written roughly 60,000 words .
Pretty good words if I do say so myself .
To give you a bit of perspective , there are entire novels that are only 60,000 words long .
Stardust , for example .
Coraline was only 30,000 words long .
( I mention these two because I just listened to an interview with Neil Gaiman . ) That means that since the beginning of the year , I 've already written an entire novel 's worth of text .
The Name of the Wind is bigger than that .
It was over 250,000 words .
The Wise Man's Fear is looking to be even longer , maybe more than 300,000 words .
Why did my book need these 60,000 words ?
Well , I realized part of the book was n't as well - developed and satisfying as it needed to be .
It needed more action , more tension , more detail .
It needed to be re-worked , expanded and generally betterized .
It took 60,000 words to do the job .
My book effectively ate an entire novel 's worth of text .
A short novel , admittedly .
But still , it gives a sense of perspective .
In case you had n't noticed , the story I 'm telling is a little different .
It 's a little shy on the Aristotelian unities .
It does n't follow the classic Hollywood three - act structure .
It 's not like a five - act Shakespearean play .
It 's not like a Harlequin romance So what * is* the structure then ?
Fuck if I know .
That 's part of what 's taking me so long to figure out .
As far as I can tell , my story is part autobiography , part hero 's journey , part epic fantasy , part travelogue , part faerie tale , part coming of age story , part romance , part mystery , part metafictional - nested - story - frame - tale - something - or - other .
I am , quite frankly , making this up as I go .
If I get it right , I get something like The Name of the Wind .
Something that makes all of us happy .
But if I fuck it up , I 'll end up with a confusing tangled mess of a story .
Now I 'm not trying to claim that I 'm unique in this .
That I 'm some lone pioneer mapping the uncharted storylands .
Other authors do it too .
My point is that doing something like this takes more time that writing another shitty , predictable Lord of the Rings knockoff .
Sometimes I think it would be nice to write a that sort of book .
It would be nice to be able to use those well - established structures like a sort of recipe .
A map .
A paint - by - numbers kit .
It would be so much easier , and quicker .
But it would n't be a better book .
And it 's not really the sort of book I want to write .
Two years ago , I was a part - time teacher .
I was poor , obscure , and pretty content to stay that way .
I learned to write as a happy , carefree nobody .
No deadlines .
No editors .
No stress .
Since then I have somehow become an international bestselling author .
I 've paid off my credit card debt .
I own a house .
I own a car .
I get fanmail and invitations to conventions .
And , honestly , for big parts of this time I have been pretty miserable .
The reason for this is Psyke 101 simple .
Stress is caused by change , and the last two years of my life have been nothing but change .
Some bad .
Some good .
But it all boils down to the stress of suddenly having a completely different life .
It 's taken me the better part of these two years to get my feet under me again .
It 's been hard for me to get back to the familiar headspace where my good writing happens .
I 'm glad to say I seem to have finally made it .
My writing is finally going well .

( CNN ) --
The pastor of a Maryville , Illinois , church was shot to death during a service Sunday in front of horrified church members who then tackled the gunman , state police said .
The Web site for the First Baptist Church of Maryville , Illinois , includes a photo of the Rev. Fred Winters .
Fred Winters , the pastor of the First Baptist Church , was shot and killed during the 8 a.m. service , and the attacker and two church members suffered knife wounds in the attack , authorities said .
The gunman entered during the service and walked up to the pulpit .
Winters and the gunman apparently exchanged words before the 27 - year - old man fired four shots , hitting the pastor 's Bible and then the pastor , said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent .
" The only thing we know is that the suspect said something to the pastor , and the pastor said something back to him -- we do n't know what that was , " Trent told reporters Sunday afternoon .
" It was almost as if the pastor may have recognized him , but we 're not sure about that at all . "
The gunman 's . 45 - caliber pistol jammed after he shot Winters , Trent said .
The man then pulled out a knife before being tackled by some of about 150 worshippers attending the service in southern Illinois , near St. Louis , Missouri .
Watch the aftermath of the church shooting »
Earlier reports from authorities said the man may have turned the knife on himself , but Trent said that was not confirmed .
" When he was tackled by two of the members , we do n't know whether he fell on the knife , injuring himself at the time , or whether [ his injury ] was self - inflicted during the struggle , " Trent said .
Two of those who went after the attacker suffered injuries that are n't life - threatening , while the suspect 's injuries are " very serious , " Illinois state police spokesman Ralph Timmins said .
Witness Claudia Bohley told CNN affiliate KSDK - TV in St. Louis that she was in the church 's foyer waiting for the service to begin when she heard " pop , pop , pop . ...
We just could n't imagine what had happened . "
She said she ran into the sanctuary and saw what looked like paper scattered on the pulpit .
She said she was later told that a bullet hit Winters ' Bible .
" It was like confetti .
It went everywhere , " she said .
" People were down on their knees and on the floor , screaming and praying . "
She described Winters -- who is pictured on the church 's
Web site along with his wife and two children -- as " such a pleasant pastor . "
Trent said police are still trying to determine a motive in the shooting and that church members did not recognize the gunman .
St. Louis University Hospital spokeswoman Laura Keller told CNN three males , including the suspect , were brought to the hospital .
One was dead on arrival , she said , but the hospital was not releasing names and ages .
She said the second was in an operating room and the third was the suspect , whose condition was not immediately available .
Trent said one of two wounded church members was treated and released .
Trent called the actions of the two wounded church members " heroic , " saying they took quick action when others " were understandably stuck to their seats . "
Phone calls to the church office went unanswered Sunday .
A posting on the church 's Web site said a prayer vigil would be held at 6 p.m. at Metro Community Church in Edwardsville , Illinois , about six miles north of Maryville .
First Baptist Church is fairly large , with about 1,000 members , KSDK reported .
The church holds four Sunday services .
Timmins said many of the people attending the service remained for hours afterward , as police were conducting interviews .
The Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation 's first in a church since July , when a 58 - year - old man opened fire in a Knoxville , Tennessee , church during a children 's play .
Two people were killed and six wounded in that shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church .
In the Tennessee case , Jim Adkisson told police he targeted the church because of its " liberal teachings , " according to court papers .
Adkisson pleaded guilty last month in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and will face life in prison without parole , court officials said .
Police said the Maryville congregation had a plan in place , including a protocol for lockdown , in the event of an incident such as Sunday 's attack .

Der jüngste , heise online vorliegende Entwurf für eine Gesetzesinitiative der Bundesregierung zum Sperren kinderpornographischer Webseiten enthält im Vergleich zum vorherigen Arbeitsentwurf gravierende Änderungen .
Dem
Text des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums zufolge sollen die Zugangsanbieter die geplanten Stopp - Seiten nun selbst hosten .
Außerdem dürfen sie Zugriffs - IP - Adressen erheben und auf Anforderung an Strafverfolgungsbehörden weitergeben .
Die Beschlussvorlage der Bundesregierung soll am Mittwoch vom Bundeskabinett verabschiedet werden .
Sie dürfte bei Datenschützern für neuerlichen Unmut sorgen : Selbst auf dem stilisierten Stopp - Schild , welches das Bundesfamilienministerium bisher für die heftig umstrittene vertragliche Blockadelösung mit fünf Providern vorgesehen hat , ist bislang nachzulesen , dass vom federführenden Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) keine IP - Adressen oder andere Identifizierungsdaten aufbewahrt werden sollen .
Nicht mehr enthalten ist in dem überarbeiteten Dokument zudem die zunächst geplante Beschränkung der Sperrliste auf außereuropäische Webseiten .
Vielmehr ist im Entwurf für einen neuen Paragraphen 8a Telemediengesetz ( TMG ) nun die Rede von " vollqualifzierten Domainnamen , Internetprotokoll - Adressen und Zieladressen von Telemedienangeboten " .
Einbezogen werden sollen zudem nicht nur kinderpornographische Darstellungen an sich , sondern auch Webseiten , " deren Zweck darin besteht , auf derartige Telemedienangebote zu verweisen " .
Falls nach Inkrafttreten der Regelung auch Whistleblower - Plattformen wie Wikileaks.org aufgrund der bereits wiederholt erfolgten Veröffentlichung von Sperrvorgaben anderer Länder von Anfang an auf die schwarze Liste aufgenommen würde , könnten somit auch Nutzer dieser Seiten auf dem Umweg über die Provider ins Visier der Strafverfolger geraten .
Dazu kommt die Anforderung einer anonymisierten Statistik .
Hierzu sollen die Diensteanbieter eine Aufstellung anfertigen , in der die Anzahl der Zugriffsversuche jeweils bezogen auf einen einzelnen Eintrag der Sperrliste zusammengefasst über jede Stunde der zurückliegenden Woche angegeben wird .
Die Aufstellung wird einmal pro Woche dem BKA zu übermitteln sein .
Neu ist auch das Anerkenntnis , dass die im Raum stehende Maßnahme in Grundrechte der Surfer eingreifen könnte .
Allerdings glaubt die Bundesregierung , dem Grundgesetz mit dem " Zitiergebot " des insbesondere betroffenen Fernmeldegeheimnisses Genüge zu tun .
Im Entwurf heißt es dazu lapidar , dass der entsprechende Artikel 10 der Verfassung eingeschränkt wird .
Der Kreis der zur Sperrung verpflichteten Provider soll nunmehr auf " privatrechtliche Anbieter " begrenzt werden , die den Zugang zu einem öffentlichen Kommunikationsnetz für mindestens 10.000 Teilnehmer oder andere Nutzungsberechtigte ermöglichen .
Außen vor bleiben sollen demnach – augenscheinlich aus Kostengründen – bewusst " alle staatlichen Einrichtungen wie Behörden , Bibliotheken , Universitäten oder Schulen " .
Ausgerechnet dort soll also der Entwurfsbegründung zufolge nicht gesperrt werden .
Die von Gegnern des Vorhabens vielfach ins Feld geführte leichte Umgehungsmöglichkeit der " Zugangserschwernis " wird damit noch einmal deutlich vor Augen geführt .
Zur Verteidigung gegen diese Kritik schreibt das Kabinett klipp und klar , dass " die Vorschrift auf eine Handlungspflicht ausgerichtet ist , nicht auf einen Erfolg " .
Es sei schließlich nach dem gegenwärtigen Stand der Technik nicht auszuschließen , " dass der Zugang zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten trotz der Sperrmaßnahmen der Anbieter nicht vollständig verhindert werden kann " .
Es sei aber " bereits viel erreicht , wenn solche Angebote nicht ohne Weiteres zugänglich sind " .
Konkret wird weiterhin zumindest eine Sperre auf der Ebene des Domain Name Systems ( DNS ) auf Basis vollqualifizierter Webadressen verlangt .
Den Diensteanbietern bleibe es jedoch " unbenommen , sich für eine andere Sperrtechnik mit größerer Eingriffstiefe zu entscheiden " .
In Kraft treten soll das Gesetz schon am Tage nach seiner Verkündung .
Die sonst übliche Übergangsklausel für die Anpassung von Geschäftsprozessen entfällt .
Zur allgemeinen Begründung des Vorstoßes beruft sich die Bundesregierung einmal mehr vor allem auf die Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik , wonach bei der Besitzverschaffung von Kinderpornographie über das Internet von 2006 auf 2007 ein Zuwachs von 111 Prozent zu verzeichnen sei .
Bilder im Internet würden zunehmend Gewaltausübungen gegen Kleinkinder oder sogar Kleinstkinder zeigen , " die schwer missbraucht und misshandelt werden " .
Der Großteil der Kinderpornographie im Web werde mittlerweile über kommerzielle Server verbreitet , die in Drittländern außerhalb der EU lägen .
Die zuletzt genannte
These sowie die Belastbarkeit der genannten Zahlen werden von Experten aber stark in Zweifel gezogen , wie c't in seiner aktuellen Ausgabe berichtet .

An Australian film about Lebanese gangs has been pulled from Greater Union cinemas in Sydney after violent outbursts at early screenings .
The Combination is the first Australian film release of the year and has been receiving rave reviews for its gritty portrayal of life in Sydney 's west .
The distributor for the film was informed of the decision by Greater Union last night .
Allanah Zitserman from Australian Film Syndicate says Greater Union decided to stop screening the film after several brawls occurred at western Sydney cinemas after the movie was shown .
" I understand there has been some isolated incidents at the Parramatta Greater Union by a very small minority group that has forced Greater Union to make the unprecedented decision in the third day of its release to pull the film , " she said .
Ms Zitserman says the film 's cast and crew are devastated by the decision , but can understand why it has happened .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A cheap ingredient used in ice cream , cosmetics and found in breast milk helps protect monkeys against infection with a virus similar to AIDS and might work to protect women against the virus , researchers reported on Wednesday .
The compound , called glycerol monolaurate , or GML , appears to stop inflammation and helps keep away the cells the AIDS virus usually infects , the researchers said .
While it does not provide 100 percent protection , it might greatly reduce a woman ’s risk of being infected , and she could use it privately and without hurting her chances of pregnancy , the researchers reported in the journal Nature .
And it costs pennies a dose , Ashley Haase and Pat Schlievert of the University of Minnesota reported .
“ For years , people have used the compound as an emulsifying agent in a variety of foods ... it is in breast milk , ” Schlievert told reporters in a telephone briefing .
GML is being considered as an additive to tampons because it interferes with bacteria , particularly those that can cause a potentially fatal infection called toxic shock syndrome .
If it can be shown to work safely in women , GML might provide the first easy route to a microbicide -- a gel or a cream that women could use vaginally to protect themselves from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV , which causes AIDS .
HIV infects 33 million people globally and has killed 25 million .
It is transmitted sexually , in blood and breast milk .
In Africa , it is most commonly passed during heterosexual contact .

PROTECTING WOMEN
AIDS experts say many victims are married women whose husbands will not use condoms and who are often trying to have children .
They need a safe and private way to protect themselves .
A microbicide ( pronounced my - CROW - buh - side ) might also protect men who have sex with men .
Haase and Schlievert ’s team tested GML , carried in KY jelly , in macaque monkeys .
They put the gel into the vaginas of the monkeys and then applied SIV , a monkey version of HIV .
Four out of five monkeys never became infected and tests showed GML affected the immune response .
HIV is particularly hard to fight because it infects the very immune cells the body uses to attack a virus .
When HIV infects an area such as the vagina , the CD4 T - cells rush to defend against it .
The body sends out signaling chemicals called cytokines to call in more T - cells .
HIV can then infect them all and spread through the body .
GML appears to stop the cytokine call for help and stops so many T - cells from rushing to the area , Haase and Schlievert said .
This in turn reduces the opportunity for HIV to take hold .
“ This result represents a highly encouraging new lead in the search for an effective microbicide to prevent HIV transmission that meets the criteria of safety , affordability and efficacy , ” they wrote .
Even if it was only 60 percent effective , such a gel could prevent 2.5 million HIV cases over three years , they said .
They said they plan to study their gel in more monkeys for longer periods of time to ensure the gel is not simply delaying infection rather than preventing it .
As European Union leaders gather for a Brussels summit on Saturday , pressure is growing for a co-ordinated financial support package for central and eastern Europe .
Where is it needed most ?
Much of “ emerging ” Europe shared decades of communist mismanagement , painful 1990s transition , then rapid growth .
Now crisis has struck , it is more vital than ever not to view this as a homogenous region Some countries are far more vulnerable than others .
For a rough guide , look at current account deficits .
Countries that ran up deficits exceeding 10 per cent of gross domestic product last year – notably the Baltic states of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , plus Bulgaria and Romania – are most at risk .
As UBS notes , they score highly on risk measures including short - term debt , increase in credit since 2001 , and the gap between 12 - month external financing needs and foreign exchange reserves .
The lower - deficit countries , Poland , Turkey , the Czech Republic and euro members Slovenia and Slovakia , are in better shape .
( Russia , owing to soaring energy and commodity prices , ran up a current account surplus ) .
While Russia , Poland and Turkey have the largest short - term external debts in absolute terms , they are among the smallest as a proportion of output .
But two countries with mid-range deficits – Hungary and Ukraine – have already had to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund .
Hungary has one of the largest debt - to - output ratios .
For Ukraine , poleaxed by collapsing steel demand , five - year credit default swap spreads have leapt to 3,900 basis points as political infighting has thrown its IMF programme into doubt .
How much will the region need ?
A €24.5 bn package to banks unveiled yesterday by international financial institutions is only a start .
Under pessimistic scenarios for capital inflows in 2009 , the estimate by Hungary ’s prime minister , calling for a $ 230 bn regional support programme , looks closer to the mark .

Professional journalists in the age of the internet look as doomed as blacksmiths in the age the combustion engine .
Local newspapers are disappearing .
National newspapers and commercial TV stations are seeing the web take their advertisers .
Even the gloomiest forecasters expect there will still be a few reporters around in 2025 , but as with blacksmiths , we will be curiosities .
There is no point arguing against the inevitable and many optimists believe that the destruction of the old order should be welcomed .
In Here Comes Everybody , Clay Shirky celebrates the switch to a democratic world where publishing costs next to nothing and anyone with access to a computer can write for an audience which in theory extends to everyone with a computer on the planet .
He quotes the example of Alisara Chirapongse , a marvellous Thai student who blogged mainly about fashion .
Her readership was tiny , until the 2006 Thai military coup .
Chirapongse ignored a news blackout and described life in Bangkok .
She posted photos of mutinous troops on her website and organised a campaign against the army 's attempts at censorship .
When the crisis was over , international admirers left and she went back to sharing thoughts with her friends .
Newspaper correspondents in Thailand may have been censored by the military .
If their editors had sent them in from London , they may not have known the language or understood Thai politics .
It is possible that Alisara 's writing was not only equal to the work of her professional rivals but superior and more widely read .
Why , then , mourn the passing of the hack ?
The best reason for wanting my colleagues to survive is that serious reporters and broadcasters offer a guarantee that what they say is true .
If they stray , their editors impose journalistic standards and insist on objectivity .
They may not have the best or fullest story or the most vivid account , but readers should be able to assume their work is reliable , while a blogger 's commitment to objectivity can never be assumed .
The BBC offers the most comprehensive guarantee .
Politicians and lobbyists want to influence it more than any other news organisation because , despite occasional lapses , its reporters have earned the right to be believed .
The corporation should be becoming the most important news institution not merely in Britain but the world .
The technological changes that are wrecking the profitability of newspapers and commercial TV in all advanced countries mean that many will think hard before sending a reporter to cover the next coup in Thailand .
The BBC , whose £ 3bn income is guaranteed by the state , should have no comparable worries .
Yet far from looking like confident men and women ready to fill the gaps left by their retreating competitors , BBC journalists are a harried and miserable bunch .
This week , they will strike over a threat to jobs in Asian branches of the World Service .
Despite the obscurity of the cause , union members voted 77 % in favour of action because they fear that they will be next .
To use old - fashioned language , they are caught in a class war .
Wealthy managers , 50 of whom earn more than the prime minister , have turned on their less fortunate subordinates .
After Jonathan Ross 's obscene phone calls , the management made reporters go on childish courses to teach them how to be good boys and girls , even though the scandal had nothing to do with them .
At the March meeting of the BBC Trust , Mark Thompson , the director - general , described how he had cut 7,200 jobs since 2005 and was planning to cut another 1,200 .
South America , West Africa and much of Europe are barely covered , while the best British programmes are downsized .
Managers have reduced the number of journalists working for Radio 4 's Today from 17 to seven .
After imposing years of cost squeezes , they are insisting that Newsnight accept a further 12.5 % reduction in its budget .
At the morning conference on what the news agenda of the day should be , editors do n't always listen to their reporters but run after stories from the Mail , Guardian and Telegraph .
Every newspaper editor I know is trying to think of ways to maintain reporting standards , but they fear they are fighting a losing battle .
The BBC is not thinking about how it will cope if one day the Mail , Guardian and Telegraph do n't have any stories .
The net is partly to blame for the downgrading of journalism , but not , for once , because it is destroying a news organisation 's business model .
The BBC has willingly poured hundreds of millions into developing its online sites and iPlayer , while getting as far away as possible from the democratic hopes of Shirky .
He justifies his enthusiasm by describing the writers and networkers who have used technology to campaign against abuses of power .
In other words , he cares about content as much as process .
The BBC is so uninterested in content that it is sacking its content providers or journalists as we used to call them .
The paradox of the BBC 's strategy is that the more it spends on expanding into cyberspace the less it has to say .
Once , the disputes within the corporation would have been a local affair .
Now , as traditional media contract , they are of national and maybe international importance .
No rival can fill the gaps if the BBC pulls back from comprehensive reliable reporting .
Soon , if its camera crews do not go to Nigeria , no one else 's will .
All over the world , there are Alisara Chirapongses providing breadth and depth , which we never experienced in the 20th century .
They find it harder to provide a solid record of events , which others can refer to and move on from .
Critics of the BBC say that it is using the power of its protected status to take audiences from its rivals and there 's some truth in that .
They should be as worried about the type of BBC its managers are creating and how patchy and thin its news coverage is becoming .
In this time of upheaval , the BBC has a public duty to invest and broadcast the journalism that others cannot afford .
It is failing spectacularly to live up to its responsibilities .

Push Comes to Shove Comes to Whack - A - Mole : FSF Suit Against Cisco
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 11 , 2008
On previous occasions it 's been mentioned that it takes very specific behaviors for the Free Software Foundation to file suit against a company for violating the GNU GPL license .
Today , the FSF let Cisco Systems know in no uncertain terms that line had been crossed .
The complaint centers on the Linksys brand routers , and the firmware used on those products .
Brett Smith , the licensing compliance engineer at the FSF said that in 2003 , the FSF was notified that the Linksys WRT54G used GPL / LGPL licensed code in its firmware , but customers were n't getting the source code that these licenses required Cisco supply .
He said that initially , Cisco seemed willing to work with the FSF to put procedures in place so that its products -- at the time , and in the future -- would comply with the license terms the firmware used .
Over the course of five years , a compliance plan never materialized .
As the FSF investigated the Linksys WRT54G complaint , it was receiving license violation reports regarding other Cisco products .
Smith says that new issues were being brought up before the older ones could be addressed , resulting in " ... a five - years - running game of Whack - A - Mole . "
Though the Linksys site does offer source code ( according to the FSF , a somewhat more than cursory site search is n't turning up any results for me ) , the code is reportedly out of date or incomplete .
Many Cisco customers report that formal written requests for source code ( searching the Linksys site for source code did yield technical support contact information ) frequently remain unaddressed .
FSF 's complaint against Cisco was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York this morning by the Software Freedom Law Center ( which will be representing the FSF in this case ) .
A copy of the complaint ( including a list of the code involved ) is available in PDF format on the FSF website .
With the growing popularity of social networking comes a growing list of social search engines that can turn up all kinds of embarrassing and potentially invasive information about you .
The issue raises questions about what other revealing information is out there and what can be done to protect oneself .
Besides making online stalking easy , specialized search engines are making it increasingly easier to combine socially shared information together into a highly detailed profile of our virtual lives .
These specialized search engines go by a variety of terms such as " social search " utilities or " people search " utilities and many of them brag of their ability to search deeper than even Google .
The Social People Search Engine
Spokeo , pipl and CVGadget are a few examples of specialized social engines .
Harrison Tang , founder and CEO of Spokeo , a social people search engine , says despite what people think , there is actually a lot of information on the Internet not crawled by Google .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Specialized people search engines like Spokeo , pipl and CVGadget are designed to let you dig up information on friends , foes or anyone else you care to search for .
Spokeo , unlike many other services , lets you import your email address book and for a small monthly fee , continually monitors your contacts and notifies you when anyone does anything new , anywhere online .
Aggregated Identities Result In A New Identity
The portfolio compiled by all the accumulated information can be potentially damaging for just about anyone .
Tang notes that a lot of people know they have a public MySpace page and a public Twitter album .
Some may not realize that when all the information from both services is bundled together , it creates a new , aggregated identity .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Spokeo tracks a person 's activity on a few dozen services , from basic blogs , social networks , photo and video - sharing sites , as well as less obvious sources such as Amazon Wish Lists , Pandora playlists , and movie - rating sites .
Prying Under The Guise Of Market Research
There are other services that access the same information and then sell it under the guise of marketing research .
Rapleaf , a highly visible ' data and people lookup ' company , gets paid thousands of dollars for compiling detailed social profiles of individuals in their own customer database .
( Source : pcworld.com )
All the information assembled by specialty search engines such as Spokeo is publicly available .
Companies like Rapleaf just bring it all together and are allegedly trying to understand how to use social media more effectively for specialized marketing .
Having all that information accumulated in one place creates some new privacy risks .

EARLIER this month , two judges in Pennsylvania 's Luzerne County admitted sentencing thousands of children to jail in return for kickbacks from a prison - management company .
Judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan received a commission for every day they sent a child to private juvenile detention centres run by Pennsylvania Child Care and a sister company .
The pay - offs came to $ 2.6 m over seven years .
“ It just makes me think that anyone can betray the law , ” says Jamie Quinn , one of the children exploited by the judges .
Ms Quinn , from Scranton , was sent to juvenile prison for nine months at 14 , after slapping a friend who , she claims , slapped her first .
Hillary Transue , who is 15 and faced Mr Ciavarella without a lawyer , was sentenced to three months because she constructed a fake MySpace page ridiculing the assistant principal at her high school .
Her case led to the judges ' downfall ; children have a constitutional right to a lawyer , and the case first alerted Robert Schwartz , executive director of the Juvenile Law Centre .
His organisation exposed the larger crime .
Adam Graycar , of the Rutgers Institute on Corruption Studies , explains that what is really unusual about this tale is the scale of the corruption .
First the judges received monetary rewards for sanctioning the building of a new private - sector prison in their area .
Second , they were paid for closing a county - funded prison nearby .
And , then , of course , they offered up the “ juvenile delinquents ” for the benefit of the owners of the new jail .
Both judges were elected , not appointed .
The judges are going to jail , but the prison companies have so far avoided prosecution .
Mr Schwartz fears this is because Robert Powell , the former co-owner of Pennsylvania Child Care , has been co-operating with the authorities .
If the prisons get off , though , that will be another disgrace .

How MI5 colluded in my torture : Binyam Mohamed claims British agents fed Moroccan torturers their questions - WORLD EXCLUSIVE
MI5 directly colluded in the savage ' medieval ' torture in Morocco of Binyam Mohamed , the Guantanamo inmate who was last week released to live in Britain .
The revelation came as Mohamed broke his silence about the full horror of his seven years in detention in a compelling interview with The Mail on Sunday .
Documents obtained by this newspaper - which were disclosed to Mohamed through a court case he filed in America - show that months after he was taken to Morocco aboard an illegal ' extraordinary rendition ' flight by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency , MI5 twice gave the CIA details of questions they wanted his interrogators to put to him , together with dossiers of photographs .
7 - year ordeal : Binyam Mohamed near the home in the English countryside where he is trying to recover
At the time , in November 2002 , Mohamed was being subject to intense , regular beatings and sessions in which his chief Moroccan torturer , a man he knew as Marwan , slashed his chest and genitals with a scalpel .
Mohamed , 30 , who returned to Britain last month from Guantanamo Bay after seven years detained without charge , said that he reached his lowest ebb the moment he realised that Britain was conniving in his torture .
He said : ' They started bringing British files to the interrogations - not one , but several of them , thick binders , some of them containing sheaves of photos of people who lived in London and places there like mosques .
' It was obvious the British were feeding them questions about people in London .
' When I realised that the British were co-operating with the people who were torturing me , I felt completely naked .
' It was when they started asking the questions supplied by the British that my situation worsened .
They sold me out .'
His disclosures suggest that MI5 misled Parliament 's spy watchdog , the Intelligence and Security Committee .
Security Service witnesses told an inquiry by the committee in 2007 that it had no idea that Mohamed was subjected to ' extraordinary rendition ' .
The revelations will put Foreign Secretary David Miliband under even greater pressure to come clean about British involvement in the rendition and alleged torture of Muslim terror suspects .
Last month his lawyers persuaded the High Court not to allow parts of a judgement that summarised Mohamed 's treatment to be published , on the grounds that to do so would jeopardise Britian ’s intelligence - sharing relationship with America .
The judges agreed with great reluctance , saying that the suppressed section , which was based on admissions by American officials , amounted to evidence of torture , but contained nothing that could be described as sensitive intelligence .
Mr Milliband maintained that the new administration or President Obama was just as concerned about publication as its predecessor - but later he had to admit in the Commons that in fact he had not checked whether this was so .
According to the documents , MI5 knew Mohamed had not been transferred to any known U.S. base , and did not know his whereabouts , but still fed the CIA questions in the knowledge that while he must be in some ' third country ' , he was ultimately under CIA control .
The documents also show that MI5 officers held a ' case conference ' on Mohamed with their U.S. colleagues at MI5's London headquarters on September 30 , 2002 , when Mohamed 's torture in Morocco had been going on for weeks .
What was said at the conference remains unknown .
As late as February 2003 , MI5 received a report from the Americans of what Mohamed said under torture .
A copy of the report given to Mohamed has been heavily redacted ( blanked out ) .
David Davis , the former Shadow Home Secretary , demanded that Mr Miliband make a fresh parliamentary statement on the case .
' The Government can no longer continue to claim ignorance , ' he said .
' It is also time for an independent judicial inquiry .
Only then can we have confidence the British Government will not allow , condone or collude in torture or inhuman treatment in future . '
Speaking at a house in the English countryside where he has been staying since his release , Mohamed also described how he was interrogated by an MI5 officer in Pakistan in May 2002 , before his rendition to Morocco .
Mr Mohamed , pictured in an image released by human rights organisation Reprieve , says MI5 allegedly colluded in his torture
He said the officer knew he had already been tortured numerous times after his capture the previous month , with methods that included days of sleep deprivation , a mock execution and being beaten while being hung by his wrists for hours on end .
He said this torture in Pakistan made him confess to a plan that was never more than fantasy - to build a ' dirty ' radioactive bomb .
He also revealed the nightmarish physical torture inflicted on him in the CIA 's ' dark prison ' in Kabul , Afghanistan , where he was forced to listen , chained in total blackness , to the same music - a CD by rap artist Eminem , played at ear - splitting volume over and over again , 24 hours a day for a month .
That , he said , was when he came closest to losing his mind : ' It 's a miracle my brain is still intact . '
The strongest evidence of British collusion comes in the form of a confidential telegram sent from MI5 to the CIA on November 5 , 2002 .
Headed ' Request for further Detainee questioning , ' the telegram suggests its author was aware of the explosive consequences if details of the torture leaked out .
It said : ' This information has been communicated in confidence to the recipient government and shall not be released without the agreement of the British Government .
' We would be grateful if the following can be passed to Binyam Mohamed . '
The telegram asked that his interrogators show him and ask him questions about a ' photobook recently sent over ' .
Large portions of the rest of the telegram , which set out detailed questions , have been redacted , but it added : ' We would be grateful if the following could be put to Binyam Mohamed , in addition to the questioning above .
' Does Mohamed know [ two lines redacted ] ?
What was the man 's name ?
How does Mohamed know him ?
Can Mohamed describe him ?
Where did they meet ?
' Where was the man from ?
Who facilitated his travel from the UK ?
Where did this man go ?
What were his intentions ?
' We would appreciate the opportunity to pose further questions , dependent on answers given to the above . '
A further telegram sent by MI5 on November 11 was headed ' update request ' .
It too has been heavily redacted but the surviving portion states : ' We note that we have also requested that briefs be put to Binyam Mohamed and would appreciate a guide from you as to the likely timescale for these too .
' We fully appreciate that this can be a long - winded process , but the urgent nature of these enquiries will be obvious to you . '
The Foreign Office refused to comment on the allegations , on the grounds that MI5 officers accused of colluding in Mohamed 's torture may face criminal charges .
A spokesman said : ' The Attorney General is considering an allegation of criminal wrongdoing by British personnel .
' In these circumstances it would be wrong to make any comment and because of this we cannot discuss the points you raise . '
Now read the full , exclusive interview
The worst time in Binyam Mohamed 's seven - year ordeal in American captivity , worse even than the medieval tortures he endured for 18 months in Morocco , came in the first half of 2004 when he was held for five months at a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan .
Kabul 's dark prison was just that : a place where inmates spent their days and weeks in total blackness .
Other than during interrogations , which took place away from the cells , the only time the prisoners could see was in the brief moments when the guards used torches when bringing trays of food .
Finally released : Mr Mohamed arrives back in Britain at RAF Northolt after seven years in prison in Afghanistan , Morocco and Guantanamo Bay
' The toilet in the cell was a bucket .
Without light , you either find the bucket or you go on your bed , ' Mohamed says .
' There were loudspeakers in the cell , pumping out what felt like about 160 watts , a deafening volume , non -stop , 24 hours a day .
' They played the same CD for a month , The Eminem Show .
' It 's got about 20 songs on it and when it was finished it went back to the beginning and started again .
' While that was happening , a lot of the time , for hour after hour , they had me shackled .
' Sometimes it was in a standing position , with my wrists chained to the top of the door frame .
' Sometimes they were chained in the middle , at waist level , and sometimes they were chained at the bottom , on the floor .
' The longest was when they chained me for eight days on end , in a position that meant I could n't stand straight nor sit .
' I could n't sleep .
I had no idea whether it was day or night .
' You got a shower once a week , with your arms chained above you , stripped naked , in the dark , with someone else washing you .
' The water was salty and afterwards you felt dirtier than when you went in .
It was n't a shower for washing : it was for humiliation . '
In Kabul , Mohamed says the food was also contaminated , and he often suffered from sickness and diarrhoea .
' The weight just dropped off me , ' he said .
' The floor was made of cement dust .
Whatever movement you made , the air would be full of cement and I started getting breathing problems .
' My bed was a thin mattress on the floor , surrounded by that dust . '
' I said I had met Osama Bin Laden 30 times '
Much later , when Mohamed was being held at Guantanamo Bay , he and a fellow inmate discussed the time both had spent at the dark prison .
' They had just opened Oscar Block , a new Guantanamo punishment wing , and he'd been in it .
Mr Mohamed began dictating a diary of his ordeal since it began in September 2002 to lawyer Clive Stafford - Smith
' I was worried - I wanted to know what it was like .
He told me , " Binyam , it 's not even a twentieth as bad as Kabul .
" 'A hundred nights in Oscar Block is the equivalent of one night in the dark prison " .
' In Kabul I lost my head .
It felt like it was never going to end and that I had ceased to exist . '
Mohamed , 30 , spoke to The Mail on Sunday at the house in the English countryside where he has been staying since he was flown to Britain from Guantanamo at the end of last month .
After years of abuse and confinement and a hunger strike he began at the end of last year , he has been trying to build up his strength with simple home cooking and rambles in the open air .
He revealed new details about MI5's alleged collusion in his torture , speaking for the first time about being interrogated in Pakistan by an MI5 officer who knew he had already been tortured numerous times after his capture , and how torture made him confess to a fantastical plot that never was - to build and detonate a ' dirty ' radioactive bomb in New York .
He disclosed details of confidential MI5 telegrams to the American Central Intelligence Agency that show that at the very time he was being subjected to nightmarish tortures in Morocco , where his chest and penis were repeatedly slashed with a razor , MI5 was not only supplying his interrogators with background information but making specific requests about what they wanted him to be asked .
Mohamed was given these and other documents as part of an American court case , and made a verbatim record .
Other sources have confirmed his record is accurate .
He has made it available to The Mail on Sunday .
Since photos were taken of him emerging from the aircraft that brought him from Guantanamo , Mohamed has trimmed his beard and cut his hair .
Wearing a sports shirt , tracksuit and a Muslim prayer cap , he looks spruce and relaxed .
But when he slips off his jacket , it is evident his frame is still skeletal .
Yet his eyes are bright and he speaks with animation , sometimes smiling ruefully when he recalls the more bizarre aspects of his ordeal .
He seems straightforward and makes no attempt to hide the chain of events that had led to his capture - including the training he received in an Afghan camp .
Much of what he says can be corroborated from other sources .
But while the British and American governments persist in imposing secrecy over a lot of what happened to him , other parts must be taken on trust .
Mohamed says most of his physical injuries have healed .
But when he is asked about their psychological consequences , his voice falters .
' Mentally right now , the result of my experience is that I feel emotionally dead .
' You could do anything to me and I would n't feel it any more . '
His lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , from the human rights group Reprieve , has arranged therapy for him through London 's Helen Bamber Foundation , a world - renowned centre that cares for victims of torture .
Still fearful for his safety , Mohamed asked us to ensure he could not be recognised from the photograph published here .
' The British co-operated ... they sold me out '
His odyssey began in 1992 , when he was just 14 .
His father was a senior executive with the state - owned Ethiopian Airlines and following the ousting of the dictator Haile Mengistu , many of his colleagues were being arrested by the new government .
He decided to flee , uprooting Mohamed and his elder brother and sister from the home in Addis Ababa where they had spent their childhood .
He left behind his wife , Mohamed 's mother .
For almost two years , Mohamed , his siblings and his father lived in a suburb of Washington DC .
However , Mohamed says he became a victim of racist bullying at his school .
' I did n't like the U.S. at all .
It just did n't feel right for me to be there and I wanted to get out . '
The family had no connections in Britain , but because Mohamed spoke good English , his father decided to see if he could settle in London .
They arrived in the spring of 1994 , travelling on their Ethiopian passports , which had not yet expired .
For about a week , Mohamed says , they stayed in a hotel .
Then , although he was not quite 16 , his father returned to America , leaving him vulnerable , without guidance or support .
Mohamed remained in regular phone contact with his family , but he had to fend for himself .
Before he left , Mohamed 's father told him to go to Social Services .
At first they suggested foster care , but when he turned 16 they helped him claim state benefits while he stayed in a Notting Hill hostel and , eventually , a housing association flat .
Meanwhile he applied for asylum and was given leave to remain .
He enrolled at Paddington Green sixth - form college and passed an A - level in electronic engineering , and then began a BTEC course at City of Westminster College .
At first he stayed out of trouble .
But in the summer of 1996 some friends persuaded him to try cannabis at Notting Hill Carnival .
' About two weeks later I smoked my first joint .
It started from there .'
By 1998 , Mohamed was regularly ' chasing the dragon ' to smoke heroin and sometimes crack cocaine .
' Often I did n't even bother to go to college .
I was surrounded by people who were doing the same thing .
' I was also drinking a lot .
Finally , I dropped out .'
The following year , Mohamed says , he tried hard to stop using drugs .
Part of the answer turned out to be kick - boxing , and if he was searching for a father figure , he seems to have found it in his kick - boxing instructor , of whom he still speaks reverentially .
He says : ' I had to get fit again , and I started using my money to buy food again , not heroin . '
Although his mother was a Muslim , he had never practised any religion .
' I wanted to protect civilians , not kill them '
However , he lived in an area with thousands of Muslims and several mosques .
There he began to find a more spiritual solution to his efforts to get clean .
He says : ' I went to the mosque to see if there was something happening there that would help . '

In the middle of 2000 , he was offered a job as a mosque janitor and began to spend as much time there as he could , often staying the night - largely in order to avoid his old drug - abusing friends who still clustered around his apartment .
Mohamed says that someone at the mosque told him about the radical American civil rights leader Malcolm X , saying he had come to understand his religion properly when he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca .
Mohamed , he suggested , should go to see the ' pure ' form of Islam being practised in Taliban - controlled Afghanistan .
How much did he know about what the Taliban stood for ?
' Minus one , ' Mohamed says .
' I really had no idea what it was . '
He had saved some money and flew to Islamabad , Pakistan 's capital , in May 2001 .
As an asylum - seeker , he could n't apply for a new Ethiopian passport and had been unable to obtain a British travel document .
Instead , he borrowed a genuine British passport from a friend and substituted his own photograph .
After a week in Islamabad , Mohamed crossed the Afghan border by truck .
It was , he says , easy : ' No one looked at my documents .
I just kept down . '
Later , after the attacks of 9/11 , the Americans who led the ' war on terror ' assumed that because the Taliban had given refuge to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda , the two were interchangeable , and that anyone who had the least involvement with the Taliban was a fully - fledged terrorist , bent - as former U.S. defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said when he opened the Guantanamo prison in January 2002 - on ' killing millions of ordinary Americans ' .
Mohamed insists that this was not the way he saw the world at all .
Back in London he had been moved and appalled by watching TV news stories about the plight of civilians caught in Russia 's second war against Chechnya , where thousands , mainly Muslims , had been killed and tortured .
' To me , the Chechens were the freedom fighters and the Russians were the oppressors , ' Mohamed says .
' It was the sight of the women and the kids being killed : innocent lives being lost for no reason .
' I wanted to go there to do what I could - not for fighting , but as an aid and rescue worker . '
At a guest house in Jalalabad , the first town in which he stayed in Afghanistan , he found people who had links with the Chechen resistance .
' I was told that the Russians do n't separate between aid workers and those doing the fighting , and that if I wanted to go to Chechnya , I needed basic training .
' I was so young , I did n't question it .
I did n't expect to fire a gun except in training , let alone kill someone . '
Mohamed adds : ' I would never have taken up arms against British or American soldiers , let alone attacked civilians .
' I wanted to protect civilians , not kill them . '
' They carried out a mock execution on me '
He underwent a 45 - day boot camp course .
Much of the time , Mohamed says , was spent sitting around doing nothing .
He even abandoned the course halfway through for a few days , before being persuaded that if he wanted to go to Chechnya he had to finish it .
He says he learnt nothing that could be construed as terrorist training : there were no lessons on bomb - making , for example .
Demonstrators protest over Guantanamo outside the White House in Washington .
Mohamed was the first to be released from Guantanamo after President Obama pledged to close it down
Afterwards , Mohamed went to Kabul , where he contracted malaria .
While he was recovering in hospital , news broke of 9/11 .
It was evident the West was likely to attack Afghanistan , and Mohamed 's immediate impulse was to leave .
' All I wanted to do was to get back to London , to the country that I thought of as home , to continue my education and find a job ; to get back to my life , minus the drugs . '
As the U.S. - led coalition advanced , Mohamed became swept up in the tide of refugees .
He fled from city to city and in 2002 managed to cross into Pakistan and made his way to Karachi .
He booked a flight to London for April 3 , but officials saw that his passport looked wrong and sent him packing .
Six days later , using the same document , he tried again .
This time the Pakistanis detained him - and this was the start of almost seven years of incarceration without trial , interrogation and torture .
Two weeks after being detained , having been held in Landi prison , he met an American who called himself ' Chuck ' and said he worked for the FBI .
Mohamed says : ' I told him I wanted a lawyer .
He told me , " The law 's changed .
There are no lawyers .
" ' Either you 're going to answer me the easy way or I get the information I need another way . " '
Senior U.S. officials in Washington say that in these early months after 9/11 , American intelligence agencies were ' obsessed ' with the possibility that Al Qaeda might have acquired nuclear fissile material .
' Every interrogator would ask questions about it , ' one former CIA officer says .
Thus it was that Mohamed unwittingly contributed to his fate .
As The Mail on Sunday revealed last month , his interrogation began to turn nasty after he mentioned that while he was in Pakistan he had seen a website with spoof instructions for building a nuclear device - instructions that included advice to refine bomb - grade uranium by whirling a bucket round one 's head .
' I mentioned the website to Chuck , ' Mohamed says .
' It was obviously a joke : it never crossed my mind that anyone would take it seriously .
' But that 's when he started getting all excited .
' Towards the end of April he began telling me about this A - bomb I was supposed to be building , and he started on about Osama Bin Laden and his top lieutenants , showing me pictures and making out I must have known them .
' He started asking me about operations and what type I had been trained for . '
As the interrogations became more serious , the treatment meted out in the time between them brutally worsened .
Mohamed says : ' For at least ten days I was deprived of sleep .
' Sometimes the Pakistanis chained me from the top of the gate to the cell by my wrists from the end of one interrogation to the start of the next for about 22 hours .
' If I shouted , sometimes I would be allowed to use a toilet .
Other times , they would n't let me go and I would p*** myself .
' They had a thick wooden stick , like a kind of paddle , which they used to beat me while I was chained .
' They 'd beat me for a few minutes , then stop , then start again .
They also carried out a mock execution .
' A guard put a gun to my head and said he was going to pull the trigger .
They were saying , " This is what the Americans want us to do . " '
Details of the abuse Mohamed underwent in Pakistan are contained in the ' redacted ' section of the British High Court judgment on his case that Foreign Secretary David Miliband is refusing to release , claiming that to do so would damage the intelligence - sharing relationship with America .
As the court has made clear in the open section of its judgment , when an MI5 officer known as ' John ' went to interrogate Mohamed on May 17 , 2002 , he was made fully aware of what had been happening .
' John was a white male , 30 , with short black hair and a goatee , ' Mohamed says .
' He was about 5ft 10in and stocky .
' There was another guy with him , about the same size with a full , dark beard .
I do n't know if he was British or American .
' The Americans had already been threatening to send me somewhere where I would be tortured far worse , like Jordan or Egypt .
' I was given a cup of tea and asked for one sugar .
The other guy told me , " You 'll need more than one sugar where you 're going . "
' They asked me about the A - bomb website and I told them it was a joke .
' They wanted to know everything about my life in the UK and I gave them all the information I had .
' Later I realised that was part of my undoing : I told them the area I lived in had 10,000 Moroccans and was known as Little Morocco .
' The feedback I got later from the Americans was that because the Brits told them I had lived in a Moroccan area , they thought Moroccans would be more likely to make me talk .
' At the same time , they thought I must know something about what Moroccans were up to in London . '
Mohamed says that a Moroccan interrogator who would deal with him later was even more specific .
' He told me , " Do you know who sent you here ?
The British sent you here . " '
The materials seen by The Mail on Sunday confirm much of his account .
One MI5 memo from this period , disclosed to Mohamed via the American courts , suggests the British saw themselves as central to his interrogation .
It said : ' We believe that our knowledge of the UK scene may provide contextual background useful during any continuing interview process .
' This may enable individual officers to identify any inconsistencies during discussions .
' This will place the detainee under more direct pressure and would seem to be the most effective way of obtaining intelligence on Mohammed 's [ sic ] activities / plans concerning the UK . '
Regarding the ' dirty bomb ' , MI5 could see the ' inconsistencies ' in Mohamed 's account .
John dutifully recorded that he claimed the website was a joke .
But MI5 concluded that Mohamed and another prisoner being interrogated were ' lying to protect themselves ' and ' evidently holding back ' .
Day after day , MI5 kept the Americans supplied with questions and information .
Mohamed says : ' John told me that if I co-operated he'd tell the Americans to be more lenient with my treatment . '
In a further confidential memo John wrote : ' I told Mohammed [ sic ] that he had an opportunity to help us and help himself .
' The U.S. authorities will be deciding what to do with him and this would depend to a very large degree on his co-operation - I said that I could not and would not negotiate up - front , but if he persuaded me he was co-operating fully then ( and only then ) I would explore what could be done for him with my U.S. colleagues . '
Evidently , John felt he was n't co-operating enough .
His memo concluded : ' While he appeared happy to answer any questions , he was holding back a great deal of information on who and what he knew in the UK and in Afghanistan . '
Mohamed was flown - trussed , gagged , blindfolded and wearing a giant nappy - from Islamabad to Rabat in Morocco on July 21 , 2002 .
He gave this date to Stafford Smith four years ago , it has since been confirmed by the CIA aircraft 's flight logs .
Mohamed would not leave again for 18 months , for most of which he was horribly tortured .
Shuddering , he says the details of what he endured in Morocco are such that he cannot bring himself to relate them again .
But in 2005 , when he first met Stafford Smith in Guantanamo , he dictated a detailed diary , which described the abuse that began at the beginning of September 2002 .
He had , he said , already endured beatings at the hands of an interrogator named Marwan .
Now , he went on , ' they cut off my clothes with some kind of doctor 's scalpel .
I was totally naked .
I was afraid to ask Marwan what would happen because it would show fear .
' I tried to put on a brave face .
But maybe I was going to be raped .
Maybe they 'd electrocute me .
Maybe castrate me .
' They took the scalpel to my right chest .
It was only a small cut .
Maybe an inch .
Then they cut my left chest .
' One of them took my penis in his hand and began to make cuts .
He did it once , and they stood still for maybe a minute , watching my reaction .
' I was in agony , crying , trying desperately to suppress myself , but I was screaming .
' I remember Marwan seemed to smoke half a cigarette , throw it down , and start another .
They must have done this 20 to 30 times in maybe two hours .
' There was blood all over .
They cut all over my private parts .
' One of them said it would be better just to cut it off , as I would only breed terrorists . '
This , Mohamed says , was repeated many times over the next 15 months .
Even after this treatment started , the documents disclosed to Mohamed for the U.S. court case reveal that MI5 was colluding with his tormentors .
In late September , one document reveals : ' The Service received a report from the U.S. of an interview of Mr Mohamed .
' On September 30 , MI5 held a case conference about him with their American colleagues at MI5s London headquarters .
Weeks later , on November 5 , came the strongest evidence to emerge of British collusion in Mohamed 's illegal ' rendition ' and torture , in the form of a telegram from MI5 to the CIA .
Headed ' Request for further Detainee questioning ' , it stated : ' This information has been communicated in confidence to the recipient government and shall not be released without the agreement of the British government .
' We would be grateful if the following can be passed to Binyam Mohamed . '
It went on to ask that his interrogators show him and ask him questions about a ' photobook recently sent over ' .
Large portions of the telegram , which set out detailed questions , have been redacted , but it added : ' We would be grateful if the following could be put to Binyam Mohamed , in addition to the questioning above .
' Does Mohamed know [ two lines redacted ] ?
What was the man 's name ?
How does Mohamed know him ?
Can Mohamed describe him ?
Where did they meet ?
Where was the man from ?
' Who facilitated his travel from the UK ?
Where did this man go ?
What were his intentions ?
' We would appreciate the opportunity to pose further questions , dependent on answers given to the above . '
A further telegram sent by MI5 on November 11 was headed ' update request ' .
It , too , has been heavily redacted but the surviving portion states : ' We note that we have also requested that briefs be put to Binyam Mohamed and would appreciate a guide from you as to the likely timescale for these too .
' We fully appreciate that this can be a long - winded process , but the urgent nature of these enquiries will be obvious to you . '
Mohamed remembers very clearly the moment when MI5 's questions were first channelled by his Moroccan interrogators .
He says : ' They started bringing British files to the interrogations - thick binders , some of them containing sheaves of photos of people who lived in London and places there like mosques .
' It was obvious the British were feeding them questions about people in London .
' When I realised that the British were co-operating with the people torturing me , I felt completely naked .
' It was when they started asking the questions supplied by the British that my situation worsened .
They sold me out .'
Under this torture , Mohamed 's confessions became ever more elaborate .
' They had fed me enough through their questions for me to make up what they wanted to hear .
I confessed to it all .
' There was the plot to build a dirty nuclear bomb , and another to blow up apartments in New York with their gas pipes . '
This - supposedly the brainchild of the 9/11 planner Khalid Shaikh Mohammed - always sounded improbable : it was never quite clear how gas pipes might become weapons .
' I said Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had given me a false passport after I was stopped the first time in Karachi and that I had met Osama Bin Laden 30 times .
None of it was true .
' The British could have stopped the torture because they knew I had tried to use the same passport at Karachi both times .
' That should have told them that what I was saying under torture was n't true .
But so far as I know , they did nothing . '
Mohamed was finally ' rendered ' by the CIA again in January 2004 and taken to Afghanistan .
He says the agents he met there responded with horror .
' When I got to Kabul a female agent started taking close - up pictures of my genitals .
She was shocked .
' When they removed my diaper she could see blood was still oozing from the cuts on my penis .
' For the first two weeks they had me on antibiotics and they took pictures of my genitals every day .
' They told me , " This is not for us .
It 's for Washington . "
They wanted to be sure it was healing .'
Then came his ordeal in the dark prison .
Mohamed says the thrust of his interrogations had changed .
Since he madehis fantastical confession , the Americans wanted him to become a prosecution witness in their system of special military commissions , against Al Qaeda bigwigs he had never met .
He reached Guantanamo in September 2004 .
There , the interrogations continued but there had been another shift .
He says : ' They said they were worried I would tell the court that I had only confessed through torture .
They said now they needed me to say it freely .
' We called them the clean team , they wanted to say they had got this stuff from a clean interrogation . '
After Mohamed had spent more than four years at Guantanamo , Barack Obama became U.S. President and announced the camp 's impending closure and an end to the military commissions .
But according to Mohamed , there was little sign of an improvement .
' Since the election it 's got harsher .
The guards would say , yes , this place is going to close down , but it was like they wanted to take their last revenge . '
The feared Emergency Reaction Force , a SWAT team used to punish inmates in their cells , is being used more often , he says .
Mohamed recalls an occasion when it was deployed against him .
The reason was that he was refusing to give his fingerprints which , despite all the torture , had unaccountably not been taken before : he says he feared they might use them to frame him .
' They nearly broke my back .
The guy on top was twisting me one way , the guys on my legs the other .
' They marched me out of the cell to the fingerprint room , still cuffed .
I clenched my fists behind me so they could n't take prints , so they tried to take them by force .
' The guy at my head sticks his fingers up my nose and wrenches my head back , jerking it around by the nostrils .
' Then he put his fingers in my eyes .
It felt as if he was trying to gouge them out .
Another guy was punching my ribs and another was squeezing my testicles .
Finally I could n't take it any more .
I let them take the prints . '
Last October , before the election , all charges against him were dropped , even the Americans had come to realise there was no ' dirty bomb ' plot .
Yet to Mohamed , it seemed he was no closer to release - hence his decision , on December 29 last year , to go on hunger strike .
Release , when it finally came last month , took him by surprise .
It is , he admits , still difficult to accept .
' I kept being told , you 'll be free in ten days , and they would pass , and then I 'd be told another ten days , and still it was n't for real . '
As for the future , he is determined to stay in Britain , despite MI5 's alleged collusion with his torturers .
' It 's the only place I can call home , ' he says .
' I want to live a normal life , to find a wife , get married , have a family , a job .
' Meanwhile , I 'll do whatever I can to get the other innocent prisoners out of Guantanamo . '

It 's Summer !
No it 's not ( but hey we can dream .. ) --
It is time though for another round of Google 's Summer of Code ( SoC ) .
The SoC is an effort that first started in 2005 as an effort to get students involved in open source code development .
Google provides a stipend to the student and to the mentoring organization that helps the student .
The SoC started off in 2005 with an allocation for 200 students and a budget of $ 1 million , which ultimately grew to 410 students that same year .
In 2008 , the SoC grew to a staggering 1,125 students which totaled an open source cash infusion of at least $ 5.6 million dollars .
2009 is a recession year -- even for Google , so initially ( at least ) , Google is capping the number of students for the SoC at 1,000 .
In terms of mentoring organizations Google worked with 175 different groups in 2008 and expects a slightly lower number for 2009 .
Also of interest for SoC 2009 is the fact that Google is using a new home grown system called Melange to manage the effort .
Melange was first announced at OSCON in 2008 .
The name ' Melange ' is an homage to the concept of Melange / spice from Frank Herbert 's Dune novels .
The deadline for mentoring organizations to submit is March 18 , 2009 and Google will begin taking student applications on March 23 , 2009 with the deadline for student applications on April 3rd .
On April 20th , Google will formally announced the accepted student applications and then after a several week learning period students will begin coding their projects on May 23rd .
The SoC coding then continues on until August 17th .
While I do n't know if Google 's Melange will create a Mau'dib Paul
Atreides type superhero , I do know that in its 4 years of existence the
SoC has had a tremendous impact on the open source ecosystem , leading to
countless functions and innovations that I benefit from every day .
" The sleeper has awoken . "
“ We had a woman run at us with a grenade in one hand and the Koran in the other , ” Brig .
Gen. Eli Shermeister , head of the military ’s education corps , said in an interview in which he showed ethics kits distributed to commanders .
“ What we know till now is that there was no systematic moral failure .
There were not more than a few  a very few  events still being investigated . ”
Col . Roi Elkabets , commander of an armored brigade , told of occasions when fire was held .
His troops saw “ a woman , about 60 years old , walking with a white flag and six to eight children behind her , and behind them was a Hamas fighter with his gun .
“ We did not shoot him . ”
Almost everything about the Gaza operation has caused controversy : how many Palestinians were killed and what percentage were civilians , whether the rise in the number of religious Israeli soldiers has led to zealotry , and whether the use of enormous military force was a legitimate response to years of Hamas rocket fire on Israeli civilians .
The dispute is a proxy for a debate  both here and abroad  over whether Israel should shift its policy toward the Palestinians and whether Hamas should be seen more as a resistance movement or as a tool of Iranian ambition and terror .
Those who wish to press for an end to the occupation and settlement of the West Bank and to the boycott of Gaza so as to create a Palestinian state  either out of sympathy with Israel or contempt for it  have focused on the accounts of abuses .
Those who think such moves would endanger Israel have dismissed them as a blood libel .
The debate began within hours of Israel ’s attack in late December and continues daily .
This week , Human Rights
Watch issued a report citing six cases of improper use of white phosphorus by Israel and calling them evidence of war crimes .
Israel has not completed its own study .
On Thursday , the military issued its first casualty count , saying 1,166 people were killed .
Of those , it said 295 were noncombatants , 709 were what it called Hamas terror operatives and 162 were men whose affiliations remained unidentified .
I , like most people , never realized I 'd be dealing with large files .
Oh , I knew there would be some files with megabytes of data , but I never suspected I 'd be begging Perl to process hundreds of megabytes of XML , nor that this week I 'd be asking Python to process 6.4 gigabytes of CSV into 6.5 gigabytes of XML1 .
As a few out - of - memory experiences will teach you , the trick for dealing with large files is pretty easy : use code that treats everything as a stream .
For inputs , read from disk in chunks .
For outputs , frequently write to disk and let system memory forge onward unburdened .
When reading and writing files yourself , this is easier to do correctly ...
from __future__ import with_statement # for python 2.5 with open ( ' data.in ' , 'r ' ) as fin : with open ( ' data.out ' , ' w ' ) as fout : for line in fin : fout .
write ( ' , ' . join ( line .
split ( ' ' ) ) )
... than it is to do incorrectly ...
with open ( ' data.in ' , 'r ' ) as fin : data = fin .
read ( ) data2 = [ ' , ' . join ( x . split ( ' ' ) ) for x in data ] with open ( ' data.out ' , ' w ' ) as fout : fout .
write ( data2 )
... at least in simple cases .
Loading Large CSV Files in Python
Python has an excellent csv library , which can handle large files right out of the box .
Sort of .
>> import csv >> r = csv.reader ( open ( ' doc.csv ' , 'rb ' ) ) >>> for row in r : ... print row ...
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > _csv.
Error : field larger than field limit ( 131072 )
Staring at the module documentation2 , I could n't find anything of use .
So I cracked open the csv.py file and confirmed what the _csv in the error message suggests : the bulk of the module 's code ( and the input parsing in particular ) is implemented in C rather than Python .
After a while staring at that error , I began dreaming of how I would create a stream pre-processor using StringIO , but it did n't take too long to figure out I would need to recreate my own version of csv in order to accomplish that .
So back to the blogs , one of which held the magic grain of information I was looking for : csv.field_size_limit .
>>> import csv >>> csv . field_size_limit () 131072 >>> csv . field_size_limit ( 1000000000 ) 131072 >>> csv . field_size_limit () 1000000000
Yep .
That 's all there is to it .
The sucker just works after that .
Well , almost .
I did run into an issue with a NULL byte 1.5 gigs into the data .
Because the streaming code is written using C based IO , the NULL byte shorts out the reading of data in an abrupt and non-recoverable manner .
To get around this we need to pre-process the stream somehow , which you could do in Python by wrapping the file with a custom class that cleans each line before returning it , but I went with some command line utilities for simplicity .
cat data .in | tr -d ' \0 ' > data.out
After that , the 6.4 gig CSV file processed without any issues .
Creating Large XML Files in Python
This part of the process , taking each row of csv and converting it into an XML element , went fairly smoothly thanks to the xml.sax.saxutils.XMLGenerator class .
The API for creating elements is n't an example of simplicity , but it is -- unlike many of the more creative schemes -- predictable , and has one killer feature : it correctly writes output to a stream .
As I mentioned , the mechanism for creating elements was a bit verbose , so I made a couple of wrapper functions to simplify ( note that I am sending output to standard out , which lets me simply print strings to the file I am generating , for example creating the XML file 's version declaration ) .
import sys from xml.sax.saxutils import XMLGenerator from xml.sax.xmlreader import AttributesNSImpl g = XMLGenerator ( sys .
stdout , ' utf - 8 ' ) def start_tag ( name , attr = {} , body = None , namespace = None ) : attr_vals = {} attr_keys = {} for key , val in attr . iteritems ( ) : key_tuple = ( namespace , key ) attr_vals [ key_tuple ] = val attr_keys [ key_tuple ] = key attr2 = AttributesNSImpl ( attr_vals , attr_keys ) g . startElementNS
(( namespace , name ) , name , attr2 ) if body : g . characters ( body ) def end_tag ( name , namespace = None ) : g . endElementNS (( namespace , name ) , name ) def tag ( name , attr = {} , body = None , namespace = None ) : start_tag ( name , attr , body , namespace ) end_tag ( name , namespace )
From there , usage looks like this :
print " " " < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 ' ? > " " " start_tag ( u'list ' , { u'id ' : 10 } ) for item in some_list : start_tag ( u'item ' , { u'id ' : item [ 0 ]} ) tag ( u'title ' , body = item [ 1 ] ) tag ( u'desc ' , body = item [ 2 ] ) end_tag ( u'item ' ) end_tag ( u'list ' ) g . endDocument ()
The one issue I did run into ( in my data ) was some pagebreak characters floating around ( ^ L aka 12 aka x0 c ) which were tweaking the XML encoder , but you can strip them out in a variety of places , for example by rewriting the main loop :
for item in some_list : item = [ x . replace ( ' \x0 c ' , '' ) for x in item ] # etc
Really , the XMLGenerator just worked , even when dealing with a quite large file .
Performance
Although my script created a different mix of XML elements than the above example , it was n't any more complex , and had fairly reasonable performance .
Processing of the 6.4 gig CSV file into a 6.5 gig XML file took between 19 - 24 minutes , which means it was able to read - process - write about five megabytes per second .
In terms of raw speed , that is n't particularly epic , but performing a similar operation ( was actually XML to XML rather than CSV to XML ) with Perl 's XML :: Twig it took eight minutes to process a ~ 100 megabyte file , so I 'm pretty pleased with the quality of the Python standard library and how it handles large files .
The breadth and depth of the standard library really makes Python a joy to work with for these simple one - shot scripts .
If only it had Perl 's easier to use regex syntax ...

Being part of the LA party crowd one associates with a lot of obnoxious types .
Like the " Conveniently Forgetting His Wallet Guy , " the " We Have To Go Back I Lost My Phone Girl , " the " I ’m Too Drunk You Need To Drive My Car Dude , " the " Obsessive Texters and the Pukers , " to name but a few .
I myself used to be the " Gets Us Kicked Out For Looking Too Wasted Guy . "
But hands down the most annoying person to go out boozing with is " The Fighter , " that guy who can seemingly get into a fight anywhere , over anything .
I ’ll call my Fighter , Jack .
Jack is a relatively normal chap when sober .
Incredibly fun when slightly buzzed .
But somewhere in between that 4th and 5th drink something happens .
First he gets happy , but in a fake way , forcefully over - laughing at things .
Then comes the no-standards wandering eye , ogling any girl that passes .
Then it ’s time to do shots , and anyone who wo n’t partake is being a “ pussy . ”
Finally , like some addled vet still paranoid of an attack , Jack ’s head and eyes start dodging around the room – I call this his " There Might Be Ninjas " phase .
We ’ve crossed the event horizon .
A fight is now unavoidable .
Fortunately Fighters mostly fight other Fighters .
They are cosmically drawn to each other , and like Highlanders , there can be only one .
It ’s fascinating to see how Jack can turn anything into a wounded pride moment that demands immediate and violent satisfaction .
A guy gives Jack a weird look , because Jack was giving him a weird look .
" You got a problem ? " the guy will ask , as Fighters do .
" I do now ! " Boom .
Fight .
Just like that .
Of course the Fighter always expects you to have his back .
“ Where were you , bro ? ! ”
He ’ll get extra offended later when you dismiss his concrete reasoning for needing to fight that “ prick . ”
But never feel guilty and certainly never enter the fray .
Most bouncers will kick you out too , just for being friends with the Fighter .
Jack loves attacking bouncers .
It ’s best to pretend you do n’t even know the guy , especially if you paid an absurd $ 20 cover .
He can cab it home .
Now you can get yourself kicked out later !
Maybe you ’ll be the " Falls Asleep In Bathroom Girl " or the " Tries To Pour Own Drink At Bar Guy . "
Jeremy
White posted the CodeWeavers ’ Outlook for 2009 , explaining what the group has been working fervently on the past eight months as well as plans for the coming months of 2009 .
CodeWeavers develops and sells CrossOver , an application based upon Wine that can run Windows applications on Mac OS X and Linux , specifically certain games and office applications .
They ’re also the leading corporate backer of the Wine Project .
In the road map , White explains that the past eight months have been spent on unattractive , under - the - hood improvements to Wine , particularly “ things like .NET support , work on a DIB Engine , Gdiplus , and a lot of Direct X work .
We ’ve also spent a lot of energy focusing on issues with Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007 , in an effort to bring those applications fully up to ‘ Gold ’ level . ”
He goes on to say that DirectX 9 support is coming along nicely for the CrossOver Games project , and DirectX 10 is around the corner .
The plans for the upcoming months include shipping CrossOver 8.0 for both Linux and Mac , which will include many improvements , the juiciest of which are centered around Photoshop CS3 , Microsoft Office , and Quicken 2009 .
Aside from adding more and better application support in Wine , the GUI of CrossOver is supposed to get a hefty overhaul by the CodeWeavers team .

Below is an alert I sent out on Wednesday evening .
I want everyone to see what is at the forefront of my thinking right now .
I am busy writing up my next layers of thought around this development and will make that the basis of my next Martenson Report or two .
Why ?
Because this recent action by the Fed is a " game changer . "
In a shocking development that I frankly hoped we ’d never actually see , the Federal Reserve dropped a bombshell yesterday and announced that it is going to create an extra $ 1 trillion dollars out of thin air to support the spending desires of the US government and to drive down interest rates for mortgage borrowers .
Of course , this will continue to punish savers and pension plans , but those , frankly , are of no concern to the Fed .
Below I explore this outrageous turn of events .
Please note that I have not had much time to digest this incredible news and that I reserve the right to add to ( or amend ) my thinking over the next few days .
Fed to Buy $ 1 Trillion in Securities to Aid Economy
WASHINGTON — Saying that the recession continues to deepen , the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it would pump an extra $ 1 trillion into the mortgage market and longer - term Treasury securities in order to revive the economy .
As expected , the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate at virtually zero .
But in a surprise , it dramatically increased the amount of money it will create out of thin air to thaw out the still - frozen credit markets that have cramped lending to consumers and businesses alike .
The dollar took a massive hit .
Gold , down some $ 25 on the day prior to the announcement , finished up $ 50 .
Stocks rallied while the long bonds ( 10 , 20 and 30 years ) were bought hard driving yields down by massive amounts before giving back ~ 50 % of the move .
Given the recent revelations that Goldman Sachs and other well - connected players in the AIG scandal got billions of dollars directly from the US taxpayers for their side - bets with AIG , I will not be at all surprised to find out in a few weeks or months that Goldman Sachs , JPM , and others were magically positioned to make a killing off of this move .
That ’s just raw speculation , but it fits with the general pattern of conflicted enrichment that has stalked every move in this grand looting operation so far .
In fact , the constant drip - drip - drip of news about self - dealing by insiders with zero legal consequences for the perpetrators leaves me with the queasy feeling that every attempt at finding a legitimate resolution to this crisis will be thwarted by a crowd of Wall Street insiders who simply cannot resist an opportunity to redirect money into their own pockets .
But that ’s another story .
For now the main plot line is the fact that the US has just decided to openly print up another trillion dollars in order to buy more dodgy debt from itself .
Here are a few dots related to this action that we might connect .
On Wednesday of last week China via its premier expressed its desire to see the US take care to safeguard the value of China ’s investments in US dollars .
Over the weekend the G20 meets to discuss the financial crisis .
It is a near certainty that this new move by the Fed was discussed at that meeting .
On Wednesday the 18th , the US Federal Reserve thumbed the nation ’s collective nose at the Chinese .
I think this will be frowned upon by the Chinese .
However , I think this move is also a tacit admission by the US that it can no longer depend on the rest of the world to meet its borrowing and expenditure desires .
As I outlined in a blog post yesterday ( Funding Nightmare for the US ) , there ’s been an extremely dramatic outflow of foreign money from the US that all but guaranteed this recent Fed move was a certainty .
Here ’s a chart showing the net foreign capital flows to the US .
After hitting a dramatic peak late in 2006 , there has been what can only be described as a collapse in foreign purchases of US financial assets .
This chart is about as scary a chart as you could ever want to see if you happen to hold a lot of US dollar debt , as does China .
This chart foretold the move by the Fed today to attempt to print our way out of trouble ( no money was available anywhere else ) and it tells us that the prospect of a dollar crisis is a very real concern for the future .
The reason why can be captured by a very simple calculation .
( US government deficit spending ) + ( trade deficit ) – ( domestic savings ) =
( Need for positive foreign capital flows )
Or :
( $ 2.5 trillion ) + ( $ 500 billion ) – ( $ 0 ) = ( $ 3 trillion )
Unfortunately , not only is the right side of the equation not equal to $ 3 trillion , but it was negative $ 150 billion in January .
Where we need $ 3 trillion to flow in , we saw $ 150 billion flow out in a single month .
The extent there ’s an imbalance in this equation is the extent to which the dollar will lose value .
I think that reality just caught up with the markets .
Today we saw a mighty decline in the dollar .
Here it is again .
That ’s just huge .
Maybe not if it was the stock price of a company just announcing poor earnings , but absolutely gigantic for the reserve currency of the world .
Trillions just sloshed out of one currency and into all the others .
Such movements are almost certainly injecting a huge dose of stress into an already strained system .
Such wild gyrations are certain to result in an incident sooner or later .
My read on the dollar is that it is an exceptionally overproduced and ( still ) overvalued piece of paper .
That ’s just on the basis of how many have been produced and sent overseas over the past few years as compared to the productive capacity of the US .
Now that another trillion of them are going to be exchanged for debt that ’s already in existence only adds fuel to this fire .
This move by the Fed to print up another trillion comes on the heels of an announcement by the IMF that it plans to issue “ Special Drawing Rights ” which are nothing more than irredeemable bits of paper that central banks can pretend have value amongst themselves .
The International Monetary Fund is poised to embark on what analysts have described as " global quantitative easing " by printing billions of dollars worth of a global " super- currency " in an unprecedented new effort to address the economic crisis .
Here ’s a great explanation posted to the forums a few days back by Machinehead :
Here is one way to look at [ Special Drawing Rights or SDRs ] , via a simple example .
Let ’s say that you and I , while hanging out at the strip club , exchange million - dollar IOUs scribbled on cocktail napkins .
If I can discount your IOU at my bank for a $ 1 million loan to me , and you can discount my IOU at your bank for a $ 1 million loan to yourself , then we have jointly created 2 million dollars , in what is essentially a chain - letter scheme .
The vast expansion of international reserves during this decade also resembled a chain - letter scheme .
The U.S. trade deficit piled up dollars in China , which became international reserves for China .
China then recirculated these dollars to the U.S. , providing the expanding volume of debt financing which is essential to keep a Ponzi scheme expanding .
There is no numerical limit , other than the economy ’s ability to service the debt , to prevent this cycle from endlessly repeating .
In recent months , the drastic shrinkage of the U.S.trade deficit has slowed this runaway transmission belt to a crawl .
Reviving trade is going to take years .
If one ’s objective is to restore the heady 20 - percent annual growth of international reserves during the Bubble II years , then new reserves must arise from some source other than expanding trade .
Enter the IMF , with its SDRs .
SDRs are acceptable as international reserves , because nearly all countries belong to the IMF club .
SDRs can be created out of thin air as derivatives of existing national currencies and then handed out to central banks , in a process exactly like our exchange of cocktail - napkin IOUs .
Central banks in turn can exchange SDRs among themselves to settle trade debts , meaning they can buy real goods with these thin - air paper derivatives .
And that ’s the very definition of inflation — purchasing power created from nothing , with no corresponding increase in investment or production .
So all purchasing power gets diluted accordingly .
That sums it up beautifully .
The SDRs are nothing more than a derivative currency issued by a bank - like entity that answers to no single government and therefore to none at all .
Together , the IMF and the Federal Reserve have embarked on a joint program to reinflate the world at any price .
I am certain they have the best of intentions and hope to be able to reel all this bogus funny - money back in at just the right moment to preserve whatever economic activity has been spawned by the thin - air bonanza while avoiding overshooting and igniting an inflationary inferno .
But history suggests that the chance of this outcome is 0 % .
From here , I am expecting several things .
A continued decline in the dollar , possibly turning quite ugly at some point over the next couple of months A continued increase in gold ( but with heroic attempts to cap its price by various central banks and their proxies )
For commodity price increases to begin soon ( due to a falling dollar and massive printing by Japan , the Bank of England , Switzerland , the US , and the 150 other countries that are now scratching their heads and wondering why they should n’t just print up a few thousand pallets of their own currencies ) .
Bonds will continue to behave counter - intuitively ( that is , to rise in price when they should be falling )
Finally , I am expecting this latest “ bold initiative ” by the Fed to fail , and fail spectacularly .
More on this later as events develop .
Today was a stunner .
The game has now shifted to a new set of rules .
Regular people are probably confused by the re-inflamed Mac vs. PC ad war , which now focuses on price .
Never fear , CNBC's Jim Goldman breaks down the true cost of PCs .
Wait , Macs come with Photoshop ?

According to CNBC's Silicon Valley Bureau Chief , PCs need the following things to " perform as well as a Mac " : $ 50 a year for anti-virus software , $ 104 multimedia software , $ 100 music software , $ 140 " Photoshop — you get that with Apple " and $ 129 for a Geek Squad visit .
Over $ 600 worth of extra stuff .
Oh , and Macs get 4 x the battery life , have faster processors and a higher resolution screen .

Um .
What ?
Last time I checked , you can get pretty decent antivirus software for free , my MacBook Pro did n't come with Photoshop , and iTunes was free on OS X and Windows .
For multimedia , you 've got Windows Media Center , which is also pretty free .
And Picasa —hey , it 's free too — is n't a bad alternative to iPhoto .
Okay , you might have to spend money on video editing software , since MovieMaker ai n't so hot .
But you know what ?
A lot of the stuff MobileMe charges you $ 100 a year to get , Windows Live provides for free , like SkyDrive 's 25 GB of storage .
I would also like to meet this mythical Mac with an all - day battery , since we sure have n't seen it .

Look , there are some valid reasons to pick a Mac over a PC , just like there are valid reasons to pick a PC over a Mac .
But you should n't smear blatant horseshit all over them , especially when it 's already confusing enough for regular people , your audience , Mr. CNBC Silicon Valley Bureau Chief .

No wonder the figures Goldman tosses out look so familiar .

Student finds mobile phone while out celebrating his 18th birthday and is ARRESTED after handing it in to police
A college student who found a mobile phone while out celebrating his 18th birthday was arrested after handing it in to police .
Teenager Paul Leicester was arrested for ' theft by finding ' and detained for four hours .
The Southport College A - level student eventually had the case against him withdrawn but said it was a ' shocking experience ' .
Paul Leicester was arrested after handing in a mobile phone that he found
Paul said : ' Being arrested is n't a way to celebrate your 18th birthday .
What are you supposed to do when you find a phone ?
I told the last caller I would drop it off at the police station the next day .
But they arrested me for theft by finding .'
The teenager was kept by Merseyside Police in Southport police station for four hours and had his fingerprints taken , along with a DNA swab and a photo for police records .
Officers then grilled him for 15 minutes about the alleged ' theft ' .
Paul , who is of good character , has a Saturday job at a jewellers and is held in high regard by his teachers .
The former Birkdale High School student , who lives in Seaforth , added : ' I want people to be aware of what happened .
I thought I was doing the right thing and had it thrown back in my face .
' I would not go to the police in future .
I would arrange for it to be collected by the last caller .
All I was doing was the honest thing .
It was a shocking experience . '
Paul 's father Vinnie Leicester , 37 , said : ' I 'm disgusted and angry .
It should never have happened .
Paul 's mum and I have brought him up the right way .
It 's ridiculous . '
A police spokesman explained the complaint of theft was subsequently withdrawn and Paul was released without charge .
Sefton Area Commander , Chief Supt Ian Pilling , said : ' Merseyside Police has contacted Mr Leicester in relation to the incident and he does not wish to make a complaint against the police .
As a matter of course we are reviewing the circumstances of the arrest . '
If you 're wondering why " Happy International " is a top trend on Twitter today , it 's because today is International Women 's Day , an important day that celebrates the achievements of women everywhere .
This year will be the 98th celebration of International Women 's Day .
And although we celebrate the advances women have made today , we are also humbled by the reminder that there is still a lot of work to be done in the realm of gender equality .
In honor of International Women 's Day , Mashable has put together some important links related to women , especially women and social media .
Although International Women's Day has already ended in some countries , these resources are hopefully useful at any time .
There are plenty of other social media resources out there for women .
So if you have a resource or websites to share for International Women 's Day , please share them in the comments .
This is n't a " normal " posting for Blog of helios .
Sometimes , there are important things to share with you , and in this case , I think this side trip is merited .
I would feel negligent for not posting this .
This could potentially be important to many .
I was looking forward to it .
Going home that was .
I was stationed at Fort Polk Louisiana as an assistant squad leader with 2 nd platoon .
1 st squad of Bravo Company , 5 th Engineer Battalion .
My job ?
I blew stuff up and I did it with maths and C4 explosives .
There were worse places for a soldier to be stationed in 1976 than Fort Polk , but I ca n’t bring any to mind ... ever .
Having received orders for my 1st overseas deployment to Europe , I was due a 30 day leave .
While I was looking forward to the Land of Beer and Bratwurst , I had a longing for home , and specifically , seeing my mom .
Two weeks prior to leaving for Phoenix , I got a letter from my kid brother , and in part it was a warning :
“ Bro , I need to tell you , mama is n’t well .
She ’s been in a severe depression for months and none of us know what to do .
I hope seeing you brings her out of it . ”
Depression ?
I knew about it in the abstract , something I had been trained to recognize .
As a non commissioned officer , recognizing and acting upon depression within your command has become a topic talked about more and more with emphasis .
We were only a few years out of Vietnam , and the senior non commissioned officer corps were said to be ate up with it .
T he on base NCO clubs had never seen such early - in - the - week traffic .
Copious amounts of alcohol seemed to be the most popular means of self - medication .
B ut personally , I had never encountered depression in real life and I had no idea of just how devastating this condition was , and still is .
That would change in a couple of weeks .
At first , I did n’t see anything other than what I had known of my mom for decades .
A quiet demeanor with a slashing wit and a mind prone to thought before she spoke .
She had worked her way up to the civilian rank of G - 12 within the IRS within 16 years .
She was Senior Corporate Auditing Agent for the Phoenix office but she took early retirement .
She could no longer justify working for , what she considered , a soul - less renegade organization .
Even with that , initially she had seemed fine when I got home .
But as I settled into the second week of my stay , it was obvious that she was all but detached from everything around her .
I spent a few days with an old girlfriend and when I came home , she sat at her dining room table , wearing the same clothes she had worn prior to me leaving .
Her ashtrays over flowed and there were over a dozen Miller Lite beer cans strewn across the table .
She was immersed in one of the hundreds of romance novels that lay around the house .
I finally put my hand gently on her shoulder and she jumped as if I had set off a cherry bomb .
“ You OK Mama ? ”
She looked at me through pale , watery blue eyes and smiled softly .
“ I ’m fine honey .
There ’s a ham in the fridge if you ’re hungry . ”
With that she poured the remainder of her beer into her glass , lit a cigarette and returned to her book .
As the last week of my leave approached , I decided I would take a more active roll in at least getting her to talk to me .
She slept on the couch down stairs and rarely , if ever ; changed her clothes .
My brother Mark told me that he did n’t think she had showered in weeks .
I spoke with her throughout the day , mentioning that we might take a drive out to South Mountain or go out for lunch and maybe a shopping trip .
At best , she would look up at me and nod absently .
By the end of the day , I had lost my patience and I sat down next to her at 6 that evening .
“ When ’s the last time you were out of the house mom ? ”
She glanced up at me and then back to her book without an answer .
“ Do you want me to fix you something to eat ?
Can I get you a bath ready ?
Have you talked to Grandma lately ? ”
With that , she carefully dog-eared her page and closed her book .
“ I ’m going to bed early tonight honey .
You and Mark go out for a while .
There 's some money in the box on the shelf over the microwave .
Take my car and have a good time . ”
She re-opened her book and thus , excused herself from all other conversation .
I took the book out of her hands and sat it across the table , and in a manner that I regret to this very moment , I said to her .
“ Mama ... Just . Get. Up . "
She looked up at me as I stood over her offering my hand and she did n’t say a word , but in the way that some women can , she began crying .
Silently ... without gulps of air or attempts to speak .
Without one sound .
She kept eye contact the whole time .
Tears flowed down her face , onto her chin and then onto her lap .
They did n’t stop .
She looked at me as if tying to ask me …
“ Do n’t you understand ?
Ca n’t you understand ? ”
I pulled a chair in front of her and held her close , She smelled of stale cigarettes , beer , and the musk of dry , unwashed skin ,
and complete dispair .
Then she wept , in great , sobbing , gulps of air .
Wailing and rocking with the pain of a woman too long in her own head and without the ability to ask for help , or to even understand why she needed it .
I held her for over 15 minutes , rocking her from time to time .
She talked of losing her husband at the age of 57 , of a job that sucked the very soul from her , she thought often of her youngest daughter , lost in a crack cocaine nightmare , and mostly she spoke of just not wanting to wake up the next morning .
When her tears subsided , I got her some water and one of the “ tranks ” I got for flying the long miles to come .
I washed her face with a cool cloth and I kissed her on the forehead .
She slept for 11 hours that night .
About 9 hours longer than my brother told me she ever slept .
He thanked me for whatever I had done .
Something he could never figure out how to do and something I had no idea what I had done .
Even before she had her coffee that next morning , she had showered and fixed both of us boys poached eggs and fresh orange juice .
She then announced she was going to the store , “ for some things ” and arrived back two hours later .
It took us 20 minutes to shuttle those " things " into the house .
She was humming .
I took the credit for something I neither understood nor felt comfortable claiming .
It ate at me for the rest of my time at home , that I would have to leave her again .
For three years .
She eventually fell back into her disease and it took hospitalization to bring her back to half of the person she was .
But even that ... that was a win ,
Will The Circle Be Unbroken ...
The light switch snapped on , and when I squinted toward the door ; Diane was standing in the doorway of our bedroom .
She stared at me for an uncomfortable moment before she spoke .
“ Is there something we need to talk about ? ”
She looked around the room , taking into account the half full glasses of stale grapefruit juice , cereal bowls , pop tart wrappers and the dirty clothes strewn throughout the room .
From her expression , I assumed it did n’t smell pleasant at all .
“ You ’ve been in here for days Kenny .
What did I do to make you angry with me ? ”
Again I shrugged and returned my attention to my monitor and the best extinct friend a guy could ever have .
To my mind , the Triceratops should still be roaming the plains with the bison and wild mustangs and I opened my mouth to tell her so .
She moved sharply to turn the monitor off and sat next to me on the bed .
The clock radio face told me it was 11:09 but I had no idea whether it was AM or PM .
The blackout blinds I installed did a good job of blocking all evidence of life outside that 12x12 room .
With obvious impatience , she looked me in the eye .
“ Now , tell me .
What ’s going on with you ? ”
It ’s not that I did n’t want to talk to Diane .
I simply did n’t know what to say , where to start .
So many things had arrived at a central point of focus at the same time .
Another thing that wore on me deeply ... wore on me when I did n't even realize it .
This freak show chunk of plastic that jutted from my throat .
The monstrosity that made both kids and adults stare muvh longer than what could be considered slightly impolite ..
I was under the impression that things like this were accepted , even common in our not - so - polite society .
Wrong .
I began ripping the damned thing out of my throat and just leaving the raw hole covered by an bandanna .
It 's taken me a while to make those adjustments but to this day , I still get the urge to ditch the prosthetic and pretend that I am normal , well , at least until I key the mic to speak .
But with Diane , I did n’t know where to begin , basically because I did n’t know when to begin .
Over the next 2 days , I did my best to tell her how I felt , and more importantly , how I did n’t feel .
The most important thing in my life , the project that had fueled my energy and sense of purpose for 12 years …. it just seemed like a burden now .
I felt like a fraud for even thinking that I had done one bit of good for anyone ...
Ever .
Had it not been for great friends and director Pete Salas , Reglue would have suffered .
Pete , single handedly ; took the reigns of Reglue every few days , days that I could not be there ; and only contacted me when he needed money , parts or to check in on me .
The news that a sequel to last year 's Sex and the City movie is being planned should be of interest to more than shoe fetishists .
By the time the film is released , most of the lead actors will be aged 45 or over and - potentially - menopausal .
While I doubt that any serious academic research has been undertaken into the ovarian function of Hollywood stars , I 'd hazard a wild guess that this is not standard blockbuster territory .
Whether Samantha , the character of 52 - year - old Kim Cattrall , will be having hot flushes alongside hot sex remains to be seen .
Depending on which report you 've been reading , this month middle - aged women have either never had it so good , or never so bad .
In a survey published last week and examined in this paper 's women 's pages , 77 % of respondents said that they were having the best sex of their lives in their 40s .
It was suggested that hormonal changes brought on by the approaching menopause - when testosterone becomes ascendant - might be responsible for this later - in - life epiphany .
Elsewhere , according to a new study by the NHS Information Centre , middle - aged women suffer more anxiety and depression than any other group in the country , with nearly a quarter of those aged 45 to 64 exhibiting symptoms , an increase of 20 % in the last 15 years .
Responding to the figures , 53 - year - old Sally Brampton , former Elle editor and current agony aunt , who has herself had clinical depression , wrote how her generation felt overworked , overlooked and biologically redundant .
The menopause was a particular shock , she said , for women who came of age in the 60s , with all the exciting new possibilities that era afforded them , and swore to themselves that they would never turn into their mothers .
While the travails of thirtysomething women - in their relationships , fertility choices and career ambitions - are relentlessly picked over , those of their older sisters receive markedly less attention .
Yet they are often dealing with the heaviest stress of their lives , still raising children while managing the care needs of elderly parents , as well as coping with fundamental changes to their own body and self - image .
And those changes are not made any easier to accept when the menopause remains the subject of casual misogyny , euphemism and taboo .
A plethora of self - help books offering advice on " managing " , " surviving " or " outsmarting " this transition does little to dispel the notion that it is something only to be dreaded .
And , while the menopause can of course be accompanied by unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes , sleeplessness and depression , these are neither universal nor , in most cases , debilitating .
Although loss of libido is most often ascribed as a side - effect , recent research has found that many women 's capacity for arousal and orgasm actually increases .
But these leavening facts have no place in the current discourse , which characterises this age as a time of loss , pathologising what really ought to sit as naturally on the timeline of a woman 's development as puberty or pregnancy .
In Hot Flushes and Cold Science , her fascinating history of the modern menopause , published next month , Dr Louise Foxcroft charts the way that it has been historically medicalised in western culture , to the extent that it is now viewed by women as well as the medical establishment as a disease requiring urgent intervention .
She also examines the dearth of evidence connecting the menopause to mental health , despite their often lazy linkage , and argues that lows which occur around that time might equally be ascribed to other life events involving partners , work , children , elderly parents , quality of sleep or health .
What is not in dispute is that the menopause is a phenomenon with a cultural context .
Our society continues to equate female sexuality and attractiveness with youth .
And it still measures a significant proportion of a woman 's worth according to her ability to reproduce .
Regardless , I suspect that many older women have indeed reached that state of grace where they are confident enough to judge themselves - and demand to be judged by others - not only according to what they look like in the mirror .
And , as Foxcroft concludes , when it comes to being done with the palaver of contraception and pregnancy , freedom is a powerful aphrodisiac .
Diana Athill aside - winner of last year 's Costa biography prize and heroic chronicler of desire beyond 50 - very few cheerful narratives exist for those women who may well be more sexually confident than ever before , but are only encouraged to feel obsolete .
As our population continues to age , an increasing number of women will be spending a sizable chunk of their lives post - menopause , and could perhaps do with better public mirrors than Twiggy or Marie Helvin in an M&S campaign can provide .
And more realistic ones .
I doubt there are many 60 - year - olds who still want to be supermodels , but they might not balk at the idea of being appointed US secretary of state .

Approaches to internationalization in Haskell
There are several different approaches you can use to internationalize your Haskell program .
Using GNU gettext
You can internationalize your program using GNU gettext and its Haskell bindings package hgettext .
Set up your translations and integrate them into your application using these instructions .
Using native Haskell data types
The Yesod web framework takes this approach but provides a more translator - friendly format .
You can internationalize your program using native Haskell data types .
Represent the individual texts to be translated as constructors of a Haskell data type .
Then provide a function that automatically renders the texts appropriately in the current language context .
See this description of a simple example of using Haskell data types for internationalization .
Using the Grammatical Framework
You can internationalize your program using the Grammatical Framework ( GF ) .
The GF provides a way to define human - language - independent syntax for expressing texts in Haskell .
The GF can then render the texts automatically in any human language for which an appropriate GF grammer exists .
See this very simple example of an application internationalized using GF .
It is based on the " Foods " grammar ( included in the example ) , so it 's quite contrived , but it should be enough to get you started .
Usage instructions are in the file README.md .
See the GF download page for information about how to install GF .
The standard installation of GF currently includes grammars for at least 26 languages .
Comparison of approaches to internationalization
GNU gettext
Advantages :
Easiest integration with other tools and programming languages
Little or no specialized knowledge required of translators
Little or no interaction needed between programmers and translators
Well - known and well - documented
Disadvantages :
Inflexible use of static text literals creates awkwardness when there are complex differences between how the same idea is expressed in different languages
Translation selection happens at runtime , so there is no type safety
Texts are loaded from external files at runtime , which creates overhead and deployment issues
Requires a moderate amount of work to set up and integrate
Not well supported on MS Windows
Native Haskell data types
Advantages :
Easy to implement in Haskell
Compile - time type safety
Fast
Flexible in handling complex differences between languages
Flexible in implementation : e.g. , use a type class if you do n't want one big data type , use Text or Builder instead of String
Platform independent
Disadvantages :
May require some training of translators and / or cooperative integration work between translators and programmers , depending on the level of sophistication needed in the rendering functions
May lead to many string literals in a Haskell source file .
This requires a work - around for a current limitation of the GHC compiler ; see file - embed , below .
Yesod 's Native Data type approach
Yesod 's approach provides a translator - friendly veneer that gets rid of the above disadvantages .
It is integrated with the Yesod web framework and its use of the Hamlet template language .
A portion of it has been abstracted out into the http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shakespeare-i18n package .
Grammatical Framework
Advantages :
Translations automatically generated in all languages for which GF grammars exist , without the need for human translators
High quality translations
Platform independent
Disadvantages :
Learning curve for the programmer to express texts using existing GF grammars , and to extend GF grammars as needed
Extra work needed if you must support languages that do not yet have a GF grammar
Installing GF is not quite as simple as installing the usual Haskell package
A human translator may still be needed for domain - specific words and expressions not included in the standard GF grammars
The following tools may also be useful when internationalizing your Haskell program :
file - embed
Internationalization often leads to a large number of literal strings in a Haskell source file .
This creates a technical problem due to a current limitation of the GHC compiler - the GHC compiler does not behave well when compiling a source file with a large number of literal strings .
One classic work - around to this problem is to place the literal strings in a small C library and import them via the FFI .
Another work - around , based on Template Haskell , is provided by the file - embed package .
numerals
The numerals package renders numbers ( currently only cardinal numbers ) as text in many different languages .
The IMF says it sees mounting problems for developing countries
The world 's poorest countries are beginning to be hit by the global financial crisis , warns the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
And they are likely to need $ 25 bn ( £ 18 bn ) in additional financing this year , the organisation says .
The IMF describes it as the " third wave " of the downturn ; after first affecting the advanced and then the emerging economies .
And it is calling on donor countries not to cut back on their support .
In a new report , the IMF says poor countries face greater exposure to the current crisis because they are more integrated into the international economy than they used to be .
They are likely to feel the impact through a downturn in trade and falls in foreign investment and remittances - money sent home by people working abroad , the fund adds .
Humanitarian crisis
The report says more than 20 countries , half of them in Sub - Saharan Africa , are particularly vulnerable .
It warns that if " global growth and financing conditions deteriorate further , the number of vulnerable countries could almost double " .
And that would increase the additional amount of money countries need towards $ 140 bn , the study predicts .
" After hitting first the advanced economies and then the emerging economies , a third wave from the global financial crisis is now hitting the world 's poorest and most vulnerable countries , " the head of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , says .
VULNERABLE COUNTRIES Angola Ghana Honduras Kyrgyzstan Moldova Mongolia Nigeria Papua New Guinea Sudan Vietnam
List shows some of the countries identified by the IMF " This puts at risk the major achievements of higher growth , lower poverty , and greater political stability that many low - income countries have made over the past decade . "
Mr Strauss - Kahn called on donor nations to provide the financing required in order to " prevent a humanitarian crisis " .
The IMF , which represents 185 nations , says it has already increased its support to low income countries in the last year and it is ready to provide more .
But the amount is still relatively low , our economics correspondent Andrew Walker says .
And the IMF has made larger commitments to mainly middle income countries that are more directly affected by the financial crisis , our correspondent adds .
Are you in Africa ?
Are you struggling as a result of the global financial crisis ?
Or are you doing well despite of the economic climate ?
How is the global economic crisis affecting you ?

The number one question that I receive from readers who want to open their own online store is how to go about finding vendors and suppliers .
Do I purchase wholesale ?
Should I drop ship or should I contact the manufacturer directly ?
When my wife and I first started our online store , we faced these exact same questions .
But having done a fair amount of research on each of the options above , I ’d like to talk about our experiences and our take on each of these ways to stock merchandise for your online business .
While our experiences are primarily related to wedding linens , what we are about to tell you should apply to almost anything that you choose to sell in your online store .
Want To Learn How To Find Great Suppliers For Your Ecommerce Business ?
Finding a dependable wholesale supplier is a crucial step in starting a successful ecommerce business .
So I put together a comprehensive package of resources that will help you find great suppliers ( foreign and domestic ) and launch your own online store from complete scratch .

Drop Shipping
Most people fall into the trap of getting excited about drop shipping when they first open their online store .
Drop shipping seems appealing for several reasons .
For one thing , you do n’t have to stock any items .
Whenever an order comes in , you simply place the exact same order to the drop shipper and collect the profit based on the difference in selling price .
There is no inventory , no fulfillment obligations and all you have to do is take orders .
Sound like a dream come true ?
What most people do n’t realize is that the profit margins often suck and you have to provide customer support for problems that are completely out of your hands .
What if the drop shipper screws up the order or ships the product late ?
What if the drop shipper routinely ships faulty items ?
Guess what ?
You have to deal with all of these issues even though they are n’t your fault .
Couple that with the fact that the profit margins are extremely small ( between 10 - 25 % ) and you have a situation where you are sacrificing your mental health over things beyond your control for very little money .
Even if you manage to find a reliable drop shipper , customer issues will still pop up and it will be much harder to deal with them when you do n’t have control over your fulfillment .
In a nutshell , you are staking the reputation of your business on a 3rd party who may not have your interests in mind .
In most cases , it ’s easier to become an affiliate rather than drop ship .
This way , you take your cut and you ’re done .
There are no hassles .
How To Find Dropship Suppliers
That being said , drop shipping is an excellent way to fill in gaps in your overall product line .
For example , let ’s say I sell handkerchiefs but I only have 3 private label styles of my own to sell .
Instead of launching a store with only 3 products , I can fill out my selection with drop shipped goods .
Most people are n’t aware that you can mix and match drop shipping with your own inventory but you can !
For those who are apprehensive about starting a business , drop shipping is also a good way to dip your toes in ecommerce without risking a lot of money .
While I would never base my online store solely on drop shipping , an easy way to find companies willing to drop ship is via a service called Worldwide Brands .
We ’ve used them in the past to quickly find vendors to fill out our inventory for sparse categories .
That being said , most wholesalers will not want to drop ship for you unless you can demonstrate that you are a legit business that can drive sales .
And while many vendors do n’t openly advertise that they ’ll drop ship , you can sometimes negotiate a drop shipping arrangement if you just ask .
For information on how to start a dropshipped business and approach a dropship vendor , read the following posts
Buying Wholesale Domestically
I hear the word ‘ wholesale ’ a lot .
Many people contact us about wholesale pricing and where to find wholesale products .
The term ‘ wholesale ’ seems to imply that the price that you are going to get is going to be the lowest that you can find .
Well guess what ?
Nothing could be further from the truth .
When I was shopping for domestic vendors for our online store , all of the “ wholesale ” dealers in the US were offering extremely high prices .
Sure , they were cheaper than MSRP ( MSRP is just a made up number anyway ) , but the prices were sufficiently high that the profit margins would have been on the low end for the products we wanted to sell .
To make things worse , there were already a large number of competitors carrying the exact same items in their stores at rock bottom prices .
So why buy from a wholesale vendor in the US ?
Because many products are not made in the United States anymore , wholesalers take care of all the hassle of importing and warehousing the goods from the manufacturer .
You do n’t have to travel to a foreign place .
You do n’t have to deal with shipping or customs .
You just place your order and the merchandise appears at your doorstep .
Buying wholesale domestically also saves you time from having to perform extensive quality control checks on your merchandise because presumably the wholesaler has gone through it all already .
The simplest way to find wholesale vendors in the US is by Googling the company of the product you want to sell , going on their website , and finding out who their wholesale distributors are .
Smaller companies most likely wo n’t have distributors and will sell to you directly .
Typical wholesale discounts are on the order of 30 - 50 % off MSRP .
And depending on the item and the brand , the minimum order can be as low as a hundred dollars .
Another great way to find wholesale vendors is by attending local trade shows .
For example , a site called WholesaleCentral.com lists all of the trade shows in the US based on product category .
If you live near a major city , you should definitely go and check out a trade show if you have the time .
All you need is a sellers permit and in most cases admission is free .
Buying Direct From Overseas Manufacturers
Buying direct from the manufacturer is the holy grail of merchandising , but it also takes the most amount of work , dedication and time .
These days , almost everything is manufactured overseas because labor costs are much cheaper .
My general rule of thumb ( for textiles at least ) is if you are buying from a vendor in the United States , you are n’t going to get the best pricing for your products .
Buying direct from the manufacturer or from overseas vendors is the best way to obtain the lowest prices , but it also presents the greatest upfront headaches .
Here ’s a list of things that we had to deal with when finding our vendors in Asia .
Communication can be an issue – Most Chinese vendors do n’t speak english very well so you often have to rely on written communication like email .
– Most Chinese vendors do n’t speak english very well so you often have to rely on written communication like email .
Product definition is a slow process – Manufacturers in Asia have really crappy websites and it ’s often hard to get an idea of their merchandise quality online .
As a result , you have to get samples made and sent across the country which takes a long time .

The lead times are long – Getting products made often takes months so you have to plan your inventory requirements carefully .
Is Buying Direct From Overseas Worth It ?
After reading about all of the hassles outlined above , is it really worth it ?
The answer is a resounding yes .
The prices are unbeatable and the upfront investment is worth it in the long run .
Once you ’ve established a good relationship with a vendor , it becomes smooth sailing from then on .
You will be able to competitively price your products .
You will be able to out price the larger chains and you will be able to differentiate yourself from the competition .
Once you have confidence in your manufacturers , you can design your own custom products and that is where the big money starts to kick in .
If you can fabricate your own designs or make small improvements to existing ones , you have the potential to sell completely unique goods that no other store can offer .
How To Find Overseas Vendors And Suppliers
A great place to start is online .
There are a variety of search engines for overseas manufacturers .
For example , Alibaba.com or GlobalSources.com are good places to start for a wide variety of items .
Both Alibaba and Global Sources vet all of their suppliers and provide you with useful information so you can quickly evaluate each vendor .
In addition , with a click of a button , you can easily contact a Chinese supplier directly and ask for quotes , minimum order quantities and lead times .
In general , both Alibaba and Global Sources allow you to quickly access thousands of vendors without having to travel to Asia .

Find Suppliers By Leveraging The US Customs Database
Even though the vendor reviews on Alibaba and Global Sources are helpful for evaluating potential suppliers , an even faster way to vet great suppliers is to simply find out who your competitors are using .
In fact , you can easily steal wholesale suppliers from your competition by leveraging a supplier database .
What is a supplier database ?
Every sea shipping container that enters the United States must clear customs before it is allowed to cross the border .
And during this process , every shipment is carefully documented in the US customs database .
All of this information is freely available to the public and a supplier database tool allows you to quickly browse the shipments for every company that imports into the United States by sea .
For example , here is a sample shipping document ( bill of lading ) for The North Face .
From this document , you can easily find North Face ’s supplier and the size and weight of their shipment .
This information is extremely powerful !
My favorite supplier database tool is called the Jungle Scout Supplier Database
For a small fee , you can quickly and easily find the exact factories your competition is using !
Below is a video demo I created on how to use the Jungle Scout supplier database tool to find your suppliers .
Note : I have negotiated a significant discount on the tool for MyWifeQuitHerJob.com readers .

Once you ’ve found some potential vendors , send them email or give them a call .
Get a feel for whether they truly carry or manufacture the products that you ’re interested in .
Once you ’ve narrowed down potential vendors , it helps to have a Skype or WeChat conversation .
And if you can , hop on a plane and visit them directly .
Especially if you are dealing with Asian vendors , face to face communication is strongly preferred in order to establish a good relationship .
By speaking to your vendor face to face , you are accomplishing three main things .
One , you are showing them that you are serious about purchasing from them .
Two , you will get to see their entire inventory of products in person to judge their quality .
And three , you will be able to place a face with a name and get to know them on a personal level .
Before meeting our first vendor face to face , I remember picturing him as a sleazy Asian dude wearing a wife beater and smoking a cigarette .
Much to my surprise , our supplier was actually clean cut and a pleasant , honest looking fellow .
After meeting him face to face , I had much more confidence in ordering from him .
Because face to face communication is so important , my wife and I travel to China and Hong Kong every other year to visit our vendors .

Attending Tradeshows
In Hong Kong And China
While finding and contacting vendors via Alibaba and Global Sources is fairly straightforward , it is a very slow and cumbersome process .
Not only to do you have to get individual samples sent back and forth from Asia , but there ’s also a major communication slowdown because exchanging emails is highly inefficient .
Add in the time difference and you only have a small window of time everyday to communicate .
But what if you could contact and see sample products for thousands of Chinese vendors all at once in a single location ?
What if you could see and touch all of the merchandise without having to wait several weeks ?
That ’s what you get if you attend a major trade show like the Canton Fair or the Global Sources Expo .
Because so many different vendors congregate at these fairs and bring their merchandise with them , you can easily cover hundreds of vendors in the span of just a few days .
There ’s no back and forth or delay in communication .
You do n’t have to get samples made and sent overseas .
Everything is right there at your fingertips .
I ’ve written about the Canton Fair extensively in the past .

GlobalSources Vs Alibaba
If you are finding your Asian vendors via Global Sources and Alibaba , keep in mind that these two services have different strengths .
If you are sourcing electronics , then Global Sources is by far the better service .
In fact , the vendors you ’ll find on Global Sources will tend to be higher quality because they vet their companies more closely .
But on the flip side , the vendors on Global Sources are more established and prefer to work with companies with greater purchasing power .
As a result , the minimum order quantities tend to be higher .
Alibaba has a much larger selection of vendors but it ’s going to be a mixed bag in terms of quality and legitimacy .
Some companies on Alibaba are trading companies .
Some listings are individuals doing wholesale arbitrage online .
Make sure you do your due diligence on every company before you make a large purchase .
When To Source Product From Asia Vs the United States Or Your Home Country
While the prices for your goods will tend to be cheaper if purchased from China , importing from Asia will not always be the right answer for everyone .
There are many factors that you need to take into account .
First off , the main advantage of importing from China is that the labor costs are significantly cheaper .
Therefore if what you want to sell is labor intensive , going with China will almost always be cheaper .
So textiles , clothing and anything that needs to be handmade are ideal candidates for importing .
But let ’s say you manufacture plastic toys and you already own the molds .
The cost of plastic between the US and Asia will probably not differ enough to warrant manufacturing in China .
The other thing you need to consider are the minimum order quantities and the cost of shipping and customs .
Note : I created a true landed cost of goods shipping calculator that you should check out if you plan on importing from overseas .

Where To Find Wholesale Clothing Suppliers In The US
A lot of people come to me and ask if China is the right answer when manufacturing t shirts and dresses .
If you are doing huge volumes , then the answer is yes .
But for most beginners , making clothing in China is overkill .
You ’re much better off buying fabric in the US and finding a local seamstress to make your goods for you .
Only once you have the patterns down and know that you can sell in sufficient volume should you import a large quantity .
If you want to manufacture your own products in the US , there are a lot of ways to find vendors .
For textiles and clothing , you can visit the local garment district in your area .
If you want to manufacture your own goods in the US , check out my post on 4 Ways To Find USA Wholesale Suppliers
You can also use Google and look for local manufacturers and product designers .
If you are specifically looking to sell ready made wholesale clothing , you can try the following companies in the US .
Wholesale Fashion Square
WholesaleFashionSquare.com is a wholesale clothing marketplace of manufacturers and importers from Los Angeles , CA .
Most of their items are sold in bundles of 6 and they offer very reasonable pricing on their items .
Overall , they have one of the largest selections of wholesale clothing in the United States spanning accessories , jewelry scarves , makeup accessories and clothing for all seasons and occasions .
LA Show Room
Similar to Wholesale Fashion Square , LAShowRoom.com also offers a huge selection of clothing from designers , manufacturers , and distributors from around the world .
New products are added every week and they carry mens , womens and children ’s clothing from a variety of brands .
Where To Find Wholesale Clothing Suppliers In China
Once you are ready for larger scale manufacturing , then finding wholesale suppliers in China makes the most economic sense .
Just to give you an idea of pricing , you can buy a blank t- shirt in China for as little as 50 cents depending on quality .
But the downside is that the Minimum Order Quantity ( MOQ ) for clothing is on the order of 300 - 500 pieces per design .
In many cases , you have to order 300 - 500 pieces per size as well .
As a result , manufacturing clothing in China carries a large upfront investment .
In general , you should only order designs from China that you know you can sell in volume .
In addition to finding clothing manufacturers on Alibaba and Global Sources , you can also look at ChinaBrands.com and Made - In - China.com as well for clothing suppliers .

The Choice Is Yours
How you prefer to obtain your goods from your suppliers is up to you , but buying direct is a no brainer in my book .
The more work that you are willing to put into your business , the more profits that you will make .
No one said that opening an online store was going to be easy .
By placing a larger investment of your time upfront , you will pave the way to greater rewards in the future .

The Money Growth Formula
The basic relationship
In a TREND sense , real economic growth is the result of the effect of the current demand for money ( money demand ratio , or MDR , measurable as M1 / GDP ) on the change in spendable money balances ( M1 ) .
gr( GDP ) = gr( M1 ) - gr( MDR )
This is not a tautology
One might assume this at first glance to be a tautology , since " obviously "
GDP = M1 / ( M1/GDP )
However , this would only be true if GDP and M1 were inherently independent of each other , and the MDR was simply a description of their relationship .
In fact , the situation is quite different .
The MDR describes how the economy is managing the money it uses in generating GDP spending .
Although the only convenient measure we have for it is M1 / GDP , it is , in fact , an independent characteristic of the economy -- the degree to which interest rates and other factors induce people to economize ( or not ) on cash balances .
To the extent that people manage to economize on cash balances and still maintain a given level of economic ( GDP ) activity -- i.e. , a decreasing MDR -- less money is necessary to support a given level of GDP . )
The policy formula
To determine the amount of growth in nominal ( current - dollar ) M1 necessary to achieve a certain degree of nominal economic growth , the above relationship must be adjusted for inflation , the best overall economic measure of which appears to be the National Income measure of the deflator for final sales .
This results in the following prescriptive relationship between money and economic growth :
TARGET
NOMINAL MONEY
GROWTH = DESIRED
REAL ECONOMIC
GROWTH + change in
DEMAND FOR
MONEY + INFLATION
RATE or target policy target current trend current trend gr ( M1 nominal ) = gr ( GDP real ) + gr ( MDR ) + gr( FS - defl )
The components of a policy target for economic growth
In IEA 's frame of reference , the ideal economic environment is one in which planning by business and households is facilitated by the predictability offered by stable full - employment without inflation .
Getting to that environment involves economic growth with two components :
the underlying trend of Potential ( high - employment ) GDP , and an asymptotic ( " soft- landing " )
Recovery component , related to the unemployment rate gap -- the excess of the current unemployment rate over the " high - employment unemployment rate "
gr ( GDP ) = gr ( P - GDP trend ) + Recovery
Under this formula , initially rapid economic growth in a period of high employment slows gradually as growth reduces the unemployment rate gap ( and thus its component in the formula ) .
Eventually , growth slows to that of Potential GDP , characterized by normal increases in
productivity , and labor force
SAN FRANCISCO  Skype , the Internet calling service that has more than 400 million users around the world , is aggressively moving onto mobile phones .
The Luxembourg - based company , a division of eBay , plans to announce on Tuesday that it will make its free software available immediately for Apple ’s iPhone and iPod Touch and , beginning in May , for various BlackBerry phones , made by Research in Motion .
Other companies have already made software for those phones that works with Skype , but it does not offer all of the service ’s features .
As with Skype on the computer , users of Skype on mobile phones can make calls and send instant messages to other Skype users free , and they pay lower rates than the phone companies would charge when they use Skype to call landlines or other mobile phones .
It has been a little more than a month since you were able to install the latest and greatest KDE on release day .
Today is another one of those with KDE 4.2.1 ( codenamed " Cream " ) hitting the shelves .
Today , the KDE team announces the immediate availability of KDE 4.2.1 , which is a recommended update for everyone running KDE .
( If you are still on 3.5 , do consider again upgrading to KDE 4 . ) 4.2.1 has a nice changelog for those that want to read something while packages are being downloaded .
As usual , this release does not contain exciting new features but stabilizes the 4.2.0 release further .
A month worth of feedback and bug fixing surely pays off .
Also , those dot - releases bring updated translations for the 50 - odd languages KDE desktop and applications are shipping in .
If you are running this release with Qt 4.5 and you 're encountering problems , please let the developers know by means of bugs .
kde.org so those kinks can be worked out for everyone ( including yourself ) .
The KDE team wishes you a lot of fun and productivity with this release and goes back to hacking on the next KDE coming this summer .
In the meantime , roughly once a month we 'll keep pushing out the latest bug fixes and updates through this kind of dot - releases to the user .

Granted , this is a decidedly male back pocket and not the ass - hugging skinny jeans of Vaio P ad fame .
And it still looks like it 's filling that zone halfway between concept and actual product ( as the actual concept sketches that accompany the shots on Lenovo 's Flickr stream would seem to indicate ) but it does look cool , with an ultra- widescreen , apparently touchscreen display that may be able to flip around into tablet mode .

Also , look at that crazy belt clasp system .
According to one of the Flickr captions , that belt also turns into a mouse .
Mind blown .
All we 've got not are these shots , so we 'll have to see what pops up in terms of concrete details .

UPDATE : Sadly , the folks at Lenovo 's design department have outed the Pocket Yoga as a two - year - old concept .
Why photos of it showed up on a Lenovo Flickr stream earlier today is anyone 's guess , but as of now , they 're denying that this is an actual upcoming product .

Yes , I 'm talking to you It 's been a busy week for speechwriters , with world leaders converging on London and Strasbourg .
But how much of the success of a speech depends on what is said , asks Jay Mukoro .
When Barack Obama stood up to make his inaugural speech , the enticement for the audience set before him - and the world beyond - was not simply to see the 44th President of the United States take office ( and all the historic significance attached to it ) , but to hear him speak .
Ted Sorensen , former speechwriter to John F Kennedy , tells us that words " are the instruments that a president of the United States uses to govern the country , and wins the support of the world " .
However in the early 18th Century it was customary for political speeches to be read , not delivered .
David Frum , President Bush 's former speechwriter , points out that the political culture in America at that time deemed that if you sought power you were n't to be trusted .
As a result , oratory did n't figure as an attribute you should possess .
By the latter part of the 18th Century , oratory had returned to the political stage , and by the 19th Century the ancient art of oratory was back in full gusto .
On one inauguration day it had famously tragic consequences .

In the 1840 presidential campaign William Henry Harrison , a Whig , was portrayed by the Democrats ' campaign machine as a simple frontier fighter and a hard cider drinker , living in a log cabin .
In fact Harrison was a scion of the Virginia planter aristocracy , and he 'd studied classics and history .
Once elected - and determined to slay this false image - Harrison delivered a three - hour inaugural address , pulling out all the stops and using all the rhetorical flourishes from his classical training , which included references to the ancient Athenian constitution .
Unfortunately for Harrison , this speech was delivered on a cold March day in Washington .
Soon after Harrison caught a cold , which developed into pneumonia , and he died on 4 April 1841 .
At a mere 278 words , Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg address which he delivered in Pennsylvania , on 19 November 1863 , shows that perhaps one of the tricks to the art of great oratory is to be brief .
Body language Political oratory , as a tradition , does n't simply stretch back across the ocean to Europe , but back in time , to ancient Rome and ancient Greece .
Cicero is generally credited as one of the most versatile minds of ancient Rome .
He rose to the heights of the senator class by his eloquence .
As a man from a modest background with great ambition , " rhetoric was the thing at his disposal to make his career " , says the writer Charlotte Higgins .

Rome the senators were really drama critics , critiquing not only the contents of one another 's speeches , but the style of delivery .
Former President Bill Clinton agrees .
He says : " A lot of communication has nothing to do with the words , a lot of it is just your body language , or your tone of voice , or the way you look in your eyes . "
Tone remains an important characteristic or ingredient when delivering a speech .
Bill Clinton , for example , says he tries to make his speeches " like a jazz music piece , where I 've got a script and there 's this ad - lib " in the middle .
Winston Churchill liked his speeches to be heard like a psalm .
In the hands of a demagogue , however , impassioned rhetoric can be used to appeal to the worst excesses of nationalism .
" Ancient critics of rhetoric would have found Hitler a pretty good example of everything that they distrusted about rhetoric , " says Charlotte Higgins .
Kinnock was over - exuberant in 1992
And this is one reason why rhetoric has at various times in our history fallen out of favour because , as the author Simon Sebag - Montefiore tells us , " words lie " .
But words have the power to stir people , as exemplified by Obama 's campaign slogan " Yes We Can " .
And as Rev Jesse Jackson notes , " words paint pictures , words draw our imagination " and help us to believe we can achieve great things .
With the rise of television , we all have the chance to be critics .
The classic example is the Kennedy - Nixon debate , which has set the tone for modern televised political debate .
Closer to home , Neil Kinnock 's appearance at the Labour election rally in Sheffield in 1992 is cited by Diane Abbott MP as a clear example of someone getting intoxicated by the adulation of the crowd .
It has been argued that this performance - in which an over - exuberant Kinnock cringingly repeated " we 're awright " to the crowd - was one of the reasons Labour lost the 1992 election .
But perhaps Bill Clinton is one of the best placed people to remind us of challenge in delivering a truly great speech .
" You measure the impact of your words , not on the beauty or the emotion of the moment but on whether you change the way people not only think , but the way they feel . "
And that 's extremely difficult to do , but it 's important to try .

Look Ma , the system of checks and balances does work !
After passing both the state House and Senate , Utah governor John Huntsman vetoed a bill that would make it a crime to sell mature - rated games to underage consumers .
While the bill sounds noble , the fine print imposed strict penalties on retailers , and as a concession , actually allowed them to opt - out from using ratings altogether .
As such , the bill was largely viewed as pointless legislation .
" While protecting children from inappropriate materials is a laudable goal , the language of this bill is so broad that it likely will be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional , " Huntsman said after his decision .
" The unintended consequence of the bill would be that parents and children would have no labels to guide them in determining the age appropriateness of the goods or service . "
After the bill started gaining momentum in the state legislature , retailers responded by saying they would simply use a loophole in the bill to avoid civil penalties of up to $ 2,000 .
By simply removing the Entertainment Software Ratings Board labels from games , they would not suffer penalties because they would not be advertising guidance when selling mature - rated games .
The ESRB , which lobbied heavily to have the bill vetoed , was pleased with the decision .
" This is an absolute win for families , " said ratings president Michael Gallagher .
" Utah 's parents will benefit from Governor Huntsman 's leadership and thoughtfulness on this issue .
His decisive action helps caregivers and prevents businesses from being opened to unproductive , wasteful civil litigation and needless expense . "
Under Utah law , the bill will now return to the legislative branch , where it can be further amended to satisfy the governor 's objections .
If they desire , however , both the state house and senate can override the governor 's veto and force the bill into law with a two - thirds majority revote .
Both the house and senate approved the bill by more than two - thirds majority the first time .
Representative Mike Morley ( R ) of the Utah House , who sponsored the bill , has not made it known if he plans to veto the veto with a second vote .
In the event he does and it successfully passes , the courts would likely deem the current bill unconstitutional , as Governor Huntsman is aware .

That ’s one way to phrase the conclusion of a new study on how the economical but decidedly nontraditional slang words in text messages affect the language skills of young people .
Researchers at Coventry University in England ran 88 grade - school students through a battery of literacy tests .
Then , the researchers asked each child to write responses to 10 real - world scenarios – asking a friend what to wear to a birthday party , for example – and measured how frequently the students used “ textisms , ” such as abbreviating “ tonight ” as “ 2nite . ”
Parents and educators have long complained that such slang words erode a student ’s English skills .
But the results of the study , published in this month ’s edition of the British Journal of Developmental Psychology , tell a different story .
The analysis found no evidence of a relationship between frequently typing in textisms and diminished spelling ability .
The more textisms students used , the higher they tended to score on measures of word - based learning and vocabulary .
The report suggests that when kids use text message lingo , they are actually being artful – not just lazy – and building a heightened awareness of letter patterns and sounds .
In support of the theory , the study found reading ability correlated more positively with sound - based textisms , such as substituting “ wiv ” for “ with , ” than with acronyms , such as writing “ lol ” in place of “ laughing out loud . ”
A factor behind the results might simply be the increased exposure to the printed word that text - messaging inspires .
The fun and ease of the medium encourages extra language practice , especially by children whose skills are poor and who are otherwise discouraged from reading .
Kids who obtained a mobile phone at an early age performed the best on the literacy tests .
China executes more people than any other nation
The number of state executions almost doubled last year worldwide , with China accounting for nearly three - quarters of the total , Amnesty International says .
In its annual survey , the group says 2,390 people were put to death in 2008 , up from 1,252 in 2007 .
Of those , 1,718 people ( 72 % ) were executed in China .
Another 8,864 people were sentenced to death , up from 3,347 in 2007 .
On the positive side , the report shows that only 59 nations retained the death penalty , and few actually used it .
The group 's secretary general , Irene Khan , said such punishments as beheading , stoning and electrocution " have no place in the 21st Century " .
Despite the rise in executions during 2008 , she said there were reasons to be optimistic .
" The good news is that executions are only carried out by a small number of countries , which shows that we are moving closer to a death - penalty free world , " she said .
' Worrying instances '
The group highlighted decisions by Argentina and Uzbekistan to abolish the death penalty in 2008 .
And the fact that Belarus was the only European nation to carry out executions was also interpreted positively .
But Ms Khan said the " bad news " in the report , entitled Death Sentences and Executions in 2008 , was that hundreds of people continued to suffer .
Of 25 nations using the death penalty in 2008 , China was the most prolific .
The report said China used lethal injection and shooting to execute at least 1,718 people .
But Beijing does not publish data on the death penalty .
Of the top -six countries in Amnesty 's list , only the US ( 37 ) publishes statistics on the penalty 's use .
The figures for the others are estimates based on what Amnesty has verified through media reports , rights groups and official statements .
Other groups frequently give much higher figures .
The other worst - offending nations on the list are Iran ( 346 ) , Saudi Arabia ( 102 ) , Pakistan ( 36 ) and Iraq ( 34 ) .
Amnesty also highlighted " worrying instances " of some nations bucking a long - term trend away from the death penalty .
St Kitts and Nevis carried out the first execution in the Caribbean for five years , the group 's report said .
And Liberia introduced capital punishment for robbery , terrorism and hijacking .

From the ' would n't that be something ' files :
IBM is reportedly in talks to acquire Sun for a whopping $ 6.5 billion .
At this early stage , its not known whether this is a fact or just a rumor .
But just for the sake of argument , let 's consider what a powerhouse IBM Sun would be .
In my opinion , it would be a boon to both the Unix and Linux markets .
Between the two of them , they control two - thirds of the Unix market with AIX and Solaris .
They also control a large portion of the big server market , with IBM 's POWER and Sun 's SPARC architectures .
The only company in the Unix space that effectively competes against Sun and IBM is HP , and a result an IBM - Sun combo would be a major challenge .
Then again , it was n't that long ago that HP bought Compaq for $ 25 billion ( and remember Compaq had DEC ) .
So in terms of size and scale , IBM acquiring Sun is a smaller deal and may perhaps even finally be IBM 's attempt at catching up , as it were .
Bringing AIX and Solaris under one roof will help to consolidate Unix 's position instead of fraying it with competition .
For Linux , Sun is n't unfriendly -- working with Ubuntu / Canonical and others lately , but Solaris is their main operating system push , the way I see it .
With Sun as part of IBM , and IBM a major reseller of Linux , the equation changes .
Sun would fall into the IBM fold of pro-Linux in a manner similar to how HP today supports Linux .
Yes , there would be overlap -- just as there was for HP and Compaq -- but together , the combined IBM / Sun will challenge HP on significantly larger level .
Expanding the competitive landscape a little , with Cisco getting into the server market and a tighter relationship with Red Hat , the overall IT landscape is changing .
IBM and Sun both have to do something in response to Cisco 's blade server , and a new combined entity might just be the ticket .
In search of a future for Brentwood , CA … and the U.S. work force
Raymond Alvarez : Earthquakes , a great flood , fires – seemingly nothing could stop the rocking ’90s and California ’s Contra Costa County , an area bounded by high tech companies to the south and industrial giants in the north .
Then came the fourth horseman of the apocalypse , the real estate bust .
Gravity finally caught up with the region that somehow managed to absorb a Dot.com bust and the familiar problems that strike the Golden State with some regularity .
Fortunes turned in 2007 .
Suddenly , a robust housing industry fell quiet .
Home prices plummeted .
Real estate professionals scurried to grab the vanishing service jobs in the area .
In 2008 , The San Francisco Chronicle labeled the commuter town the poster child of the housing collapse .
When ordering by Internet , you were likely to have your merchandise shipped to the tiny neighborhood made famous by O.J. Even Bay area residents confessed to being confused .
Brentwood the municipality was that far off the map .
In good times , the incorporated town west of Stockton was in the nation ’s sweet spot .
Vasco Road , a two - lane strip of asphalt connecting high - tech dotted Pleasanton - Dublin , was upgraded from country road to highway .
BART was extended to Pittsburg , about a half hour ’s drive from Brentwood .
By the late 1990s , the Bay Area economy was red hot and home seekers came looking in the burgh beyond the hills .
Some raved about the small town feeling .
Relatively affordable home prices and an easy 40 - minute commute were deal signers for many .
According to the Chronicle ’s statistics , Brentwood is home to more than 53,000 , quintupling in size from 1990 to 2007 .
The only faster growing area was a new state prison .
Today , Brentwood is pinning its hopes on Obama ’s Stimulus Package .
Could lightning strike twice ?
Could transportation improvement ignite another growth spurt ?
Some are hoping that the BART extension that would bring rail service right to their door may be just what the recession doctor ordered .
There can be little doubt a housing rescue would arrest falling home prices .
But what if there are no jobs at BART ’s next stop .
The more provocative question might be : Does Brentwood have the stuff , or can it get the stuff quickly , to make a recovery and even become a model for Obama ’s future economy ?
Recovery wo n’t come too soon for some .
In a normal month in Contra Costa , 16,000 families apply for some type of public assistance , including Medi-Cal , food stamps and the like .
“ In the month of January alone , our applications jumped 60 percent over what they had been in previous months , and a lot of the people now coming into our offices to apply for food or medical assistance , are people who have never been to a social service office before , ” said Joe Valentine , executive director of Employment & Human Services who spoke to San Francisco ’s KGO - TV .
Housing prices have plummeted
Contra Costa can be found among the 35 counties with the highest foreclosure actions identified in USA Today .
As Californians face an uncertain future , more are joining their ranks .
The economy lost 39,500 retail jobs in February , and has eliminated more than 500,000 in the last year .
California ’s inland area reports 10.1 percent of residents there are jobless .
The stimulus spending bill includes $ 4.5 billion in additional monies for job training .
But under current programs , many of those eligible for training are given vouchers that cover only a semester or two at community colleges .
Careers in growth industries like biotechnology and health care typically require at the minimum two - year degree programs .
Meanwhile , community colleges are straining under the weight of a massive influx of new students .
City of Brentwood , CA
In December 2008 , Brentwood ’s mayor told local real estate people the worst may have passed .
City data show in November , there were 396 homes on the multiple listing service , a decrease of 33 percent or 194 units from the 590 homes on the market one year earlier .
The key to the market recovery , in Brentwood and California in general , will be the disposition of the foreclosed inventory , the mayor says .
In his address to Congress , Obama called on laboratories , universities , and the imaginations of entrepreneurs to bring bold action and ideas to fore .
Obama understands that linking bold ideas with timely action is the way to take the country forward , Craig Benson and Leonard Schlesinger of Babson College wrote in a recent article carried by CBSMarketwatch.com .
Sustaining whatever progress in stabilizing housing will depend on jobs , or maybe an explosion of entrepreneurial frenzy .
Twitter co-founder Evan Williams let Twitter followers know last week that he had been invited to a White House economic summit .
Here is the economic rescue outlined by the New York Times :
A $ 75 billion housing rescue could help as many as 9 million American homeowners reduce mortgage payments .
Loan modifications .
Lenders and other services can immediately begin making modifications that could help up to 4 million at - risk homeowners stay in their homes .
To be eligible , homeowners with a first loan can have an unpaid principal balance up to $ 729,750 .
Lenders and other services : Services also must follow an established process to reduce the monthly payment to no more than 31 percent of the borrowers ’ gross monthly income .
Services will get financial incentives , such as an upfront fee of $ 1,000 per modification , to encourage participation .
Persistent problems of the economy could easily derail recovery if employers do n’t begin to rehire workers .
So , the next question :
What will stimulate hiring and , in the alternative , can workers hire themselves ?
“ The decimation of employment in legacy American brands such as General Motors is a trend that ’s likely to continue , ” Robert E. Hall , an economist at Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution told the New York Times .
“ We have to stimulate the economy to create jobs in other areas . ”
Going out of business in Brentwood
The economy lost 39,500 retail jobs in February , and has eliminated more than 500,000 in the last year .
The stimulus spending bill includes $ 4.5 billion for job training .
That only begins to address an area long neglected , Andrew Stettner told the Times .
In current dollars , the nation devoted the equivalent of $ 20 billion a year to job training in 1979 , compared with only $ 6 billion last year , said Stettner , the deputy director of the National Employment Law Project .
“ We have to seriously look at fundamentally rebuilding the economy , ” he said .
“ You ’ve got to use this moment to retrain for jobs . ”
If there were ever a time that called for unconventional thinking , it would be now .
So , it may seem particularly prescient that a founder of what may be the fastest growing company in the nation was invited to the White House .
William ’s company Twitter is poised to play a growing role in igniting an economic recovery – once it unveils its revenue model .
The millions of business users flocking to his social media network suggest it has the potential .
Searching for jobs in Brentwood
Analysts may look in vain for the start of significant temporary employee hiring that would signal a bottoming of the economy .
But what if businesses decide that permanent hires are no longer practical ?
Futurist Thomas
Frey of the DaVinci Institute in Colorado is concerned , but says trends could favor Contra Costa and other counties .
“ A general trend of hiring temps could gain momentum as companies feel pressures of health care costs among other influences , ” Frey says .
But permanent hires may become the exception rather than the rule .
Frey predicts entrepreneurialism will become far more commonplace .
The good news , he says , is the one - and two - man shop have a far better track record of success among small businesses .
Frey ’s observations / predictions on labor :
The highest startup success rate belongs to the one - person businesses – the “ Empire of One . ”
As the name suggests , EO is a one - person business , often a husband / wife team .
Some EO businesses consult ; others create products and freelance services .
A better way to help align opportunity with skills is the development of business colonies that form around specific business themes or technologies , including photonics and nanotechnology .
Social media such as Twitter can bring these colonies together on an as - needed basis .
Colonies will provide training , equipment , and opportunity .
Eventually colleges will offer Empire of One training , Frey believes .
Until then , business colonies will seize on prospects springing up around business opportunities that draw knowledge and skill resources into various projects , much like the film industry does .
Twitter and other social media will be important to proliferation of the trend .
A Twitter / Empire of One economy could already be reinvigorating communities like Brentwood .
Without the Internet , email and social media , Brentwood could remain an isolated community indefinitely .
In an entrepreneurial part of cyberspace , prosperity is waiting .
Michael Cushman , founder of Learn the Book and a DaVinci Institute fellow , maintains wholesale change is needed for the educational system .
With currently available technology , namely wireless communication and virtual simulation , learning can be vastly improved .
The problem : extricating the education system from its long marriage with a classroom model .
Here ’s how remote communities might transform themselves :
Creation / transformation of community colleges that offer training inside virtual classrooms .
As the earth is digitally scanned by Google , the foundation is being laid for such possibilities .
Local colleges could develop SIM learning curriculum that might train students in entrepreneurialism , project leadership and exploiting online knowledge resources .
Cushman says virtual learning is much more powerful , so investment will have greater payoff for individuals and employers .
A business incubator also could employ the latest SIM technology making it available to tenants .
SIM technology creates a “ blended reality integrating the real physical and virtual worlds . ”
Such blended realities already exist to a limited extent ( instrumentation on a plane , navigating using a GPS enabled cell phone ) , but as of yet have not been deployed widely for education , Cushman said .
In Brentwood ’s case , the town ’s southern exposure gives way to forests of wind towers .
SIM courses might be designed for wind tower maintenance and repair .
Contra Costa and neighboring counties might be expected to tap the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for both solar and wind technologies .
The Solar Energy Industries Association says solar is poised to create 110,000 jobs over the next two years .
The solar energy provisions in the bill will help create 60,000 jobs in the solar industry in 2009 alone .
The sweet spot for hyper growth is the prize .
How quickly communities can tool up and exploit business opportunities is a question for individuals to answer .
Meanwhile , we ’re anxious to hear how that discussion between Williams and Obama went .

A report last year from LAPD Chief of Police William Bratton signaled the end of enforcing bicycle licenses , a law that was so little known within the department , you could n't obtain one at most police stations like you were supposed to .
City Council then approved the matter in January .
Fast forward to last Saturday night when two bicyclists were detained in handcuffs , one of them for not having a bicycle license when pulled over during a large group ride in Hollywood .
One cyclist was in cuffs being cited for not having a bicycle license and an out of date address on his drivers license when blogger Alex Thompson began taking photos .
Then Thompson was detained , cuffed and cited for allegedly crossing the street against the red flashing hand .
" Handcuffing someone for not having a bike license ?
For crossing the street against a flashing red hand ?
What country am I living in ? " questioned Damien Newton at LA Streetsblog .
The LAPD is allowed to handcuff detainees in two situations .
One is on when officers are responding to a call with weapons .
The other is at an officer 's discretion , based on how cooperative a person is or if they think the situation could turn violent .
" Everything is done is to keep it from escalating to the next level , " explained Officer Sam Park , noting that handcuffs can be used in any situation including minor ones like traffic stops and jaywalking .
" You never really know who you 're dealing with on the street . "
Additionally , if no actual arrest is made , no record of a detainee being handcuffed is made either .
As for the citations written Saturday night , Thompson and the other cyclist plan on fighting it in court .
And no matter the outcome , this issue will come back to City Council , who scratched the bicycle license law from the books .
To that , Newton huffs , " is the City Council just an advisory group these days ?
In everyday language , people sometimes say that immoral behaviours " leave a bad taste in your mouth " .
But this may be more than a metaphor according to new scientific evidence from the University of Toronto that shows a link between moral disgust and more primitive forms of disgust related to poison and disease .
" Morality is often pointed to as the pinnacle of human evolution and development , " says lead author Hanah Chapman , a graduate student in the Department of Psychology .
" However , disgust is an ancient and rather primitive emotion which played a key evolutionary role in survival .
Our research shows the involvement of disgust in morality , suggesting that moral judgment may depend as much on simple emotional processes as on complex thought . "
The research is being published in Science on February 27 , 2009 .
In the study , the scientists examined facial movements when participants tasted unpleasant liquids and looked at photographs of disgusting objects such as dirty toilets or injuries .
They compared these to their facial movements when they were subjected to unfair treatment in a laboratory game .
The U of T team found that people make similar facial movements in response to both primitive forms of disgust and moral disgust .
The research employed electromyography , a technique that uses small electrodes placed on the face to detect electrical activation that occurs when the facial muscles contract .
In particular , they focused on movement of the levator labii muscle , which acts to raise the upper lip and wrinkle the nose , movements that are thought to be characteristic of the facial expression of disgust .
" We found that people show activation of this muscle region in all three situations - when tasting something bad , looking at something disgusting and experiencing unfairness , " says Chapman .
" These results shed new light on the origins of morality , suggesting that not only do complex thoughts guide our moral compass , but also more primitive instincts related to avoiding potential toxins , " says Adam Anderson , principal investigator on the project and the Canada Research Chair in Affective Neuroscience .
" Surprisingly , our sophisticated moral sense of what is right and wrong may develop from a newborn 's innate preference for what tastes good and bad , what is potentially nutritious versus poisonous . "

Apple 's latest Mac OS
X security update has a knack for breaking Perl , according to Mac users across the web .
" I 've just done the update using Software update and just about everything I look at is working , except that perl seems to have gone almost AWOL , " says one Mac OS X user , with a post to Apple 's support forum .
" I seen it pop up occasionally in the Activity Monitor , but , when I try to run perl scripts from the command line or the cron jobs that ran flawlessly before the update , nothing happens .
Period . "
Two additional support forum visitors say they 've experienced similar problems with the popular programming language following Mac updates , and others have complained of Perl breakage on a public Perl mailing list and an independent blog .
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The company released its Security Update 2009 - 001 on Thursday .
According to blogger Tatsuhiko Miyagawa ,
Perl breakage only occurs if you 're running Leopard ( Mac OS X 10.5 ) , you 're using the Perl distro baked into the OS , and you 've updated the distro via CPAN ( Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ) , a widely - used collection of existing Perl modules .
Miyagawa 's post says the problem generates error messages that look something like this :
% perl -MIO IO object version 1.22 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.23 at / System / Library / Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/XSLoader.pm line 94 .
Compilation failed in require .
BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted
This would indicate that Apple 's security update reverts Mac Perl to an older IO object incompatible with newer CPAN modules .
" The Security Update brings ( old ) IO. bundle with version 1.22 but your IO.pm has been updated to the latest 1.23 on CPAN shell .
( But hey , 1.23 was released in 2006 ...
Why do you bring that ancient version back , Apple ! ? ) , " Miyagawa writes .
The blogger claims you can fix the problem if you reload the IO module .
But since Perl is broken , this takes a little finesse .
" The fix is to update IO. pm to 1.23 , but since IO . pm is now broken , you can't even run CPAN shell to do this ( Ugh ! ) .
You need to go to CPAN and grab IO - 1.2301.tar.gz , unpack it and run ' perl Makefile .
PL ; make ; sudo make install ' to fix this . "
And one support forum poster says the fix is only a partial solution .
" This is another reason why you should n't use Perl that comes from vendors , " Miyagawa says .
" Apple is n't any different from Fedora on this ! " ®

BBC News , Beijing
China hopes this monk will act as its public face on Tibetan issues China has pushed a young bespectacled monk into the spotlight in an effort to show that it governs Tibet with a benign hand .
Officials have launched a vigorous propaganda battle over recent weeks , to demonstrate that Tibetans are thriving under Beijing 's direction .
And the man China selected as its Panchen Lama , the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism , has been at the forefront of that campaign .
Although he is only 19 , the Panchen Lama has already stepped onto the public stage to praise the Chinese Communist Party .
Tibet expert Professor Robert Barnett , of New York 's Columbia University , says this is part of China 's efforts to undermine the appeal of the Dalai Lama , the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism .
" He will never really replace the Dalai Lama , but his role confuses the picture and can gradually be used to weaken the Dalai Lama 's standing , " he said .
" I think [ China 's ] Panchen Lama is being built up very gradually as a public spokesman within the Tibetan Buddhist world . "
Lavish praise
The Dalai Lama 's choice of Panchen Lama - a young boy called Gedhun Choekyi Nyima - was rejected by China , and disappeared soon afterwards .
China 's choice , Gyaincain Norbu , has been largely kept from public view since his appointment at the age of five .
But now officials are keen for the world to hear about a young man they depict as a diligent student who loves horse riding and jogging .
Panchen Lamas usual live in Shigatse 's Tashilunpo Monastery in Tibet Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Tuesday that China hoped he would help maintain the country 's " territorial integrity " .
The Panchen Lama has made three high - profile forays into the spotlight over the last few weeks to coincide with Serfs ' Emancipation Day last Saturday .
This is a new holiday introduced by China to mark the day on which the Dalai Lama 's rule in Tibet was officially dissolved - a day China celebrates as the start of the liberation of ordinary Tibetans .
The Panchen Lama first visited an exhibition in Beijing showing the economic and social progress China says has taken place in Tibet over the last 50 years .
Today 's China enjoys social harmony , stability and religious freedom
China 's Panchen Lama
He also penned an article that appeared in the state - controlled People 's Daily , one of China 's most important news outlets .
In the article he lavished praise on the Communist Party , which he said had brought prosperity to Tibet .
" [ We should ] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and contribute more to national unity and the happiness of Tibetan people , " he wrote .
And just a few days ago the monk gave a speech at the Second World Buddhist Forum in China 's Jiangsu Province .
Although the forum was about religion , the Panchen Lama 's speech - delivered in English - had an overtly political message .
" This forum is convened in my country - China , " he said , suggesting that he does not support Tibetan independence .
" This event fully demonstrates that today 's China enjoys social harmony , stability and religious freedom , " he went on .
It was a rebuke to Tibetan exiles , including the Dalai Lama , who insist that China 's rule in Tibet over the last 50 years has been repressive .
Great hopes China has made great play of its Panchen Lama 's public appearances .
State - controlled Xinhua news agency published a report on the forum speech under the headline : " Panchen Lama says China enjoys religious freedom . "
There was also a hint in the report of just how much China hopes this monk will be able to act as its public face on Tibetan issues .
The Chinese - approved Panchen Lama was selected when he was five " We disciples of Tibetan Buddhism pin great hopes on him , " Xinhua quoted Jalsan , president of the Buddhist Association of Inner Mongolia , as saying .
Previously , little was known about China 's Panchen Lama and how he lived his life , which has been spent largely in Beijing .
But on Tuesday Xinhua published an in - depth interview with him , revealing a host of personal details .
The man Xinhua described as " elegant " said he spent most of his time studying Buddhism .
But there is time for relaxation .
" About 5 % of my time [ is ] spent on entertainment , such as reading newspapers , books and sports , " he told Xinhua .
" I read all kinds of books , but I like historical books most .
I also read some fiction and essays in Tibetan and Chinese . "
But there was no mention in the article of the other Panchen Lama , chosen by the Dalai Lama in 1995 .
Two years ago , an official from the Tibetan Autonomous Region told the BBC that this Panchen Lama was living a quiet life in Lhasa , although many Tibetans say he is a political prisoner .

Environment analyst , BBC News
Many shellfish struggle to survive as seawater becomes more acidic Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are acidifying the oceans and threaten a mass extinction of sea life , a top ocean scientist warns .
Dr Carol Turley from Plymouth Marine Laboratory says it is impossible to know how marine life will cope , but she fears many species will not survive .
Since the Industrial Revolution , CO2 emissions have already turned the sea about 30 % more acidic , say researchers .
It is more acidic now than it has been for at least 500,000 years , they add .
The problem is set to worsen as emissions of the greenhouse gas increase through the 21st Century .
" I am very worried for ocean ecosystems which are currently productive and diverse , " Carol Turely told BBC News .
" I believe we may be heading for a mass extinction , as the rate of change in the oceans has n't been seen since the dinosaurs .
" It may have a major impact on food security .
It really is imperative that we cut emissions of CO2 . "
Dr Turley is chairing a session on ocean acidification at the Copenhagen Climate Change Congress .
Testing times
The problem is most acute for creatures which make calcified shells .
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
Up to 50 % of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels over the past 200 years has been absorbed by world 's oceans
This has lowered the pH value of seawater - the measure of acidity and alkalinity - by 0.1
The vast majority of liquids lie between pH 0 ( very acidic ) and pH 14 ( very alkaline ) ; 7 is neutral Seawater is mildly alkaline with a " natural " pH of about 8.2
The IPCC forecasts that ocean pH will fall by " between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st Century , adding to the present decrease of 0.1 units since pre-industrial times "
Natural lab shows sea's acid path Laboratory tests suggest starfish may be wiped out before the end of the century if current emissions trends continue .
Scientists fear mussels may not be able to cope , either .
Oysters may be less vulnerable , and farmed oysters may fare better than wild oysters .
" One thing is certain , " says Dr Turley .
" Things will change .
We just do n't know yet exactly how they will change .
" It is not a very wise experiment to be making . "
Professor Andy Watson , an ocean biologist from the University of East Anglia , believes climate change and overfishing may ruin the seas before acidification does .
He condemns increases in CO2 from human activities , but points out that ocean acidity also fluctuates naturally .
He also wonders if some creatures might adapt to the changes over time .
" ( In ) many of the experiments that are being done at the moment , sudden changes are made ; the CO2 is quickly raised , for example , or the acidity is quickly raised .
" Of course , that 's not really what will happen in the real world , " he told BBC News .
" There will be instead a gradual ramping up of CO2 and acidity .
And we do n't know whether organisms will be able to adapt or how quickly they 'll be able to adapt . "

Advertisement Professor Tony Knapp runs the BIOS institute in Bermuda , where some of the key measurements of acidity are taken .
He defends his conclusion that the recent increase in acidity has been caused by CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels .
" It took me a long time to determine that I was convinced ...
I 'm a cynic at heart .
" But if you look at the data , and you 're intimate with the data , there 's really no other conclusion you could make " .
Stormy waters
On the island of Ischia , in the Bay of Naples , Italy , scientists believe they have evidence that many creatures will fail to adapt to increased acidification .
THE pH SCALE
Higher numbers indicate alkalis , lower values signify acidic liquids : 13 - bleach 10 - soap 8.2 - pre-1750 oceans ( average ) 8.1 - current oceans ( average ) 7.8 - oceans in 2100 ( projected average ) 7 - pure water 3 - vinegar 0 - battery acid ( Source : NMEA )
The seawater around a part of the island has been more acidic for thousands of years thanks to volcanic CO2 vents that turn the seabed into a sort of jacuzzi .
If research here presents an accurate picture of future oceans , the prospects for shell - forming organisms are bleak .
Some of the creatures that appear to survive increased levels of acidity in short - term laboratory studies are not present here in the real world at the same levels of pH .
" We are very worried , " says Dr Jason Hall - Spencer from Plymouth University , who researches the site with help from the Naples - based Benthic Ecology Laboratory at Stazione Zoologica .
" The changes here have clearly made life impossible for shell - forming creatures .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Seagrass flourishes in CO2 - rich waters Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " When you start messing around with a complex ecosystem it is impossible to tell what will happen . "
The Ischia site does not present a perfect experiment for future oceans because levels of acidity shift regularly as the currents change , whereas future oceanic pH levels will be more stable .
But the site does show clear winners and losers : the lush seagrass , hyper - fertilised by CO2 , may be the tallest in the world .
The extra acidity will suit some creatures , but Dr Hall - Spencer argues that the diversity of the site is reduced and therefore it is likely that productivity of valuable species will diminish in future acidified oceans .
Ocean acidification is increasingly known as " the other CO2 problem " .
It is a new branch of science and researchers were initially uncertain how seriously to take the threat .
" In 2004 , I did a Google search for ocean acidification and got 17 hits , " says Dr Turley .
" Now you get hundreds of thousands .
There is much more evidence to show this will be a problem for the future - indeed it may even be a problem for now . "
For many people it will strike a sobering note that humans appear to be changing the chemistry of the mighty oceans .

Biz Stone on the Colbert Report
And we have reached a new level of meta-ness .
Co-founder Biz Stone calls
Twitter the messaging service we did n’t know we needed until we had it .
There are some really great moments in here , as is to be expected .
One thing though , Colbert must be friends , secretly , with Matt Buchanan , because he ’s pretty good at ignoring all real tangible communications , choosing instead to liveblog the procedings with an iPhone .
Colbert twittering on the Colbert Report
Via Gizmodo
U.S. Sen .
Amy Klobuchar said Monday that the owner of a peanut - processing company should be prosecuted for the salmonella poisoning of more than 600 people and federal laws should be changed in the hope of preventing future outbreaks of food - borne disease .
" Based on my review of the evidence , there should be a criminal prosecution here , " said Klobuchar , D - Minn. , after hosting a two - hour panel discussion on food safety at the University of Minnesota 's St. Paul campus .
Peanut Corp. of America , which has filed for liquidation in bankruptcy court , is the subject of a federal criminal investigation over the shipping of adulterated peanut products from its now - closed Blakely , Ga. , processing plant .
Last week , the company 's president , Stewart Parnell , refused to testify in Congress , citing his Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination .
Klobuchar , flanked by the sons of two Minnesotans who died after eating tainted peanut butter , pledged to push for major change in the nation 's food safety net , including improving the disease - tracking efforts by states and giving government agencies power to order mandatory recalls .
On the panel were Jeff Almer and Lou Tousignant , who each had a parent die after being infected with salmonella from peanut butter served in Brainerd , Minn. , nursing homes .
Five experts from the university , government agencies and a food company also offered advice on what 's wrong with the nation 's food safety efforts .
More than 2,200 products have been recalled because they contained peanut butter or other products shipped from Peanut Corp. plants .
The list , posted at www.fda.gov, includes snack bars , nut mixes , cookies , candies and other foods .
Popular peanut butter products sold in jars , such as Jif and Peter Pan , are not affected by the recall .
先週末 、Wired の Gadget Lab のブログ に " Why the Japanese hate iPhone " なんて記事があがりました。キャッチーなタイトルにセンセーショナルな内容の文章に、digg が over 2000 で、さらに slashdot などいろんなところに引用なれるなど飛び火しましてかなりの話題になっていたようですが、実は全然気がついていませんでした。
気がついたのは Apple 関連のジャーナリストとして有名な林信行さん ( 以下 、Nobi さん ) が
、Wired の記事に間違った引用されたとかで、かなりお疲れの様子をチャットで見かけたこと。彼が書いた英文記事は
My view of how iPhone is doing in Japan by Nobi ( Nobuyuki Hayashi ) 。大変だったんだねえ、と元記事もどんなものかと読んでみるとそこに、なんと
Daiji Hirata の名前が ...わたしですか。
Cellphones are also more of a fashion accessory in Japan than in the United States , according to Daiji Hirata , chief financial officer of News2u Corporation and creator of Japan 's first wireless LAN .
And carrying around an iPhone in Japan could make you look pretty lame .
http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/02/why-the-iphone.html
直訳する と 「日本じゃ携帯電話は米国なんかよりファッションアクセサリの意味が強いんだ。だからiPhone
なんか持ってたら間抜けに見えるよ」くらいでしょうかね。
おいおい、そんなこと言っていないよ。ご丁寧に肩書のほうが長いくらいです。巻き込まれたのは
Nobi さんだけじゃなかったのね 。Nobi さんは疲れて寝ちゃったよ ( この時点 で 4AM です)。しかたがないので、あわてて情報収集。どうも、去年の
WIRED の記事に引用されていた言葉から、意図も意味も変えて引用しているようです。こりゃまずいと、去年、記事を書いた
Lisa Katayama さんに連絡しつつ、あわてて反論を書きました。それがこれ。
About " Why the Japanese Hate the iPhone . "
聞かれたら iPhone はみんなカッコイイと思っているじゃないかな、わたし
iPhone も持ってるし、って答えますよ、そりゃね。ちなみに、元記事では、「日本では、携帯電話は、単に携帯できる電話の域をこえて、肌身離さず持ち歩く。会話するだけでなく携帯電話の話題も多いし、そんなことだから古い機種を持ち歩いていると流行にのっているとは思われないだろうね」って感じで掲載されています。
で、コメント欄に 「そんなことは言っていません」と書きこんでリンクを貼りました。Lisa さんとも連絡がとれて、先方に連絡をしてもらったおかげでしょうか、しばらくしたら、Wired の記事が修正されて、わたしがいったのは前半部分だけになり、「iPhone
なんて持っていたら間抜けに見えるよ」ってところは独立した段落になりました。まあ、意図は曲解されているが誤解されるものではないところになりました。しかし、さらにしばらくするとコメント欄がいきなり閉じられて、新しいコメントが付けられなくなりました。とにかくいろいろビックリです。
あとから Nobi さんからコメントをもらってわかったのですが 「 だから iPhone なんて持ってたら間抜けに見えるよ 」のところは、元々は
Nobi さんの言葉として書かれていたそうです。なんてわかりやすい捏造。なんてこった。その頃には増えつづける引用記事に
Nobi さん同様に心をいためつつ、英語ならともかく、検索すると、中国語、そして ポーランド語のサイトまで広がっており、翻訳ソフトを使って読んでいました。しかし翻訳ソフトいれても、全然わからないのでストレスはたまるばかりでした。はい。
でも、その後は Nobi さんの書いたとおりで、ネット上に反論を取り上げてくれた記事がでてきました。Torley Blog や iPhoneAsia にカバーされ 、Apple Insider にまで記事が載り 、Boing Boing Gadgets にも波及しました。良貨が悪貨を駆逐してくれる方向に向かいはじめて、ちょっと落ち着きをとりもどし、やっとこんな記事を書きはじめた次第です。slashdot も
AppleInsider の記事からの引用で再掲していますね。ほかにもたくさんの記事が生れています。
今回の騒動、いろいろ考えさせられました。Nobi さんは大人なので、記事を憎んで人を憎まず、の方針でしょうか。記者により詳細な情報を提供することで自主的に訂正させようと努力されていたようですが、まさか彼も、自分がいっていないと訂正させたその言葉を、すぐその後に、わたしが言ったことにして捏造するまでは思っていなかったでしょう。わたしは
Nobi さんのそのような配慮に気がつかず、あっさりと「そんなことはいってないし、そもそも記者に会ったこともない」と明言してしまいました。大人気なかったですかね。
しかし、今回 の WIRED /記者の姿勢には、残念なところがあります。本来はどのように記事を訂正したのかを明らかにして、謝罪のひとつも行えばすぐにおさまったであろうに、不透明な変更を繰り返し、またコメントへの直接の反論もせずにコメント欄を閉じたことで、不信感を増幅し、最終的にジャーナリズム的な視点でも批判される状況にまで陥りました。背景には、松村太郎さんの記事のコメント欄でboxerconanさんが書いていたりや
Nobi さんが書いたように、数字を追って(もしくは、数字に追われての)
Yellow Journalism の誘惑にかられたというのがあるでしょうし、日本人のわたしたちなら、ここまで追い掛けて反論をしないと甘く考えたのかもしれません。
ブログを始めとして、ネットは透明性の高いメディアです。情報があまりに早く広まるため、情報の伝搬速度のほうが注目され、情報を早く出すことがなにより重要だと思われるかもしれませんが、それ以上に情報が広まったあとも残りつづけることのほうがより重要になってきますし、すでにそうなりつつあります。そして、ウソだろうが間違いだろうが、その情報がずっとネット上に残りつづけることになります。以前ならそれも誰の目にもとまらなかったでしょうが、いまでもさいな情報でも検索すれば見付かるでしょうし、今後、検索技術が発達すれば、探そうとしなくても目にすることができるようになるかもしれません。間違えた情報だけではく、間違いをどのように訂正したのかも残ることになります。透明性の強い社会においては、正しい、間違いを問わず、なにをやってきたのか、それらの積み重ねがレピュテーションになるのだとおもいます。レピュテーションは信用の元であり、築くのには時間もコストをかかりますが、失うときは一瞬です。自分の書いたことがポジティブに受けとめられるのか、ネガティブに受けとめられるのかわからないときは、匿名というか無記名にしたくなる気持ちもわからなくはないですが、レピュテーションを構築するためには、すこしずつでもつみあげていくしかないでしょう。今回も
Wired の記事への反論を書いているとき 「 英語通じないと困るなあ」とか「これで逆に嫌なヤツと思われたらどうしようか」と思いながら、一時間かけて文章を書きました。記事を書いた記者に直接連絡をとって修正してもらうだけでもいいかともちょっとは思いましたが、最終的には公開することにしました。これらの行動を含めてどのように評価されるか身をもって体験することも重要だと思ったからです。
さらに、これを企業に置き換えると、レピュテーションって、ブランドに相当するんじゃないかなと思います。今回、Wired や記者に対しては、怒りよりなによりガッカリです。
今回 、Nobi さんの反論が内容も充実していたおかげで、わたしたちの意見はきちんと広がり、元記事と同様に話題になりネットに拡散して事なきを得たとおもいます。インターネットでは先行者利益が大きくクローズアップされがちですが、後発でも世界を席巻した例はいくつもあるように、良貨で悪貨を駆逐することは不可能ではありません。今回はそう思って、今後もブログを書き綴ることにしたいと思います。
Spring training 's Grapefruit League got its timbers shivered yesterday when the much - older wife of one of the Pirates ' top minor league prospects was arrested in a bizarre baby - snatching case .
Police say Amalia Tabata Pereira , 43 , who lives with outfielder husband Jose Tabata in Bradenton where the Pirates play spring ball , traveled to a Plant City medical clinic where she found Rosa Sirilo - Francisco with her two - month old baby Sandra .
Sirilo - Francisco told police Pereira identified herself as an immigrations official then claimed that Sirilo - Francisco and the baby 's father were in danger of being deported to Mexico -- but could receive assistance if they handed over the baby .
Under the impression Sandra would be returned later , Sirilo - Francisco handed the child over .
But after telling the story to an alarmed relative , she was informed that the process was not governmental policy and called police .
Baby Sandra was found with Pereira on Tuesday in downtown Bradenton after a call which may have been placed by Pereira was made to police .
She was reunited with her parents , but questions abound as Periera sits in a Hillsborough County jail charged with false imprisonment , interference with child custody , and impersonating a social service worker .
Tabata , who at 20 years old is closer to the baby in age than his wife , was confirmed by police to be in no way involved in Pereira 's kidnapping adventures .
He released a statement through the Pirates stating that he is " shocked ... hurt , frustrated , and confused by her actions " and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement officials in any way possible .
In the meantime , the Pirates are publicly and privately supporting him ( and no doubt hoping to cash in on the promise he displayed when he led the entire Yankees farm system batting .314 as a 17 - year - old ) .
There is no evidence to suggest that the baby - faced Tabata was himself snatched away by his wife , but we 're guessing he 's about to be reunited with his parents , too .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A congressional investigation has exposed gaping holes in security eight years after the September 11 terrorist attacks , a government report says .
An investigator used fake documents to obtain a U.S. passport , a congressional report says .
An investigator used a false identification to obtain a U.S. passport and then used the passport to get an airline boarding pass and go through an airport security checkpoint , according to the Government Accountability Office .
The GAO , the investigative arm of Congress , said its undercover investigator conducted four tests of the passport issuance system and " easily " obtained passports every time .
Individuals with " even minimal counterfeiting capabilities " can obtain genuine U.S. passports , which can be used to travel overseas , open bank accounts and prove U.S. citizenship , the GAO report says .
In the " most egregious " case , it says , the investigator used the Social Security number of a man who died in 1965 to obtain a Social Security card .
In another case , he used the Social Security number of a 5 - year - old child and obtained a passport , even though his counterfeit documents and application indicated he was 53 years old .
" A U.S. passport is a key to virtually anywhere in the world , " said Sen. John Kyl , R - Arizona .
" It is very troubling that in the years since the September 11 attacks someone could use fraudulent documents to obtain a U.S. passport . "
Kyl and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - California , both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's subcommittee on terrorism , requested the test .
To perform the test , the GAO designed four scenarios .
In each , an investigator simulated the actions of a malicious person involved in identity theft , then created fake documents using " off - the - shelf , commercially available hardware , software , and materials . "
The investigator used the counterfeit documents to obtain a genuine Washington , D.C. , identification card .
For three of the tests , the undercover investigator submitted passport applications and supporting materials at U.S. Postal Service locations that accept passport applications .
For the remaining test , it submitted the application and materials to the State Department 's regional passport office in Washington .
" State and USPS employees did not identify our documents as counterfeit in any of our four tests , " the GAO report says .
The State Department " issued a genuine U.S. passport in each case . "
" All four passports were issued to the same GAO investigator , under four different names , " it says .
The tests occurred between July and December of last year .
A State Department spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
But the GAO said in the report that State Department officials " agreed that our findings expose a major vulnerability " in the passport issuance process .
State Department officials said the department 's ability to verify the information submitted " is hampered by limitations to its information - sharing and data access with other agencies at the federal and state levels . "
Some agencies wo n't share information because of privacy concerns , or because the State Department is not a law enforcement agency .
Also , the department , like other government agencies , has difficulty verifying birth certificates because there are thousands of acceptable formats for them .

FEWER FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS , LESS CAVIAR
“ Use balloons instead of flowers , ” said Cuppy Kraft , a real estate agent who spends half the year in Delray Beach , Fla. , and the other in Pittsburgh and is active in many charities .
“ Even when speaking to the caterers , one might say , I do n’t know that we need truffles . ”
Mr. Duchin advises still working with the best caterer and the best florist , but negotiating with them to reduce costs .
One huge flower display in a prominent spot might be better than 20 or 30 scattered through the hall , on every table .
NO MORE BUSTLING WAITERS
“ There ’s not as many seated dinners now , ” said Ms. Riven , of St. Louis ’s art museum .
“ There are more and more food stations , which are neat .
You kind of graze around , sampling different foods . ”
Some dinners are served from a buffet table , with only dessert and coffee served at the table by waiters .
FIND NEW VENUES
You do n’t have to pay for a ballroom at the Ritz .
Think a trustee ’s grand apartment in the city or a neighbor ’s apple barn in the country .
Or at the very least , shop around ( far more than in the past ) for the cheapest deal on the space you want : some places will cut prices in half if you select a Thursday night , rather than a Friday or Saturday .
SOLICIT FOOD AND WINE DONATIONS
At the Center of Creative Arts , the cocktail hour for a coming benefit has been totally donated  for the first time .
Increasingly , nonprofits are reaching out to businesses to sponsor or contribute their products , or perhaps one of the supporters owns a vineyard .
So , instead of Château Margaux on every table , the charity may end up serving bottles from the local winery  in fact , offering “ local ” menus has become even more popular in these environmentally conscious times .
( It ’s easier to persuade local farmers and restaurants to donate than it is more far - flung sources . )
COMMUNICATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
In the first broadside about the benefit , explain to donors that the board recognizes that times are hard for everyone , and tell them the steps being taken that will make the benefit less lavish  and therefore increase the percentage that goes directly to the charity .
In hard times , it probably is n’t enough just to send out the usual invitations and expect the normal response .
Some boards give each board member 20 or 30 invitations and ask them to personalize each one to a friend or colleague , offering to make a table of acquaintances .
GIVE THEM MORE FOR THEIR MONEY
In St. Louis , Ms. Riven said that for the $ 450 patron ticket contributors would be invited to a reception to greet the television star Jon Hamm , of “ Mad Men ” and “ 30 Rock , ” who grew up in St. Louis .
In addition they will be given free cosmetics and the opportunity to be made up by local artists .
“ All the guests will get more goodies in their goody bag , ” Ms. Riven added .
In the Hudson Valley of New York , attendees at some sites are now being given free annual memberships .
Without paying attention to the appearances  as well as the realities  of tighter times , the professional party - givers agree : these fund - raisers may get toned down all by themselves .
No one will show up .
South Dakota has become the latest state to ban salvia divinorum , the hallucinogenic plant used for centuries by Mexican shamans whose recreational use has become noticeable in the US in recent years .
Oddly enough , as the bill was amended in back and forth between the state House and Senate , legislators forgot to specifically make it a crime to distribute the herb .
Google ads for salvia on web page reporting salvia arrest
The bill does not go into effect until it is signed by Gov. Michael Rounds ( R ) , who has indicated he will sign it .
Once he does , the salvia ban goes into effect immediately because the bill declared an " emergency " regarding use of the fast - acting , short - duration psychedelic .
The bill creates two salvia possession offenses -- a misdemeanor for possession of less than two ounces of the plant or its active substance , Salvinorin A , and a felony for possession of more than two ounces .
A misdemeanor charge can earn you up to a year in jail , while the Class 6 felony would be worth up to two years in the state penitentiary .
Rep. Lance Russell ( R - Hot Springs ) urged the House to reject the Senate version of the bill because it did not specifically outlaw distribution of salvia .
But other lawmakers , eager to move ahead , said banning possession was a good enough start .
As the Chronicle noted last week , South Dakota is only the latest state to fall prey to salvia mania .
Nebraska banned it a week ago , and similar measures are before legislatures in Alabama , Iowa , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Texas .
Thirteen states -- Delaware , Florida , Illinois , Kansas , Mississippi , Missouri , Nebraska , North Dakota , Oklahoma , and Virginia -- have classified salvia as Schedule I under state drug laws .
Make that 14 now that South Dakota has joined the list .
Three more -- Louisiana , Maine , and Tennessee -- restrict the sale of the plant .
Maine and California ban it only for minors .

Two U.S. Navy vessels , a nuclear - powered fast attack submarine and an amphibious transport dock , collided this morning in the Strait of Hormuz , which runs between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula .
According to a news release from the U.S. Fifth Fleet in Manama , Bahrain , the submarine USS Hartford collided with the amphibious ship USS New Orleans at around 1:00 a.m. local time .
Fifteen sailors aboard the Hartford were described as being " slightly injured " ; all returned to duty .
No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans , but that ship suffered a ruptured fuel tank , spilling 25,000 gallons of diesel fuel .
This is not the first incident involving the Hartford .
The boat ran aground in 2003 while performing maneuvers off Sardinia ; the vessel was put out of commission for several months and two Navy officers were relieved of command .

to take a random potshot at a hard - charging artiste who has toughed his way through challenge after challenge , including puberty , and quite another to cast aspersions on the depth and range of his talent .
" The funny answer , " says Eric Deggans , media critic for the St. Petersburg Times , " is , We 've been asking that question for years , too .
The serious answer is ,
There are surprisingly few actors who have a charisma that viewers want to see .
David Caruso has that .
It was a humbling experience for him to go into movies and find it did not translate .
But on television , people like to watch him . "
Andy Dehnart , editor of TV - news site realityblurred.com , offers his own perspective on Caruso 's putative charisma , telling AF , " I think it 's because he 's so terrifically bad that he 's really awesome to watch .
He is so absurdly bad that you can't possibly believe he's on television — that he's on a top - rated show .
It 's just all the more train - wrecky . "
However , Glenn Garvin , TV critic for the Miami Herald , begs to differ : " I 'm in a minority on this .
And I acknowledge that it flies in the face of all recent evidence .
But I think David Caruso is a talented actor . "
For what it 's worth , Mr. Garvin is also the founder and sole member of the Carrot Top Fan Club .

The state has many weapons in its arsenal to keep Boobus ignorant of their illegal , unconstitutional activities and in compliance with its confiscatory tax and slavery system .
In all likelihood , the two most often used of these weapons are fear and prevarication .
Our new US Attorney General / Race Agitator , Eric Holder , last week used a bright shining lie in his advocating the introduction of a new Assault Weapons Ban .
( AWB )
He stated :
" Putting the ban back in place would not only be a positive move by the United States , it would help cut down on the flow of guns going across the border into Mexico , which is struggling with heavy violence among drug cartels along the border .
I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico , at a minimum . ”
What a crock ; believing the fantastically wealthy drug cartels actually secure their weapons from America is analogous to taking a hamburger to a steak dinner .
The drug cartels use their millions , if not billions , to purchase some of the finest weaponry that can be had , far exceeding the firepower of their state - armed opponents in both Mexico and the US .
One of my sources in federal law enforcement in the El Paso area stated it was common for his forces to be totally outgunned by members of the cartels .
To believe these weapons came from weapons that are currently legal in this country is preposterous and an obvious lie .
Mr. Holder has no fear of armed drug cartel members ; his fear is a well - armed citizenry awakening to the tyranny now running rampant in our government !
The vehicle most likely to be used by these tyrants to inflict us with more of their unconstitutional crap would be a remake of HR 1022 , legislation that was introduced back in 2007 and has already been through several required committees .
This onerous piece of legislation would prohibit from private ownership such vile weapons as the Ruger 10 / 22 and Hi-Point carbine .
I can assure you any drug runner worth his salt would be embarrassed and laughed out of the hood were he to appear with either of these weapons !
Of course also outlawed with this proposed legislation would be any high capacity ( hi - cap ) magazines for both rifle and pistol .
I have yet to have any of these bureaucrats explain to me how the 11th round fired is much more dangerous than the first 10 .
I am also sure none of these idiots have witnessed Doug Koenig , Rob Leatham , or Todd Jarrett do rapid - fire pistol shooting with multiple magazine reloads .
A February 20 , 2009 State Department memo stated , “ … with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades . ”
Everyone with the exception of new presidents and attorney generals are aware neither automatic weapons nor grenades are legal in this country .
But , this is what we must endure when we elect " anointed " people to high office .
Obviously lost on our new administration is the fact drug cartels with millions of dollars at their disposal have no trouble buying mayors , police officers , judges and even presidents ;
I ’m sure obtaining weapons including grenades , fully automatic weapons , and rocket launchers present no problems .
To believe the illegal confiscation and outlawing of legally obtained weapons from those who believe in their God - given right to protect what is theirs , is ignorance in the extreme , or the simple desire to protect tyrannical government officials as they move to deprive citizens of their freedom .
Any other reason stated by these criminals is a damnable lie .
Jefferson said , “ No freeman shall be debarred the use of arms within his own lands "
How did this country evolve from the wisdom of Jefferson to the ignorance , prevarication and tyrannical tendencies of Obama and Holder ?
We have only ourselves to blame .
We were warned !

In a " Special Comment " regarding the release by the Obama Administration of " the remainder of this nightmare of Bush Administration torture memos , " MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann offered the current Commander in Chief some praise for going " half - way , " then blasted him for issuing a statement which said that " nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
" This President has gone where few before him , dared , " Olbermann said Thursday night .
" The dirty laundry  illegal , un -American , self - defeating , self - destroying  is out for all to see . "
Olbermann continued ,
" Mr. Obama deserves our praise and our thanks for that .
And yet he has gone but half - way .
And , in this case , in far too many respects , half the distance is worse than standing still .
Today , Mr. President , in acknowledging these science - fiction - like documents , you said that :
" This is a time for reflection , not retribution .
I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke . "
" We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history .
" But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past .
Mr. President , you are wrong .
What you describe would be not " spent energy " but catharsis .
Not " blame laid , " but responsibility ascribed . "

OP -ED CONTRIBUTOR
Tales From Torture ’s Dark World
By MARK DANNER
ON a bright sunny day two years ago , President George W. Bush strode into the East Room of the White House and informed the world that the United States had created a dark and secret universe to hold and interrogate captured terrorists .
“ In addition to the terrorists held at Guantanamo , ” the president said , “ a small number of suspected terrorist leaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside the United States , in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency . ”
At these places , Mr. Bush said , “ the C.I.A. used an alternative set of procedures . ” 
He added : “ These procedures were designed to be safe , to comply with our laws , our Constitution and our treaty obligations .
The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be lawful . ” 
This speech will stand , I believe , as George W. Bush ’s most important : perhaps the only historic speech he ever gave .
In his fervent defense of his government ’s “ alternative set of procedures ”  and his equally fervent insistence that they were “ lawful , ”  he set out before the country America ’s dark moral epic of torture , in the coils of whose contradictions we find ourselves entangled still .
At the same time , perhaps unwittingly , Mr. Bush made it possible that day for those on whom the alternative set of procedures were performed eventually to speak .
For he announced that he would send 14 “ high - value detainees ”  from dark into twilight : they would be transferred from the overseas “ black sites ”  to GuantÃ¡namo .
There , while awaiting trial , the International Committee of the Red Cross would be “ advised of their detention , and will have the opportunity to meet with them . ” 
A few weeks later , from Oct. 6 to 11 and then from Dec. 4 to 14 , 2006 , Red Cross officials — whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the Geneva Conventions and to supervise treatment of prisoners of war — traveled to Guantanamo and began interviewing the prisoners .
Their stated goal was to produce a report that would “ provide a description of the treatment and material conditions of detention of the 14 during the period they were held in the C.I.A. detention program , ”  periods ranging “ from 16 months to almost four and a half years . ” 
As the Red Cross interviewers informed the detainees , their report was not intended to be released to the public but , “ to the extent that each detainee agreed for it to be transmitted to the authorities , ”  to be given in strictest secrecy to officials of the government agency that had been in charge of holding them — in this case the Central Intelligence Agency , to whose acting general counsel , John Rizzo , the report was sent on Feb. 14 , 2007 .
The result is a document — labeled “ confidential ”  and clearly intended only for the eyes of those senior American officials — that tells a story of what happened to each of the 14 detainees inside the black sites .
A short time ago , this document came into my hands and I have set out the stories it tells in a longer article in The New York Review of Books .
Because these stories were taken down confidentially in patient interviews by professionals from the International Committee of the Red Cross , and not intended for public consumption , they have an unusual claim to authenticity .
Indeed , since the detainees were kept strictly apart and isolated , both at the black sites and at Guantanamo ,

The reliability of eyewitness accounts is one of the bedrock beliefs of our society .
In ancient cultures – and in some modern cultures that still follow ancient laws – some crimes could only be proven by eyewitness testimonies .
One of the most infamous examples was Pakistan ’s Hudood Ordinances , which mandated that allegations of rape could only be proven by four eyewitness accounts ; otherwise , the woman was to be punished for making false accusations .
Even in our supposedly more enlightened society , eyewitness testimonies still carry great weight in criminal trials – this despite ample evidence that they are often mistaken , resulting in many wrongful imprisonments .
The willingness of juries , and people in general , to believe eyewitness testimony stems from a faulty view of the nature of memory .
Human memory is not like a tape recorder or a video camera , creating a record of events and then playing them back exactly as they were first observed .
Rather , human memory is basically reconstructive : in most cases , we remember only the basic outlines of an event , and if we ’re called upon to retell what happened , the mind fills in the gaps with whatever details are at hand .
This means that details that are fed to a person may subconsciously be incorporated into their memories and presented by that person as an accurate account of history .
One of the classic examples of this is an experiment done by the memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus .
In it , Loftus interviewed the relatives of her research subjects to get three true stories of childhood events that had happened to each of them .
To those three stories , she added a fourth one , which she confirmed with relatives had not actually happened : a story about the subject being lost in a mall at the age of five , crying and being comforted by an elderly woman , and finally being reunited with their parents .
The subjects were each presented with these stories and asked to write down as much additional detail as they could remember about each of them .
About 25 % of Loftus ’ subjects “ remembered ” the fictitious account and described it as a true story that had happened to them in childhood ( source ) .
Similar studies along this line have found that , in follow - up interviews conducted later , more and more subjects remembered the false stories over time , with some even embellishing them with details of their own that were n’t part of the original presentation .
Another study by Loftus found that subjects ’ memories of events can be altered by questions that presuppose a particular set of facts .
In this experiment , 150 students saw a short film of an accident involving a white sports car and then answered questions about it .
One set of students was asked , “ How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn ? ” ( There was no barn in the film . )
The other set was simply asked , “ How fast was the white sports car going ? ”
One week later , both sets of students were brought in for a follow - up interview , and both were asked , “ Did you see a barn in the film ? ”
Students who had previously been asked about the non-existent barn were far more likely ( 17 % vs. 2 % ) to incorrectly believe that it had been present the first time .
Even memories of highly emotionally charged events – so - called “ flashbulb ” memories – are just as likely to suffer this distortion .
Just like any other memory , subjects tend to forget true details or add embellishments over time .
But what ’s worrying is that , despite this error creep , people tend to put more confidence in their flashbulb memories and are more likely to believe they ’re accurate , even when the record shows otherwise .
And finally , the most sensational example of how memory can fail us :
In 1975 , the Australian psychologist Donald Thomson was arrested and charged with rape , and was informed by police that the victim had positively identified him as her attacker .
This was a great surprise to Thomson , because he had a seemingly invulnerable alibi : he was on live TV at the time , being interviewed in the presence of a studio audience , cameramen , and an assistant police commissioner .
As it turned out , the woman who was raped had been watching that very program just before the attack .
She had mixed up Thomson ’s face on the TV screen with the face of her attacker .
Ironically , Thomson had been on TV to discuss the unreliability of eyewitness testimony .
( source ; see also )
The human tendency to confabulate details and misattribute sources means that memory , especially in the long term , cannot be counted on as a reliable source of information .
This does n’t mean that eyewitness accounts should be excluded from trials and other decision - making altogether , but they should be considered with greater attention to their fallibility .
When we question witnesses about the details of an event , we must avoid leading questions that could implant details into their minds .
When victims of crime are asked to pick their assailants out of a lineup , those lineups should be double - blind .
And testimonies should be given greater weight when two or more witnesses independently agree on the same details or when they are supported by other evidence .

Some inmates were subjected to controversial interrogation techniques
Spanish judges have agreed to consider charging six former US officials with providing legal justification for alleged torture at Guantanamo Bay .
Human rights lawyers brought the case against the six , who all served under former President George W Bush .
Among those named was former defence official Douglas Feith , who said the charges against him " made no sense " .
Spanish courts can prosecute offences such as torture or war crimes even if they occurred in other countries .
The former officials - who include ex-Attorney - General Alberto Gonzalez - could face arrest on leaving the US if the courts decide to issue warrants .
' Controversial position '
The lawyers who brought the case accuse the six of providing legal cover to allow the security services to use techniques of interrogation such as " waterboarding " .
They say the methods amounted to torture .
Mr Feith , a former under - secretary for defence , rebuffed the accusations .
" The charges as related to me make no sense , " he said .
" They criticise me for promoting a controversial position that I never advocated . "
The lawyers took their accusations to Judge Baltasar Garzon , who agreed to allow state prosecutors to decide if the case has merit .
Judge Garzon was responsible for bringing a prosecution against former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet , who was arrested in the UK in 1998 .
Spain 's courts have also launched investigations over alleged crimes in Argentina , Tibet , El Salvador and Rwanda .
Hey !
Who 's that dour - looking dude on the left ?
There 's a 20 - year - old photo making the rounds on the tubes showing U.S. President Ronald Reagan taking a stroll through Red Square during his May 1988 visit to Moscow .
In the photo , Reagan was approached by a group of " tourists " -- who were in reality KGB members and their families -- who asked him about human rights in the United States .
Reagan 's photographer , Pete Souza , told NPR in January that he has confirmed that the blonde - haired man in the striped shirt on the left was none other than Vladimir Putin , then a KGB colonel .
You can listen to Souza , who is now U.S. President Barack Obama 's official photographer , talk about the photo by clicking the audio link in the NPR story here .
And then decide for yourself whether it really is Putin .

Users Complain of Mysterious ' PIFTS ' Warning
Computer support forums are lighting up with queries from users wondering what to do about an alert on whether to trust a file called " PIFTS.exe " .
Meanwhile , someone at Symantec 's support forum seems to be deleting posts from users inquiring about this alert almost as soon as they go up on the forum .
Swa Frantzen , an incident handler with the SANS Internet Storm Center , writes today that PIFTS .
exe appears to be related to a Norton update since it has a has a component in it that leverages the user 's Internet connection to contact a Web page at norton.com , which is owned and operated by Symantec .
A Security Fix reader sent this e-mail today about his experience with this alert : " Symantec 's response has been odd .
It has removed all chat threads on the subject , and seems to be deleting questions about PIFTS .
exe wherever they may be posted .
In short , it is Symantec 's response which has caused greater questions than the problem that it seems to be trying to cover up .
I am no expert , and I simply went online to get an explanation .
However , it now looks as though thousands of queries at the Norton chat forum were posted today and all have been deleted without comment . "
Also , it appears that PIFTS .
exe is being submitted quite a bit to VirusTotal.com , a free service that people can use to scan suspicious files against more than three dozen different anti-virus products .
ThreatExpert also has a writeup that confirms that this file phones home to Symantec .
I 've put in queries to Symantec , and will update this post when I hear back .
In the meantime , it 's probably safest just to deny this program access to the Internet if prompted by Norton or any other firewall product you use .
Update , 12:46 p.m. ET :
The bad guys know that people are interested in this search term , and appear to have latched on to it already .
I 'd advise readers to be extremely careful about randomly clicking on every link returned in a Web search for " pifts.exe " :
Some of the top searches ( currently the 3rd and 4th result in a Google search ) are Web sites that try to install malicious software when you visit them .
Both results take you to sites that use Javascript attacks to try and foist rogue antivirus products ( ah , the irony ) .
Update , 2:23 p.m. ET : Dave Cole , senior director of product management at Symantec , said the PIFTS file was part of a " diagnostics patch " shipped to Norton customers on Monday evening .
The purpose of the update , Cole said , was to help determine how many customers would need to be migrated to newer versions of its software as more Windows users upgrade to Windows 7 .
" We have to make sure before we migrate users to a new product that we can see what kind of load we can expect on our servers , and which customers are going to have to be moved up to the latest version of our product , " Cole said .
As to why Symantec has been deleting posts about this from their user forum , Cole said the company noticed that minutes after the update went out hundreds of new users began registering on the forum , leaving inane and sometimes abusive comments .
" We want to be out there in the community , but by the same token , if we see abuse we will shut it down pretty quickly , " Cole said .
" There was no attempt at secrecy here , but people were spamming the forum and making it unusable to everyone . "
In Symantec 's defense , when I first heard about this earlier this morning , I noted privately to a couple of folks that some of the comments being left on the Symantec forum bore many of the hallmarks of " 4Chan , " ( a.k.a. " anonymous " ) , a virtual community that thrives on playing practical jokes and causing trouble online .
The summary about this incident posted to News - for - nerds site Slashdot this morning links to a key 4 Chan forum .
Update , 5:24 p.m. ET : Symantec 's official statement on this is here .

Obama has picked a Bilderberger to be his choice for health secretary — Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius .
Obama initially picked former Senate Democrat leader Tom Daschle for the position , but Daschle “ withdrew because of personal tax issues , ” in other words he did n’t bother to pay any taxes because minions of the elite are not required to do so , except for public relations reasons .
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius was groomed for the position of health secretary .
She attended the 2008 Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly , Virginia , and the 2007 meeting in Istanbul , Turkey .
Recall Sebelius , described as “ a moderate Democrat , ” was considered a leading candidate to be Obama ’s vice presidential running mate last summer , but the elite picked CFR member Joe Biden instead .
In June , 2008 , Sebelius attended the 2008 Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly , Virginia , a fact not reported by the corporate media in her home state .
She was included on the Official 2008 Bilderberg Participant List .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In 2007 , Sebelius attended the Bilderberg meeting in June in Istanbul , Turkey and the Kansas City Star reported the story on Sept 2 , 2007 .
“ It is a rather prestigious group , ” Sebelius spokeswoman Nicole Corcoran told the Star .
“ She was pleased to be invited . ”
Now she will be pleased to do the bidding of the Bilderbergers in the Obama administration , that is if she is confirmed and does not have any pesky tax issues or illegal alien housekeepers in her closet .
It is also fair to say that any health care agenda Obama puts forward will be vetted by the elite who attend secretive meetings initially organized by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands , a confirmed Nazi .
Increasingly , Obama ’s “ change ” represents not only more of the same , but a larger dose of the same as he has appointed a record number of Trilateralists , CFR members , and Bilderbergers to his administration .

Kumar is one of Bollywood 's most successful stars
A complaint accusing Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar of obscenity has been lodged with police in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
The actor , who recently appeared for Levi's at the Lakme India Fashion Week show , asked his wife to unbutton his jeans during his catwalk .
The actor is the brand ambassador of Levi's " Unbuttoned " range .
Kumar is one of Bollywood 's most popular and successful stars and has appeared in many blockbusters .
' Vulgar '
The case against Kumar was filed by Anil P Nayar , a social worker .
Mr Nayar says the unbuttoning of the jeans was " vulgar and indecent " .
" After the preliminary inquiry , we will register a case against Akshay Kumar , [ his wife ]
Twinkle Khanna , the abettor of the Lakme Fashion Week show and the top management of the Grand Hyatt [ the hotel where the show was held ] and we will take action against them , " news agency Reuters quoted SG Pandey , a lawyer of the complainant , as saying .
Police say they have received the complaint , but are yet to register a case .
" They gave an application , it is under inquiry and after inquiry , we will let you know , " the agency quoted senior police officer Nissar Kalambole as saying .
Dressed in a T - shirt and denim jeans , Kumar walked up to wife Twinkle , seated in the front - row , and asked her to undo the top button of his jeans .
Kumar has made a name for himself by playing lead roles in action and comedy films .
His film , Singh is Kinng , was one of the biggest hits of 2008 .

It ’s the southern ozone hole whatdunit .
That ’s why Antarctic sea ice is growing while at the other pole , Arctic ice is shrinking at record rates .
It seems CFCs and other ozone - depleting chemicals have given the South Pole respite from global warming .

But only temporarily .
According to John Turner of the British Antarctic Survey , the effect will last roughly another decade before Antarctic sea ice starts to decline as well .
Arctic sea ice is decreasing dramatically and reached a record low in 2007 .
But satellite images studied by Turner and his colleagues show that Antarctic sea ice is increasing in every month of the year expect January .
“ By the end of the century we expect one third of Antarctic sea ice to disappear , ” says Turner .
“ So we ’re trying to understand why it ’s increasing now , at a time of global warming . ”
In a new study , Turner and colleagues show how the ozone hole has changed weather patterns around Antarctica .
These changes have drawn in warm air over the Antarctic Peninsula in West Antarctica and cooled the air above East Antarctica .
The Southern Ocean is home to some of the strongest ocean winds on the planet .
The region between 40° and 60° South is well - known to sailors who call it the “ roaring forties ” and “ furious fifties ” .
Wind vortex
If the South Pole were smack in the middle of Antarctica , the winds would circle neatly around it in a clockwise direction .
But in fact the continent is set slightly off - centre relative to the South Pole .
As a result , the winds whip off Victoria Land and create a vortex over the Southern Ocean north of the Ross Sea ( see blue area in figure ) .
Turner compares this to the way wind going down a line of buildings will whip into a vortex when it comes to a corner .
The vortex generates a large area of storm activity .
It also draws in warm air from South America over the Antarctic Peninsula , making this the warmest region of the continent .
By running an atmospheric computer model with and without the ozone hole , Turner and his colleagues found that the depletion of the ozone has intensified the winds of the roaring forties and furious fifties .
The net result has been to draw more warm air in from Chile – which has warmed the Antarctic peninsula and caused the collapse of several ice shelves – and generate stronger cool - air storms around the Ross Sea .
Satellite data shows that sea ice has shrunk west of the Antarctic Peninsula and grown in the Ross Sea .
Because the increase in sea ice extent has been greater than the reduction around the Antarctic peninsula the net effect is that since the ozone hole appeared 30 years ago , Antarctic ice has grown .
The researchers say their models suggest this is most likely a result of the ozone hole although they cannot rule out the possibility that natural variations in sea ice extent have also played a role .
Ozone healing
“ Over the next 50 to 100 years , the ozone hole will heal , ” says Turner .
“ At the same time , greenhouse gases will rise .
In next decade or so we should see sea ice plateauing and then decreasing massively if greenhouse gases continue to increase . ”
Earlier this year , research led by Eric Steig of the University of Washington , Seattle showed that although the Antarctic continent as a whole has warmed by 0.5 °C in the last 50 years – on a par with the global average – the figure hides strong regional differences .
West Antarctica has warmed while temperatures over East Antarctica have dropped .
Accordingly , the disintegration of large ice shelves have all been in West Antarctica , the most famous example being the Larsen ice shelf .
More recently , scientists have been anxiously expecting the Wilkins ice shelf to collapse as well .

The great thing about complex data is that one can basically come up with any number of headlines describing it – all of which can be literally true – but that give very different impressions .
Thus we are sure that you will soon read that 2008 was warmer than any year in the 20th Century ( with the exception of 1998 ) , that is was the coolest year this century ( starting from 2001 ) , and that 7 or 8 of the 9 warmest years have occurred since 2000 .
There will undoubtedly also be a number of claims made that are n’t true ; 2008 is not the coolest year this decade ( that was 2000 ) , global warming has n’t ‘ stopped ’ , CO 2 continues to be a greenhouse gas , and such variability is indeed predicted by climate models .
Today ’s post is therefore dedicated to cutting through the hype and looking at the bigger picture .
As is usual , today marks the release of the ‘ meteorological year ’ averages for the surface temperature records ( GISTEMP , HadCRU , NCDC ) .
This time period runs from December last year through to the end of November this year and is so - called because of the fact that it is easier to dice into seasons than the calendar year .
That is , the met year consists of the average of the DJF ( winter ) , MAM ( spring ) , JJA ( summer ) and SON ( autumn ) periods ( using the standard shorthand for the month names ) .
This makes a little more sense than including the JF from one winter and the D from another as you do in the calendar year calculation .
But since the correlation between the D - N and J - D averages is very high ( r=0.997 ) , it makes little practical difference .
Annual numbers are a little more useful than monthly anomalies for determining long term trends , but are still quite noisy .
The bottom line :
In the GISTEMP , HadCRU and NCDC analyses D - N 2008 were at 0.43 , 0.42 and 0.47 ºC above the 1951 - 1980 baseline ( respectively ) .
In GISTEMP both October and November came in quite warm ( 0.58 ºC ) , the former edging up slightly on last month ’s estimate as more data came in .
This puts 2008 at # 9 ( or # 8 ) in the yearly rankings , but given the uncertainty in the estimates , the real ranking could be anywhere between # 6 or # 15 .
More robustly , the most recent 5 - year averages are all significantly higher than any in the last century .
The last decade is by far the warmest decade globally in the record .
These big picture conclusions are the same if you look at any of the data sets , though the actual numbers are slightly different ( relating principally to the data extrapolation – particularly in the Arctic ) .
So what to make of the latest year ’s data ?
First off , we expect that there will be oscillations in the global mean temperature .
No climate model has ever shown a year - on - year increase in temperatures because of the currently expected amount of global warming .
A big factor in those oscillations is ENSO – whether there is a a warm El Niño event , or a cool La Niña event makes an appreciable difference in the global mean anomalies – about 0.1 to 0.2 ºC for significant events .
There was a significant La Niña at the beginning of this year ( and that is fully included in the D - N annual mean ) , and that undoubtedly played a role in this year ’s relative coolness .
It ’s worth pointing out that 2000 also had a similarly sized La Niña but was notably cooler than this last year .
While ENSO is one factor in the annual variability , it is not the only one .
There are both other sources of internal variability and external forcings .
The other internal variations can be a little difficult to characterise ( it is n’t as simple as just a super - position of all the climate acronyms you ever heard of NAO + SAM + PDO + AMO +MJO etc. ) , but the external ( natural ) forcings are a little easier .
The two main ones are volcanic variability and solar forcing .
There have been no climatically significant volcanoes since 1991 , and so that is not a factor .
However , we are at a solar minimum .
The impacts of the solar cycle on the surface temperature record are somewhat disputed , but it might be as large as 0.1 ºC from solar min to solar max , with a lag of a year or two .
Thus for 2008 , one might expect a deviation below trend ( the difference between mean solar and solar min , and expecting the impact to not yet be fully felt ) of up to 0.05 ºC .
Not a very big signal , and not one that would shift the rankings significantly .
There were a number of rather overheated claims earlier this year that ‘ all the global warming had been erased ’ by the La Niña - related anomaly .
This was always ridiculous , and now that most of that anomaly has passed , we are n’t holding our breath waiting for the ‘ global warming is now back ’ headlines from the same sources .
Taking a longer perspective , the 30 year mean trends are n’t greatly affected by a single year ( GISTEMP : 1978-2007 0.17+/-0.04ºC/dec ; 1979-2008 0.16+/-0.04 – OLS trends , annual data , 95 % CI , no correction for auto - correlation ; identical for HadCRU ) ; they are still solidly upwards .
The match of the Hansen et al 1988 scenario B projections are similarly little affected ( GISTEMP 1984-2008 0.19+/-0.05 ( LO - index ) 0.22+/-0.07 ( Met- station index ) ; HansenB 1984-2008 0.25+/-0.05 º C / dec ) – the projections run slightly warmer as one would expect given the slightly greater ( ~10 % ) forcing in the projection then occurred in reality .
This year ’s data then do n’t really change our expectations much .
Finally , as we ’ve discussed before , what climate models did or did not predict is available for all to see .
Despite many cautions about using short - term changes to imply something about the long - term trend , these comparisons will still be made .
So just for fun , here is a comparison of the observations with the model projections from 1999 to 2008 using 1999 as a baseline .
The answer might be surprising for some :
You can get slightly different pictures if you pick the start year differently , and so this is n’t something profound .
Picking any single year as a starting point is somewhat subjective and causes the visual aspect to vary – looking at the trends is more robust .
However , this figure does show that in models , as in data , some years will be above trend , and some will be below trend .
Anyone who expresses shock at this is either naive or … well , you know .
As for the next few years , our expectations are not much changed .
This coming winter is predicted to be ENSO neutral , so on that basis one would expect a warmer year next year than this year ( though probably not quite record breaking ) .
Barring any large volcanic eruption , I do n’t see any reason for the decadal trends to depart much from the anticipated ~ 0.2 º C / decade .
Update : Just FYI , the same figure as above baselined to 1990 , and 1979 .
Recession Stocks and Investing Strategy for Coming Period of High Inflation
We have been in recession for more than a year and it is still not clear if the economic shocks are done coming .
The recession may last for another year or more depending on if and when the government actions start stimulating the economy .
Traditional Buy and Hold strategies call for buying when the stock prices are low .
But during recession equities can remain depressed for years at end .
This is a right time to reconsider your investing strategy to position your portfolio to weather the recession .
Additionally , we would want to consider stocks and investments that can do well in an inflationary environment .
All the trillions of dollars that are now being pumped into the economy in the name of stimulus and bailouts , will have significant inflationary effect in the near future .
What Stocks Should we Consider ?
Recession is defined as a period when the economic activity of the country is declining .
Which means , that in most sectors of the economy , the inventories are high and capacity to build far exceeds demand .
This includes once hot sectors such as high technology and housing .
The reasons for demand / supply imbalance could be many ; overbuilding due to loose credit for non-essential purchases was the main reason for the current recession , rapidly declining purchasing power may be another reason which is also manifesting itself in the economy today .
Recession stocks are stocks of the companies that typically do not have such demand / supply imbalance .
This is mainly because they produce goods or services that are essential for consumers , and these goods and services are very price inelastic ( meaning consumer demand does not change much if the price changes up or down ) .
So what are these companies ?
These companies include sectors of consumer staples ( like tooth paste , shampoo , soap , etc ) , drugs , vice ( tobacco ) , etc .
You may also consider companies that do work for the government like defence suppliers , prison management , etc .
Many of these companies do steady and boring business with no surprise growth spurts but also no surprise declines .
These are some of the sectors you should consider investing in .
Respectable dividends are also an added benefit that many companies in these sectors can offer .
You can do more research on companies in these sectors using Yahoo Finance or Google if you want to construct your stocks portfolio .
Investing Strategy for coming high inflation
If you are also worried about high inflation in the future , as I am , there are a few investments that you can consider .
Keep in mind that a period of high inflation will almost surely decimate the purchasing power of an cash or cash like investments ( CDs , money markets , treasuries ) that you may have .
The only way to keep up with the inflation is to invest in TIPS or to invest in stocks .
But which stocks ?
The key to figuring this out is to understand that the rise in inflation is going to be due to the freer monetary policy and the countless trillions that are being pumped into the US economy today in the name of stimulus .
Similar actions are being taken in Europe and other countries , although , arguably to a lesser degree .
High inflation means the value of the dollar will decline rapidly in real terms and also as measured against some other currencies and commodities .
So how should we change our investing strategy to protect against this ?
Hard assets provide some protection against inflation as they become more valuable as inflation goes up .
I do not recommend buying gold , although this has been a favorite of many pundits , for the sole reason that I believe the gold prices have run up to the level where the demand for the commodity will suffer .
Gold is NOT one of the essential commodities .
I feel that natural resources ( mining , timber , agriculture , etc ) will be a good hedge against inflation and countries that are rich in natural resources will have stronger economies and will have strengthening currencies against US Dollar .
Therefore I would say one would be wise to consider a part of their portfolio to be linked to countries rich in natural resources such as Brazil , Canada and Australia .
If you want to play the currencies , you can use the forex markets or even buy cds linked to foreign currencies ( I think Everbank offers this facility ) , but do this purely to hedge .
Growth should always come from investing in a business .
Even buying real estate in US may be a good move , although I would imagine not everyone will be comfortable doing this for investment purposes in this environment .
US no longer the growth engine of the world
Well , it has not been the growth engine of the world for many years in the past but the size of the US economy has ensured that when US sneezes , the world catches cold .
The future is likely to be very different from the past with the relative importance of the US economy diluted even more .
There are many reasons why I think this will happen and some of the reasons why I think the US Economic Future is Uncertain are outlined in this article I posted a while back .
Needless to say , I recommend that investors increase their exposure to non-US assets or at least start investing in US companies that do a large part of their business overseas .
International themes may be hard to play for simple reasons that we may not have time or resources to conduct the research needed .
There is also a political risk and currency risk to consider .
For this reason , diversification becomes very important when investing abroad and ETFs can be some of the lowest cost option to construct a diversified portfolio .
As always , if you do not yet have a sufficient emergency fund , focus on building that first .
Then consider your risk tolerance before you decide to invest in stocks .
There are many low risk investments available that will do a better job of preserving the value of your dollars compared to a CD or a savings account .
And finally , consider the advice of your professional financial advisor before making any changes to your investing strategy .
ONE of William Penn ’s first tasks was to build a brewhouse .
Following a trend of the time , the founder of Philadelphia opened a private brewery in the 1680s at his nearby Pennsbury Manor .
By the 1880s , there were almost 100 commercial breweries , but Prohibition shut most of them down , and the city ’s beer scene never fully recovered .
But Philadelphia is starting to brew anew .
From historically minded breweries that pay homage to our founding fathers , to bohemian pubs that craft unusual ales , the city is undergoing a kind of beer renaissance .
Much of the upswing can be attributed to Philadelphia ’s bubbling night life .
The new breweries , said Don Russell , who as Joe Sixpack writes a weekly column about beer for The Philadelphia Daily News , “ are filling a need that ’s out there being created by the local bar scene .
Every single bar that has been opening up has a multitap system and is featuring microbrews . ”
Already some children are no longer allowed to play conkers , take part in snowball fights or go on school trips for fear that teachers will be sued if something goes wrong – triggering fears that they are being denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves or explore the world .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The private sector lost nearly 700,000 jobs in February , according to a report from payroll - processing company Automatic Data Processing released Wednesday , but a separate report showed that employers announced fewer job cuts last month .
The ADP report , which is calculated on payroll data , said the private sector eliminated 697,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in February .
That 's an increase of 83,000 job cuts , or 11 % , from a revised total of 614,000 job cuts reported in January .
Economists were expecting a loss of 630,000 private sector jobs , according to a survey conducted by Briefing.com .
" We probably still have a few million jobs to lose here by the end of the year , " said ADP spokesman Joel Prakken in a conference call with reporters .
He added that the unemployment rate , which stands at 7.6 % , could rise above 8 % a year from now .
And by the middle of 2010 , it could top 9 % , according to Prakken .
Prakken said the unemployment rate could have exceeded 10 % by year 's end if not for the government 's economic stimulus efforts .
Still , he expects " gruesome employment numbers " for the next several months .
But a separate employment report suggested that the worst may be over for the nation 's strained job market .
Outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. reported that the number of planned job cuts announced in February fell for the first time since December .
" The decline in job cuts last month offers some hope that January was the peak and we will now see layoffs begin to fall or at least stabilize , " John Challenger , chief executive officer of Challenger , Gray & Christmas , said in a statement .
" Hopefully we have seen the last instance of monthly job cuts in excess of 200,000 , " he said .
Job cut announcements by U.S. employers totaled 186,350 in February , down 23 % from January 's 241,749 cuts , which was a seven - year high according to Challenger .
But not all the news was good .
The February total was still 158 % higher than the 72,091 job cuts announced in the same month a year ago .
After just two months , employers have already announced 428,099 job cuts in 2009 .
That is 191 % higher than the 147,077 cuts announced in the first two months of last year .
The auto sector was hit the hardest , Challenger said .
Boosted in large part by layoffs at General Motors , 61,288 job cuts were announced , or about one - third of the monthly total .
Of the 25 industry categories that the Challenger report tracks , 11 reported higher job cuts in February compared to the previous month .
Ten industries announced hiring plans , led by entertainment , financial and energy .
The reports set the tone for the government 's monthly jobs report due Friday .
The Labor Department report is expected to show that the economy shed 650,000 jobs in February , more than the 598,000 reported for January , according to a consensus estimate of economists complied by Briefing.com .
The unemployment rate is forecasted to rise to 7.9 % from 7.6 % .

A low - carbon economy will be the culmination of thousands of decisions by governments , businesses and individuals about how we choose to balance environment and economy .
There is n't one correct future but many , with each detail in each country dependent on the will of its people .
One thing is certain , though .
Anyone concerned about having to give up their modern lifestyle for an austere existence can rest easy .
The big differences between now and the low - carbon future will not be the way the world looks or what we will be able to do in it , but how it is arranged .
The biggest hurdle is electricity .
Three - quarters of our global electricity needs come from burning fossil fuels .
The low - carbon future will demand that none of that electricity emits carbon dioxide .
So every gas or coal - fired power plant , of which there will be many in China and India , will have carbon - capture technology to trap and store CO2 underground .
Renewable sources including wind , tide , wave and sun will , through investment in basic research in the coming decades , be commercially viable .
Far from being forbidding installations belching out carbon dioxide , renewable power stations will be smaller , emit no CO2 and tap into near - limitless supplies of free fuel .
Clean electricity will have a knock - on effect on the other modern carbon nasty - transport .
When electricity is cheap and clean , there is no reason not to use its power as much as possible .
Electric cars , buses , lorries and high - speed trains will move us and our goods , yet make no contribution to global warming .
Though mass public transport will be the travel mode of choice , personal cars will remain .
You might not own one yourself , instead borrowing from clubs when needed .
By planning towns around pedestrians and investing in cycle lanes , local councils will encourage travel under two miles to be under your own steam or by hydrogen buses .
Flying will be a problem .
Improved aerodynamics , lighter aircraft and mixing biofuels into jet fuel will bring down the carbon cost of air miles .
Carbon reductions in energy production and road transport will mitigate some of the rise in emissions from the growth in flights in China and India , but environmental campaigners will not be satisfied .
Expect punishing taxes on plane tickets , tied to their carbon cost , to discourage flying unless there really is no alternative .
In these situations , a personal carbon - rationing system , linked to national CO2 emissions targets , will allow individuals to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
But the number of long journeys , particularly for work , will drop dramatically as high - speed internet connections enable high - quality video conferences and easy communications for people on different sides of the world .
Many people will stop commuting to their offices or factories , preferring to work from home .
Homes might look the same , for nostalgic reasons , but will be fundamentally different .
Bricks coated with solar paint will be held together with cement that soaks up CO2 from the air around it .
Triple - glazed windows will reduce the need for heating in winter and cooling in summer .
Only the most energy - efficient fridges and washing machines will be available to buy while LEDs in lamps and displays will turn electricity into light efficiently instead of wasting most of it as heat .
Automatic controls will warm rooms only when needed and switch appliances and lights off when they 're not needed .
Our throwaway culture will disappear .
By encouraging people to re-use as much as possible , less waste will end up in landfill and the carbon in our possessions ( the stuff emitted to make our clothes , toys or furniture ) wil not be wasted .
Products will be made to last and , when they come to the end of their useful life , be repaired rather than thrown away .
Packaging will be virtually nonexistent and , where it exists , will be recyclable or compostable .
People will use water more carefully .
Rain will be collected from home and office rooftops and filtered using carbon - free electricity so that it is drinkable .
Any water drained away in a building will be recycled and treated locally to wash clothes or flush toilets .
Bottled water will be banned .
Food will come from local farms or factories to reduce the carbon cost of transport .
Meat lovers , because of their high - carbon diets , will have to use up their personal carbon rations whenever they bite into a steak or else make sure their food comes from local , sustainable farms that produce meat artificially .
Locally - produced electricity will also play a big part in keeping homes carbon free .
Solar thermal panels , community - based combined heat and power plants running on carbon - neutral wood chips , micro wind turbines and ground source heat pumps mean that local districts wo n't need all their power from today 's centralised power stations .
Local heat and power networks could even feed into the national grid during times of great demand .
This is one of many visions for a low - carbon world in 2050 .
It seems a long way off and whether we get there depends on decisions made over the next few years .
Missouri Militia member expresses outrage that organization which helps police find missing children , sponsors soup kitchens and blood donation campaigns is linked with OKC bombing , domestic terrorism
Paul Joseph Watson

Monday , March 16 , 2009
A member of the Missouri Militia has contacted us to express his outrage that the organization , which routinely works with local law enforcement to help find missing children , sponsors blood donation campaigns and soup kitchens , is being smeared as a terrorist outfit by the federal government .
As we reported last week , a secret report distributed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center lists militias , Ron Paul supporters , libertarians , people who display bumper stickers , people who own gold , or even people who fly a U.S. flag and equates them with radical race hate groups and terrorists .
The document features a photograph of members of the Missouri militia next to a list of terrorist plots , including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the Atlanta Olympic Park attack .
A member of the Missouri Militia who is featured in the photograph has written to us expressing his outrage that such a highly regarded organization , which devotes most of its time to projects which better the local community , has been villified in such a slapdash and erroneous way by the feds .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ In regard to the boys pictured in the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) entitled “ The Modern Militia Movement ” .
I know most of the guys pictured in the article , ” he writes .
All are hard working men whose wife ’s support everything they do .
Not one is a radical or a white supremacist .
There are no anti-Semites .
In fact some of the members have been Jewish and African - American .
The leaders of this organization are in contact with the local sheriffs office every - time there is a get together that involves discharging weapons .
The local sheriff knows who they are and where they live .
There is no talk of revolution or using any force against law enforcement .
Indeed , just the opposite .
They have volunteered for food kitchens and search and rescue .
They are a transparent organization that only seeks to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms .
I know these guys , because I have trained with them … .
Most of these guys have wives and children and there only crime is preparing for the worst , yet hoping for the best .
Most of these boys do n’t even believe 911 was an inside job .
They are patriots and good fathers in every sense of the word .
They come from all walks of life and there is not an ounce of racism among all of them combined .
Some are college educated white collars and some are blue collars , but all are as normal and patriotic as they come .
Indeed , a cursory examination of the Missouri Militia ’s website reveals that the group is routinely involved in projects such as helping local authorities search for missing children , blood donation campaigns , and feeding the homeless in soup kitchens .
The organization has supported campaigns such as Harvesters , Habitat for Humanity , and Project Warmth .
The website even features a 9/11 tribute and expresses the organization ’s vehement opposition to the perpurtrators of the terrorist attack .
Part of the role of the group is also outlined as “ defense of the state from terrorism or invasion ” .
For the feds to demonize such a group and smear them as potential terrorists is beyond belief .
It ’s almost akin to labeling a group like the Salvation Army an Al - Qaeda offshoot .
This is not only a damning indictment in terms of how the federal government views U.S. citizens , but also a staggering insult to the very notion that there is a “ war on terror ” at all .
If there really were Al - Qaeda suicide bomber cells plotting to attack America , as we are constantly told , then the feds are telling your local police departments to ignore them and instead target stand - up Americans who like to do charity work , feed the homeless and give blood .
Even if one dismisses the notion that these documents are being released as part of a deliberate attempt to smear informed Americans as dangerous political enemies of the state , what we are left with is almost equally as disturbing , which is the fact that the people supposedly leading the “ war on terror ” on the home front have the same level of detective and criminology skills as Barney the Purple Dinosaur .
In releasing this training document , the Missouri Information Analysis Center is putting the U.S. in greater danger of a terrorist attack and ensuring that any real terrorists would evade detection , while law enforcement are being trained that the most patriotic Americans imaginable are their mortal enemies .

Why Financial Crises Will Keep Happening
The financial crisis currently unfolding before our eyes in slow motion was inevitable and predictable .
I say this because it was predicted by numbers of people .
It was obvious ; anyone with sense knew it was coming ( a group which apparently includes very few people ) ; and despite the fact that we ’ve known for years it was going to happen , it happened anyway .
The same was true of the dot - com bubble .
The inevitability of the dot - com collapse was obvious , at least as far back as 1996 / 1997 .
Everyone knew it who was n’t paid not to know it , and it happened anyway and burst anyway .
Both of these foreseeable collapses raises the question of deliberate government policy — both bubbles were fostered and grown from tiny soap - suds with the aid of Alan Greenspan ’s Fed and various other government and private and semi-private actors ( in the case of the current collapse , including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) .
Creating the bubble behind the current financial crisis took the cooperation and encouragement of a lot of people beyond the government , people who benefited a great deal from it .
Let ’s take Chuck Prince , the ex-CEO of Citigroup .
Prince walked away from his near - destruction of Citigroup with about $ 41.5 million , including a $ 12 million bonus for his performance .
The moral of the story is : drive the place into the ground , get paid well .
Then there ’s Merrill Lynch ’s Stan O’Neal who walked away with $ 160 million .
Nice work if you can get it .
But if the rot was limited to the top , it would n’t be nearly as big a problem .
Mortgage brokers were paid to sell what everyone knew were mortgages that probably could n’t be repaid .
Why ?
Because the banks knew that they were going to slice - and - dice the mortgages into Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) and sell them to suckers investors .
When the loans went bad they would n’t be on the banks ’ books .
It did n’t ( and is n’t ) quite working that way for the banks , but in a more real sense it is .
The mortgage brokers still got their commissions .
The real - estate agents got their commissions .
In many cases they made enough money to live on for the rest of their lives .
The executives in the banks and in the Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley , who created these CDOs , also got rich .
They made millions .
If they were smart and saved some of it , they will never ever have to work again .
The system did what it was supposed to do .
It made the people who run the system stinking filthy rich .
If you ’re reading this , odds are you expect to work to 65 or so and pray that when you retire you ’ll have enough money to support yourself in a style that does n’t require you to eat cat food .
You ’ll work forty or forty - five years to get that retirement .
What would you do , or rather what would n’t you do , if you knew that by working hard for five years you ’d have enough money that you need never , ever , work again for the rest of your life ?
Not just that , but in the case of most executives , that 5 year ’s of work would make you rich .
Want a house on the Riviera ?
Want to spend the rest of your life traveling ?
Have a hobby ?
Whatever it is , you ’ll be able to indulge it , because you ’ll be rich and money is freedom .
So even if , in the end , Merrill Lynch was going to be stuck with a bunch of bad debt , or Citigroup was going to have problems , why should you , the executive , give a damn ?
Making record profits for a few years allows you pay yourself , or to be awarded commissions and bonuses , that add up to more money than a normal person earns in 45 years .
From the perspective of self - interest you ’d be a fool not to jump at the chance .
And for most people , even some CEOs , even if you do n’t like it , you ’d still be a fool not to do it , because if you opt out , someone else will just take your place , run the scams , and reap the windfall of ill - gotten gains .
What is good for the economy , the country and for the long term health of your company is not what ’s good for you .
That ’s a recipe for disaster for everyone , possibly even for you , if you are n’t real smart .
Money is only worth what the country behind it is worth , after all .
Trash your country , or your world , and you trash your own wealth .
As a result of this incentive system , if the possibility to have another financial bubble after this one crashes out is not eliminated , there will be another financial bubble .
Guaranteed .
There is no way to avoid it unless the economic circumstances are so bad it ca n’t get off the ground — which is possible , if the monetary base starts collapsing .
The answer is fairly simple , mind you .
These sorts of bubbles did n’t happen in the post - war period .
They did n’t happen because you could n’t pay enough people enough to make it worth their while .
After a certain amount of income , in most western countries , you got taxed at a marginal rate of over 90 % .
A few CEOs might be able to make it , but most of the executive suite was going to need more than 5 years –they were going to need a career .
At this point , wringing the excesses out of the system and stopping the systemic incentives to keep blowing bubbles is going to require doing something to stop it from paying .
There are two parts to any solution .
The first and simplest way is to put a very progressive tax on all income no matter how or where earned that probably comes in at over 95 % of all income over , say , $ 500,000 or a million at the most .
Suddenly , needing to actually keep the companies sound , and knowing that in 7 years when the loans go bad , they ’ll still be there taking the heat for it , will tend to concentrate the mind not on “ can I make enough money to be in a yacht in 3 years ” but into “ does this deal make sense over the long run ” .
The second thing to do is to stop allowing people to sell risk .
For years Greenspan argued that risk markets ( the ability to take on , say , default risk in credit or for that matter to sell loans in CDOs ) made the system stronger and actually reduced systemic risk by spreading risk around .
What it did instead is take the risk away from the people who were able to manage it because they were close enough to the ground to know whether a loan was risky and give it to people who really had no clue and had to rely on bond rating agencies to tell them if the risk was acceptable .
Without a loan officer in the actual district , without actual inspections of houses and businesses and without the loan officers knowing that 10 years from now if the loan goes bad some manager is going to call them into the room and ask them to justify the decisions they made , the people taking on the loans had no ability to know if they could , or would , be repaid .
And the banks , since they thought they were selling the risk , mainly did n’t bother with old style vetting .
Indeed banks like Citigroup have gutted the departments which used to do that sort of due diligance .
The bond agencies also got paid by the people they issued ratings to .
I ’m sure you understand what that means for their objectivity .
Nor could they , even if they had made an honest effort , duplicate the sort of vetting and checking which banks used to do routinely .
They simply do n’t check every mortgage and can’t .
So the rule going forward has to be that if you make the loan you keep the risk on your books .
You can not load it off on other people .
There are mathematical reasons why in theory offloading risk ought to reduce systemic risk , but in the real world they generally do n’t play out because of the problem of incentives :
the people with the necessary information to manage the risk have no incentive to do so ;
the people who wind up with the debt do not have the ability to manage the risk ;
and the third parties like bond agencies have neither the incentives nor the ability to manage the risk either .
Such a world will be a world with a much smaller , less flamboyant financial sector with much lower returns .
But the idea that the financial sector could somehow make far greater returns than GDP growth and do it for decades was always insane and simply could never work .
The only way to accomplish those kinds of insane returns , the only way it has in fact been done , was to cheat and to ignore system risk , use massive leverage , print money and shove it into asset bubbles and so on .
The end result has been two financial bubbles and thirty years in which the average American has n’t had a raise and has taken on debt .
A lot of people have gotten rich , mind you , and for them these last thirty years have been great , which is why there ’s a bipartisan consensus amongst the people who matter in both parties to keep going what has been , for them , the best of all possible times .
Given a choice , they will keep it going .
And there will be a lot more rich in America , but odds that you ’ll be one of them are near zero .
And when it all comes crashing down , somehow ordinary Americans , despite having never been invited to the party , will be stuck with the cleanup and the bill .

Cream Cheese Pound Cake
Adapted liberally from Staff Meals from Chanterelle
The cream cheese does n’t so much change the flavor profile but adds a bit more depth of flavor and an amazing crackly edge .
If you ’re baking this pound cake in advance , as opposed to the day you are serving it , a little basting will go a long way towards keep it ( or any other pound cake ) moist .
You can use a simple syrup ( one part sugar dissolved in an equal amount of water ) , up the water in it if you ’re concerned it will be too sweet and / or add a teaspoon of your flavoring of choice to it .
Serves ( at least ) 10
1 1/2 cups ( 12 ounces or 340 grams ) unsalted butter , at room temperature
1 package ( 8 ounces or 225 grams ) Philadelphia brand cream cheese * , at room temperature
3 cups ( 595 grams ) granulated sugar
6 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract plus 1/2 teaspoon almond extract ( original recipe calls for 2 teaspoons vanilla but I liked this mix better )
3 cups ( 375 grams ) all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
Preheat the oven to 325 °F .
Lightly butter a 10 - inch tube pan , then line the bottom with parchment paper .
Alternately , you can use a 12 - cup bundt pan , and simply butter and flour it .
Place the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth .
Add the sugar , increase the speed to high , and beat until light and airy , at least five minutes .
Add the eggs , one at a time , beating after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed .
Add the vanilla , almond , then the flour and salt all at once .
Beat just until incorporated .
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and shake lightly to even out the top .
Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean , 1 1/4 hours .
Place the pan on a cake rack and cool for 20 minutes , then remove the cake from the pan and let it cool completely .
Serve at room temperature .
* Philadelphia cream cheese is often recommended for baking for consistency purposes , as in , bakers know this brand works , and because it contains less water than other brands .
Variations : I think this cake would be fantastic with a cup of chopped white chocolate stirred into the batter ( an idea I got from this lovely lady ) and / or some orange zest .
Or grapefruit zest .
Or whole raspberries , if you can find good ones in season .
Or have fun with it .
A good pound cake is infinitely adaptable , and I would like to try them all .
Smaller cakes : A bundt - volume cake often can be used to make two 8 1/2 - by - 4 1/4- by - 2 1/2 - inch loaf cakes , however ( caveat ! )
I have not tested this recipe in loaf pans .
I just wanted to throw that out there for those of you feeling adventurous , or interested in a reduced volume of cake .
Strawberry Coulis
Where has this been my whole life ?
I have spent — nay wasted — too much time making cooked fruit compotes for dessert when some fruits , like berries , will always taste better raw .
I suspect you could swap any berry for the strawberry in this coulis , but you might have to bump up the sugar accordingly .
And then share with me .
2 cups quartered hulled strawberries ( about 12 ounces or 340 grams )
1/4 cup ( 60 ml ) water
3 tablespoons ( 35 grams ) sugar
1 tablespoon ( 15 ml ) fresh lemon juice
Combine strawberries , water , sugar and lemon juice in blender .
Purée until very smooth , then press through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds .
Cover and refrigerate until cold .
Coulis can be prepared one day ahead .

Fox producer busted for child porn once linked to ' Lohan nipple ' photos Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Online resume claims he spent four years at school he dropped out of after his first arrest Fox News Channel producer Aaron Bruns , who was arrested and arraigned on child pornography charges in a federal courthouse in Washington Tuesday , once ran a blog heavy on satire called Tanksphere where he linked to naughty photographs of a young actress , RAW STORY has found .
" According to charging documents , investigators say Bruns had been sharing pornography on a social networking Web site , " the AP reports .
" A Fox News spokeswoman says they are aware of the arrest .
She says Bruns was suspended Tuesday without pay . "
The AP adds , " Bruns covered Secretary of State Hillary Clintons presidential campaign in 2008 and later was a general producer in Washington , covering politics .
A judge scheduled another hearing for Thursday , where he will consider whether to continue holding Bruns in jail . "
In a July of 2004 post , fellow blogger David Deming wrote about the film Mean Girls , which starred Linsday Lohan , who had just turned 18 years old .
" Which brings me to another point - I do n't know how old Ms. Lohan is in real life , but in the movie she is sixteen , " Deming wrote .
" There 's something slightly discomfiting about this , for she is very clearly a sex object , but kind of disarmingly cute at the same time .
I can imagine that men watching this movie can't decide whether they want to deflower her or make sure she gets home by midnight .
How much conflict you feel over this depends entirely on how old and how sleazy you are . "
Bruns left the following reply on the post , " http://www.foundonfloor.com/lohanslip.html just in case you had n't seen this ... should be requird viewing . "
The link was to a web site , since scrubbed from the web ( archived link ) , that contained video of the young actress grinding followed by pictures that showed " accidental " cleavage .
The five photographs which Bruns said should be " requird viewing " clearly showed her right nipple protruding from her top .
A prior post by Bruns at his blog referenced his Fox News employers : " Special Report with Brit Hume .
Gripping stuff .
( Had to give a nod to those that pay the bills ) . "
" FishbowlDC reports this is not Bruns ' first run-in with the law , " TV Newser notes .
" He dropped out of the University of Michigan in 1999 after being arrested on charges of distributing child pornography . "
TVNewser 's Chris Ariens continues , " So why was n't Bruns checked out by Fox News ?
A network spokesperson tells TVNewser criminal background checks were not instituted until 2003 .
Bruns was hired in 2002 . "
According to a 1999 AP story not available on the web , Bruns was sentenced to three years  probation after " 6,000 pornographic images of children " were found on his computer 's hard drive .
" The judge placed Bruns of Lima , Ohio , on probation last Thursday under the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act , which means his conviction will be expunged if he complies with the conditions of probation , " the 1999 AP story added .
In 1998 , the University of Michigan school paper reported , " Less than two weeks after Department of Public Safety detectives had arrested him on charges of distributing child pornography , LSA first - year student Aaron Bruns voluntarily dropped out of the University while his case was pending , his lawyer told District Court Judge John Collins on Wednesday . "
The story quoted a DPS officer who told the paper that " Bruns has been trading and downloading pornography since at least late January , receiving as many as a few hundred inquiries a day from others eager to trade child pornography . "
Bruns ' now deleted LinkedIn profile claimed that he attended University of Michigan from 1998 to 2002 .
It 's unknown if Bruns ' official resume also claimed the same when he was hired by Fox nearly seven years ago .
Smoking Gun has a copy of the explicit arrest warrant affidavit which was filed in U.S. District Court .

President Obama ’s plan to leave 50,000 troops in Iraq has come under criticism from the nation ’s leading anti-war veteran ’s organization , Veterans for Peace .
The group said that Obama ’s policies in Iraq and Afghanistan will put the final nail in the coffin of the American economy .
“ I really believe President Obama wants to do good things for the country , ” said VFP president , Mike Ferner , “ but if he continues on this course he ’s charted , his hopes are guaranteed to founder on the shoals of war .
This way lies disaster .
For all our sakes , I hope he reconsiders .
Besides the suffering and death caused by prolonging these wars , America simply can no longer afford the cost of empire .
Unfortunately , that ’s exactly what these policies do .
Their purpose is to control an entire region of the world and its resources .
If you look at history , it ’s clear the long term outlook for empires is not very pleasant . ”
Ferner called Obama ’s policies nothing more than sleight of hand , “ Barack Obama became president in part because millions of voters were sick of these wars and wanted them stopped , period .
Saying that only ‘ non - combat ’ troops will be left after 19 months is just sleight of hand so we can keep tens of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and send thousands more to Afghanistan . ”
Much of the most stinging criticism that Obama has faced so far has not been from the right .
It is the left that has been disappointed by Obama ’s performance .

I respectfully disagree with the Veterans for Peace on this issue .
By all accounts , Iraq still is n’t able to handle its own training of soldiers and police .
I think having non-combat troops there is an improvement , and while I share their concerns that 50,000 troops will stay there forever , I think that it is an unrealistic goal to go from 142,000 to 0 troops in Iraq .
It is critical that everyone who wants the troops out of Iraq keeps the pressure on the Obama administration , to make sure that all the troops come home .
It would be easy for those on the left to be content with the fact that over 2/3 of the troops are out of Iraq , but unless all of the troops come out , Iraq will become the latest global U.S. military global outpost .
Usually , once American troops go in , they never completely come out .
American troops do n’t belong in Iraq , but unless Democrats hold the Obama administration accountable , the Pentagon will turn Iraq into the Middle Eastern outpost that they have always dreamed of .

Listen to Stephen Harper and you might think Canada plays to our national stereotype when it comes to the world of finance .
We might be boring but at least we do n't stand for the risky policies adopted by our American cousins .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
In response to a pessimistic Merrill Lynch report on Canada 's housing market , for example , Harper said " We do n't have the same situation here with the mortgages as was the case in the U.S. with the subprime mortgages there .
So , therefore , I think that our market is in a much stronger position . "
There are differences in the Canadian and U.S. housing markets , differences that can generate sharply contrasting points of view on whether Canada will experience a housing meltdown comparable to the one in the U.S .
The thing is , the Harper government is responsible for pushing the envelope on deregulation both domestically and internationally despite cautionary events in the U.S. clearly indicating what could go wrong .
Promoting mortgage ' innovation '
In his first budget as Harper 's finance minister , Jim Flaherty invited " new players " -- that is , U.S financial corporations -- into Canada 's mortgage insurance market and doubled the amount of government money available to back up private insurers from $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion .
Flaherty 's 2006 budget states that " These changes will result in greater choice and innovation in the market for mortgage insurance , benefiting consumers and promoting home ownership . "
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has observed that " financial innovation " are two words that should henceforth strike terror into the hearts of investors .
With the entrance of new private mortgage insurers into Canada after the Flaherty budget , Canada saw a dramatic weakening in the standards for mortgage insurance .
This enabled Canadians to get into homes they otherwise could n't have -- and in many cases should n't have .
It also kept house prices rising .
In fact , Canadian median house prices peaked this year at levels higher than median prices at the top of the market in the U.S .
In November 2006 , Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation responded to the competition from private insurers by starting to insure no - down - payment , interest only , and 40 - year amortization mortgages .
A CMHC spokesperson was quoted in the National Post as saying : " We 're the third guys coming up to the plate with these products .
AIG has done it , GE has done it .
We 're just doing something that 's in the marketplace . "
Competition from U.S. - based mortgage insurers meant risky products rapidly took over the Canadian mortgage sector .
Forty percent of new mortgages approved in 2007 were amortized over 40 years , and in overheated markets like Alberta 's , the percentage was even higher .
By 2007 , there was clear evidence from the U.S. on the hazards of loose mortgage standards , but the Harper government did not step in to tighten regulations here .
If the Tories had really wanted to make houses more affordable for low income Canadians , one thing they could have done was to reinstate CMHC 's social housing programs .
Innovative mortgage products do not do cash - strapped families any favours .
Rather than being considered a break for low income people , mortgages with lengthy amortizations should be regarded as an extremely expensive way to buy a home .
An analysis in the Toronto Star pointed out : " A 40 - year mortgage [ on a $ 350,000 home ] will save you $ 73 a week on payments but cost an extra $ 254,000 in interest than if you had opted for 25 years .
It 's a trade - off that works way better for the bank than your personal finances . "
As the Canadian economy turns sour , what will be the cost of Canada 's experiment with mortgage innovation ?
In what may turn out to be a too - little , too - late intervention , this summer Flaherty limited CMHC to ensuring mortgages of homebuyers who can make at least a five per cent down payment and who amortize their mortgages over a maximum of 35 years .
The new restrictions will only take effect as of October 15 , 2008 , essentially closing the barn door after the horse has bolted .
Selling financial liberalization to the world
On the international stage , Canada is a major proponent of financial liberalization .
At the WTO , Canada heads a group of delegations pressing developing countries to open their economies to the supposedly superior services of foreign financial institutions .
The world 's major financial conglomerates are claimed to have sophisticated risk management capabilities that can stabilize economies .
You might think these days such a claim would not pass the laugh test , but that did not stop financial liberalization from being pushed at the WTO ministerial meeting held in July 2008 .
The enormity of what 's at stake in the WTO financial sector negotiations is revealed in a February 2006 bargaining request sent from Canada 's Department of Finance to developing countries .
Canada asked that foreign financial institutions be guaranteed rights to " establish new and acquire existing companies " in all financial sectors .
This would mean among other things that countries would have to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of their banks and insurance companies .
Canada has also asked that companies be given WTO enforceable rights to trade in derivatives , which has been described as a high - octane form of financial speculation similar to gambling .
Warren Buffett famously called derivatives " financial weapons of mass destruction , " destruction that is being witnessed on a daily basis on the world 's stock exchanges .
While successive Canadian governments have been strong advocates of financial liberalization , the unfolding financial crisis might have suggested now is the time to show a little caution and back off these WTO negotiating demands .
Yet a WTO submission from Canada dated Dec. 5 , 2007 , berates other WTO members for their lack of " ambition " in the financial services negotiations .
On behalf of the co-sponsors of the submission , Canada claimed : " further liberalization of financial services will help promote economic growth and improved standards of living for all WTO Members … "
It makes one wonder .
Just how bad would things have to get before the Harper government realizes further liberalizing the world 's financial markets is not such a great idea ?

Tyee stories :
Sam Smith November 2006 -
You 'd never guess it from the sycophantic obituaries , but Milton Friedman did more damage to American democracy and culture than just about any figure in the 20th century .
The sycophancy is n't surprising .
Friedman was blessed with it from the start .
For example , the supposedly liberal PBS starred him in a ten part series , " Free to Choose " in 1980 just in time to help Reagan win the presidency .
To this day , even NPR babbles about the " free market " when you all you have to do is count the number of lobbyists in Washington to understand that such an economy does n't exist .
Further , one of the best kept secrets of economics is that there are lots of systems that work provided , that is , you do n't care who they work for .
Feudalism , for example , was great if you were a lord , not so efficient a marketplace is you were merely a serf .
And each system works differently depending on the culture in which it operates , which is why communism in the Soviet Union , China and Italy meant such different things .
In the end , the real test of an economy is not its math but its social , financial and moral effect on its culture and those who live there .
This is why the commentaries on Friedman were so consistently wrong .
They treated economics as though it was a cold science when , in a mind as distorted as Friedman 's , it was really just a sort of creationism myth applied to money .
If you read far enough down the stories , you would find , grudgingly , a single quote from a critic .
The Washington Post cited Galbraith biographer Richard Parker who said that Friendman 's " passionate calls for financial and securities market deregulation played no small role in ushering in the half - trillion dollar S&L fiasco of the 1980s and the deeply corrupt Wall Street stock market boom of the 1990s .
His tax - reduction - at - all - costs policies helped lead to the nation 's yawning budget deficits . "
And the Wall Street Journal admitted deep in its account , " Critics said he inspired policies that put millions of people out of work in pursuit of low inflation and demonized almost everything the government did , no matter how beneficial or democratically chosen .
' Milton Friedman did n't make a distinction between the big government of the People 's Republic of China and the big government of the United States , ' said James Galbraith , professor of government at the University of Texas .
" But for the most part both public figures and the media bought Friedman 's mythology , never stopping to look critically at the effect it had on America .
Here are a just few things that have happened since America 's elite swallowed the Friedman myth :- Real income down - Real manufacturing wages down -
Top one percent 's share of wealth up -
Income gap between rich and poor up - Family indebtedness up - Bottom forty percent 's share of wealth down - CEO pay as a percent of average workers ' pay up - Workers covered by pensions down - Workers covered by health plans down -
Age at which one can receive Social Security down - Personal bankruptcies up - Housing foreclosures up - Median rent up
But the worst damage of Friedman economics is not fiscal but what it has done to the social and moral principles that made America what it was before the greedsters of neo -capitalism began taking it apart .
The underlying principle of laissez faire economics is that power is intrinsically good and decency intrinsically irrelevant .
No society can long function on such a lie .
It is essentially that of the Mafia with the exception being that you do n't have to always ignore the law to get what you want ; often , with the help of your lobbyists and purchased politicians , you can just change it to fit your needs .
The moral vacuum was clear from the start .
Ronald Reagan said things like " We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry every night .
Well , that was probably true .
They were all on a diet . "
And : " Unemployment insurance is a pre-paid vacation for freeloaders .
" As for Margaret Thatcher , whose platform of public selfishness was used as a model for the Reagan campaign , she thought there was n't even anything one could call a community : " There is no such thing as society .
There are individual men and women , and there are families . "
Thatcher wrapped herself in economic slogans that justified greed not only to accomplish economic ends but also to deal with gays and abortions and everything else she did n't like .
In her paradigm , the free market and Victorian tyranny formed a civil union .
By the time Reagan , Bush , and Clinton were through with the concept , they had created a gaping corporate exemption from common morality and decency .
The market not only offered adequate justification for any act , it had replaced God as the highest source of law .
We have paid a terrible price for this corruption of our culture by the new robber barons egged on by Friedman and his ilk .
We so accept their foul standards that we do n't even discuss or debate them .
We have become prisoners of their lie .

Real American street racing in the 21st century is heavily constrained by many factors .
Not the least of which are over - crowded roads and an often overwhelming law enforcement presence .
But it did n't used to be this way .
In the nineteen - seventies the U.S. interstate highway system was so fresh and new some parts still remained under construction .
And there were n't nearly as many people or cars to crowd the byways .
There also were n't nearly so many police officers and patrol cars .
To top all this off , suddenly there were fast cars in the hands of just about anyone who wanted them .
So you might say that was the golden age of American street racing .
Me and my friends personally saw even more excitement and adventure than all the above implies , due to us growing up in a wild , sometimes nearly lawless region of the USA during this time ( even our cops were frequently outlaws themselves ) .
Of course , it was n't wise for racers to advertise their kills too widely , even in that time and place .
After all , laws of one sort or another were often broken , and people hurt too , along the way .
Now -- around thirty years later -- it should be safer to tell the tales .
I may be one of the last survivors of the very wildest treks from those days .
I drove a heavily modified black 1969 Mustang .
We did far more than just racing ( CLICK HERE to see everything ) .

I hope you enjoy them !
PS : Many readers may be shocked to see automotive feats here they 'd never dare try with their own modern sports cars , despite being equipped with technologies 30 years advanced over those described in the accounts .
In some ways the older hardware was simply more robust , and more easily improved upon .
It was definitely easier and cheaper repaired .
I guess I should also add that young men typically underestimate the risks involved in almost any undertaking they might consider .
I know I sure did !

Australian Rules Football : Where Even The Referees Will Hurt You
Most people know that Australian Rules Football is a violent sport .
But did you also know that the referees will also hurt you ?
Following an under - 18 age group preseason game between the University of Queensland Bulldogs and Kenmore Bears in Brisbane , Australia , a fan / parent named Phil Tagell got into an argument with the referee .
The referee won the argument by punching him .
Fisticuffs over a preseason game ?
It ’s a good thing it was n’t the playoffs , or else he might have shot him .
Before you think this was a fair fight , the guy who was punched by the referee was 61 , and the referee was 39 .
Phil Tagell had “ facial injuries and a 2.5 cm - long fracture to the back of his skull . ”
According to Tagell , “ I have been told by several people to be glad that I ’m still alive , because apparently the punch was so good I was unconscious from the moment I was touched .
I then did a dead fall backwards onto the concrete where I did most of the damage .
I ’ve had bleeding and cranial fluid pouring out of my ear and I ca n’t hear in one ear . ”
He ’s lucky that it was n’t Ed Hochuli , or else his head would have been knocked clean off .
Police charged the referee with one count of assault occasioning bodily harm , and he has stepped down from refereeing indefinitely .
“ Because of the police investigation we both agreed it was in his best interest and the game ’s best interest that he does n’t umpire from this point onwards .
We are very concerned of the nature of the incident , ” AFL Queensland chief executive Richard Griffiths said .
That sounds like a very good idea .
Might I suggest some anger management classes as well ?

The pair were reporting on North Korean refugees in China North Korea has confirmed the arrest of two female US journalists , saying they were detained for illegally entering North Korean territory .
The official Central News Agency said the case of the two women , arrested on Tuesday near the China - North Korea border , was under investigation .
The US had earlier expressed " concern " over the fate of the two women .
The news came after the North restored a cross - border military hotline with South Korea severed earlier this month .
The North also indicated it will reopen a border crossing which links the South with a joint Korean industrial zone , just inside the North .
The reporters arrested on Tuesday have been named in news reports as Laura Ling , a Chinese - American , and Euna Lee , a Korean - American .
Both reportedly work for the California - based online media outlet Current TV .
A Chinese interpreter accompanying the two journalists was also arrested .
Chun Ki-won , a Christian clergyman in Seoul who helped arrange the journalists ' trip , has said they went to the area to report on North Korean refugees in north - eastern China .
There have been conflicting reports about where the women were detained .
South Korean reports have suggested they were on Chinese territory .
But North Korea 's official Central News Agency said the journalists were detained on Tuesday " while illegally intruding into the territory of the DPRK [ North Korea ] " .
" A competent organ is now investigating the case , " it added .
Industrial complex
The now restored military hotline between the two Koreas is intended as a means of direct communication at a time of high tension .
It is used to co-ordinate the movement of goods and people through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone , and in its absence officials resorted to exchanging notes by hand .
North Korea 's missile programme Pyongyang cut the hotline in protest at an annual US - South Korean military exercise , which it said it suspected were a prelude to an invasion .
On Saturday , South Korean Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong - jo said that Pyongyang had also informed Seoul it would reopen cross - border traffic to and from an industrial complex in the North Korean border town of Kaesong .
The joint Korean venture is a key source of hard currency for the communist state .
The border between the two Koreas has been intermittently closed since the communication lines were cut on 9 March - when the US - South Korea drill began - stranding South Korea workers at a shared industrial estate and badly affecting businesses there .
The North 's move came just hours after Beijing urged North Korea to restart talks on its nuclear programme .
Missile worries
The six - party talks , which also include South Korea , the US , Japan , and Russia , aim to offer aid to Pyongyang in return for the North ending its controversial nuclear activities .
But negotiations have been deadlocked for months because of a dispute with the US over how to verify the North 's full range of past nuclear activities .
The situation has been further enflamed by the North 's announcement that it plans to test - fire a rocket early next month .
China has voiced its concern over the growing tensions on the Korean peninsula over North Korea 's planned rocket launch .
The North insists it is preparing to send up a communications satellite - and that any attempt to shoot it down would result in war .
The US , Japan and South Korea have all expressed concerns that the North is actually planning to test - fire a long - range missile .
North Korea is banned from firing either device under a UN Security Council resolution prohibiting it from ballistic activity .
Tensions have been high between North and South Korea since the South 's conservative President Lee Myung - Bak scrapped his predecessors ' policy of offering virtually unconditional aid to Pyongyang .
North and South Korea technically remain in a state of war since their 1950 - 53 conflict ended in a ceasefire , not a peace treaty .

The Endless Wars Of Our Times Part One
The pattern of these already serious wars and conflicts around the world teaches us a great deal about the patterns of 21st century war .
The high - tech , " lean , mean " militaries that President George W. Bush and his first defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , so enthusiastically pursued are irrelevant to all of them .

Washington ( UPI ) Mar 30 , 2009
" Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars . "
Jesus ' famous words in the Olivet prophecy have been true for pretty much every generation of history for the past 2,000 years .
So why should things be any different now ?
New U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democratic foreign policy establishment in the United States know they can't outlaw war .
Believe it or not , that was actually done in 1928 in the Kellogg - Briand peace pact .
U.S. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand were awarded Nobel Peace Prizes for their " achievement . "
They were arguably the most farcical Nobels ever given to anyone .
Within nine years , the Imperial Japanese army had slaughtered three - quarters of a million Chinese people in its drive up the Yangtze River valley to Nanjing .
Within 11 years of that " achievement , " World War II , the bloodiest single conflict in human history , had begun .
However , Obama and his team are confident they can reduce tensions around the world .
They are particularly hopeful of being able to end the century - old Israel - Arab conflict and the 30 years of ferocious hostility of Iran toward the Great Satan , as its leaders , broadcasters and educators continually call the United States .
The leaders of the giant European Union of 27 nations encompassing half a billion people -- the third - largest organization of human beings on the Earth after China and India -- are also firm believers in the so - called soft power of economic influence and diplomatic persuasion rather than the hard power of military might .
Safe under the protective nuclear - armed shield of the U.S. - led NATO alliance for the past 60 years , they believe that major wars are a thing of the past too .
Why should they be wrong ?
The first reason is that war has never been successfully abolished in the entirety of recorded organized human history ; one hesitates to use the term " civilized " for anything to do with war .
The second reason is that we do n't live in an age of peace or even of receding war now .
Genocide continues in Darfur , and the organized political groupings of the African Union , the Arab League and China -- together representing around one - third of the population of Earth , all strongly support Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir of Sudan , who remains completely unrepentant about the continuing brutalities of his armed forces against black Christian and animist peoples of Darfur .
Farther south , things are even worse in Congo , formerly Zaire .
It has been in a state of anarchic chaos for well over a decade and is the largest , most populous and most hellish collapsed - state region on Earth .
At least 10 million people have died there .
In Afghanistan , the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban and its al - Qaida allies are on the upsurge all across the country .
Last week Obama outlined a new strategy he hopes to apply there .
However , as yet it remains untested , with many military analysts expressing extreme skepticism about it having any relevance to the real cultural , economic and social conditions on the ground .
Continuing southward , Pakistan , already an Islamic nuclear power , teeters on the brink of disintegration .
The civilian government has only the most tenuous control over the armed forces , and one - quarter of the area of the country , the huge North - West Frontier province , is already controlled by the Taliban and their allies .
The pattern of these already serious wars and conflicts around the world teaches us a great deal about the patterns of 21st century war .
The high - tech , " lean , mean " militaries that President George W. Bush and his first defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , so enthusiastically pursued are irrelevant to all of them .

Taking Cities in Stride
Last post , I let you know about Walk Score , the website that tallies a district ’s commercial , recreational , and cultural opportunities , then assigns it a numerical score based on its pedestrian - friendliness .
Walk Score also ranks the 40 largest cities and provides neat walkability maps of them .
Here are the 10 most pedestrian - oriented :
Los Angeles , from Walk Score .
1. San Francisco
2. New York
3. Boston
4. Chicago
5. Philadelphia
6. Seattle
7. Washington , D.C .
8. Long Beach , Calif .
9. Los Angeles
10 . Portland
Few surprises here , except perhaps the high rankings of Los Angeles and satellite city Long Beach .
Here are the 10 least - walkable , most auto - dependent cities :
Nashville , from Walk Score .
31 . El Paso
32 . San Antonio
33 . Fort Worth
34 . Kansas City
35 . Memphis
36 . Oklahoma City
37 . Indianapolis
38 . Charlotte
39 . Nashville
40 . Jacksonville
Any patterns here ?
First , note that seven of the 10 most walkable cities sit on large bodies of water .
With a coastline checking expansion , available land had to be used more intensively .
( As the map makes clear , there were considerable natural limits on San Francisco ’s physical growth . )
Intensive land use means density , and density generally means walkability .
On the other hand , nine of the 10 least walkable cities are inland .
In most of them , largely unfettered expansion and low densities were possible from the get - go .
Boston ’s growth was restricted by the presence of the Atlantic Ocean , and San Francisco ’s growth was restricted by the Pacific Ocean ; Oklahoma City ’s growth was restricted by , well , the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean .
Second , the walkable list is dominated by Northeastern and West Coast cities that are comparatively old , at least by American standards .
Six of the 10 most walkable cities were among the 20 largest urban places in 1900 .
By the 1950 ’s , these cities were largely mature ; collectively , they grew only 1.5 percent in population between 1960 and 2000 .
On the other hand , the least walkable cities are relative newcomers on the urban scene .
Eight of 10 are in the South , the site of much of America ’s most explosive urban growth in the postwar period .
None of the least walkable cities were among the 20 largest urban places in 1900 , and five were not even in the top 100 .
The postwar period has seen rapid growth for these cities : 81 percent between 1960 and 2000 .
Why do city age and maturity matter ?
I ’ll give you a hint : my answer will have something to do with the fact that I have transportation on the brain .
As Peter O. Muller ably chronicles , most of the pedestrian - friendly cities are products of the era of the foot and the hoof , with the steel wheel ( i.e. the streetcar ) coming along a bit later .
Getting around cities in the age of muscle power was a difficult and slow proposition , so activities clung together in space to make travel to , from , and between them feasible .
Dense districts were literally built for walking .
The streetcars partially reinforced this trend .
Networks were generally radial , which funneled traffic into downtowns , promoting growth there .
Having reached a critical mass , these urban cores continue to thrive to this day .
With the transition to the rubber tire , the rules of the game changed .
High - speed , omnidirectional auto travel meant businesses were no longer tethered to the center or to each other ; they had the freedom to disperse in search of cheap land while still being accessible to their suppliers and customers .
In places that grew up in the era of the auto , central districts were often stillborn and sterile .
Walkability was a casualty .
But do n’t start feeling smug , Washingtonians and Bostonians ; auto - oriented development is alive and well in your cities too .
Yes , you have some great walking neighborhoods and on occasion one of your urban areas might even gentrify and sprout opportunities for travel by foot .
But for many decades , the vast majority of your new development has been in auto - oriented suburban areas that resemble Charlotte more than Chicago .
Even in a walker ’s paradise like New York , new development has tended to look a lot more like East Brunswick than the East Village .
For the most part , these suburban areas are not particularly amenable to walking , unless you count the stroll from the parking lot to the front door of Denny’s .
In short , with some admittedly notable exceptions ( such as the interesting case of Portland ) , they just do n’t seem to be building walkable cities any more .
The tricky part is figuring out how , and whether , we can take steps to remedy this .
Explosions are n't just for padding out Michael Bay movies .
They are also crucial to the production of industrial materials , keeping medical supplies safe during shipping , and even to the future of treating heart disease .

Yesterday at the Etech Conference in San Jose , chemist Christa Hockensmith explained how she got interested explosion science , and what researchers at the cutting edge are doing to make exothermic reactions work for you .
Hockensmith runs the chemistry lab at New Mexico Tech 's Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center ( EMRTC ) , an enormous , outdoor facility in Socorro , NM , where researchers have the space to test massive explosions in relative safety .
The innovations that come out of Hockensmith 's chemistry research are all eventually turned into giant balls of fire and tremendous shockwaves in the mountains above her lab .

Often , explosion science starts with a specific question from a company or research lab .
" Somebody will call me on the phone and say , ' Can you help me with this ? ' "
Hockensmith said , then added with a laugh , " And of course if they have the money , we always do . "
Often companies will partner with EMRTC , sponsoring research that 's relevant to products they create .
Recently , a company came to Hockensmith asking whether she could create an " explosive - aided polymer . "
The company makes chemicals that are used in industrial manufacturing , but those chemicals must be encased in a protective polymer shell until the exact moment they are needed .
So Hockensmith and her team created a way to set off a tiny , focused explosion that would crack the polymer shell at the instant that the chemical is added to the manufacturing process .
They also created a similar kind of explosion for use in plastic containers for medical supplies .
She explained :
Shipping containers for medical supplies are often plastic , and get deformed in the shipping process .
So we put small explosive charge in them which creates enough inert gas to reshape the container .
A filter protects the medical supplies from contamination , and the inert gas prevents leakage and loss of sterility .
And then there are the untested ideas that Hockensmith is just starting to think about , like how extremely tiny explosions at the molecular level might be used in medical research .
She mused :
We make almost 200,000 industrial diamonds per year with explosions , so what why not work on tiny explosions that could destroy tumors , or unblock arteries ?
We could actually make them implosions , so that they would n't cause bleeding .

EMRTC , where Hockensmith works , is trying to get young people interested in the science of explosions , too .
For the first time this year they 'll be offering " Explosives Camp " for high schoolers interested in pursuing science and engineering topics related to explosions .
Explosives Camp will run from June 21 - 28 this summer at New Mexico Tech .

Overture Films has released the first teaser trailer for sci - fi thriller “ . ”
The film takes place 500 years in the future when the human race is trying to migrate from an Earth dying of climate change to a new planet .
Two astronauts awaken in a hyper - sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft .
It ’s pitch black , they are disoriented , and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the spacecraft .
They ca n’t remember anything – who are they , what is their mission ?
The only way out of the chamber is a dark and narrow airshaft .
Corporal Bower ( Foster ) , the younger of the two , crawls inside , while the other , Lt. Payton ( Quaid ) , stays behind for guidance on a radio transmitter .
As Bower ventures deeper and deeper into the ship , he begins to uncover a terrifying reality .
Slowly the spacecraft ’s shocking and deadly secrets come unraveled , and the astronauts realize that the survival of mankind hinges on their actions .
” The sci - fi thriller is directed by German filmmaker ( Case 39 , Curiosity & the Cat , Antibodies ) , starsand .
The film is also supported by “ Twilight ” villain “ Pandorum ” is scheduled to hit theaters on September 4th .
" It does not require a majority to prevail , but rather an irate ,
tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people 's minds . "
Suddenly , bloggers , opinion people , columnists and , yes , pundits who have n't paid attention to anything I have been saying or writing for the past 18 months are all over me .
Suddenly , I find myself in the center of a firestorm over Obama 's economic policies , taking enfilading fire from the " liberal " media ( from serious columnist Frank Rich to entertainer Jon Stewart ) while being defended by Rush Limbaugh , the standard - bearer for the Republicans .
I 'm uncomfortable being in the crosshairs of columnists and comedians I enjoy , and I find the embrace of Rush Limbaugh most certainly strange if not antithetical to many of my viewpoints .
So , why after toiling in the cable wilderness for four years with Mad Money am I the target of the wrath of the Obama clan , and the darling , albeit surely momentary , of the Obama - critics ?
After all , my criticism of Obama 's handling of the economic crisis is a lot less pointed than my withering August 2007 " They Know Nothing " meltdown against the previous regime 's handling of the economic crisis .
Then , I advocated a swift slashing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a concomitant policy for potential widespread banking failures that were sure to come because of the Republican administration 's pernicious laissez - faire attitude toward Wall Street .
The answer lies in the way the two administrations handled criticism .
The Bush administration , I believed , simply chose to ignore my warnings , perhaps because of a brutal combination of ideology , fecklessness and complacency .
Publicly , it was easy to ignore a carping Democrat , even as most of my insight came from apolitical people who ran many of the major trading desks and were simply worried about the sure - to - come tsunami spawned by subprime mortgages .
The Bush administration 's endless " fundamentals are sound " observations seemed ridiculous in the face of what most chief executive officers from Main Street companies and all executives of the top investment banks knew to be the case .
Ben Bernanke did n't seem to understand the urgency , perhaps because of his academic background .
Tim Geithner , the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the most important regulator of Wall Street , did n't seem to get the importance of a consistent policy in the face of frightened and confused participants in the capital markets .
Hank Paulson confused me the most .
He ran Goldman Sachs ( Stock Quote : GS ) , for heaven 's sake .
He had to know better , but he did n't .
When Paulson and Geithner wrongly euthanized Lehman Brothers , the consequences pretty much spelled the end of finance as we know it .
Saving Lehman was well within their capacity , even though they refuse to admit it or say it was even a mistake .
The markets have never recovered .
Their hands - off policies ended after Lehman .
Two days later , when worries about moral hazard went out the window , they did a total about - face and began what is now an endless bailout of AIG ( Stock Quote : AIG ) .
Nevertheless , they never questioned their beliefs and therefore never answered to anyone -- Congress , the press or the pundits -- so sure were they that everything was fine and things would work out well in the end .
President Obama 's team , unlike Bush 's team , demonstrates a thinness of skin that shocks me .
When I somewhat obviously and empirically judged that the populist Obama administration is exacerbating the crisis with its budget and policies , as evidenced by the incredible decline in the averages since his inauguration , I was met immediately with condescension and ridicule rather than constructive debate or even just benign dismissal .
I said to myself , " What the heck ?
Are they really that blind to the Great Wealth Destruction they are causing with their decisions to demonize the bankers , raise taxes for the wealthy , advocate draconian cap - and - trade policies and upend the health care system ?
Do they really believe that only the rich own stocks ?
What do they think we have our retirement accounts in , CDs ?
Where did they think that the money saved for college went , our mattresses ?
Do they think the great middle class banks at the First National Bank of Sealy and only the wealthiest traffic in the Standard & Poor 's 500 ? "
They exacerbated their insensitivity when President Obama proclaimed that he was n't worried about the averages , dismissing them as traffic polls that go up and down in the short term .
Ah , if only they went up occasionally and not down endlessly then I would believe the President 's logic .
Do n't get me wrong , Obama was dealt a terrible hand by the previous croupier .
But this administration 's handling of the banking crisis , something that has brought Citigroup ( Stock Quote : C ) , Bank of America ( Stock Quote : BAC ) , Wells Fargo ( Stock Quote : WFC ) and even JPMorgan Chase ( Stock Quote : JPM ) to their knees , has been devastating .
The indecision of Geithner , who has floated to the media every single idea in his head , only to announce none orally , has created a vacuum that has allowed short - sellers to dictate policy .
As someone who just wants to help people preserve capital and help it appreciate when the time comes when it is not too risky to do so , I am appalled at the attack and badly want to engage in the issues and tone down the rhetoric .
What 's the point ?
The country 's in crisis .
We need to stop the lurching nationalization of banks , something that 's come about because the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have not been able to regain control of the banking system from the short - sellers who seek to wipe out the common equity and " win " by placing all banks in receivership .
The pundits wo n't engage in the merits of , say , favoring Tier 1 capital for the banks vs. common equity , or forbearing on the banks to work the situation out over time because the banks can be profitable if we have some patience .
They just attack me .
Take Frank Rich and Jon Stewart .
Both seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed , even though I was saying that I thought it could be worthless as soon as the following week .
I did tell an emailer that his deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe , but through a clever sound bite , Stewart , and subsequently Rich -- neither of whom have bothered to listen to the context of the pulled quote -- pass off the notion of account safety as an out - and - out buy recommendation .
The absurdity astounds me .
If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup , I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless , but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency .
Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear .
The fact that I was right rankles me even more .
I never said the same thing about Lehman , where your accounts were n't safe .
I expect a skewering from the comedian Stewart .
I was shocked , however , that the rigorous Rich would n't investigate further and relied on the show 's truncation of the truth .
After all , how many times were the pull quotes from reviews by Rich used against him when he may have been panning a play in his former role as entertainment critic ?
Rich also chastises me for endorsing Wachovia 's stock after then - CEO Bob Steel came on Mad Money and spoke positively about the bank .
Was I taken in ?
Yes , and I made a mistake .
I apologized both on Mad Money and on the Today Show for believing in Steel .
But others say I have been too hard on myself given that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Steel 's appearance on my show for truthfulness .
I chalk it up to something different : Sometimes you just get had .
After the White House briefing , Rush Limbaugh defended me as a wayward leftist who has seen the light .
I am always glad to have any allies and defenders , but I do favor almost all of Obama 's agenda , right down to having the rich pay more of their freight in this great country .
It 's just not the right time .
We need to declare a war on unemployment and solve it before we let it get out of hand .
We need to stop house - price depreciation .
Neither the pork - laden stimulus plan nor the confusing mortgage proposal put forward by Obama will defeat either enemy .
When Obama trounces both unemployment and house - price depreciation , he will have the power to enact anything he wants .
But all the initiatives he wants to rush , like tax hikes , changes in health care , tinkering with the mortgage deduction -- good grief , right now in the midst of the worst housing downturn ever -- and the tough cap - and - trade rules , will derail any chance we have of turning this economy around .
Instead , they put the Second Great Depression smack on the nation 's table .
The markets thought he could stop it ; hence the giant relief rally when he was elected .
But in fewer than 50 days of his ascendancy , the markets ' hopes were totally dashed and the averages are now forecasting the worst decline since the Great Depression .
As someone who listens to what the averages are screaming , I think they are accurately predicting the future .
I welcome any serious exchange with the administration on the issues that are not beyond my ken : fixing house price depreciation , stopping the destruction of wealth as demonstrated by the stock market 's plunge , and solving the banking crisis before we nationalize every bank .
( Oh , and memo to Bill Maher : Stop insulting my faux great - great - uncle Vlad Lenin .
I am using him to dramatize the point of a failed nationalization and confiscation of the banks at the hands of the people .
It is funny how the right is certainly very civil as my old friends and new allies as of last week , Fred Barnes and Sean Hannity , do n't hold my left wing social view against me when they talk about my criticism of the president !
I always love anyone from Fox on the team because they are fierce in their defense with much less gratuitous slamming . )
It 's time to get serious .
It 's time to take the issue from the pundits and from the left and right , and put it where it belongs : serious non-ideological debate to put out the real firestorm , the collapse of the economy from Wall Street to Main Street and the ensuing Great Wealth Destruction for all .
But if it stays ad hominem , we will all be betrayed and the train wreck will become inevitable .
The next time an overnight snow begins to fall , take two bricks and place them side by side a few inches apart in your yard .
In the morning , the bricks will be covered with snow and barely discernible .
The snowflakes will have filled every vacant space between and around the bricks .
What you will see , says Ivan Biaggio , resembles a phenomenon that , when it occurs at the smallest of scales on an integrated optical circuit , could hasten the day when the Internet works at superfast speeds .
Biaggio , an associate professor of physics at Lehigh University , is part of an international team of researchers that has developed an organic material with an unprecedented combination of high optical quality and strong ability to mediate light - light interaction and has engineered the integration of this material with silicon technology so it can be used in optical telecommunication devices .
A description of this material was published on online in the journal Nature Photonics on March 15 .
The material , which is composed of small organic molecules with high nonlinear optical susceptibilities , mimics the behavior of the snowflakes covering the bricks when it is deposited into the slot , or gap , that separate silicon waveguides that control the propagation of light beams on an integrated optical circuit .
Just as the snowflakes , being tiny and mobile , fill every empty space between the two bricks , Biaggio says , the molecules completely and homogeneously fill the slot between the waveguides .
The slots measure only tens of nanometers wide ; 1 nm is one one - billionth of a meter , or about the width of a dozen carbon atoms .
“ We have been able to make thin films by combining the molecules into a material that is perfectly transparent , flat , and free of any irregularities that would affect optical properties , ” says Biaggio .
The slot between the waveguides is the region where most of the light guided by the silicon propagates .
By filling the slot , say Biaggio and his collaborators , the molecules add an ultra - fast all - optical switching capability to silicon circuitry , creating a new ability to perform the light - to - light interactions necessary for data processing in all - optical networks .
The nanophotonic device obtained in this way , says the group , has demonstrated the best all - optical demultiplexing rate yet recorded for a silicon - organic - hybrid device .
Multiplexing is the process by which multiple signals or data streams are combined and transmitted on a single channel , thus saving expensive bandwidth .
Demultiplexing is the reverse process .
In tests , the novel hybrid device was able to extract every fourth bit of a 170 - gigabit - per- second telecommunications data stream and to demultiplex the stream to 42.7 gigabits per second .
Biaggio ’s group is part of an international collaboration that includes scientists from the Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany , the Photonics Research Group at Ghent University in Belgium , and the Laboratory for Organic Chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) in Zurich .
Biaggio is affiliated with Lehigh ’s Center for Optical Technologies ( COT ) .
Another group member , Bweh Esembeson , earned a Ph.D. in physics from Lehigh earlier this year and is now an applications engineer with Thorlabs Inc. in New Jersey .
The silicon - organic - hybrid device and its breakthrough properties were presented for the first time as a postdeadline contribution at a meeting of the optical telecom industry last spring and at several other scientific conferences , and Biaggio ’s group published an article titled “ A High - optical Quality Supramolecular Assembly for Third - order Integrated Nonlinear Optics ” in the October 2008 issue of Advanced Materials .
A nonlinear optical answer to bandwidth demand
As Internet users demand greater bandwidth for ever faster communications , scientists and engineers are working to increase the speed at which information can be transmitted and routed along a network .
They are hoping to achieve a major leap in velocity by designing circuits that rely solely on light - waves process data .
At present , data must be converted back and forth from optical signals to electrical signals for managing its progress within the optical telecommunication network .
This limits the flexibility and the speed of optical telecommunication .
All - optical circuits , experts say , could unleash the full potential of optical telecommunication and data processing .
All - optical circuits require nonlinear optical materials with good optical quality .
A nonlinear optical response occurs in a material when the intensity of light alters the properties of the material through which light is passing , affecting , in turn , the manner in which the light propagates .
Biaggio ’s group is working with a small organic molecule called DDMEBT that possesses one of the strongest nonlinear optical responses yet observed when compared to its relatively small size .
The molecule can condense from the vapor phase into a bulk material .
The high , off - resonant bulk nonlinearity and large - scale homogeneity of this material , says Esembeson , represent a unique combination not often found in an organic material .
“ Between high optical nonlinearity in a molecule and ability to actually fabricate a bulk plastic with excellent optical quality , there is always a compromise , ” he says .
The DDMEBT bulk material possesses 1,000 times the nonlinearity of silica glass .
This organic material , however , is difficult to flexibly structure into nanoscale waveguides or other optical circuitry .
Silicon , on the other hand , is structurally suited to the dense integration of components on photonic circuit devices .
And silicon technology is mature and precise .
It enables the creation of waveguides whose nanoscale flatness facilitates the control of light propagation .
“ With pure silicon , ” says Biaggio , “ you can build waveguides that enable you to control light beam propagation , but you can not get ultrafast light - to - light interaction .
Using only silicon , people have achieved a data switching rate of only 20 to 30 gigabits per second , and this is very slow .
“ We need higher - speed switching to achieve a higher bit rate .
Organic materials can do this , but they are not terribly good for building waveguides that control propagation of tightly confined light beams . ”
To combine the strengths of the DDMEBT and the silicon , Biaggio and his collaborators have fashioned silicon - organic hybrid ( SOH ) waveguides where silicon waveguides are covered with DDMEBT .
“ We have combined the two approaches , ” he says .
“ We start from a silicon waveguide designed to guide the light between two silicon ridges .
Then we use molecular beam deposition to fill the space between the ridges with the organic material [ DDMEBT ] , creating a dense plastic with high optical quality and high nonlinearity where the light propagates .
“ We combine the best of both technologies . ”
One of the group ’s singular achievements , he says , is the filling - in process .
“ The key question was whether we could put the DDMEBT between the two silicon strips .
There is a lot of research in this area , but no one had been able to make an organic material completely and homogeneously cover such a silicon structure , so that it spreads out and fills all the spaces .
Homogeneity is necessary to prevent light scattering and losses .
We now achieved this by using a molecular structure that decreases inter-molecular interactions and promotes the formation of a homogeneous solid state .
We then heated the molecules to a vapor phase and used a molecular beam to deposit the molecules on top of the silicon structure .
The molecules were able to homogeneously fill the nanometer scale slot between the silicon ridges and to cover the whole structure we needed to cover .
“ Our collaborators in Karlsruhe , who have state - of - the - art equipment for characterizing optical communications systems , were able to reliably switch individual bits out of a 170 gigabits per second data stream , which is impressive , but the organic material would be able to support even faster data rates ”
The researchers summed up their achievements in one of their forthcoming articles : “ To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that nonlinear SOH [ silicon - organic hybrid ] slot waveguides were used in high - speed optical communication systems .
We believe that there is still a large potential for improving the conversion efficiency and the signal quality . ”

A British Muslim man accused of raising funds for terrorism was punched , kicked and strangled during his arrest by specialist officers from the Metropolitan police , the high court in London heard today .
The court was told that Babar Ahmad , who is suing the police , was dragged from his bed and rammed against a window before being repeatedly beaten by officers dressed in riot gear during his arrest in December 2003 .
During what his counsel Phillippa Kaufmann described as a " prolonged and violent series of gratuitous assaults " the 34 - year - old IT support analyst claims officers forced him into the Muslim prayer position before shouting " Where is your God now ? … Pray to him . "
Kaufmann said : " The acts of the officers were ones of gross brutality , intended to humiliate and debase the claimant and to make him fear for his life .
The officers engaged over a prolonged period in extreme , sadistic and dangerous acts of violence against an individual who was completely restrained and vulnerable .
" This was an extremely serious abuse of power which is in no sense justified , nor was it excusable on the grounds that it was perpetrated in the heat of an arrest for terrorism . "
The Metropolitan police deny the claims and say that officers used reasonable force during the arrest at Ahmad 's home in Tooting , south - west London .
The court heard that the Met specifically denies that Ahmad was punched , controlled with handcuffs , stamped on or put in a dangerous neck hold .
Ahmad has been in detention since he was rearrested in 2004 following a request from the US government over claims that he had helped raise money to fund terrorist campaigns .
Kaufmann said no evidence had been produced against Ahmad and he had never been charged with any offence .
Ahmad , who listened to proceedings via a video link , is awaiting a decision on whether his extradition to the US would contravene the European convention on human rights .
Before the raid in December 2003 , officers were told Ahmad , then working as an IT analyst at Imperial College in London , was " potentially a very dangerous man " who was believed to have been trained in terrorist camps .
During the briefing , detectives compared him to Kamel Bourgass , who stabbed an anti-terror squad officer to death during a raid on a house in Manchester .
Officers were told to use a strategy called " deck and dominate " during the arrest .
Kaufmann said that Ahmad adopted a " passive position " with his hands above his head as soon as the police entered the house .
" Between five and six officers then began to strike him all over his body .
At some point , he asked them to stop but that had no effect , " she said .
" At another point , one officer grabbed his testicles and pulled them hard , causing him immense pain . "
She said Ahmad was then thrown to the floor and dragged around by his handcuffs .
" The use of handcuffs was known by the officer to cause excruciating pain and one or more officers deliberately , repeatedly and sadistically used them for no reason other than to hurt the claimant , " said Kaufmann .
She said that after being forced into the prayer position , Ahmad was bundled into the back of a police van where , she said , officers continued to punch and stamp on him before he was put in a neck hold .
" The neck hold is an extremely dangerous hold , as the officer would well have known , " said Kaufmann .
" It can only have been intended to cause the claimant to experience a state of utter terror , at the thought he was about to die . "
Kaufmann said Ahmad first made his claims against the police the day after his arrest in 2003 .
A subsequent inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission cleared the Met of any wrongdoing .
Ahmad is due to give evidence at the high court on Wednesday .
Vath Automobiltechnik launched their latest tuning package for the new Mercedes C Class .
The Vath Mercedes C Class has a slightly modified body kit with better aerodynamics and comes with improved performance .
The guys from Vath reprogrammed the engine cooling unit with a V18K Compressor kit the engine delivers 215 HP , 29 HP more than the stock version .
With these small improvements the car ’s top speed is a bit higher and now this Mercedes could reach 240 km /h .
The price for the performance kit from Vath is just 1,773.10 Euros .
VATH also offer new sport springs that lower the car ’s height by 45 mm at the front axle and 35 mm at the rear axle and new wheels .
The body kit that was created for this car includes a new front bumper , radiator grille , a rear spoiler and a stainless steel exhaust system .
Last December , I spoke to the nonpartisan Jamestown Foundation ’s annual conference on al - Qaeda .
My talk was a worldwide survey of how America ’s war against Islamism had gone in 2008 ; an analysis of al - Qaeda ’s current fortunes and growth potential ; and an assessment of whether U.S. policies were adequately protecting genuine U.S. national interests as the Obama administration began .
I concluded that 2008 was a year of setbacks for America , and that the future appeared rather bleak .
For the speech , I took as my text a truncated version of the introduction I wrote for the paperback edition of my book , Marching Toward Hell : America and Islam After Iraq .
In preparing the new text I was pleased to find my predictions in the hardcover had been accurate , but saddened that Americans had not faced the fact that our Islamist foes are motivated by U.S. foreign policies and their impact .
One policy I am critical of in Marching Toward Hell is the nature of the U.S. - Israel relationship .
I argued that unqualified , bipartisan support for Israel damages U.S. national security , and I damned those who identify critics of the relationship as anti-American , anti-Semitic , or , in my case , according to AIPAC leader Morris J. Amitay , a man who would make Mein Kampf " required reading " at the CIA .
In the course of analyzing 2008 events , I found no reason to alter my view .
And after hearing McCain and Obama during the campaign , there was no reason to expect change in Washington ’s Israel policy .
At the Jamestown Conference , I therefore first discussed the abject failure of President Bush and his advisers to recognize that al - Qaeda and its allies are waging war because of U.S. policies  one of which is Israel policy  and not because of our lifestyle and domestic politics .
I next offered an estimate of Mr. Obama ’s potential to change these terrorism - motivating policies .
While admitting an inability to read Obama ’s mind , I noted that he had given at least two strong hints  to Americans and the Muslim world  that he would be as pro-Israel as Mr. Bush .
I noted that ( a ) Mr. Obama spent the last months of the presidential campaign " dancing the Tel Aviv two - step , " promising to protect Israel as if it were located inside the United States ; and ( b ) Obama appointed Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff , a U.S. citizen who during the 1991 Gulf War left America to serve in Israel ’s military .
These statements of fact suggested to me that U.S. policy toward Israel and the Muslim world would be identical to Mr. Bush ’s , albeit couched in softer , come - let - us - reason - together rhetoric .
My speech seemed well received , but in January I received a call from Jamestown ’s president telling me I had been terminated as a senior fellow by the Foundation ’s board of directors .
Why , I asked ?
He responded by citing my comments about Obama doing the " Tel Aviv two - step " and my description of Emanuel ’s record , both of which he said might be in a speech by Rep. Ron Paul .
My remarks about Emanuel apparently sparked particular anger among the Foundation ’s directors , as Jamestown ’s president referred to them at least three times in a short telephone conversation .
In any event , the president said several major financial donors to Jamestown threatened to withdraw funding if I remained a senior fellow , so I was getting the boot .
Then he added that my every - other - week essays for Jamestown ’s Terrorism Focus had attracted readers and praise for the Foundation , so the directors said I could keep writing for the journal .
I declined this honor , which seemingly was a bribe made in the hope that I would not speak publicly about being terminated as a senior fellow for saying the current state of the U.S. - Israel relationship undermined U.S. national security .
I regret leaving Jamestown , as I have great respect for its analysis on several vital U.S. security issues .
But at the same time , I am grateful to the Foundation ’s directors for terminating me .
In the hardcover of Marching Toward Hell , I condemned the U.S. - Israel relationship and those who take it " upon themselves to decide who is and who is not a ‘ good American , ’ " based on his or her views of U.S. - Israel relations , and " then mete out punishment to those of their countrymen who do not make the grade . "
At the time , my view was based on what pro-Israel U.S. citizens had done to Pat Buchanan , President Carter , and Professors Walt and Mearsheimer .
Now , however , I have the personal experience of losing both position and income for condemning Washington ’s status quo Israel policy as a threat to U.S. national security .
The introduction to my paperback , therefore , can be said to be credibly written by an author with firsthand knowledge of how the Israel Lobby works .
After my experience with the " nonpartisan " board of directors at Jamestown , I can only say of them what FDR said of his domestic foes : " They are unanimous in their hatred for me  and I welcome their hatred . "
Rebecca Adlington clinched two golds and a world record in the LZR suit World swimming governing body Fina has once again moved to limit the impact of the controversial hi-tech swimsuits .
Swimmers will no longer be able to wear anything under their costumes after Therese Alshammar had a world record erased for wearing two swimsuits .
An extra suit can help swimmers compress their body and trap air , which provides greater buoyancy in the pool .
There were 105 world records broken last year , 79 of them by swimmers wearing one suit , the Speedo LZR Racer .
Alshammer , who improved her own record in the 50 m butterfly in Sydney , is the first swimmer to lose a world record under the new rules .
The Swede said she believed she was allowed to wear a ' modesty suit ' under her skin - tight racing gear .
But Fina executive director Cornel Marculescu said : " Nothing must be worn underneath .
One suit only , that 's it . "
606 : DEBATE
Officials at the Australian Swimming Championships had said women were allowed to wear bikini bottoms for modesty purposes at the event but not a full suit and any world records set would not stand if they used them .
Following a recent three - day meeting in Dubai , Fina also stipulated swimsuits should not cover the neck and must not extend past the shoulders and ankles .
The changes , which will be in place for July 's World Championships , also limit the thickness and buoyancy of the suits .
" Fina wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete , " read a statement from swimming 's world governing body .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The first swimsuit to combine stitch - free , ultrasonically welded seams , water - resistant fabric and strategically placed polyurethane panels ( designed by Nasa ) , the LZR took the swimming world by storm last year .
At the Olympics in Beijing , LZR swimmers , most notably American Michael Phelps , won 94 % of the golds on offer and broke 23 of the 25 records set in the Cube .
But opponents of the hi-tech suits argue the buoyancy they create amounts to " technological doping " .
Fina also intends to limit the use of non-permeable materials in the suits .
Suits to be used from 1 January 2010 will have to be put in for approval by 1 November .
And future submissions will have to be made 12 months in advance of a World Championship or an Olympic Games , with the approved models to be available at least six months prior to the events .
Fina will also publish a list of approved models and these will be used in competitions starting 1 January 2010 .

According to research , those who download ' free ' music are also the industry 's largest audience for digital sales
Piracy may be the bane of the music industry but according to a new study , it may also be its engine .
A report from the BI Norwegian School of Management has found that those who download music illegally are also 10 times more likely to pay for songs than those who do n't .
Everybody knows that music sales have continued to fall in recent years , and that filesharing is usually blamed .
We are made to imagine legions of internet criminals , their fingers on track - pads , downloading songs via BitTorrent and never paying for anything .
One of the only bits of good news amid this doom and gloom is the steady rise in digital music sales .
Millions of internet do - gooders , their fingers on track - pads , who pay for songs they like – purchasing them from Amazon or iTunes Music Store .
And yet according to Professor Anne- Britt Gran 's new research , these two groups may be the same .
The Norwegian study looked at almost 2,000 online music users , all over the age of 15 .
Researchers found that those who downloaded " free " music – whether from lawful or seedy sources – were also 10 times more likely to pay for music .
This would make music pirates the industry 's largest audience for digital sales .
Wisely , the study did not rely on music pirates ' honesty .
Researchers asked music buyers to prove that they had proof of purchase .
The paper 's conclusions emerge just as Sweden 's Pirate Bay trial comes to a close .
Pirate Bay 's four defendants , who helped operate the notorious BitTorrent tracker , were sentenced to a year in jail and fined 30 m SEK ( £ 2,500,000 ) in damages .
Putin 's poster girl : Pin-up politician who hates the West ... but loves Thatcher
Blonde ambition : Maria Sergeyeva , who dreams of leading Russia , ' finds adventures ' while drunk and wearing nothing but a Cuban flag
At only 24 she is already tipped to become a minister , and perhaps achieve her goal of ruling Russia .
Happy to exploit her glamorous looks , Maria Sergeyeva has emerged seemingly from nowhere to become a leading propagandist for her hero , Vladimir Putin , her country 's ' Iron Man ' Prime Minister .
Critics , who have dubbed her ' Putin 's pin-up ' , say that she is being used by the former KGB leader to target the young and to whip up jingoism and loathing of the West as Russia stares into the abyss of an economic crisis .
' Maria is a potent combination , ' says a supporter in Putin 's party , United Russia .
' She can sway crowds with her passion , her looks and her punchy style , but she also reaches out via her blogs and webcasts to places that normal politics fails to go . '
She is a leading light of the Young Guards , a youthful and growing band of zealots dedicated to resisting any efforts to stop Putin 's inexorable Russian revolution .
The Young Guards are close ideological cousins of Nashi , the controversial government - funded ' youth movement ' that led a six - month campaign of intimidation against former British Ambassador Sir Anthony Brenton in 2006 after he attended a conference held by critics of the Kremlin .
Both organisations were engineered to mimic Soviet - era youth organisations , such as the Young Communists , with the purpose of boosting ' patriotism ' in support of the ruling elite .
But the Young Guards , though currently smaller than Nashi , have become more influential by harnessing the power of the internet to spread their message .
They recently raised their profile by highlighting the ' immigration crisis ' and helping police to identify illegal immigrants .
With more than 100,000 members , many see membership as essential to their career development .
Although Sergeyeva claims that she holds no official position in the Young Guards , she is suddenly ubiquitous in Russian society - writing newspaper articles , attending political rallies ( which , unlike so many others , do n't get banned ) and pontificating via the internet .
One recent speech that was made available online had 140,000 hits , crashing the political website hosting it .
Her nationalist rhetoric is blunt , if not outright incendiary .
At a time when racist attacks in her country are at unprecedented levels , she recently told immigrants to leave .
' They grab our work , ' she said .
' Immigrants should work in places where Russians do n't want to , or they should go back home . '
She went on the offensive against former chess champion Garry Kasparov , one of Putin 's few critics , saying he ' sold himself to American spies ' .
Another opponent , writer Eduard Limonov , was dismissed as having ' the face of someone who is psychologically abnormal ' .
She declared : ' I personally consider them my enemies .
They cast doubt on things that are very important to me : the integrity of Russia and its sovereignty . '
Of a prominent radio talk - show host , another opponent of Putin , she said : ' I 'm not saying that Yulia Latynina is ugly .
I 'm saying that if a person experiences a lot of negative emotions , that negativity is reflected in her face . '
Boasting that she wears almost exclusively Russian - made clothes rather than Western designer labels - she has a fondness for pink bikinis - Sergeyeva urges drivers to follow her example by shunning foreign cars .
She is critical of the West , especially America , seeing the world through the same prism as her leader .
' Only the United States is our real competitor , ' she says .
' When they provoked war in Georgia and revolution in Ukraine , I was so angry . '
When it comes to Russia 's latest crippling financial crisis , she believes that only Putin and his ally President Dmitry Medvedev can save her country .
Despite all her anti-Western rhetoric , Sergeyeva idolises Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill - she carries a book of his quotations in her handbag .
Rallying point : Maria at a protest
' I love Thatcher and Churchill because they are self - made leaders , ' she says .
' I think Thatcher and I have some similarities .
I do n't like how my voice sounds when I am making speeches and I have read that Thatcher corrected her vocal cords to make her voice sound better - I may do the same .
She worked hard .
She is a good example for me .'
Yet , unlike her heroine , it appears that this lady is for turning .
Three years ago , Sergeyeva was a proud opponent of Putin and his party .
She was a prominent activist in the tiny Democratic Party , a group that wanted Russia to join the European Union .
Her most effective protest was a demonstration mocking Russia 's rulers as robots and androids .
The circumstances of her sudden conversion to these robots are disputed .
It certainly involved recruitment by a close friend who was already in the Guards , prompting some to suggest she 'd been planted in an opposition party as a spy before coming ' home ' .
Others believe Putin 's cronies simply recognised her potential and recruited her on a hefty salary , a claim she denies .
Whatever the truth , she now lives and breathes pro-Putin politics .
According to her internet postings , one of her current assignments is to promote training sessions for loyalist bloggers - under the acronym KGB .
Kursy Gosudarstvennykh Bloggerov stands for Courses For State Bloggers , and its purpose appears to be to teach loyal cyber - warriors how to hack into opposition blogs and find the addresses and telephone numbers of those behind them - all apparently sponsored by the Russian taxpayer .
In return , the loyal bloggers are given a membership card , Putin 's book on ideology , a CD of Medvedev 's video blog and their own badges and uniforms .
U-turn : Sergeyeva switched to supporting Vladimir Putin , above , after being a staunch opponent
However , Sergeyeva also expresses her feelings and frustrations online , a rarity for a Russian politician .
At times her blog veers off into Bridget Jones territory as she reveals her irritations with men .
' My friend Anya got married this summer , I was maid of honour at her wedding and even caught the bride 's bouquet , ' she writes in one entry .
' Now I am the only one who 's left single among my girlfriends .
The rest are married .
I have only cats . '
She laments the fact that men ' do n't understand what 's wrong in wanting to have sex with someone else ...
I 've never seen someone who did n't cheat on his partner for three years in a row .
Maybe they exist ?'
One picture shows her looking the worse for wear .
' I 'm at a conference .
Drunk - and after the banya [ sauna ] .
It 's 3 am .
A plastic glass with champagne in one hand and single malt whisky , 12 years old , in the other .
So I drink champagne after whisky .
And wearing nothing but stockings and flag of Cuba .
This is my way of finding adventures . '
When pressed , Sergeyeva admits there is an older man in her life .
' I have a sort of relationship .
I think it 's real love .
I have loved this man for two years - he 's a bit older than me and not in my party .
' I am not encouraging him to come to United Russia .
I do n't think it 's a woman 's business to teach her man what to do . '
Insiders believe she has a long political career ahead of her .
' It 's likely that she 'll be very successful , ' predicts politician Robert Schlegel , himself a former Nashi member .
She is tipped to join Schlegel soon in the Russian parliament .
Sergeyeva , the great - granddaughter of a Stalinist NKVD secret service officer who died in the siege of Leningrad , has come a long way since being expelled ' for laziness ' from an elite Moscow academy .
' I was very fat and had no friends , ' she has said .
' We lived very poorly - I had no toys either .
With that kind of despair , I read and pondered a lot . '
Her mother , Lyudmila , is a 55 - yearold retired government employee , while her father , Vladimir , 52 , is a retired cold - storage worker .
By the time Maria reached the age of 13 , ' nature started making me taller and slimmer .
. .
So from tubshaped tearaway with a boy 's haircut , I turned into something indecent .
People thought , " THIS is a glamorous blonde . "
I try not to argue or disappoint them . '
Although she collects guns and is a proficient markswoman , she insists : ' I am not so violent .
I also love dancing .
I love the Hustle , Arabic dance and Latina . '
But politics will always come first .
' I would like one day to become President or at least Prime Minister , ' she says .
' I do n't think Russia is ready for a female president .
On the other hand , in 20 years ' time , when I am 44 , this may change and it will be the right time for my presidency . '
In the meantime , she proudly recalls the achievements of another of her role models , on whom history 's verdict is somewhat equivocal .
' I adore Catherine the Great , ' she says .
' Now she was a great leader . '

Explanation : Small asteroid 2008 TC3 fell to Earth at dawn on October 7 , 2008 , tracking through the skies over the Nubian Desert in northern Sudan .
That event was remarkable because it was the first time an asteroid was detected in space before crashing into planet Earth 's atmosphere .
It was generally assumed the asteroid itself had completely disintegrated to dust .
But , based on satellite and ground observations of the atmospheric impact event , Dr. Mauwia Shaddad of the University of Khartoum , aided by Dr. Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center , led an expedition of students and staff to the area , combing the desert for surviving fragments .
On December 6 , 2008 , two hours after their search began , the first meteorite was found .
The team ultimately collected some 280 small meteorites , now called Almahata Sitta , with a total mass of about 5 kilograms -- the first material recovered from a known asteroid .
In stark contrast to the lighter - colored stones , the black fragment in the picture is Almahata Sitta meteorite number 15 .
About 4 centimeters in diameter , it is seen as it came to rest on the desert floor .
Editor 's note :
In Arabic , Almahata Sitta is " Station Six " : a railway stop in the Nubian desert where witnesses reported seeing the bright fireball meteor .

The current benchmarks can highlight weak spots in libraries and compilers that need improving .
Some things noticed included :
hashtable performance is poor .
A simple binding to a basic C hashtable would be very useful
it would be nice to have tre regexes in the core libs ( instead of POSIX ones )
Why tre regexes ?
The libtre code is buggy , though if the shootout avoids the bugs then I guess one might want to use it .
Would libpcre be a better choice ?-- ChrisKuklewicz 00:21 , 24 February 2009 ( UTC )

Carbonite Han Solo is awesome , right ?
So ... If we use logic here , that means that when Han Solo is encased in carbonite , that makes the carbonite awesome as well !
Just in case you did n’t know , in the Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes back , the character of Han Solo is frozen in Pure Awesome in order to be displayed as a trophy by his captor .
Mithril Another famous fictional metal largely popularised in J. R. R. Tolkien ’s Middle - earth fantasy writings , the metal was said to have been mined by the Dwarves in the mines of Moria .
Mithril was expensive before the Balrog was released and destroyed the only supply of mithril , but afterwards , it was rendered priceless .
Its properties not only included looking similar to silver and being pleasing to look at , but it was nigh - on impervious , being the strongest of metals available and able to stop spears and arrows from piercing it .
Pretty awesome .
Request to not approve Bill H.R. 875 now in House Committees .
Four issues after reading HR875 : 1 ) Redundant , expensive , government activity 2 ) Redundant regulations of Federal , state and local regulations already in place 3 ) Yet another way legislation set up that can be used to drive out small farms and give more unfair advantages to large Corporate Farms .
Legislation that in the future will have indirect and direct control over another fundamental aspect of our daily lives .
4 ) Pushing our country as having the right to police , and impose themselves into other countries .
There are international organizations already established for the U.S. to work within to address agricultural and food processing issues on a global scale .
There are Federal , State and local Agencies already established that are suppose to be doing what is stated in this bill .
However , this bill is so broad and vague enough that it could be used to get a strangle hold on our whole food supply chain , from anyone growing or raising anything that can be classified as food , distributors , to the grocery store , to any eating establishment and then to top it off , the right to go , physically , into any country and police them as well .
The responsibility is to the American people , our wishes and best interest within our own country without nicking away at our freedoms .
Instead of yet another Agency and redundant regulations , improve the USDA , FDA , Federal Department of Health and Human Services , Center for Disease Control and Prevention , the EPA and Import Inspectors , these are the jobs they are already suppose to be doing .
Participate more actively in the World Health Organization 's Food Safety Department and / or the 4 other international organizations .

H.R. 875 , good intentions maybe .
Will it affect every citizen and cost every citizen ?
Yes , absolutely , because it will increase the cost of food , which has already sky rocketed and very likely limit the choice of available foods .
It will be paid for , same as all government agencies , by the taxpayers of course .
If you grow plants or are buying seeds , you will be affected because somewhere within the process the Federal government will have had control of the process .
Vegetable seeds are considered ' food ' by our government .
The saving / storing / banking of seeds is ' processing ' which will fall under the purview of the new laws .
You may find next year you can no longer get those favorite Heirloom Tomato seeds you love because some Federal Agent did n't approve of the collection process or the small grower did n't have the fees or forgot to register with this new agency or the seeds come from Canada and Canadian seeds have been ban .
Too much of a very slippery slop to give one Federal Agency so much control over our food supply chain , especially when there are already Federal , state and local agency that are suppose to ensure food is safe for consumption .
Please understand all the ramifications .
We need to ask what if the new agency goes to the extreme , if and how the regulations can be used abusively and do they take yet another part of our freedoms under the calls of being for our own good and safety .
We want our food products to be safe but not at the expense of giving up our responsibilities or freedom of choice .
Help us stay informed so we can make our own choices .
We want to have little Kitchen Gardens , local Farmers Markets , and Organic Foods without worrying if a Federal Agency is going require we are Federal Registered and pay fees we cannot afford and more taxes we cannot afford either .
Support the small farmer and encourage more of them .
This country , not so long ago , could feed the world 3 times over , all grown on family farms .
The bigger problems are coming from % u201CCorporate Farms % u201D .
We now are importing more and more food .
Why ?
Make the USDA , FDA , FDHHS , CDC , EPA and Import Inspectors do their jobs , as the current laws and regulations require them .
If these agencies are not or cannot do their jobs improve and modernize them .
Do not create another Federal Agency with such broad and vague power over our food supply chain .
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this petition .
We know it is only one of many being reviewed in committee but our hopes are with you to hear and know the voice of the citizens .
When the Iraqi journalist , Muntazar al - Zaidi , hurled his shoes at the then - US president , George Bush , in December , Iranian officials declared him a hero and hailed his gesture as a mark of Islamic courage .
They were presumably less impressed this week when Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was similarly targeted during a visit to the north - western city of Urumiye .
Ahmadinejad found the shoe on the other foot as he waved to the crowd from an open - top car on his way to give a speech at a local stadium .
An Iranian website , Urumiye News , reported that a shoe was hurled at the president as his convoy drove through a central square .
Security guards waded into the crowds but failed to find the culprit .
A hat was also thrown in Ahmadinejad 's direction before his car sped away .
The event went unreported on mainstream Iranian news outlets but has been hotly discussed on the country 's highly active blogosphere .
Some pro-Ahmadinejad bloggers have dismissed the reports as rumours spread by " royalists " and " counter - revolutionaries " .
However , Ahmadinejad has been on the receiving end of flying footwear before .
A shoe was thrown at him during a students ' demonstration at Tehran 's Amir Kabir university in December 2006 .
Urumiye News said the latest protest came when a disturbance broke out after a vehicle in the presidential convoy struck an elderly man who walked onto the road to try and hand Ahmadinejad a letter .
People became angry when the driver failed to stop to attend to the injured man .
Eventually an ambulance in the motorcade was forced to take him to hospital after jeering crowds blocked its path .
Ahmadinejad travels frequently to Iran 's provinces in a bid to boost his popularity .
He commonly receives large numbers of letters requesting financial assistance and other help during such trips .
After Zaidi's protest in Baghdad , Iranian officials paid tribute by holding several public shoe - throwing competitions in which contestants threw footwear at ­caricatures of Bush .
Iran 's main shoemaking federation also offered to supply a lifetime of shoes to Zaidi , who remains in a Baghdad jail awaiting trial .

INTERVIEW WITH JUDY CARMAN
Judy Carman , Ph.D. is director of the Institute of Health and Environmental Research , Inc. , a non-profit research institute based in Australia focusing on the safety of genetically modified food .
She earned a doctorate degree in medicine from the University of Adelaide in the areas of metabolic regulation , nutritional biochemistry , and cancer .
She has investigated outbreaks of disease for an Australian state government .
Not someone known for rushing into prejudice , one assumes .
Dr Carman says very little safety testing is done on genetically modified foods , and when it is done , it is done in a minimal way by the biotechnology companies .
Dr. Carman says that more extensive testing of GM foods is needed to ensure they are safe .
" We are conducting one the very few long - term , independent animal feeding studies with GM foods .
To date , most of these types of studies have been done by biotechnology companies or scientists associated with biotechnology companies .
Of the few independent studies being done , a study by the Austrian government recently made public found reduced fertility in mice fed GM corn .
Another recent study done in Italy showed immune system problems in mice fed GM corn .
The studies done by biotechnology companies tend to show no health problems associated with eating GM food .
The independent studies are finding adverse effects . "
Ain't that strange .
The biotech companies find no problems but the independent studies do .
How can that be ?
Dr Carman : " It is disturbing that the study showed a gradually worsening effect on mice that ate the GM corn .
I am worried that something similar is happening in humans .
If it is , it could take many years for problems to become apparent , and by then it could be too late to do anything about it . "
Dr Carman : " First , it is very hard to get GM seed to conduct the research .
In order to buy GM seed , you have to go to a licensed seed dealer , and sign a technology licensing agreement , which states that you wo n't do any research on the seed , which includes agronomic , health , and environmental research .
Also , scientists who try to research health impacts of GM food get harassed and intimidated by people with vested interests in GM technology .
I 've had 10 years of abuse from such people who 've defamed me , driven me out of a university , and tried to get me fired from jobs .
With that kind of intimidation , scientists often decide not to do any research .
Vested interests have been trying to find out about research I 'm doing .
They filed a freedom of information request with the Western Australian government to find out .
The government denied their request .
It could have ended up in court .
My research protocol could have been stolen . "
Any other problems ?
Dr Carman : " If you want to do medical research , you have to go to an organization that funds such research .
In order to get funding you need to have a proven track record in that area of research .
However , in a new area of research such as GM food safety , no one has a track record , so it is difficult to get the funding .
It 's a Catch - 22 .
We are thankful that the Western Australian government gave us funding .
The research protocol was sent to 15 scientists worldwide for review and then approved by a steering committee .
I wanted people to know that I was doing a thorough job with this research . "
A question :
If your research finds negative health impacts caused by GM foods , Dr Carman , are you prepared to deal with a negative onslaught from biotech companies ?
Dr Carman : " Yes , I understand that will happen .
I 've been attacked many times .
GM food advocates want to make people who do this type of work frightened of losing their jobs to make them stop working on the issue .
They can't get me fired now .
I work within my own organization , the Institute of Health and Environmental Research , which I established along with others who are committed to finding out if GM foods are safe to eat .
The behaviour of GM food advocates makes me ask , " What are they frightened of ? "
If they believe GM foods are safe , they would be confident that I would not find any problems .
Instead they are paranoid .
What do they know that I do n't know ?
What are they trying to hide ?
It makes me more curious and determined to find out . "
These are extracts from an interview by Ken Roseboro for the Organic Growers Association magazine , Dec08 / Jan09 .

Another important aspect involves knowing the value of your damages and demand accordingly .
Dealing with Adjusters
Adjusters pretend to be sympathetic to you ; however , they are not at all in the real sense .
They have a way of talking to you until you may feel that they are on your side , but this is just to win your trust , and they will end up convincing you to make a statement that may pin you down during the insurance claim process .
While as the best attorneys you can get in Houston , our goal is to win your case !
The adjusters are usually on the alert as they may approach you just after the accident even before you reach out to them .
Try not to fall in their trap as you may easily fall victim , because you may be very confused after the accident .
When you decide to make a statement without consulting a lawyer , you may end up giving information that may be used against you .
This may result in you being denied the settlement you truly deserve .
We advise that you should avoid giving information to the adjuster for instance ,
Giving a brief about what happened Giving information about your injuries Admitting to being the negligent driver Giving out a recorded statement Accepting the first settlement offer
Reviewing Settlement Offers
The insurance companies have strategies , and they are really good at it , especially when dealing with clients who have no clue that they have rights when dealing with insurance claims .
The insurer may rush to offer you a settlement knowing very well it ’s a low settlement deal .
You may be so desperate by the time you accept such an offer ; their timings may be well calculated as this might be the time you are so much in need of the money .
As an accident victim , you may undergo difficult times , especially the fact that you may be away from work hence a lack of income .
This may result in you having no money to settle your medical bills ; hence , the moment you receive an offer from the insurer , you may not think through .
That is why we advise that you reach out to us before making such a decision we would be of great help .
In most cases , insurance companies look into their benefits and give it a priority ; they have a strategy that will have their losses minimized .
The adjuster knows how to convince a victim in a way that the victim may feel so valued by the insurance group ; however , in the real sense , it is of their benefits .
Our attorneys are dedicated to assess the insurance offer and advise you if it is the settlement you deserve .
At the Houston car accident firm , we are well known to be fighters , and we do get what our clients deserve from the insurers .
The insurers are aware of our aggressiveness ; this makes it easy for us during the insurance process .
They know that we are good negotiators , and we are determined to get the highest offer that will cover our client ’s losses .
We are dedicated to working with you through all the steps involved , advice on the matters arising , and , most importantly ensure that your wellbeing is looked into .
All this we do before you pay us , no lawyer will demand payment before the process .
Car Accident Lawsuits ;
Is it worth hiring an attorney for a car accident ?
Insurance companies tend to deny victims covers that may involve long term disabilities .
Our lawyers will work hard and ensure your name in these situations are dismissed , and you receive the proper compensation .
To achieve this , our lawyers will have the insurance company sued on a personal injury case or on your lost wages .
Most victims tend to have a fear of testifying when it comes to a lawsuit .
One may be afraid of going to court from just the sound tithe fear may also be because it ’s their first time filing a lawsuit , which may cause nervousness .
Our attorneys will be able to take you through all the steps to take while filing a lawsuit ; hence you should not be worried .
Because no matter what , we will give our best to win your case for you !
This is what makes us the best !
Starting the Lawsuit
In this case , whereby the victim has decided to take legal action against the insurance company , the lawyer will make a petition having all the accident facts in order .
The lawyer should also ensure that they follow the law in consideration of the matter at hand .
In this case , the victim is the plaintiff , and the insurer is the defendant , while the lawyer is the litigator .
Once the suit has been filed and sent to the defendant , the defendant will , in most cases , hire their own attorney to defend your lawsuit .
The defendant lawyer has about three weeks to give feedback on your petition .
The defendant lawyer may also file an answer to ” general denial ’ .
This is a standard legal answer ; hence you should not be worried .
This means that the defendant wants to be presented with the evidence of your liability claims .
Our attorney will be well prepared when it comes to responding to such issues .
The Discovery Phase
This is a phrase with strict rules and procedures , and both parties are required to follow the rules .
We get to this phase if the court fails to dismiss the case .
The court is presented with motions and answers ; from this , it will decide whether to continue or dismiss the case .
At this stage , the lawyers have a hectic work as they will go deep into the investigation to gather evidence .
Both lawyers will have to be in possession of evidence supporting their claims .
The evidence may include camera surveillance , interviews from witnesses , digital evidence , and physical evidence .
To obtain this , some procedures need to be followed .
Interrogatories –
These involve coming up with well - written questions that demand answers concerning your claims , protection , and identity of people who witnessed the accident .
Requests for production - These are requests that have been written down demanding relevant documents and other physical evidence .
Requests for admissions –
These involve written requests that give individuals involved a chance to acknowledge or dispute certain statements .
The defendant party may also have the above requests presented to you .
All you have to do is be well prepared and respond to such requests to avoid the penalties .
For instance , if you do not respond to the request for admission in time , the court will be forced to believe that you have acknowledged the statement presented as true .
This will automatically mean that you give up your defense claim .
Since the situation may be so delicate , you need to have a lawyer who shows commitment when it comes to responding to the request .
Also , the lawyer should be competent in a manner that they can get work done on time .
During the discovery phase , we have deposition , and this is a simple procedure that involves a session of questions asked by the council that the witness has to answer .
The questions are directed to the other party or a witness who is usually under oath .
In the courtroom , a court reporter is in charge of recording statements made by the witnesses or the parties involved .
It is crucial to have your attorneys during the deposition process ; your lawyers will be able to advise you on what to speak about .
Questions asked at depositions may include a person ’s background .
Motions for Summary Judgment
After the two parties are done with their findings that may include the documented request and the depositions , any of the parties may file motions for summary judgment .
In most cases , one of the parties may note that there are no important facts in dispute .
Therefore , a motion for summary judgment is employed by the court as it plays a role in avoiding unnecessary trials .
A court usually grants a party a summary judgment in cases whereby the other party has been convicted for a crime , and the evidence can not be disputed .
From this , there would be no other questions of liability .
Mediation and Settlement Negotiations
The two parties may decide to settle the issue using a different method , mediation .
This involves a third party who could be a lawyer or a former judge .
The mediators are known to have special training ; this will help make the parties get to sound decagons while negotiating .
For mediation to occur , it requires the parties to be in a room together with their lawyers and the mediator .
Both parties are allowed to air out their claims .
This helps the mediator to determine how the parties may resolve their differences .
If the two parties come to an agreement , it marks the end of the case .
The mediation process usually starts with both sides and their attorneys together in the room with the mediator .
If the mediation does not bear fruits , all the parties are advised not to use the information discussed against each other .
The information discussed in the mediation room should not leave the room .
Failure to come to an agreement during mediation does n’t mean that the negotiations should stop .
Your attorney can continue with negotiations until the trial ends .
Even if mediation sessions are unsuccessful , your attorney can continue to engage in settlement negotiations with the other party until the end of a trial .
Our lawyers are fighters , and they will ensure they make negotiations until you get the deserved settlement for your claims .
The Trial Process
At the Houston car accident firm , our lawyers ensure that we are prepared for matters that may arise .
For instance , we do prepare for a court appearance .
In most cases , we do have this preparation to deal with life insurance companies that may fail to give their clients the deserved settlement .
You can say it is the first step from us to win your case !
The first part of a car accident jury trial is jury selection , which is also known as the void dire in the legal world .
During this phase of the trial , both attorneys and the judge may ask potential jurors in the courtroom , called the “ jury pool . ”
Selecting the right jury is essential to any personal injury damage lawsuit .
However , the jury selection process can be complex — even for attorneys !
Our attorneys know how to use necessary strikes ( which can be peremptory strikes or strikes for cause ) to make sure you have a strong jury .
The jury is most likely to be sympathetic to your injuries and rule in your favor .
The judge and the lawyer come to an agreement concerning the jury selection .
Once this is done , the lawyers are given a chance to speak up in front of the jury .
Once the lawyers and judge agree on a selected jury , both the parties are allowed to make a statement .
This is the period when the attorney do not have to make an argument on their cases .
After the two parties give out their statements , they will also have to present the evidence to the jury and provide an argument on the other party ’s claims .
The plaintiffs ’ lawyer presents their statement first ; this process involves the lawyer questioning the thief witness who makes an appearance to give evidence .
The following process takes place ,
Direct examination involves the plaintiff ’s attorney interrogating the witness who is here to prove their case .
Cross-examination , here the defendant ’s attorney gets to question the witness .
After all the above steps taken by the plaintiff ’s lawyer , the defendant ’s lawyer also gets to present their case in the same manner .
The attorney may ask the witness questions during the direct and cross-examination .
The lawyers are free to ask the witness questions about evidence .
They are supposed to be equipped with statements and evidence that are in line with the rules .
During the presentation , the attorneys should not hesitate to dispute the statements that violate the rules .
The judge gets to interpret the law to the jury .
This interpretation is in connection with the proceeding case .
After the jury hears all the evidence , the judge will read the jury instructions , which informs the jury of the law relating to the case .
The attorneys are allowed to present a final statement to the jury before they go to the jury room for further discussion .
When the jury reaches a judgment , they get to read it in the courtroom .
From the jury ’s decisions , you do not get to come up with an argument ’s decision .
With this , you need to make the right choice of who to represent you during your insurance claim .
With our team handling your case , be assured that we will work hard to ensure you are on the winning side , as you can see from the above procedures how hectic it can be to fight for your claims .

Causes and Types of Car Collisions
In - car accidents , you will be able to notice differences in the type of collision , type of drivers , and the victims .
Car accident case experts are of great impact in helping to determine the cause of the accident .
The experts will get a conclusion from the information given by the witnesses , the condition of the car , the road condition , and many other factors .
Driver ’s negligence is one of the reasons causalities occur on the roads in Houston accidents .
Several reasons that result in a car accident include ;
Drunk Driving
The number of drunk driving is alarming in Houston car accidents case , as much as great effort is put into creating awareness .
Still , it is all in vain .
The numbers are high , which shows that the drivers do not care about the wellbeing of another individual in the society , hence continue to hurt them .
In the modern world , people tend to be so much engaged in their phones that they drive while using their phones .
People are so much addicted to social media hence tend to be distracted while they drive .
Other distracting activities may include taking your eye off the road ; for example , you may decide to check up the child ’s seat belt in the rear mirror and search for an item in your bag .
Speeding
Speeding on the roads has caused many accidents in the Houston Texas area ; the thought of losing a loved one in an accident is distressing .
Drivers who are involved in speeding do not consider that they may hurt others or even themselves .
This is because when they speed , they only think of reaching their destination on time .
The figures on the accident cases are very high ; the drivers should look into this before they step on the gear .
Think about your family , your loved ones , when you decide to drive at a high speed .
Also , you should avoid the part of the roads that are known to be dangerous .
The following are some of Houston ’s most dangerous intersections based on accident frequency :
Sam Houston Parkway at Wertheimer Road Main Street at South Loop Beechnut Street at Sam Houston Parkway Bassinet Street at West Sam Houston Parkway Hardy Road at Sam Houston Parkway West park Tollway at Sam Houston Parkway Camel Road at Sam Houston Parkway I - 45 at Sam Houston Parkway Greens Road at I - 45 NASA Parkway and I - 45 Beltway 8 at I - 45 North 610 East at I - 10
You should be careful when you happen to be driving in the above areas .
The intersection here is dangerous mostly for the motorist .
Chances of being involved in a car crash are high as people are fond of making mistakes at intersections .
We do have different types of collisions ; this is because roads experience a different crash .
From the type of collision that has just occurred , we can base it as a great starting point for liability identification .
Our attorneys look into the crash encountered including :
Rear - End Crashes
Rear - end collision occurs when a vehicle crashes into the one in front of the crash may be minor in a case where the driver was moving at low speed .
The crash may also be referred to as a fender bender as it is a minor car accident case .
Note that it is not in all cases that the crash is minor , this type of crash may be serious to having accident victims who require medical attention .
In case of a rear - end accident , the rear e driver is the one to be blamed .
In Houston car causalities , there are traffic policies that were put in place to minimize a possible number of accidents .
The drivers are supposed to follow behind at a very clear distance between the vehicles on the road .
From this distancing rule , the driver can easily stop without colliding with the other vehicles .
So if an accident occurs in this situation , the rear driver is assumed to have been too close .
Remember , this is not enough reason to make a rear driver be at fault in the crash as they can still challenge the liability .
Rear - end accidents are in most cases cost by the following ;
Distraction on the road Driving while drunk Failed breaks Driving behind another car without keeping a safe distance
Head - on Collisions
This occurs where the front ends of two vehicles hit each other when moving in opposite directions .
These kinds of accidents are usually very serious ; victims tend to have severe injuries that may lead to disability .
The victims require emergency treatment as , in most cases , the accidents are fatal , especially if the victims did not wear the safety belt .
The head - on collision is mostly caused when the drivers are distracted and happen to drive the wrong way on a one - way street highway .
Many car accidents cases occur in remote areas , and traffic police are not always present in the areas or are very few .
The drivers take advantage and break the traffic laws ; the most common one is speeding .
The driver , while speeding they may fail to stay centered in their lane .
The driver breaks the traffic rules by being involved in actions that are life - threatening , for instance , when they decide to pass through the road when there is a double yellow line .
This is against the law , and the law states that the driver should not drive on the left side of the road in a no-passing zone or the pavement located on the left side and designed to mark a no-passing zone .
When these laws are breached , we get to have reports of fatal head - on collisions .
Rollovers
Rollover crashes are known to have a higher fatality rate than any other type of accident .
The experience can be traumatizing as the victim is very much alive and gets to see how the car rolls on its side or roof .
All vehicles are susceptible to rollovers to various extents .
Rollovers can occur from driver ’s negligence or any other form of road encounters , including the following :
Risky maneuvers , like taking turns of swerving at a high - speed rate .
Single vehicle clash as another car hits the side of your car
The vehicle tire is triggered by something on the road and pops out , leading to a rollover .
Driving too fast on curves or turns
Above are some of the major reasons that usually lead to a rollover on the roads .
Rollovers involve a single - vehicle accident or a multi-vehicle .
You may be worried that your car is crashed ; hence feel that you are liable ; the other party may also be a liability .
These are only some reasons why a vehicle may rollover .
Some rollovers involve multiple vehicles , while others only involve one car .
Do n’t assume you ’re to blame if only your vehicle crashed , however , as another party still may be liable for road hazards or dangerous driving .
Modern cars are designed to prevent the vehicles from extreme damages ; for example , the roofing is made in a way that it is strengthened to avoid crumpling in the accident scenes .
However , this does not guarantee that there will be no injuries .
The victims can still come out with very severe physical injuries , psychological or emotional trauma , and many others .
Single - vehicle Crashes
In this kind of crash , some people may think that it is only one party that is usually involved , this is not true .
In this case , only a single car may be involved in the crash .
Below are some of the major reasons that contribute to single - car crash that may be out of your hands :
When you experience an approach of another car on your side and hence forced to swerve from the road .
In this case , you might not have any choice but to make a quick decision without thinking of the consequences .
In some cases , you may not be aware of the road conditions , and the road may have potholes , cracks , or something that may trigger the car ’s imbalance .
You may experience this at a highway while driving at high speed resulting in loss of control after maybe hitting a pothole .
Your car may suddenly experience a mechanical issue and result in you losing control on the road .
The mechanical issue may include seatbelt that does n’t work , Tires that have defects , airbags that cause personal injury damage , brakes that fail , steering that has defects .
Many encounters can lead to a single - vehicle accident ; a driver may cause an accident , not knowing .
For example , when an approaching vehicle that was overspeeding gets to hit you on the side .
The hitting maybe too often that the driver may just continue driving , not knowing what they have caused .
This will result in a hectic process in claiming your insurance .
From this kind of experience , you certainly need a good lawyer to work on your insurance claim case .
If the driver of the vehicle is a family member , you do not need to hesitate to wonder if you should go for the claim .
You should make your claim against the driver ; in most cases , the victim is allowed to make claims against the family automobile insurance policy .

From the above scenario , one may have long term disabilities from the accident .
The victims must get emergency treatment ; in such cases , you should not take chances to call the medics .
A second or minute can change someone ’s life .
The accident may result in the following medical conditions .
Some accident injuries may just heal after a few days from the accident ; other conditions can be permanent , for example , catastrophic injuries .
These are injuries that cause permanent damage ; a good example is the spinal cord personal injury pain and suffering that comes with heavy medical bills .
Below are some of the car collision accident injuries that our attorneys have come across when dealing with clients .
Head Injuries
Head injuries can be very devastating when you hit your head on any object , resulting in a skull fracture .
The skull fracture can occur with brain damage and even permanent disfigurement .
The fractures can also extend to the different parts of the face .
This may include the nose and the jaws .
From this personal injury damage or lost wages , one may experience a low esteem moment as surgery may take place , resulting in a complete transformation , which may be a positive or a negative effect .
Also , an individual ’s normal life may change as they will be forced to have their jaw wired shut for several months .
Head trauma can also be the cause of eyesight problems , which result in partial blindness .
Dental damage may also result from the accident .
The victim may go through a difficult time as dental surgeries are costly .
From this situation , they do n’t have a choice but to just go for the treatment .
Brain Injuries
Head injuries are usually sensitive , especially when they lead to a situation where the brain gets affected .
If there is a direct trauma impact to the head , brain damage may occur .
The functioning of the brain may be affected if the brain tissue sustains injuries .
When the brain ’s functioning is affected , a victim may start to behave in a manner that clearly shows damage to the brain tissue .
Traumatic brain injuries ( TBIs ) can range from mild ( including concussions ) to severe .
Severe brain injuries can render a victim unconscious for a long period , leaving them in a coma in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) .
TBIs can also cause the brain ’s dangerous swelling , which can increase intracranial pressure to a life - threatening level and may require the surgical removal of part of the skull .
Many TBI victims require a lengthy course of treatment and rehabilitative therapy .
For many brain personal injury damages victims with lost wages , life will NEVER be the same again and also financial losses due to medical bills will also multiply their suffering .
Neck and Back Injuries
The Back and Neck are body parts that are vital to the upper body part , and they are the ones that ensure movements and support of the upper body .
Injuries of the back and neck can limit the ability to move around .
Injuries of the soft tissue of the neck are usually referred to as “ whiplash accident injuries ” .
There is a history of whiplash being exaggerated in accidents because the attorneys take it very seriously as they know the effects are serious and they have all information about these cases .
Some parts of your back can be injured in a crash , some of them are disc injuries , fractures , dislocation , and strained muscles .
Injuries sustained at the back have serious effects like keeping someone off from lifting objects and walking properly .
It might require someone to keep away from some activities such as sports , exercising , and doing house chores .
Neck and back injuries will require one to treat them in various ways as doctors directly can be via surgery or physical therapy .
Chest Injuries
The chest contains most of the body ’s vital organs , which is again protected by the rib cage .
The organs can be damaged if , for example , a victim of a car accident suffers trauma to the chest area .
This is because it might fracture multiple ribs , which means there is no protection to the chest ’s vital body organs .
If such happens , it might cause a person to suffer punctured lungs , damage to the heart , or even worse , lead to a heart attack .
If a accident injury damages happens internally , it can lead to hemorrhaging and a buildup of blood inside the chest cavity .
Generally , chest injuries require immediate treatment and trauma care .
Abdominal Injuries
The abdomen houses many vital organs of the body ; hence it plays a major role in someone ’s body .
Some of the organs include kidneys or gastrointestinal liver and spleen .
The organs can suffer a rupture or damage due to an accident that can also fracture the lower spine , hips , or pelvis .
Fracture to the organs might be painful and take some time to heal .
It can be worse if it happens to the elderly people because it might require replacement of the hips and other surgical procedures and might take some time .
Leg and Knee Injuries
There are many other parts of the body that , if injured , can prevent someone from walking normally even though it is the knee and Leg , which are essential for moving around .
If an accident occurs and the legs stretch or move in unnatural ways , it might cause soft tissue damage .
This means the accident might cause strains , sprains , or tears to the ligaments , tendons , or muscles .
It is very common too during an accident for the victims to strike the dashboard with incredible force even if the victim had the seat belt secured .
Most injuries to the knees will require surgery , which takes a while to recover ; the knee injuries include meniscus or ACL .
Some of the leg or knee injuries do restrict physical activities for life to prevent further damage .
Hand and foot play a major role in our body as we use it from walking and doing most of the day - to - day tasks .
This means hand and foot injuries require medical attention to ensure that it heals fast and you can work and do the everyday tasks to avoid getting frustrated .
A accident can cause strains to the wrists , hands , fingers , toes , feet , and ankle .
It can also cause fractures and strains .
Spinal Cord Injuries
The spinal cord connects the brain ’s signals to various parts of the body through the nervous system .
Car accidents are the leading cause of trauma to the spinal cord since the spinal cord connects to the brain ’s signals a accident case which disrupts the spinal cord may lead to losing sensation and movement abilities in the parts of the body below where the accident injury damage has occurred .
Lower spinal injuries can cause temporary or permanent paralysis in the legs , bladder , bowels , and reproductive system during an accident .
At the same time , upper spinal cord injuries might occur and cause paralysis in the arms , torso , legs , and organs such as the lungs .

Insurance companies and adverse parties do not make it easy to recover fully financially since they find it hard to hand over the money .
Since it is not easy to get compensation , many accident victims have many questions to make them understand why .
We have below answers to some of the most regularly asked questions ; however , feel free to contact our office directly to discuss your specific situations .

Usually , it is easy to accept the compensation given until one realizes it could be better compensated as compared to what was offered .

How much does a car accident attorney cost ?
Car accident victims , in most cases , do not bother to call an attorney , the main reason being concern about how much it will cost them .
As opposed to what many thinks that the car accident attorneys are expensive to hire , we do not charge exorbitant hourly fees .
We do understand that the victim in a accident case should receive payment and not PAY .
With that in mind , we handle car accident cases on a contingency fee basis .
A contingent fee means the following :
During the free consultation , there is no fee required Until our client has a successful compensation , we do not charge the client
We do not take payment from a client ’s pocket ; we do wait and get it from the client ’s settlement .
ANYONE can afford to hire the right as attorney for a car accident case claim .
This is because someone does not need extra money on hand to hire a car accident attorney .
What if I made a mistake on the road ?
Most drivers often assume they have no right to compensation , and they do not even attempt to file a claim .
They think they made a mistake before the crash , which a vast mistake often made .
Our lawyers know that even if a driver makes a mistake , the driver might be able to receive the least partial recovery compensation .
This is because the car accident laws in Texas are not that simple .
If a victim has some degree of fault in the accident , there is a legal concept that is applied referred to as ‘ Comparative fault . ’
Different states have different ways of dealing with the situation , but most states , including Texas , use a ‘ Modified comparative fault ’ standard to such cases .
If this standard is plied , it allows the car accident case victims to get some compensation even if they also made a mistake .
This rule recognizes that when someone is at MORE fault than you , they still are held partially liable for your losses .
Keeping in mind that different states have different laws in regard to comparative fault and contributory negligence , it is wise that you hire an experienced attorney .
There is a rule that modified comparative fault follows the 51 percent bar rule .
It states that a person does not have the right to seek compensation for their accident - related losses if they were at 51 percent responsible for causing the accident .
One has a right to recover some compensation for their injuries if , on the other hand , the victim is 49 percent or less at fault .
To determine how much a victim can recover under modified comparative fault will depend on the degree of fault , someone contributed to the crash .
The Insurance Company or a jury at trial can determine the percentage ; however , when the insurance company determines the percentage , it can be negotiated by the attorney .
You can seek recovery for your losses minus your percentage of fault if you are less at fault than the other party .
This might seem confusing ; therefore , you might need a skilled attorney to represent rights if you also contributed to the crash ; it ’s usually a complicated legal issue .
Remember to discuss your accident with a car lawyer because you can trust a lawyer and evaluate your real right to compensation .
Tell him about every information that can result to solve your case .
Usually , it is NOT automatically true what the insurance adjuster tells you , better depend on the attorney .

We make sure that this does n’t happen .
It is common to have financial stress after a car accident case .
It leads to many people accepting a settlement offers from an insurance company as soon as they can without consulting to know if they deserved more .
The stress of bills piling up and the desire to settle them as quickly as possible might cause this .
Insurance companies will always want to pay out as little as possible to victims since the insurance companies are businesses that want to maximize profits .
The settlement offered by insurance companies usually starts very low , hoping one accepts it .
Since most people wo n’t check as soon as possible , they will accept initial offers , or they will take them because the adjuster falsely earned their trust .
It may result in ongoing financial concerns and costs for some time .
Once you accept a settlement offer , you waive your rights to seek more compensation afterward , so it means you have closed the deal once you accepted the check .

Auto collision statistics :
Why consulting Pusch & Nguyen is important !
The data realized by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that 2.3 million persons were injured nationwide in automobile accidents in a single year .
The following information provided by the Texas Department of Transportation is usually based on reportable Texas crashes in a single year ; they are as follows : –
In one year , there were 13,675 with a severe personal injury resulting from crashes ; 17,152 people sustained a severe accident injury in a single year .
The prior year the death toll had increased to 3,534 deaths as compared to 3,408 deaths , an increase of 3.70 percent .
The roadways had a fatality rate of 1.42 deaths per hundred million vehicles miles traveled .
Every 2 hours and 29 minutes there is a death of 1 person Every 2 minutes 13 seconds one person gets injured Every 66 seconds there is a report of 1 crash
Houston ’s dangerous intersections
Ten intersections in the Houston area all carry a large amount of traffic , but also often are the scenes of crashes where speed and the intersection ’s turning movements are a factor .
Two smaller intersections , meanwhile , have had two fatal crashes where speed was a factor .

Driving in the Houston Texas area , there is a probability of dealing with traffic and unsafe drivers .
The risk of a car crash may be far higher than you might imagine , this is according to a recent report realized by Texas State of Safety report .
In fact , in the past five years , there has been a steady increase in the number of crashes in the Houston - Galveston area .
The report , therefore , suggests that each year you continue driving in the area , you increase your chance of getting involved in an accident and having injuries .
In recent years , the number of car accident cases have exceeded 131,000 , causing more than 3,000 serious injuries and 715 deaths .
A World Without the Fed : Why Opposition to the Central Bank is Growing
“ How is the Fed ’s performance in the present economy , ” asks The Citizen Economists ’ Poll .
“ They ’re doing excellent , ” say a sarcastic and / or deranged 5 percent of respondents .
Twenty - one percent say they ’re “ doing okay , ” and another 12 percent say “ pretty good . ”
But the most popular answer is “ horrible , ” which leads polling with 30 percent , and the second - place answer is more radical yet : 25 percent of respondents say , “ We should get rid of them . ”
Support for abolishing the Federal Reserve System is mounting every day .
Hundreds of anti-Fed protesters convened on the Federal Reserve Bank of Detroit , where they joined former Governor Jesse Ventura , The Creature of Jeckyll Island author G. Edward Griffin , and Libertarian Scotty Boman in calling for a return to the gold standard .
Eleven thousand people broke into several impromptu chants of “ End the Fed ! ” at Ron Paul ’s Minneapolis counter - convention this past September , and Google searches for “ Austrian Economics ” — the school of economic thought most vociferous against fiat money and central banking — are have spiked dramatically in the past year .
This all begs the question :
Why are so many people suddenly interested in what has for years been considered a “ boring ” subject ?
Well , it was n’t always viewed that way .
Monetary Policy : Once a Burning Issue
The presidential elections of 1896 and 1900 were almost entirely about monetary policy .
The “ conservatives , ” for lack of a better term , were the “ hard money ” camp — they supported a strong gold standard .
The “ radicals ” wanted a government - managed fiat - money system much like we have today — only they were naïve enough to believe it would be to the benefit of the working man , rather than a vehicle to serve the interests of the elite .
And finally , there were the “ moderates ” — those who favored a middle - of - the - road position in which silver would be coined in addition to gold , thereby causing inflation which , believe it or not , the moderates and the radicals thought was a good thing .
All three of these constituencies existed primarily within the Democratic Party .
The “ conservatives ” were in fact the classical - liberal wing , led by staunch gold man Grover Cleveland .
The “ radicals ” were Midwestern farmers who had broken with the Dems in the previous election and formed the Populist Party , winning 5 percent of the electoral vote in 1892 and nearly costing Grover Cleveland the election .
Stepping in to “ unify ” the party was William Jennings Bryan , a staunchly anti-gold populist but loyal Democrat who did not go as far as the Populist Party .
Instead , he was a “ silver fusionist . ”
Bryan won the Democratic nomination in 1896 and 1900 , losing in the general election both times to William McKinely ( who was nominally pro-gold ) , and changing the Democratic Party forever , for the worse .
Now think about how much has changed since the turn of the 20th century : disputes over monetary policy were the basis of a third - party presidential campaign that grabbed 8 percent of the vote and won five states , led to a civil war within the Democratic Party and the realignment of the two - party system , and were the major issue discussed in at least two consecutive presidential elections .
The American people were engaged and educated , and did n’t fall for bogus platitudes about “ change , ” “ mavericks , ” “ yes , we can , ” and “ country first , ” etc . — they understood the real issues that affected their daily lives , and nothing could possibly be more critical than the money question .
Why The Monetary System is So Important
And why is that ?
Well , when the government has control of the monetary system , it can manipulate it for the benefit of some and to the detriment of others .
Ultimately , this government manipulation is always to its own benefit and at the expense of the people .
For example , under a hard - money gold standard , paper dollars can only be created if there were real gold coins to back them .
Thus , unless there is new gold , there can be no new money .
Inflation — which is correctly defined as the expansion of the money supply — did occur under the gold standard as new gold was mined , but only very slowly .
As a result , there was no “ price inflation ” whatsoever .
That ’s because the advances in technology and accumulated capital more than offset the rate of monetary expansion , and thus , consumer prices went down a little year after year .
But when the government claims for itself the right to print paper money out of thin air — notes that are n’t backed by gold — and uses its military might to force people to accept those notes , there is a recipe for exploitation .
Inflation = Theft
Think of it this way : Imagine there is $ 1 trillion in total world currency .
Paper money itself , of course , is worthless — it ’s what you can exchange the money for that ’s important .
So if the total money supply was $ 1 trillion , then all of the world ’s wealth — all the factories , the natural resources , the finished goods , etc. — would be worth $ 1 trillion .
Now what happens when the government creates $ 0.1 trillion new dollars ?
It does n’t expand the supply of factories , resources , and goods — only the money that the values of those items are denominated in .
All existing wealth would now be worth $ 1.1 trillion , since the total wealth would still be equal to the total money supply .
Only now , the $ 1 bill in your pocket would be worth $ 1/ $ 1.1 trillion instead of $ 1 / $ 1 trillion — you ’d have just been robbed of 10 percent of your purchasing power .
And that purchasing power does n’t just disintegrate — it ’s redistributed .
First , it goes from you to the government , just like a ( hidden ) tax .
And then it goes from the government to its favored industries .
This is why corporations spend so much time and money lobbying Congress instead of developing more competitive products : it ’s easier to bribe the government to give them your money than it is to convince you to part with it willingly in exchange for better products and services .
Clearly , the intelligence of the average American has fallen precipitously since the elections of 1896 and 1900 .
But the fact that people are beginning to wake up to the problems caused by the Federal Reserve System is a hopeful sign .
The only question is : is it too late ?
Can the dollar be saved by the political action of the president and the Congress , or must we wait for the entire global financial system to completely melt down so we can start over ?
If you ’re an optimist you can hope for the former , but as a realist , I think the latter is the better bet .
Hawthorne police have launched a misconduct investigation of an officer who used a 50,000 - volt stun gun on a violent autistic 12 - year - old boy at one of the city ’s middle schools , authorities said .
Such use of electroshock weapons by police on young students is rare , but high - profile incidents have sparked fierce debate around the country over when , if ever , Tasers should be used on children .
At the same time , an increasing number of police departments are equipping school - based officers with them , according to the leading maker of the weapons .
Taser proponents say the weapons allow officers to safely detain unruly students without resorting to batons or other physical force .
But critics argue that little research has been done on the medical effects of shocking children and that using Tasers on minors is inappropriate .
“ This is a question of common sense . . . .
You do n’t discharge a Taser at a child , absent the most extreme circumstances , ” said Michael Gennaco , a former federal prosecutor who now monitors internal discipline of deputies for the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department .

A Hawthorne police spokesman said the department launched its investigation in response to a complaint by the boy ’s parents days after the Sept. 23 incident .
He said department officials are reviewing the incident to determine whether the officer followed the agency ’s rules on using Tasers .
The U.S. Department of Justice ’s research arm found that studies on the effects of stun guns might not be applicable to small children .
The Police Executive Research Forum has discouraged officers from using Tasers on young children and other vulnerable people , such as pregnant women .
Some law enforcement agencies , including those in New York City and Las Vegas , have restricted the use of the weapons on minors .
Los Angeles Unified School District police officers do not carry Tasers , a district spokeswoman said .
The Hawthorne Police Department ’s policy says that officers “ may consider other options ” before deploying Tasers on juveniles but does not otherwise limit their use on children .

Lt. Michael Ishii said police were called to Hawthorne Middle School after a student grabbed a counselor in a threatening manner and punched and kicked a security guard who intervened .
The boy , described as about 5 feet 7 and 130 to 150 pounds , threatened to kill staff members and continued assaulting the guard , who tried to protect other staffers , Ishii said .
“ He bore the brunt of the assault , ” Ishii said of the guard , who was knocked to the ground at one point .
“ He was doing his best to block the kicks and punches . ”
Officer Vincent Arias arrived at the school about 11:30 a.m .
The boy , whose name was not released , continued behaving violently and kicked Arias in the groin as about 200 students looked on from the school grounds , Ishii said .
School officials called the boy ’s adult sister to the site but she was unable to calm him , Ishii said .
Arias , he said , fired a hand - held X26 Taser when the boy dashed toward the school ’s exit and the area where the other students were in a physical education class .

“ The police did what they thought they needed to do , ” said Donald Carrington , superintendent of the Hawthorne Unified School District .
He declined to comment further .
Ishii said the boy was not hurt but that his family complained , prompting the department to launch its investigation .
The probe is examining whether the officer should have used an alternative method to detain the boy , he said .
Arias declined to comment .
Charles “ Sid ” Heal , a retired Los Angeles County sheriff ’s commander and nationally recognized expert on less - lethal weapons , said that police should avoid stunning children but that he sympathized with the Hawthorne officer , who had arrived at the school without backup .
“ I am not a big fan of Tasering a kid , but a 12 - year - old assaulting a teacher and officer is a little more of a gray area , ” he said .
“ There is no nice way to handle this situation . ”

Tasers have become increasingly common in police arsenals , winning praise from law enforcement officials who say they help subdue combative suspects and prevent more serious injuries .
The weapons , which resemble handguns , use compressed nitrogen to shoot two dart - like electrodes that attach to a suspect ’s body .
The darts deliver a low - current , high - voltage shock that causes muscle spasms , disabling the suspect .
Some civil rights groups have criticized the devices , with Amnesty International estimating that since June 2001 , more than 334 people in the U.S. died after being Tasered .
In June , a federal jury in San Jose found that the nation ’s largest manufacturer of the weapons , Taser International Inc. , was 15 % responsible for the death of a drug - addled man who was repeatedly shocked by Salinas police .

The Arizona - based company says its products are safe and have saved the lives of countless police officers and suspects who might otherwise have been shot .
A National Institute of Justice study last year found that the weapons are safe in the vast majority of cases but also said that more research is needed to determine the health effects of shocking small children and others , such as the elderly .
Steve Tuttle , a Taser International spokesman , said the number of law enforcement agencies that have given Tasers to officers who work on school campuses has grown to well over 4,000 .
He said the weapons are invaluable for officers dealing with intruders on campus , breaking up brawls or subduing violent students .
“ If you ’ve got a 17 - year - old or a 13 - year - old with a knife in their hands , it really does n’t change the [ risks ] to the police officer , ” Tuttle said .
“ Most parents would highly object to a baton strike to their son or daughter . ”

But incidents involving children zapped by police have drawn criticism .
In Florida , the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People complained in 2004 after Miami - Dade police shocked children in two unrelated incidents .
A 12 - year - old truant was stunned as she ran from an officer into traffic .
And a 6 - year - old student was shot with a Taser after he injured himself on broken glass and refused to drop a piece of glass .
The police department reprimanded the officer who stunned the 12 - year - old but found that the officers in the case of the younger boy complied with the agency ’s rules .
Three years ago , several Florida state senators unsuccessfully proposed a ban on police using Tasers on schoolchildren under 16 .
And in California , Orange County sheriff ’s deputies came under criticism in 2007 for stunning a 15 - year - old autistic boy who had run away from his parents .
Advertisement
“ The risks of using a Taser on a child are just not understood well enough at this point to justify their use , ” said Hector Villagra , director of the Orange County office of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California .
Villagra earlier this year urged the Orange County department to restrict its use of Tasers .
But deputies said they fired the device to protect the teen and motorists from harm when he dashed into traffic .
The boy , who was 5 feet 10 and had a beard , looked older than 15 , according to his mother , who also said the deputies ’ response was too aggressive .

When Jane Simpson ’s mother , then 91 , started showing signs of memory loss in December 2007 , Ms. Simpson thought age had finally caught up with her .
“ As this had been a gradual process , and considering her age , we were not unduly alarmed — just saddened that it seemed we were losing my mother mentally , ” she wrote in an e-mail to this blog .
But on a visit six months later , Ms. Simpson , a 61 - year - old advertising copywriter in North Carolina , was struck by how much worse her mother ’s memory loss had become and by her confusion about everything happening around her .
Just typical 91 - year - old behavior ?
Just the first signs of the inevitable slide toward dementia we all may face if we live long enough ?
Not at all .
Since the ’70s , geriatric specialists have been aware of many unusual causes of memory loss , confusion and disorientation in older people .
These include not just medical conditions ranging from urinary tract infection to hydrocephalus to the flu , but also side effects from many commonly used medications .
Often , doctors and family members disregard these symptoms , thinking that they are just signs of an inevitable age - related decline .
But many cases of pseudo - senility , as it ’s called , are reversible — if they are caught early enough .
By coincidence , Ms. Simpson had recently read a short article in her local newspaper about the side effects in the elderly of a bladder control drug called Ditropan , which include severe memory loss .
Her mother was taking Ditropan .
Ms. Simpson and her sister got their mother switched to an alternative bladder control drug , Enablex .
Sure enough , her mental symptoms eased .
“ Within three months , ” Ms. Simpson recalled in her e-mail , “ we felt that we had our mother back . ”
You ’d think that with the constant attention being paid to Alzheimer ’s disease and other causes of memory loss in aging , doctors would have learned by now that severe memory loss in healthy aging is a problem to be diagnosed , not an inevitability to be lived with and accepted .
But according to the National Institute on Aging , missed diagnoses of reversible dementia still occur too often .
“ Some physical and mental changes occur with age in healthy people , ” the agency writes in a publication called “ Forgetfulness . ”
“ However , much pain and suffering can be avoided if older people , their families , and their doctors recognize dementia as a disease , not part of normal aging . ”
Reversible causes of dementia include the side effects of many medications .
Ditropan is only the most recent addition to the list , occasioned in part by a study by U.S. Navy neurologist Dr. Jack Tsao involving 870 men and women with an average age of 75 .
The subjects , who were all Catholic priests , nuns and brothers , were followed for almost eight years .
At a 2008 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology , Dr. Tsao reported that those who were taking anticholinergic drugs — a class that includes not only Detrol but also drugs to treat hypertension , asthma and Parkinson ’s disease — had a 50 percent higher rate of cognitive decline than those who were not .
According to Dr. Samuel Gandy , a neurologist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan , drugs with antihistamines often cause mental confusion and sedation in the elderly — especially those containing the antihistamine doxylamine , such as the sleep aid Unisom .
In addition , confusion and forgetfulness in the elderly can be caused by malnutrition , chronic alcoholism and metabolic disturbances such as thyroid , kidney or liver disorders — and even on occasion by something as common as dehydration or a high fever .
Doctors are better than they used to be at diagnosing pseudosenility , according to Dr. Gandy .
“ Most physicians are taught in medical schools to evaluate a patient for dementia by first excluding the reversible causes , ” he said .
But one kind remains a particular problem , he added : depression masquerading as dementia .
Doctors can’t simply order a test to rule it out ; the best they can do is recommend a trial run of antidepressant therapy , he said , “ to see if the person will perk up and come back . ”
First , though , the physician must think of something other than aging as a possible cause of the symptoms .

The stylishly violent first offering from Platinum Games only managed to push 66,000 copies .
Not a huge number , but still higher than Sega 's other M-rated title , House of the Dead : Overkill , which saw 45,000 copies sold in its debut month .
Still , Sega seems pleased with the results , telling Venture Beat :
House of the Dead has done very well and has absolutely met our expectations .

People with autism find it difficult to read social cues Watching how a toddler responds to animations could help diagnose autism , research has suggested .
Babies usually start paying attention to movement soon after birth , and pick up information from the cues they see but children with autism often do not .
A study , published in Nature , where two - year - olds were shown manipulated animations found those with autism focussed on movement linked to sound .
UK experts said a test of this kind could help pick up autism early .
This line of research holds promise for development of new therapies based on redirecting visual attention in children with these disorders
Thomas Insel , US National Institute of Mental Health
In the Yale study , researchers created five versions of animated children 's games such as ' peek - a - boo ' and ' pat - a - cake ' where points of light marked movement , each with sound .
On the other half of the screen , the same animation was presented upside down and in reverse , but with the same audio as the upright version .
Previous studies have shown that , normally , children 's attention is drawn to such changes from around eight months old .
Twenty - one toddlers with autistic - spectrum disorders ( ASD ) , 39 who were developing normally and 16 who had developmental problems but did not have autism were studied .
Both the toddlers who were developing normally and those with developmental problems showed a clear preference for looking at the upright animations .
However the toddlers with ASD showed no preference and looked backwards and forwards between the two halves of the screen .
But when the toddlers were shown the ' pat - a - cake ' animation - where the figure repeatedly and audibly claps his hands - those with ASD showed a marked preference for the upright animation , where the sounds were in time with the movement , choosing it 66 % of the time .
The other children continued to prefer the upright version .
' Grabbing their attention ' Dr Ami Klin , of the Yale Child Study Center , who worked on the research , said : " Our results suggest that , in autism , genetic predispositions are exacerbated by atypical experience from a very early age , altering brain development .
" Attention to biological motion is a fundamental mechanism of social engagement , and in the future , we need to understand how this process is derailed in autism , starting still earlier , in the first weeks and months of life . "
Thomas Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health - which helped fund the study , said : " For the first time , this study has pinpointed what grabs the attention of toddlers with ASDs .
" In addition to potential uses in screening for early diagnosis , this line of research holds promise for development of new therapies based on redirecting visual attention in children with these disorders . "
A spokeswoman for the National Autistic Society said : " This is a really interesting study which suggests that children with autism are on a different learning pathway from other children from a very early age .
" We warmly welcome all research which helps us further our understanding of autism , and how best to help and support those with the condition . "

WASHINGTON — The House overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a near total tax on bonuses paid this year to employees of the American International Group and other firms that have accepted large amounts of federal bailout funds , rattling Wall Street as lawmakers rushed to respond to populist anger .
Despite questions about the legality of the retroactive 90 percent levy , Democrats and some Republicans said the tax on bonuses for traders , executives and bankers earning more than $ 250,000 was the quickest way to show angry Americans that Congress intended to recoup the extra dollars .
Even backers of the measure noted it was an extraordinary step .
The House vote sent some employees into a panic about the prospect of , in effect , having to give up money they might already have spent .
And it had regulators fearing it could undermine the Treasury ’s efforts to stabilize the financial system if banks tried to flee the bailout program or if other firms refused to participate in coming rescue operations to protect their bonuses , some executives said .
Vikram S. Pandit , chief executive of Citigroup , lobbied against the legislation in a meeting Thursday with the Senate majority leader , Senator Harry Reid , according to an industry official .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged on Tuesday to press hard for Palestinian statehood , putting Washington on a possible collision course with Israeli Prime Minister - designate Benjamin Netanyahu .
“ We happen to believe that moving toward a two - state solution is in Israel ’s best interests , ” Clinton told a news conference with Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
Netanyahu , whom Clinton met later , has spoken of Palestinian self - government but has shied away from saying he backed a U.S. and Palestinian vision of statehood that has been at the heart of Middle East peace talks .
Clinton , on her first visit to the region as secretary of state , said Washington believed “ the inevitability of working toward a two - state solution is inescapable . ”
She promised the United States “ will be vigorously engaged ” in its pursuit .
Speaking to reporters , Netanyahu made no mention of Clinton ’s call for a two - state solution .
Dina Libster , a spokeswoman for Netanyahu , said “ the subject did n’t come up ” in the meeting .
“ They did n’t discuss that . ”
Netanyahu said that during their talks , he and Clinton voiced a strong desire for future cooperation and agreed that “ creative thinking ” was needed in moving toward peace .
Earlier , at the news conference , Clinton also said two U.S. officials would be going to Syria for preliminary talks on improving relations between Washington and Damascus , which engaged Israel in indirect peace talks last year .
Asked about Iran ’s nuclear program and a possible U.S. dialogue with Tehran , Clinton said the United States “ will do everything necessary to ensure Israel ’s security ” and consult closely on the Iranian issue with Israeli leaders .
She said the United States shared Israel ’s concern “ about Iran ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons . ”
Iran says its uranium enrichment program is aimed at generating electricity .
COALITION NEGOTIATIONS
Netanyahu , who clashed often with the U.S. administration when Bill Clinton , the secretary of state ’s husband , was in the White House , was tapped by Israeli President Shimon Peres after Israel ’s election last month to try to form a government .
He has enough parliamentary support to put together a right - wing government but has been seeking , unsuccessfully so far , to form a middle - of - the - road coalition that could reduce the chances of friction with the United States .
Netanyahu supports expansion of existing Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank , a policy opposed by Washington and which Palestinians say could deny them a viable state .

President Barack Obama has said it will be a priority and Clinton pledged to push on “ many fronts ” early on .
The United States is Israel ’s chief ally .
U.S. aid to Israel will amount to $ 2.55 billion in 2009 .
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks , revived in late 2007 , have stalled over violence , settlement - building and disputes over other core issues such as the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees .

The Palestinian Authority suspended the negotiations after Israel launched in December a devastating 22 - day offensive in the Gaza Strip with the declared aim of halting rocket attacks by militants in the Hamas - ruled enclave .
Clinton said a durable ceasefire in Gaza depended on Hamas stopping rocket fire at Israel .
In the Gaza Strip , Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Clinton ’s remarks gave Israel , which again bombed smuggling tunnels under the Gaza - Egypt border on Tuesday , the green light “ to continue to attack civilians . ”
On Wednesday , Clinton visits the West Bank to see Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .

The Obama administration has lost its argument that a potential threat to national security is grounds to stop a lawsuit challenging the government 's warrantless wiretapping program .
A federal Appeals Court in San Francisco on Friday rejected the Justice Department 's request for an emergency stay in a case involving a defunct Islamic charity .
Yet government lawyers signaled they would continue fighting to keep the information secret , setting up a new showdown between the courts and the White House over national security .
The Obama administration , like the Bush administration before it , claimed national security would be compromised if a lawsuit brought by the Oregon chapter of the charity , Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , were allowed to proceed .
Now , civil libertarians hope the case will become the first chance for a court to rule on whether the warrantless wiretapping program was legal .
It cited the so - called state secrets privilege as a defence against the lawsuit .
" All we wanted was our day in court , and it looks like we 're finally going to get our day in court , " said Al - Haramain 's lawyer , Steven Goldberg .
" This case is all about challenging an assertion of power by the executive branch , which is extraordinary . "
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment .
But hours after the court made its decision , government lawyers filed new papers insisting they still did not have to turn over any sensitive information .
" The government respectfully requests that the court refrain from further actions to provide plaintiffs with access to classified information , " the filing said , suggesting the Obama administration may appeal the matter again to keep the information secret and block the case from going forward .
The decision by the three - judge Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a setback for the new Obama administration as it adopts some of the same positions on national security and secrecy as the Bush administration .
Review ordered
Earlier this month , Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a review of all state secrets claims that have been used to protect Bush administration anti-terrorism programs from lawsuits .
Yet even as that review continues , the administration has invoked the privilege in several different cases , including the Al - Haramain matter .
The case began when the Bush administration accidentally turned over documents to Al - Haramain attorneys .
Lawyers for the defunct charity said the papers showed illegal wiretapping by the National Security Agency .
The documents were returned to the government , which quickly locked them away , claiming they were state secrets that could threaten national security if released .
Lawyers for Al - Haramain argued that they needed the documents to prove the wiretapping .
The U.S. Treasury Department in 2004 designated the charity as an organization that supports terrorism before the Saudi Arabian government closed it .
The Bush administration redesignated it in 2008 , citing attempts to keep it operating .
The Appeal Court eventually agreed that the disputed documents were protected as state secrets .
But the court ruled that the Oregon chapter of Al - Haramain could try to find another way to show it had standing to sue the government over domestic wiretapping .
A number of organizations , including the American Civil Liberties Union , tried to sue the government over warrantless wiretapping but were denied standing because they could not show they had been targeted .
Ann Brick , a lawyer for the ACLU of Northern California , said the court has now crafted a way to review the issue in which " national security is n't put at risk , but the rule of law can still be observed . "
At the heart of the debate about marijuana ’s medicinal value is a dearth of academic research into its therapeutic properties .
For 40 years , the federal government has frustrated such study by restricting cultivation of marijuana for research to a single source , the University of Mississippi .
Most recently , the Bush administration denied the application of a well - regarded botanist at the University of Massachusetts to establish another cultivation facility , despite a ruling by an administrative law judge determining that it should go forward .
For eight years , professor Lyle Craker has struggled to obtain a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration to grow research - grade cannabis .
His proposal is to supply marijuana to DEA - approved researchers who have undergone a rigorous review and approval process by the U.S. Public Health Service , and whose protocols have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
The DEA , however , has behaved as if this serious scientist wants to start a backyard plot for campus parties .
In February 2007 , after nine days of testimony from expert witnesses and administration officials , light broke through the DEA ’s bureaucratic murk : Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner issued an 87 - page opinion saying that the supply of marijuana from the University of Mississippi is insufficient in quality and quantity and that Craker ’s project should go forward .
In a case study of governmental intransigence , the DEA dithered for two years .
Then , a few days before the Obama administration took power , acting Administrator Michele Leonhart issued a final order denying Craker ’s application .
Members of Congress have urged Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to amend or overrule the order , and he should do so .
Then he should go further and change the culture of the agency .
Instead of thwarting the advancement of science , the DEA should encourage cannabis research .
As California and the U.S. government continue to debate the future of medical marijuana , what we need is a body of work on the drug ’s efficacy in treating a variety of illnesses and conditions .
Instead , we have a collection of small studies and individual testimony .
On Monday , President Obama signed a “ scientific integrity presidential memorandum ” and promised that his administration would base its public policies on science , not politics ; the DEA is one of many federal agencies ready for enlightenment .

Recent poll showed Bush with higher favorable rating than Limbaugh Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday March 3 , 2009
Print This Email
This ( Update at bottom : ' I 'm proud to be an entertainer , ' Rush said in 2003 )
Republicans appear to be bowing down left and right to conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh , even though most Americans view the radio talk show host unfavorably .
In fact , polls by Gallup in February show that Limbaugh has less favorable ratings from the mainstream public than former President George W. Bush .
But while members of Congress and presidential aspirants spent most of the last two years trying to run away from Bush , Limbaugh 's power seems to be expanding .
" In a February Gallup poll , 45 percent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of Limbaugh , to 28 percent with a favorable opinion .
The partisan divide was steep , with Republicans favoring Rush 60 - 23 , while Democrats disapproved 63 - 6 , " Howard Kurtz writes in Tuesday 's Washington Post .
ABC 's Jake Tapper also noted Limbaugh 's low numbers with the general public hours after Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele apologized for calling Limbaugh an " entertainer " after the radio host excoriated him in return during his Monday program .
Tapper wrote , " Our polling director , Gary Langer , points out that according to a Gallup poll completed Feb. 1 , 28 % percent of Americans view El Rushbo favorably , 45 percent unfavorably .
The rest , 27 percent , express no opinion . "
" That 's a 28/45 favorable / unfavorable rating , which is not great , " Tapper adds , before noting that his " fave - unfave is 60 - 23 among Republicans . "
DNC chair Tim Kaine quickly took advantage of Steele 's apology : " I was briefly encouraged by the courageous comments made by my counterpart in the Republican Party over the weekend , challenging Rush Limbaugh as the leader of the Republican Party and referring to his show as incendiary  and ugly .
However , Chairman Steeles reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party , its politics and its obstruction of President Obamas agenda in Washington . "
The most recent Gallup poll of Bush 's approval ratings , conducted in early January , showed that his favorably rating had risen to 40 .
While Bush 's unfavorable rating at 59 crushed Limbaugh 's 45 , previous Gallup polls show that despite a highly unpopular war , myriad political scandals and a recession , the former president 's favorable rating never fell as low as Limbaugh 's 28 .
Media figures keep asking why President Obama and other Democrats keep mentioning Limbaugh .
Based on polling numbers alone , they would be insane to ever stop .
' I'm proud to be an entertainer , ' Rush said in 2003
While Limbaugh devoted a substantial amount of airtime on Monday 's show repeatedly bashing Steele for calling him an " entertainer , " he has n't always held the label in such contempt .
In fact , as a reader pointed out in an email to Raw Story , Limbaugh once said that he was " proud " to be called an entertainer .
On Monday 's show , Limbaugh complained at various times : " Okay , so I am an entertainer , and I have 20 million listeners , 22 million listeners because of my great song - and - dance routines here ...
Now I 'm just an entertainer and now I am ugly and my program is incendiary ...
I 'm just an entertainer , ugly , incendiary , they say ... And finally , Mr. Steele , we do like to entertain people here .
The audience is very smart , sir .
They know the difference between entertainment , and they know the difference between deadly serious issues that affect their country . "
But in 2003 , Limbaugh was a little less livid about the label when he told Mediaweek 's Katy Bachman , " I combine two elements : irreverent humor and serious discussion of issues .
People tune in for both .
But the key is having credibility .
This has led to critics saying I am just an entertainer .
I 'm proud to be an entertainer .
This is showbiz .
At the same time , I believe everything I say . "

ANALYSIS : How dare these BBC liberals patronise us
The sacking of Carol Thatcher is a gargantuan over - reaction by the BBC .
It is the worst sort of gesture politics , reflecting not the gravity of the offence but the hysterical self - righteousness of a bunch of white , guilt - tripping BBC executives .
Far from helping the cause of equality , which the BBC loudly declares to be its aim , this move could worsen race relations by treating black people as nothing more than a group of helpless victims who need the constant protection of hyper - sensitive , politically correct censors .
As a black writer and broadcaster , I find the BBC ’s stance patronising and divisive .
Carol Thatcher with Jo Brand on The One Show on BBC1 on Thursday night
I do n’t want some well - heeled , ivory tower managers presuming that they have the right to speak on my behalf , quivering with synthetic outrage as they try to articulate my supposed sense of grievance about a comment over some drinks at TV Centre .
Do n’t get me wrong .
What Carol Thatcher is reported to have said was undoubtedly out of order .
For anyone to use the term ‘ golliwog ’ nowadays is unacceptable and it is even worse coming from the mouth of a well - known BBC presenter .
I have no idea if she is a closet racist but her alleged language was , at the very least ,
foolish , naive and entirely inappropriate for multi-racial Britain in the 21st century .
The fact that some of her supporters , particularly in upper class and Conservative circles , have tried to defend her by claiming that ‘ golliwog ’ is really a term of affection only shows how out of touch they really are .
These are people who appear to have absolutely no connection with the lives of ordinary black Britons .
An occasional hurried word with a traffic warden or cleaner
does not count as a relationship .
Jay Hunt said Carol
Thatcher had to go because she ' caused real offence '
But the BBC ’s liberal elitists are as bad as the outdated reactionaries they affect to despise .
They are so eager to parade their credentials as the champions of oppressed ethnic minorities that they have lost all sense of proportion .
There is nothing genuine about their display of indignation .
The sacking of Carol Thatcher has been all about ideological point - scoring .
The BBC ’s top bureaucrats , led by zealous controller of BBC1 Jay Hunt , deliberately manufactured a crisis so they could pose as heroic warriors against racial prejudice .
There was never any need for this public spat .
The BBC could have merely reprimanded Carol Thatcher and given her a warning to be more restrained .
But no , that would never have been enough for the high priests of our modern Inquisition .
Carol
Thatcher had to be publicly humiliated and punished for her grievous sinning against their creed .
What is so sickening about this affair is the epic hypocrisy of the BBC .
Jay Hunt said Carol
Thatcher had to go because she ‘ had caused real offence ’ .
Why is that logic not applied to Jonathan Ross , who seems to have dedicated much of his recent broadcasting career to the art of causing real offence to millions of licence - fee payers with his continual stream of smut ?
We have also been told that the comedienne Jo Brand , who was present when Carol Thatcher made her comment , was ‘ deeply shocked ’ , as if she were some cloistered
Victorian maiden aunt rather than one of the most foul - mouthed , irreverent performers on the comedy circuit .
Again we see the racial double standards that I find so divisive .
Somehow , a flippant anachronism is treated as the epitome of evil and has the normally robust Jo Brand reaching for the smelling salts , while anything else , from filth to pornographic abuse , is regarded as perfectly acceptable .
Deeply offensive comments by Ross earn him an annual salary of £ 6 million from the BBC , largely because his critics are seen as stuffy middle - class traditionalists who do n’t understand the nature of ‘ edgy ’ comedy .
Yet a different set of criteria apply to Carol Thatcher , as if the supposed offence felt by black people deserves to be treated more seriously than that felt by Middle England .
Jonathan Ross was not sacked for his filthy comments , merely suspended
The hypocrisy is all the more glaring because Ross ’s notoriously filthy diatribes were broadcast to the public , whereas Carol Thatcher ’s comment was made in private .
We are really descending into the land of the Orwellian ‘ thought police ’ if every word we utter has to be subjected to the approval of the white liberal elite , the self - appointed guardians of public morality .
For all the BBC ’s posturing , this kind of heavy censorship will do nothing for race relations .
The destruction of free speech will only create a climate of fear in which suspicion and distrust flourish .
It is telling that every so - called progressive revolution , like the French overthrow of the aristocracy in the 1790s , has always led to brutal oppression because of the elite ’s determination to impose a type of rigidly orthodox thinking on the citizenry .
In its own insidious way , the advance of political correctness is doing the same in today ’s Britain .
In place of linguistic sanitation , I would far rather live in a society where openness and debate are allowed .
The instinct for suppression is never healthy in a democracy and does nothing to help the cause of equality .
Indeed , the squeals of faux concern are an insult to black people , as if we are so enfeebled , so infantilised that we can be broken by one ill - judged remark .
Blacks have had to put up with genuine racial injustice for centuries , but no one was ever lynched by words alone .
It is actions that cause real suffering , not linguistic misdemeanours , no matter how unpalatable they might seem .
In some respects the BBC , so full of noisy solicitude for the feelings of ethnic groups , is acting like a plantation owner , guarding the blacks with an aggressive , proprietorial air .
We deserve better than to have this infantilism forced upon us .
We have endured far worse than anything Carol Thatcher said , and we know bullying by our self - appointed allies is never the road to freedom .
Sites featured on the list were only revealed this month after a leaked version was published on the Wikileaks website .
While the list of " prohibited " material does not have a significant impact on most internet users today , links contained on it will be blocked for everyone if Conroy proceeds with his mandatory internet filtering plan .
Henson 's spokeswoman Sue Cato declined to comment , as did ACMA and Conroy .
Colin Jacobs , spokesman for online users lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , said : " With an abortion site , the Peaceful Pill Handbook and Bill Henson photos all now revealed to be on the blacklist , claims that the list only includes the ' worst of the worst ' of the web are sounding like those over - emphatic defences of Guantanamo Bay . "
Jacobs said EFA was " pretty unenthusiastic " about a censorship system " where we have no choice but to take such assertions at face value " .
Greens Senator Scott Ludlam said : " It 's a classic example of that scope creep .
They say it 's about the worst of the worst but before you know it it 's expanding to cover other kinds of material . "
The Classification Board said it had received 10 applications to classify works by Henson .
It found the images of children were not sexualised , " mild in viewing impact and justified by context " .
This is despite some of the images depicting a naked female with " breast nudity " .
Henson 's images sparked a political storm last year following an uproar on talkback radio , which led to police seizing 32 of Henson 's photographs from Sydney 's Roslyn Oxley9 gallery .
At the time , the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , declared the pictures " absolutely revolting " .
But the case against Henson eventually collapsed , with the Director of Public Prosecutions advising NSW Police that any prosecution of Henson would be unlikely to succeed .
Conroy initially called into question the veracity of the leaked blacklist but yesterday said the latest leaked version , dated March 18 , " seemed to be close " to ACMA 's current blacklist .
" It is completely untrue that the leaked blacklist contains political content .
This is a list which contains sites that promote incest , rape , child pornography and child abuse , " he said .
However , alongside child porn , bestiality , rape and extreme violence sites , the leaked list also includes a slew of online poker and gambling sites , YouTube links , regular gay and straight porn sites , Wikipedia entries , euthanasia sites , websites of fringe religions such as satanic sites , fetish sites , Christian sites , the website of a tour operator and even the sites of a Queensland dentist , a school canteen consultancy and an animal carer .
" If in the future the Prime Minister finds a controversial artwork ' revolting ' or an online game too violent , do you trust him to resist pushing the ' ban it ' button ?
He could then go on talk radio and say something was being done , " Jacobs said .
The Opposition communications spokesman , Nick Minchin , said he had not seen the blacklisted link with the Henson images but the revelations raised " further questions about how Senator Conroy will compile any blacklist and how this will be vulnerable to ' creeping ' based on the political will of the day " .
Yesterday , Conroy said public concern about the possibility of the blacklist " creeping " to include legal content was justified , but stopped short of guaranteeing the Government would be able to prevent it .
The Government plans to expand the blacklist to up to 10,000 sites and has said it plans to incorporate sites found on international blacklists .
Specification
In the past month we 've seen a huge effort on the specs , mostly driven by Timothy " wayland " S. Nelson .
He split the ever - growing S29 document into various API documents for built - in classes , all of them living in the S32 setting library .
The term " setting " is also new and requires an explanation .
It 's a term for the namespace in which built - in functions live .
Other languages call that a " Prelude " .
Differently from a Prelude that scope is replaceable , meaning that it 's easy to throw out all built - in functions and provide your own set , if that 's what you want .
There was also a lively discussion about S16 ( IO ) , and Daniel Ruoso and Timothy made some progress in the specs there .
It seems our IO system will be heavily based on roles .
Likewise there was some work on an S28 " special variables " draft .
Larry
Wall also contributed lots of small and not - so - small cleanups .
Private methods are now declared as method !
mymethod { ... } ( as opposed to my method previously

are n't automatically considered to be the scalar part of a match object .
Instead they can now be accessed with the key , for example as .
Lists in item context now auto - promote to Captures , not Arrays anymore .
That means that when you write my $ a = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) the $ a is immutable ; $ a [ 2 ] = 4 is an array .
Instead you need to say my $ a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ; ( anyone speaks Perl 5 here ? ;-) .
Captures were also re-factored to treat the invocant less special .

Captures were also re-factored to treat the invocant less special .
Some clarification on what happens when you have a sub and an enum value of the same name
Enhancing an already defined class is now done with augment class Object instead of the previous class Object is also .
Likewise supersede replaces is instead .
I 'm sure I 've missed some important pieces , but the past month brought so many changes it 's hard to keep track of .
Implementations
Rakudo
In February we witnessed the first release of Rakudo that 's independent from Parrot .
The releases are simply numbered ( without any major / minor distinction ) and have code names ; the names are picked among cities with Perl 6 supportive perlmongers groups .
This release was dedicated to Vienna.pm who sponsored much of Jonathan Worthington 's Rakudo work .
Most notably Rakudo now ships with some built - in functions written in Perl 6 , which makes it much more hackable if you love Perl 6 , but have no clue about PIR .
Other interesting changes and fixes are support for the new R meta operator ( which reverses the order of arguments to the following operator ) and a . perl method on Match objects ( just for debugging purposes , it can't be eval 'ed back into a Match object yet ) .
Misc
Since the Topic of our beloved IRC channel # perl6 become too crowded with links to Perl 6 implementations , I set up the page http://perl6-projects.org/
which simply links to all of the most important Perl 6 projects , including compilers and documentation efforts .
It is meant to be an entry page to link to if you do n't want to collect dozens of links yourself .
Hinrik Örn Sigurðsson wrote on p6l that Google " Summer of Code " project where they pay students for work on open source projects , and hinted that he'd like to hack on Perl 6 stuff as a gsoc project .
Jonathan Leto explained that he coordinates the TPF side of this year 's project .
FORT MYERS , Fla . —Boston Red Sox owner John
Henry is renewing his call for a baseball salary cap .
He says he thinks all owners would support an " enlightened " salary cap to improve competitive balance and that players might agree .
He did not give details .
Henry 's call came Wednesday at spring training after the New York Yankees signed three free agents for a total of $ 423.5 million during the offseason .
The Red Sox gave out much shorter and cheaper deals .
Exactly five years earlier , Henry called for a salary cap when the Yankees obtained Alex Rodriguez in a trade with Texas after the Red Sox failed to complete a trade for him .
At that time , he advocated a cap to deal with a team that he said has far more resources than any other team .

The state Supreme Court allowed a transgender former prison inmate on Wednesday to proceed with a lawsuit accusing prison guards of failing to protect her from being raped and beaten by her cellmates .
In her suit , Alexis Giraldo said she was being held at Folsom State Prison for shoplifting and a parole violation in January 2006 when a cellmate began assaulting and raping her on a daily basis .
She said prison staff ignored her complaints until March 2006 , when she was transferred to segregated housing after a second cellmate attacked her with a box - cutter .
She was paroled in July 2007 .

WASHINGTON – The U.S. government may need sweeping new powers to investigate and prosecute future denial - of - service attacks , top law enforcement officials said Tuesday .
Anonymous remailers and free trial accounts allow hackers and online pornographers to cloak their identity , deputy attorney general Eric Holder told a joint congressional panel .
" A criminal using tools and other information easily available over the Internet can operate in almost perfect anonymity , " Holder told the panel .
Holder said the Clinton administration is reviewing " whether we have adequate legal tools to locate , identify , and prosecute cyber criminals , " but stopped short of endorsing a specific proposal .
Currently no laws require U.S. Internet users to reveal their identity before signing up for an account , and both fee - based and free services offer anonymous mail , Web browsing , and dialup connections .
During the unusual joint session , legislators from both the House and Senate judiciary committees gathered on Capitol Hill where they discussed how assaults on Web sites could cripple the U.S. economy .
They also wondered when the yet - to - be- identified perpetrators of the recent spate of DoS attacks would be identified .
If the noncommittal testimony of Justice Department and FBI officials is any indication , it might take a while .
" Computer crime investigators in a number of FBI field offices and investigators from other agencies are investigating these attacks , " said Holder , who refused to divulge details .
The technical details of the presentations seemed to elude Republican South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond , the oldest surviving member of the Senate .
Thurmond , chairman of the Senate 's criminal justice oversight subcommittee , was born in 1902 and ran for president in 1948 as a member of the States ' Rights party .
But it was one of the younger members of the House – Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee – who appeared the most confused .
She said that parents should be held legally responsible for what their teen - age children do " on those Internet channels . "
Most of the legislators at the hearing seemed content not drafting new Internet regulations , a laissez - faire concept enthusiastically backed by the tech firms that testified .
Howard Schmidt , Microsoft 's chief information security officer , said he would " caution against swift action , legislative or otherwise , on this front . "
" Microsoft and other information technology companies deal daily with a host of hacker assaults , " he said .
" We regularly defeat the vast majority of those efforts and we constantly upgrade our products and support services to provide protection against similar attacks . "
A Cisco Systems executive agreed .
" We do not ask Congress for new laws in the area of Internet security , " said Charles Giancarlo , a Cisco senior vice president .
" Cooperation , not regulation or legislation , will ensure that the Internet remains secure . "
That has n't stopped legislators from legislating .
Democratic New York Senator Chuck Schumer said last week that he wants to make it easier for police to eavesdrop on an online communication and prosecute 15 - year - olds as adults .
Schumer 's proposal also would allow federal prosecutions under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act even if the company being attacked suffered no monetary loss .
Current law requires $ 5,000 in damages before a prosecution can happen .
While the industry does n't seem wild about the plan , they do n't appear to be eager to oppose it either .
But a representative of a civil liberties group voiced concerns about federal legislation that would hand prosecutors more power .
" You must be careful to ensure that the recent Internet attacks do not serve as justification for legislation or other government mandates that will be harmful to civil liberties and the positive aspects of the openness and relative anonymity of the Internet , " said James Dempsey , staff counsel of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
Courtney Love just became the first celebrity to be sued for making defamatory remarks on Twitter .
THR , Esq. : In Los Angeles Superior Court , clothes designer Dawn Simorangkir , also known as Boudoir Queen , is suing Love for defamation , invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress for " an extensive rant " on Twitter about how she was billed for custom clothing .
It 's hard to be extensive when one is limited to just 140 characters .
But if anybody can do it , it 's Love , who allegedly wrote things like " oi vey do n't fuck with my wardrobe or you will end up in a circle of corched eaeth hunted til your dead . " [ those sorts of misspellings are common in Love 's tweets ]
" Whether caused by a drug induced psychosis , a warped understanding of reality , or the belief that her money and fame allow her to disregard the law , Love has embarked [ o ] n what is nothing short of an obsessive and delusional crusade to terrorize and destroy Simorangkir , Simorangkir 's reputation and her livelihood , " says the complaint .
THR , Esq. thinks
Love 's tweets are mostly her opinion , but the legal blog astutely wonders how seriously a court will take comments made via a casual medium like Twitter .
The application of Dye Solar Cells ( DSC's ) in many technologies and new products is at least a year away , according to Dyesol , the leading company in the fast - growing DSC sector .
DSC technology still has a way to go to catch up with nature .
You see , DSC technology is based on the process whereby plants convert light into energy and store it .
Plants that use photosynthesis operate 24/7 , even when the sun is not shining .
Essentially , it 's working those long hours that will prove DSC energy more efficient than silicon - based solar cells .
The bio- inspired DSC is more powerful in a wider range of light and temperature conditions and its material flexibility makes it easy to be incorporated into many commonly used materials from steel in the building industry to fabric in the textile industry .
DSC will also be far less expensive than silicon - based solar cells and will not leave the carbon footprint that current solar plants are making .
In short , the application of DSC technology to existing and new materials is going to be revolutionary , changing the way we interact with many of our environments .
Dyesol , an Australian company , with an international board of directors and customer base , is creating the DSC's which will generate heat when incorporated into glass , steel , paint , nano fabrics and many other textures .
DSC 's are extremely flexible .
Layers of dye are formed and then laid on layers of material from steel to fabric .
The dyes can be colored or transparent .
Dyesol is now working with the Welsh Assembly Government on a project designed to see if roofing steel can generate electricity .
Additionally , the University of Rome , the Italian companies ERG Renew and Permasteelisa , and the Australian Department of Defense have contracts with Dyesol for various applications of DSC technology .
DSC 's , inspired by photosynthesis , will soon be coming to a roof or window or winter shirt near you .
Probably not soon enough .

Advertisement Pakistan 's government has said a sacked Supreme Court chief justice will be reinstated , prompting the opposition to call off a major rally in the capital .
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Iftikhar Chaudhry would resume his old post later in March .
Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif had joined campaigning lawyers in demanding the judge 's reinstatement .
Announcing that the march on Islamabad had been called off , Mr Sharif urged supporters to celebrate " with dignity " .
We have said that we will restore the judges and the independent judiciary and by the grace of Allah we have achieved it
Nawaz Sharif
Clouded details of Pakistan deal
In quotes : reinstatement reactions " From here , God willing , the fate of this nation will change , " Mr Sharif said .
Mr Gilani said Mr Chaudhry would resume his post following the resignation of the current Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar on 21 March .
" I announce the restoration of all deposed judges including Mr Iftikhar Chaudhry , " Mr Gilani said .
The unrest has alarmed Western powers , and the US envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , hailed the decision .
He was quoted by the New York Times as saying the US applauded " the statesmanlike act by President [ Asif Ali ] Zardari " and hoped it would " defuse a dangerous confrontation " .
Jubilation Mr Chaudhry and 60 other judges were dismissed by former President Pervez Musharraf in 2007 .
Most have since been reinstated but Mr Chaudhry and a handful have not been allowed to return to their old posts .

One reason for the failure to reinstate him is thought to be the fact that he challenged an amnesty given by Gen Musharraf that enabled Mr Zardari to return to Pakistan , on the grounds that Gen Musharraf 's own rule could be illegal .
Overturning the amnesty could leave Mr Zardari , the widower of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , exposed to corruption charges .
Mr Gilani's announcement , broadcast on television , triggered scenes of jubilation from Mr Chaudhry 's supporters outside his home in Islamabad .
The BBC's Barbara Plett , who was at the scene , says the gathered lawyers and activists were in exultant mood , regarding this as the triumph of two years of struggle against both military and civilian governments .
Mr Gilani also said opposition activists and leaders detained over the past week of mounting disturbances would be freed and a ban on demonstrations in the capital and several provinces lifted .
HAVE YOUR SAY Historic times for the entire nation , congratulations to every one .
Zaigham , Lahore , Pakistan " This is a victory for the people of this country , " said Baz Mohammad Kakar , a leader of the lawyers ' movement .
" Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of Pakistan who has proved himself to be a judge for the people , as a chief justice for the people . "
Our correspondent says the development is also a victory for Mr Sharif , a long - time opponent of President Zardari .
He was mobbed by supporters in Gujranwala , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) north - west of Lahore , telling them : " We have said that we will restore the judges and the independent judiciary and by the grace of Allah we have achieved it .

From here , a revolution will come . "
Our correspondent says that everyone , including Pakistan 's Western supporters , will be heaving a sigh of relief that what looked to have been a dangerous political confrontation appears to have been defused peacefully .
The West wants Pakistan to focus on the battle against the Taleban on the Afghan border .
The past two days have provided fresh evidence of the militant insurgency there , with attacks on Sunday and Monday on container terminals near Peshawar in the north - west .
The terminals supply Nato and US troops in Afghanistan .
Punjab question
The decision to reinstate the chief justice marks a complete turnaround from the situation on Sunday , when Mr Sharif left Lahore with a convoy of supporters , defying an apparent effort to put him under house arrest .
Iftikhar Chaudhry and other judges were sacked by Gen Musharraf Riot police had surrounded his Lahore home but after supporters clashed with them Mr Sharif moved past unchecked and left the city .
Several days of rallies around Pakistan were to culminate in a " long march " on Islamabad and a sit-in to press the demand for the reinstatement of the judges .
The government 's announcement marks the end for the time being of the power struggle between Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari , says our Islamabad correspondent .
There are indications that other issues that inflamed tensions between the two will be resolved : a Supreme Court decision last month that banned Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz from elected office , and President Zardari 's decision to put their stronghold in Punjab province under direct rule from Islamabad .

Take cancer : there really is n't a single disease by that name , as far as we can see .
There are hundreds ( perhaps thousands ) of diseases where cells divide uncontrollably and refuse to die off they way that they should .
We 've given then all the name " cancer " , but that 's a bit like coming up with a disease called " fever " .
The biochemical pathways involved can be quite different from case to case , and it 's those pathways that our drugs have to deal with .
So far , it looks as if we can achieve spectacular successes in narrow fields , where the tumor cells happen to depend on specific factors that we can shut down .
But most cancers have multiple weapons firing , and most cancers are ( so far ) too tough for us .
The odds of one drug being able to do the trick are vanishingly long .
The same goes for obesity .
Human feeding behavior is complex , and boy , is it well backed up .
There are multiple redundant feeding pathways with exta backup redundancy backups , because every species whose members could lose their appetites easily is now dead .
Finding a single drug that could thoroughly alter food intake - well , one that does it without making people violently ill , that is - is nontrivial at best , and completely impossible at worst .
Considering the number of promising anti-obesity drugs that have crashed terribly , the second possibility is a pretty good bet .
Alzheimer 's , though , is perhaps a better one .
There may well be a single pathway for the disease , although we 're not quite sure what that is .
I used to work in this field in the early 1990s , and if you 'd told me that we 'd still be arguing about the cause of Alzheimer 's in 2009 , I 'm not sure what I would have done .
( It would have been reckless . )
But if we do figure it out , and it turns out to be something a drug can alter , and we manage to do that - well , that would indeed be a big one .
But it 's not happening any time soon , unfortunately .
It 's a frustrating business , being able to see all these opportunities but not being able to do much about them .
The hope has been that research will find a way out , that we 'll come up with some great new insights into these conditions which will lead us to therapies that we can't even picture now .
Speed the day .
It may happen .
But it may not , and it may take a long time , no matter what .
Google Earth reveals fish trap made from rocks 1,000 years ago off British coast
For a millennium it has lain undisturbed beneath the waves a stone 's throw from one of Britain 's best - loved beaches .
But now modern technology has revealed this ancient fish trap , used at the time of the Norman Conquest .
The giant fish trap , built during the Norman Conquest and designed to trap fish behind rock walls , was spotted on Google Earth
Stretching more than 280 yards along the sea bed , the V - shaped structure was used to catch fish without the need for a boat or rod .
Scientists believe it is one of the biggest of its kind .
The trap close to Poppit Sands on the Teifi Estuary in Dyfed was discovered by archaeologists studying aerial photographs of the West Wales coast .
This image shows the coastline curving round with the trap visible out at sea .
It is in water just 12ft deep , and the wall is around three feet wide
' The fish trap is a fascinating find , ' says project leader Dr Ziggy Otto
It was designed to act like a rock pool , trapping fish behind its stone walls as the tide flowed out .
At its point is a gap where fisherman would have placed nets to catch fish .
They could also have blocked up the gap , and then scooped up fish trapped in the shallows .
Now , however , it is submerged even at low tide and fish are no longer trapped as the water recedes .
Researchers believe it has sunk into the sand over the centuries .
Dr Ziggy Otto , a diver and lecturer in the coastal environment at Pembrokeshire College , believes the trap is around 1,000 years old .
' It is an amazing structure , ' he said .
' It looks well defined on the photographs , but when you are in the water it looks just like a natural reef . '
The trap , made of stones , is located on the Teifi Estuary in Dyfed , Wales
Although it was only recently spotted on aerial photographs , an armchair archaeologist could have discovered the trap on Google Earth .
Google said the V - shaped structure has been visible on its collection of satellite and aerial photos since at least December 2006 .
Fish traps , or fish weirs , were common and controversial in Britain 1,000 years ago .
They were so effective at removing fish from rivers that they were banned in the Magna Carta , and were allowed only on the coast .
SAP , the market share leader in CRM & ERP and second largest business software company is adopting Ruby as part of their SAP NetWeaver and SAP ERP 6.0 solution .
ABAP Virtual Machine will be able to run Ruby Code through the Blue Ruby extension .
In Timeless Software , SAPs CTO Vishal Sikka outlines SAP directions .
Talking about software evolution , Vishal introduces the dynamics of change software industry is facing : business change , new technology layers , evolving infrastructure and finally emerging programming languages :
Even programming languages , and programming models around them , continuously evolve .
Roughly every 10 years a major new language emerges , and minor ones emerge every 3 years or so , well within the lifecycle of large - scale applications .
New programming models and robust developer communities can quickly emerge around new languages .
The language Ruby , for example , is thought to have reached a million programmers faster than any other language ever .
Ruby on ABAP combines the best of both worlds as stated by Juergen Schmerder :
Lightweight , loosely - coupled , agile programming via Ruby , executed within the robust , proven SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP .
In many ways , Blue Ruby makes the simple things simple and the complex things possible .
On the technical side , Blue Ruby is using parse tree to produce BRIL code ( ABAP VM bytecode ) .
Blue Ruby takes care of security using a bridge and a virtual file system :
- Secured bridge packages , which allow access to the functionality of the underlying host platform in a secure way by establishing a well defined sandbox concept .
At the end , you can run your Ruby code from within ABAP context ( from Timeless Software ) :
We reuse the ABAP VM as much as possible for things such as garbage collection , session handling , memory management , etc .
It should be kept in mind that unlike a normal Ruby environment , this is all running in the context of an application server – the NetWeaver Application Server ( ABAP ) .
This means that all of this is operating in the normal context of ABAP work - processes , roll areas , user authentication & authorizations , etc .
For the moment Blue Ruby covers 3365 out of 4910 totalRubySpec specifications ( 70.2 % ) .
A Webinar is also available .
We will continue to follow next Blue phases which might include Blue PHP or Blue Python .
InfoQ had the chance to catch up with Juergen Schmerder , Blue Ruby PM at SAP and Charles Nutter from JRuby team .
It was a good opportunity to have an interactive discussion around VM implementations .
InfoQ : Firstly how is it decided that such a big company like SAP will be supporting Ruby ?
Vishal Sikka CTO thoughts on programming languages ?
Client / developers feedbacks ?
Real need for lightness ?
An originally one - man side - project ?
Juergen : Firstly , it is not decided that SAP will be supporting Ruby .
We are experimenting with the language and our group is very positive about the usefulness of Ruby .
But our mission is to prove that SAP should in fact support Ruby – and / or other languages .
The Blue Ruby project was kicked off mid of 2007 at SAP Research Center in Palo Alto ( a group inside the Office of the CTO , managed by Ike Nassi ) .
Since then we have implemented a reasonable subset of the Ruby language ( in our opinion good enough to seek feedback ) and put a lot of effort into a seamless two - way integration with our nearly 300 million lines of existing ABAP code .
What we are doing is in perfect sync with what SAP ’s CTO , Vishal Sikka , promotes in his vision around timeless software , and Vishal even mentions Blue Ruby in his blog as an example .
The original main motivation for the project was the need for a light - weight environment for consumption and adaptation of our SAP application platform .
InfoQ : Are you the only developer in BlueRuby project ?
What is your experience with Ruby ?
With Ruby VM implementations ?
When did the project started ?
Juergen :
We have a small team working full time on Blue Ruby with a few developers in Palo Alto and two more developers in our SAP China Lab in Shanghai , and we are getting valuable contributions from other developers inside the company .
Our Shanghai colleagues formerly worked on the Xruby project and have a very deep understanding of the Ruby internals and of languages , compilers , virtual machines and so forth in general .
My personal experience with Ruby – well I got into the language when I joined the project in September 2007 .
Since then , I have pretty much fallen in love with the language and went through the MRI source code countless times .
And just like in any relationship , the language still surprises me once in a while :-)
The bad thing about implementing a VM for the Ruby language is that I have to work more in the host language of the VM ( in our case – ABAP ) than in Ruby itself ...
Whenever I get to code some Ruby outside Blue Ruby , I am using MRI as a reference and JRuby for all the experiments we do on our Netweaver Java Stack .
And whenever people at SAP ask me why we are limiting our efforts to the ABAP stack , my answer is that for Java we already have a perfect solution – JRuby ...
InfoQ : Why SAP decided to target Ruby first and not other dynamic languages : Python , or other popular languages : Scala , Javascript , PHP ...?
Juergen :
Well , I ’m not sure you could say we “ targeted ” Ruby ...
JavaScript we considered “ taken ” at SAP , because the ABAP Kernel already does have a JavaScript integration .
So another JavaScript project would have been hard to justify at SAP .
Ruby had a lot of momentum in 2007 ( TIOBE language of the year 2006 ) , it had the right mix of purity and expressiveness , I ’d say we just liked the language .
Our long term vision , though , is true multi-language enablement of the ABAP VM , so Ruby is really just the first step .
We think that languages – for whatever reasons – polarize a lot and with a ‘ one size fits all ’ approach you always lock out millions of developers .
InfoQ : How did you make your technical choice like using parse tree for parsing and building AST Ruby ?
No use of LLVM ?
Was n't it possible to hack one of the existing VM like JRuby to produce BRIL code ?
You did n't want to be dependent on the Java VM ?
Juergen :
When we first started with Blue Ruby , we had our compiler implemented in Java using ANTLR for parsing .
Later we switched to ruby_parser because we are aiming for a self - hosting environment .
Blue Ruby should be able to compile its own compiler , so our compiler has to be written in Ruby .
We are looking into LLVM in even more futuristic side tracks of our project , but as our target platform is ABAP , compiling Ruby to BRIL with a compiler written in Ruby was the most pragmatic solution .
And our main point to prove was that you can run Ruby and ABAP code side by side on one call stack .
That set the boundary conditions for some of our decisions ( e.g. not considering Java )
InfoQ : Do n't you think that the limitations about Ruby processes methods , IO operation and absence of threads might slow up the adoption of Ruby in ABAP ?
Juergen :
We wo n’t deny that the limitations you mention could deter Ruby purists from Blue Ruby .
But our target developers work in the ABAP space anyhow .
A developer with no relationship with SAP whatsoever would never touch Blue Ruby , because the added value of our implementation is specifically that is makes the Ruby language available on the ABAP stack .
If you do n’t care about the ABAP stack , you wo n’t care about Blue Ruby either ...
ABAP people , however , have n’t missed IO operations or threads for decades ( well , they might have missed these functions but they were able to get along without it ) , so I do n’t see these gaps being a showstopper .
That does n’t mean we are not working on closing the gaps over time , it just does n’t concern us now .
And from the feedback we ’re gotten so far , I can say there ’s people out there who love the idea of having Ruby running inside ABAP .
InfoQ : Charles was recently stating :
Listen , people : Ruby is hard to implement .
Oh , it may look easy at a glance , and you can probably get 70 , 80 , or even 90 % of the way pretty quickly .
But there 's some crazy stuff in that last 10 % or 5 % that totally blindsides you if you 're not looking for it .
InfoQ : Today you 're supporting 70 - 80 % of RubySpec .
Do you feel confident with the 20 - 30 % left ?
Do you have deadlines or fixed goals ?
Juergen : Could n’t agree more with Charles .
Still , with time , JRuby has been able to get pretty close to the 100 % number , so it ’s not impossible , just difficult .
In a research environment at SAP , we are not even sure if we will ever try to get these 100 % .
The future of the project relies heavily on the feedback we will get from the community – our main question is “ is there demand for Ruby in the ABAP community ” .
So our next milestones will be driven by the requirements we get .
Of course , there ’s the no-brainers – e.g. we want to run Rails .
But that ’s still a bit down the road I guess .
InfoQ :
What are the next features , developments in the pipe for next BlueRuby releases ?
Juergen :
We are continuously improving our core lib coverage and we are starting to bring the standard lib to Blue Ruby ( at least the libraries that are implemented in pure Ruby , not C ) .
And what I definitely want to see in the near future , is a Blue Gem .
Besides that , we mainly went public with what we are doing to attract some early adopters from our SDN community , and we got a couple of developers interested .
We will work with these partners , help them to build something useful ( hopefully ! ) in Blue Ruby and let them drive our priorities .
E.g. if there is more demand for a Ruby unit test framework for ABAP programs than for an SMTP lib , we ’ll build a unit test framework ...
We are also trying to figure out ways to let others contribute code to our project – however , SAP does not have a tradition with open source , so we need to unlock some doors first .
InfoQ : Charles , you recently twittered about BlueRuby in those terms :
Ok , this is getting a little absurd ... yet another Ruby impl , this time for SAP's ABAP VM
InfoQ : Could you clarify on this ?
Charles : I certainly did n't mean BlueRuby was absurd .
In fact , given the little I know about ABAP , it sounds like a great idea .
The reason I tweeted that is because it seems like for every VM that can run Ruby , there 's now at least one implementation ( and sometimes more ) .
I love that there 's so much Ruby to go around , but it 's almost absurd how many different implementations there are .
I think it 's a good thing for Ruby .
InfoQ :
When you implement a Ruby VM today what 's the biggest error you will not redo ?
Charles :
Well , I would never attempt to optimize Ruby before making it compatible .
There 's two major reasons for this .
First , if you optimize and then work on compatibility , you 're very likely to optimize in ways that break that compatibility .
And second , once you already have things running really fast , it 's very tempting not to fix those edge cases that slow things down .
Ultimately any Ruby implementation that truly wants to be compatible needs to be compatible * first * and work on performance later , because it 's a lot harder than it looks .
InfoQ : With your experience on Java VM , is Java VM the VM of choice to implement a new Ruby VM ?
Is Java the language of choice for such aswell ?
Charles : I think the JVM is by far the best way to get a new language up and going quickly , whether it 's static or dynamically - typed .
It 's certainly not perfect ; we 've had to do a lot of gymnastics to get JRuby performance as well as it does , and custom implementations like MacRuby will probably have better straight - line Ruby performance in the short term .
But we get so much benefit from the JVM it outweighs the costs ; JRuby 's core class implementations are by far the fastest around , even faster than the raw C implementations , and that 's largely because of all the extra optimization the JVM does for us .
As far as languages go ... Java really is n't that bad a language .
It 's the " C " of the JVM , and it still represents the most straightforward mapping to JVM semantics of any language .
There are many other languages that are better suited to writing applications on the JVM , like Scala , Ruby , Groovy , or Python , but Java is still king for writing bare - bones , fast - as - hell library and framework code .
That 's not going to change any time soon .
InfoQ : Could you tell us the advantage of using JRuby over parse tree or any other solutions , to exploit Ruby code ?
And how could you convince Juergen to use JRuby or JRubyParser ?
Charles :
Well I must confess some ignorance here ... since I do n't really know how ABAP works .
The new JRubyParser project was spun off primarily so that external consumers of JRuby 's parser -- mostly IDE projects like NetBeans , RadRails , and 3rdRail - - could collaborate on a codebase independent of JRuby 's fast - moving dev process .
We wanted to give those consumers freedom to build a better Ruby parser library for the JVM while also giving us the freedom to modify the parser and AST to support better performance and a smaller memory footprint in JRuby .
I suppose JRubyParser would only be useful to Juergen and BlueRuby if they can run Java alongside their ABAP code .
But to be honest , I think their approach of using ruby_parser is an excellent one ; I know Ryan Davis ( creator of ruby_parser ) put a lot of time and effort into the library , and I hope to use it for some projects of my own , since it has a nice API and very standardized output .
It 's probably not going to be as fast as a C or Java - based parser , but that may not be a concern for BlueRuby .
InfoQ : JRuby is quite a mature project , do you have an idea of the man years invested in it since beginning ?
What are the next features , important issues in the pipe ?
Are you still as motivated as you were on the first day ?
Charles : JRuby is definitely mature .
We 've been production - ready for well over a year , and no other alternative implementation has reached that milestone yet .
There are governments , telecom , utilities , and many others running JRuby applications .
As far as man-years ... I suppose it 's hard to tell .
All the JRuby committers have put in more than 8 hours a day for a long time , but really it 's a labor of love .
There 's probably dozens and dozens of man-years in JRuby , and we 're still moving forward very fast .
Plus we 're still seeing JRuby open up new opportunities for Rubyists , like this week 's announcement of JRuby working on Google AppEngine .
The JVM is most definitely the platform of choice for language and application development , and I think we 're just seeing the beginning .
InfoQ : Charles , would you have any questions you would like to ask Juergen regarding his VM implementation that will make for good reading .
Charles :
What features of Ruby have you found most difficult to implement so far ?
Juergen :
Well , that ’s a difficult question .
There are features we just do n’t support at the moment ( like network sockets , threads , C - libs and so forth ) because there is no equivalent functionality exposed in the ABAP VM .
We had to do a lot of iterations until we got the method dispatching an the exception handling right , but now we are pretty close .
Most work is certainly the type system , and unfortunately it ’s also the least interesting part .
Going public will force us to make faster progress here – it ’s not really difficult , it ’s just that we are researchers and not really attracted by implementing String # fct2500
Charles :
What are the Open - Source plans for BlueRuby ?
May community developers contribute to it ?
Juergen : Personally , I hope that SAP will one day allow us to release Blue Ruby under an open source license and I am working towards this .
However , SAP does not have a long history with releasing open source ( we are beginners in that space just as we are in the Ruby community ) , and our lawyer have to find a way how we can mix our traditional ABAP application licenses with open source components – as Blue Ruby is quite meaningless without the ABAP apps .
So currently , I am unable to make any promises .
But we are just starting a trial program and got a number of SAP partners interested in participating .
The results of this trial program will certainly drive our priorities and our partners will also be able to get more actively involved .
As this is based on dedicated trial license agreements , it wo n’t scale to a larger community , but it ’s a start ...
Charles :
What do you think are the strong points of ABAP with respect to running Ruby ?
What do you think are the weakest areas ?
Juergen :
Well there are a lot of good things to say about the ABAP environment .
It is an enterprise application server by itself , so we do n’t have to worry about scalability , deployment , user access management and a lot more .
And the biggest strength of the overall application server are the existing applications – SAP covers every aspect ( may it be fincancial accounting , HCM , CRM , SRM , SCM and all the areas I forgot to list ) of business processes in any industry and nearly any country .
With Blue Ruby , we get local access to these nearly 300 million lines of ABAP code that has been written .
And we can consume , adapt and extend these application inside the system with a modern and efficient language .
On the negative side we experience every day that ABAP was n’t as a host language for implementing other VMs , it was meant for writing business applications .
And unlike Java , it is still meant for that purpose and has not evolved into a “ C for the ABAP - VM ” ( to tweak Charles ’ statement about Java ) .
So we sometimes have to use unefficient ( = slow ) implementation for compatibility reasons , because ABAP does not offer another way .
ABAP is interpreted byte code with no JIT compilation , so we do in fact run an interpreter inside another interpreter .
As we are constantly refactoring our code to fix compatibility issues or try better performing ways , we also experience that ABAP tools lack support for refactoring .
We end up re-writing big portions from scratch , just because adjustments would take even more time .
When Gretchen and Wayne Hays retired in their 60s , the California couple found themselves eager to downsize .
With their two children grown and out of the house , their oceanfront four - bedroom in Malibu felt empty and burdensome to maintain .
So , in 1997 , the Hayses put the home on the market , but first placed 25 percent of the asset in something called a charitable remainder unitrust .
In this philanthropic setup , you irrevocably transfer an asset to a trust or organization ; after the property is sold , the donor receives an income payment from the proceeds for a set period of time .
Gretchen had always wanted to make a large donation to her Massachusetts alma mater , Mount Holyoke College , and the sale of the house would finally give her the ability to do so .
They dedicated 70 percent of the trust ( to be distributed upon their deaths ) to the college 's endowment , with the remaining 30 percent still to be determined .
When the property sold a month later for $ 2.8 million , the trust became worth $ 720,000 and entitled the couple to a reduction in their capital gains tax liability , a hefty charitable donation tax deduction , and annual income for the rest of their lives .
Real estate philanthropy has become increasingly common in recent years .
A growing number of nonprofits have become willing to accept non-cash gifts , and donors are catching on to the fact that such philanthropy can provide benefits beyond the satisfaction of a good deed .
Older homeowners , in particular , often find it an attractive way to convert a difficult - to - maintain vacation or second home into retirement income , tax deductions , and the ability to support a favorite cause .
Although real estate is the largest single item of net worth for most households , it currently only represents 3 percent of charitable giving , according to Dennis Bidwell , principal at the Northampton - based real estate consultancy firm Bidwell Advisors .
" It is still a largely untapped resource , but I see that changing throughout the nonprofit sector , " he says .
" There 's this sense that , my goodness , we 're missing out on a tremendous amount of gift potential by not pursuing real estate .
Especially during these cash - constrained times , we 've got to look beyond cash gifts . "
The Boston Foundation , like many larger nonprofits , makes an effort to communicate its desire for real estate gifts , says vice president for development Ruben Orduna .
In the last 15 years , the foundation has taken in nearly $ 28 million worth of real estate -- everything from shares in a Beacon Hill co-op to undeveloped beachfront property in Gloucester -- and has seen inquiries increase in the last five years .
An added benefit : Such gifts are typically larger than cash donations .
Smaller organizations , however , often turn down potential donations , lacking the capacity to handle the logistics , upfront costs , or potential risk ( finding an environmental hazard , discovering it is tough to sell , etc. ) involved with a property sale .
While the typical donor is older than 65 and owns multiple homes , Bidwell says it is not uncommon to encounter less wealthy real estate philanthropists .
They might , however , structure the gift as a retained life estate , a scenario where the donor transfers ownership to the nonprofit but retains the right to live there for a specified amount of time , often until death .
The Hayses are now settled into a condominium a few miles from where they used to live .
They are using some of their newly found free time to figure out , through things like study trips to Asia with the nonprofit Hefer International , which organizations should benefit from the remaining 30 percent of their trust .
Gretchen
Hays urges others who are considering real estate philanthropy to look into it further .
" I have absolutely no regrets , " she says .
" It was the single most appreciated asset we had , so it enabled us to give a gift larger than we ever would have thought possible . "

The oldest fossilized evidence of animals has been unearthed in Oman and reveals that tiny sea sponges were abundant 635 million years ago , long before most of the planet 's other major animal groups evolved , according to a new analysis .
This early life hardly looked like us , but some of the so - called demosponges can be sizable today .
Demosponges still make up 90 percent of all sponges on Earth and 100 percent of Earth 's largest sponges , including barrel sponges , which can be larger than an old - style phone booth .
The ancient demosponges — probably measuring across no more than the width of a fork tine — were pinned down via fossilized steroids , called steranes , which are characteristic of the cell membranes of the sponges , rather than via direct fossils of the sponges themselves .
" The fact that we can detect sponge steranes at all suggests that by the Cryogenian Period [ about 850 to 635 million years ago ] demosponges were ecologically prominent and there were abundant demosponges living on the shallow sea floor , " said geochemist Gordon D. Love of the University of California , Riverside , who headed up the analysis detailed in the Feb. 5 issue of the journal Nature .
Frosty times for simpler organisms
The Cryogenian is a geologic period dominated by glaciers and occurring prior to the Cambrian , when the fossil record shows a so - called explosion of most major groups of complex animals , including all the bilaterians ( animals with a left and right side , unlike corals and sponges ) — around 530 million years ago .
Prior to that , most organisms were simple .
In fact , prior to the Cryogenian , the vast majority of marine organisms would have been single - celled bacteria and microalgae , some of which might have been multicellular as far back as 1.2 billion years ago , Love said .
Fossils of microbe colonies currently are evidence of the first known life on Earth , dating back to 3.5 billion years ago .
Thereafter came a long period with little major development .
The new analysis aside , fossils of the earliest multicellular organisms had been dated to 565 million to 543 million years ago .
In recent years , some evidence pushed the date of the earliest animal fossil as far back as 575 million years .
A team of scientists at the American Museum of Natural History and Tierärztliche Hochschule Hannover in Germany recently stated that multicellular , amoeba - shaped animals called Placozoans are the closest living things to approximate Earth 's original animal , based on a computer analysis of many genetic and morphological traits of numerous animals .
While Love 's chemical fossils suggest that sponges were an early group of animals , it does n't suggest they were necessarily the earliest ones .
More oxygen available
Love and his colleagues ' discovery of the older chemical traces of sponges suggests that the shallow waters in some ocean basins in the Cryogenian Period contained enough dissolved oxygen to support simple multicellular organisms at least 100 million years before the Cambrian explosion .
However , limits on that oxygen probably kept the demosponges small , he said .
Recently , scientists have started to think that the Cryogenian oceans were frozen to a depth of more than a mile , when so - called Snowball Earth conditions prevailed .
Such frozen conditions would make it difficult for oxygen to move between the atmosphere and the seas .
Now that there is evidence of animals going back to 635 million years ago , it is worth asking if future research will find evidence of animal fossils going back even further .
Love doubts the date will get much earlier than a glaciation event called the Sturtian , 720 million years ago , which caused big changes in ocean chemistry .
So evidence might be found dating " perhaps as far back as 800 million years , but not much older than that , " Love told LiveScience , " and I think an upper limit age of 750 million years that we present from dates in Oman may stand the test of time . "
Funding for the research came from Petroleum Development Oman , the NASA Exobiology Program , the National Science Foundation , the Agouron Institute and the NASA Astrobiology Institute .
Much of the work was done at MIT , when Love was a post - doctoral research fellow there .
His colleagues on the research included MIT professors Roger Summons and Samuel Bowrin .

Advertisement Colombian soldiers says they have found extensive caves deep in the country 's jungle used by Farc guerrillas .
Special forces came across the caves after a five - year - long hunt for the secret hideout of a top Farc commander .
The caves , in Meta province , are thought to have been able to shelter as many as 500 fighters from air attacks .
Farc ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) is a left - wing group which has been fighting the government since the 1960s .
As well as protecting Farc 's fighters from Colombia 's air force , the caves south of the capital Bogota also included a bomb - making factory and thousands of kilos of explosives , mortar shells and mines , officials said .
Intelligence tip - off Colombia 's defence minister Juan Manuel Santos said one of the caves even housed an operating theatre and equipment to perform dental surgery .
They used to live like princes , and now literally they are living like rats
Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos
" This proves that the wounded , including the leaders of the Farc 's Eastern Bloc may have recovered here from their wounds and were sent back into combat .
They used to live like princes and now they literally live like rats . "
The BBC's Greg Morsbach says the subterranean medical facilities in Colombia are reminiscent of those used during the Vietnam War by the Communist Viet Cong fighters .
Special forces entered the network of tunnels and caverns after an intelligence tip off by a Farc deserter , our correspondent says .
One of the Colombian soldiers who found the tunnels , Yesid Arroyo , explained how they made the discovery .
" The dog traced the smell of explosives from the tanks they were in .
Then we were led to here , and we found the explosives in a hole nearby .
" These are caves which they used to hide from us , but fortunately , because of our strength and the strength of all the Colombian people , here we are , and we have found them , " he added .
Farc has funded its 44 - year war against the Colombian government with drug - trafficking , kidnapping and extortion .
But under Colombia 's new president , Alvaro Uribe , the military has launched operation deep into Farc - held rural areas , lessening the group 's ability to launch attacks on urban areas .

VINA DEL MAR , Chile ( Reuters ) - Britain on Saturday dismissed a fresh Argentine demand for sovereignty talks over the disputed Falkland Islands , saying the issue was not up for discussion .
Argentina 's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ( L ) and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown shake hands before a private meeting during the Progressive Leaders ' Summit in Vina del Mar , about 121 km ( 75 miles ) northwest of Santiago March 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Presidency - Handout
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Saturday demanded the talks when she met Prime Minister Gordon Brown on the sidelines of a pre-G20 summit in the Chilean coastal resort of Vina del March
Her call came a day after Brown said publicly he would not discuss the issue .
“ The prime minister set out the British government ’s long - standing position on sovereignty in very clear terms , ” a government official accompanying Brown told reporters , asking not to be named .
“ He emphasized the importance of the principle of self - determination and the need to respect the wish of the Falkland Islanders and made clear our position has not changed , ” the official said .
He said this meant there could be no talks on sovereignty over the windswept , rocky outcrop off the toe of South America for now .
However , he said the two leaders did agree on the need for further discussions on the issue of commercial flights between the islands and mainland Argentina , which have been blocked for years .
Argentina wants direct flights to the islands so that relatives can visit the graves of the war dead .
The Falkland Islanders , who number around 2,900 , want more flights to South America for business purposes .
“ They agreed there would be further discussions ahead as necessary , while emphasizing that civil aviation matters are ultimately the decision of the Falkland Islanders themselves , ” the government official said .
“ We want to have a good relationship with Argentina , while of course both sides acknowledge we have a difference of opinion on the issue of the Falklands , ” he said .
The official said the topic took up 15 minutes of the 35 - minute - long bilateral meeting , and that Brown and Fernandez also discussed the upcoming G20 summit and the need for financing for emerging market economies .
Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana said Fernandez was clear and firm about the islands , which he called by their Spanish name , the Malvinas .
“ The president stated with great clarity and firmness the need for the United Kingdom to do what the United Nations has asked and to hold talks to find a solution to a sovereignty conflict between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the Malvinas , ” he said .
Britain seized back the South Atlantic islands in a 1982 war after they were occupied by Argentine forces .
Some 649 Argentines and 255 British troops died .
Argentina ’s ill - fated Falklands campaign is widely seen as a mistake by the discredited military dictatorship ruling at the time but many Argentines see the islands as theirs .
GROZNY , Chechnya
The bullnecked president of Chechnya emerged from afternoon prayers at the mosque and , with chilling composure , explained why seven young women who had been shot in the head deserved to die .
Ramzan Kadyrov said the women , whose bodies were found dumped by the roadside , had “ loose morals ” and were rightfully shot by male relatives in honor killings .
“ If a woman runs around and if a man runs around with her , both of them are killed , ” Mr. Kadyrov told journalists in the capital of this Russian republic .
The 32 - year - old former militia leader is carrying out a campaign to impose Islamic values and strengthen the traditional customs of predominantly Muslim Chechnya , in an effort to blunt the appeal of hard - line Islamic separatists and shore up his power .
In doing so , critics say , he is setting up a dictatorship where Russian laws do not apply .
Some in Russia say Mr. Kadyrov ’s attempt to create an Islamic society violates the Russian Constitution , which guarantees equal rights for women and a separation of church and state .
But the Kremlin has given him its staunch backing , seeing him as the key to keeping the separatists in check , and that has allowed him to impose his will .
“ Kadyrov willfully tries to increase the influence of local customs over the life of the republic because this makes him the absolute ruler of the republic , ” said Yulia Latynina , a political analyst in Moscow .
Mr. Kadyrov ’s bluster shows how confident he is of his position .
“ No one can tell us not to be Muslims , ” he said outside the mosque .
“ If anyone says I can not be a Muslim , he is my enemy . ”
Few dare to challenge Mr. Kadyrov ’s rule in this southern Russian region of more than 1 million people , which is only now emerging from the devastation of two wars in the past 15 years .
The fighting between Islamic separatists and Russian troops , compounded by atrocities on both sides , claimed tens of thousands of lives and terrorized civilians .
Mr. Kadyrov describes women as the property of their husbands and says their main role is to bear children .
He encourages men to take more than one wife , even though polygamy is illegal in Russia .
Women and girls are now required to wear head scarves in all schools , universities and government offices .
Some Chechen women say they support or at least accept Mr. Kadyrov ’s strict new guidelines .
“ Head scarves make a woman beautiful , ” said Zulikhan Nakayeva , a medical student whose long dark hair flowed out from under her head covering , her big brown eyes accentuated by mascara .
But many chafe under the restrictions .
“ How do women live in Chechnya ?
They live as the men say , ” said Taisiya , 20 , who asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution .
She was not wearing a head scarf while shopping in central Grozny , which she said was her way of protesting .
Most women now wear head scarves in public , though the scarves rarely cover their hair fully and in some cases are little more than colorful silk headbands .
Women who go out without a head scarf tend to tuck one into their bag for use where head scarves are required .
Many people suspect Mr. Kadyrov is branding the seven late November slayings honor killings to advance his political agenda .
He said the women were planning to go abroad to work as prostitutes , but their relatives found out about it and killed them .
Few Chechens believe that .
“ If women are killed according to tradition then it is done very secretly to prevent too many people from finding out that someone in the family behaved incorrectly , ” said Natalya Estemirova , a prominent human rights activist in Grozny .
Ms. Estemirova said two of the women were married , with two children each .
Their husbands held large funerals and buried them in the family plots , which would not have happened if the women had disgraced their families , she said .
Federal prosecutors in Moscow also contradicted Mr. Kadyrov ’s version and concluded that relatives were not involved .
No arrests have been made , and the investigation is continuing .
Mr. Kadyrov ’s office refused to comment on the investigators ’ conclusion .
The Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that some of the women worked in brothels frequented by Mr. Kadyrov ’s men .
Many Chechens say they suspect the women were killed in a police operation .
The truth about the killings may never be known , given how much Mr. Kadyrov is feared .
Rights activists fear that Mr. Kadyrov ’s approval may encourage men to carry out honor killings , which are considered part of Chechen tradition .
No records are kept , but human rights activists estimate that dozens of women are killed every year .
“ What the president says is law , ” said Gistam Sakaeva , a Chechen activist who works to defend women ’s rights .
“ Because the president said this , many will try to gain his favor by killing someone , even if there is no reason . ”
Ms. Sakaeva said she also is worried that Chechen authorities would now be less willing to prosecute men suspected of killing women .
Mr. Kadyrov inherited his position from his father , Akhmad Kadyrov , a Muslim cleric and former rebel commander who fought the Russians during Chechnya ’s war of independence from 1994 to 1996 .
Shortly after war erupted again in 1999 , the elder Mr. Kadyrov switched sides and brought Chechnya back into Moscow ’s fold .
Ramzan Kadyrov worked as the head of his father ’s security force , which was accused of kidnapping , sadistic torture and murder .
After Akhmad Kadyrov was killed by a terrorist bomb in 2004 , power passed to his son .
Vladimir Putin , then president and now prime minister , embraced the younger Mr. Kadyrov , who has succeeded in ending a wave of terrorist attacks that haunted the early years of Mr. Putin ’s presidency .
But as Mr. Kadyrov has consolidated his power , many of his critics and political rivals have been killed .
Some have been shot on the streets of Moscow , including journalist Anna Politkovskaya , whose death in 2006 shocked the world .
In one of the most recent killings , a Chechen who had accused Mr. Kadyrov of personally torturing him was shot last month as he walked out of a grocery store in Vienna , Austria .
Mr. Kadyrov has denied any involvement in the killings .
The Kremlin appears willing to continue allowing Mr. Kadyrov to rule as he wishes , as long as he prevents another outbreak of violence .
Mr. Kadyrov has won the grudging respect of many Chechens for bringing a measure of peace and stability .
“ People want to believe that things are getting better , ” said Ms. Sakaeva , the women ’s rights activist .
“ They are tired of war . ”

Objective - J and Cappuccino is fun
Objective - J is based on Objective - C and is fun .
When I learned Javascript some years ago , I could not manage to write a line of JavaScript .
What a mess to have just animation in web browser .
And at that time , no debugger was available .
On the desktop , I could play with the Cocoa framework and Objective C to solve real problems , not just animations .
Latest version of browsers ( Firefox or Safari 4 ) have changed the landscape , we now have a good debugger to solve the typos and bugs .
Now Objective - J and the Cappuccino framework enable us to have the same feel of developping application for the desktop but in a browser .
This changes everything .
I am now waiting improvments and polishing of Cappuccino .
I the mean time , we can start using Cappuccino to be ready when next version arrives .
Improving Person class
I have included the class Person that was used in the tutorial about Ojective - J. One small addition is the method -( CPString ) description .
This enable us to have a better reporting when debugging the program .
You will see that in few minutes .
@implementation Person : CPObject { CPString name ; CPString jobTitle ; CPString company ; } + ( id)personWithName :( CPString )
aName { return [ [ self alloc ] initWithName : aName ] ; } - ( id)initWithName :( CPString )
aName { self = [ super init ] ; if ( self ) { name = a Name ; jobTitle = @ " " ; company = @ " " ; } return self ; } - ( void ) setName :( CPString ) aName { name = a Name ; } - ( CPString ) name { return name ; } - ( void ) setJobTitle :( CPString ) aJobTitle company :( CPString ) aCompany { jobTitle = aJobTitle ; company = aCompany ; } -( CPString ) description { return [ [ CPString alloc ] initWithFormat : @ " name : %@ jobTitle : %@ company : %@ " , name , jobTitle , company ] ; } @end
Playing with Fundation objects
Well , the fundation framework contains non GUI objects .
We will use all of them : CPArray , CPDictionary , CPNull , CPData , CPDate , CPNumber , CPString .
Just create a small application containg a centered button .
We will put the code in the method - ( void ) playWithArray : ( id ) sender that is triggered by a click on the button .
[ button setTarget : self ] ; [ button setAction:@selector( playWithArray : ) ] ;
Another interesting code is CPLogRegister ( CPLogPopup ) which enable us to see the output of CPLog.trace ( message ) .
@import @import " Person.j " @implementation AppController : CPObject { } - ( void) applicationDidFinishLaunching :( CPNotification ) aNotification { /* Enable Logging ( DEBUG ) */ CPLogRegister ( CPLogPopup ) ; var the Window = [ [ CPWindow alloc ] initWithContentRect:CGRectMakeZero( ) styleMask:CPBorderlessBridgeWindowMask ] , contentView = [ the Window contentView ] ; var button = [ [ CPButton alloc ] initWithFrame : CGRectMake(CGRectGetWidth( [contentView bounds ] )/2.0 - 40 , CGRectGetHeight ([contentView bounds ] )/2.0 - 9 , 80 , 18 ) ] ; [ button setAutoresizingMask: CPViewMinXMargin | CPViewMaxXMargin | CPViewMinYMargin | CPViewMaxYMargin ] ; [ button setTitle : " Play with array " ] ; [ button setTarget : self ] ; [ button setAction:@selector( playWithArray : ) ] ; [ contentView addSubview : button ] ; [ the Window orderFront : self ] ; }
You should read the tutorial on debugging Ojective - J programs .
You need to know how to enable the debugger in Firefox 3 or Safari 4 .
When it is done , you can use the debugger command to stop the execution of your code .
This enable you to check the content of your variables ( and the stack frame ) .
- ( void ) playWithArray :( id ) sender { debugger ;
We start to play with the Person class by creating two objects ( john and joe ) .
We also use CPString object and chain message calls [ [ object message1 ] message2 ] .
We now use our description method to see our object easely : CPLog.trace ( [ joe description ] ) .
var john = [ [ Person alloc ] initWithName : @" dummy " ] ; var name = [ [ CPString alloc ] initWithString : @" Jo " ] ; name = [ [ name string ByAppendingFormat : @ " %@ " , @ " hn " ] uppercaseString ] ; [ john setName : name ] ; [ john setJobTitle : @" Engineer " company : @" Best sofware Inc. " ] ; var joe = [ Person personWithName : " Joe " ] ; [ joe setJobTitle : @ " Funder " company : @" Even better sofware Co. " ] ; CPLog.trace ( [ joe description ] ) ;
Now it is time to play with CPArray , CPDictionary , CPNull , CPData , CPDate , CPNumber , CPString .
A dictionary is the standard way of passing around key - value pairs in the Cappuccino framework .
It is similar to the Java map interface , except all keys are CPStrings and values can be any Cappuccino or JavaScript object .
If you are familiar with dictionaries in Cocoa , you 'll notice that there is no CPMutableDictionary class .
The regular CPDictionary has setObject : and removeObjectForKey : methods .
In Cappuccino there is no distinction between immutable and mutable classes .
They are all mutable .
We reuse our Person objects and add them in the CPDictionary object .
The method description of Person object will be called by [ dict description ] .
var keys = [ CPArray arrayWithObjects : @" key1 " , @ " key2 " , @ " John " , @ " Joe " , nil ] ; var objects = [ CPArray arrayWithObjects : @" value1 " , [ CPNumber numberWithBool : NO ] , john , joe , nil ] ; var dict = [ CPDictionary dictionaryWithObjects : objects forKeys : keys ] ; [ dict setObject : [ CPNumber numberWithDouble : 9.9 ] forKey : @" key3 " ] ; [ dict removeObjectForKey:@" key1 " ] ; CPLog.trace ( " dict : " + [ dict description ] ) ; var myNull = [ CPNull null ] ; var data = [ CPData dataWithString : @" Cappuccino " ] ; var date = [ CPDate date ] ; var number = [ CPNumber numberWithBool : YES ] ; var array = [ CPArray arrayWithObjects : @" string1 " , @ " string2 " , myNull , date , number , data , dict , nil ] ; var mutableArray = [ CPArray arrayWithCapacity : 10 ] ; [ mutableArray addObjectsFromArray:array ] ; [ mutableArray addObject : @" new one " ] ; CPLog.trace ( " dict : " + [ mutableArray description ] ) ; CPLog.trace ( " end " ) ; } @end
Done with Fundation , next will be Appkit
Now that we have seen the objects available in Fundation , we will play with the GUI part of Cappuccino : AppKit .
If you 'd like to see the complete code listing from the tutorial , you can download it all in a single file : Tutorial1.zip .
The web application is available online : Tutorial1
Some of the extra money is to go towards soldiers ' pay , officials say China says it will increase military spending by a " modest " 14.9 % this year to 480.6 bn yuan ( $ 70.2bn ; £ 50 bn ) .
The money will pay for better salaries , modernisation , and " capacity building programmes " including counter - terrorism and disaster relief , a spokesman said .
China 's military is for self - protection and does not pose a threat to any country , said official Li Zhaoxing .
Analysts say defence spending is higher than the official figure , but Beijing says there are no hidden outlays .
" There is no such thing as so - called hidden military expenditure in China , " said Mr Li at a news conference in Beijing .
' Relatively modest '
The new military budget was released on the eve of the annual session of the National People 's Congress , China 's parliament .
Mr Li described the increase as modest , saying that China wanted to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity " and would not threaten any country " .
Analysts say the increase marks the 19th double - digit boost in defence spending by China in the last 20 years .
Previous increases in defence spending have been greeted by alarm from China 's neighbours and the US , who have voiced concerns over Beijing 's modernisation of its military .
The BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing says that many people in China point out that - per capita - China 's spending is still relatively modest .
They also say that China 's military budget is still about eight times smaller than the military budget of the US , our correspondent adds .
The US military budget for 2009 has been pegged at $ 515bn , a 7.5 % increase from 2008 .
That figure does not include billions of dollars for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

When insurance giant American International Group Inc. imploded last fall , the firm ’s problems were quickly blamed not on its core insurance business but on an obscure operation that traded exotic mortgage securities .
But as the economic crisis deepens , it has become clear that AIG ’s problems extend across most of its business lines , including its massive life insurance and retirement services operations , which reported a staggering $ 18 - billion quarterly loss this month .
The company ’s situation is emblematic of problems across the life insurance industry , which is suffering deep losses on investments that underlie policies for millions of American families .
So far , some of the biggest companies have suffered sharp drops in their stock prices , and many of them are asking for federal assistance .
Advertisement
Industry conditions last year were the worst in memory and are expected to grow deeper this year amid credit rating downgrades , declining revenue and investment losses , according to credit rating firm A.M. Best Co .
The worst - case scenario is that a second financial crisis is looming if these life insurance companies come under too much stress .
“ It was essentially a house of cards at AIG , ” said Donn Vickrey , a forensic accountant and co-founder of Gradient Analytics in Scottsdale , Ariz .
“ I would characterize other life insurers as suffering varying degrees of risk . ”
The financial problems , Vickrey said , may not be as serious as the disaster that swept over some parts of the banking industry , but insurers have not been subject to the same level of scrutiny as banks , and some experts say much remains unknown about their condition .

When the life insurance industry ultimately stabilizes , the financial landscape will be different , along with the once - dominant AIG .
Unfair advantage ?
Two key pieces of AIG ’s life insurance and retirement products operations are Los Angeles - based SunAmerica Inc. , which sells retirement annuities , and Houston - based American General Life .
Last fall , AIG tried to sell off its life insurance and retirement products units with the idea of preserving its core business of property and casualty insurance .
Advertisement
But by March 2 , AIG retirement services chief Jay Wintrob wrote to employees in an internal message that the sales were more or less on the back burner .
Wintrob is now considering a consolidation of SunAmerica and American General .
Both operations say they are well capitalized and have many times the minimum required level of reserves to meet their obligations to their 17 million customers .
Credit rating agencies have cut their assessments of the firms , though they remain well above levels that would indicate vulnerability .
The companies ’ survival is due to a unique advantage : AIG is the only insurance company that is a major recipient of taxpayer bailout funds .
The company has received commitments from the Treasury Department for $ 70 billion and lines of credit for tens of billions more .

“ With the support and cooperation of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , AIG now has a new set of tools to reduce its debt , strengthen its capital base and enhance the value of its core business , ” Wintrob wrote in his message to employees .
Without that lifeline , all of AIG ’s operations -- and the welfare of its customers -- could be in a lot more trouble , according to securities analysts , insurance industry experts and credit rating agencies .
Other insurers are now asking the federal government for bailout packages , arguing that AIG has an unfair competitive advantage .
The Treasury Department and various oversight boards are uncertain how much of the taxpayer assistance went to AIG ’s retirement and life insurance operations .
But credit rating firms say that without that assistance , there would have been a substantial downgrade to AIG ’s ratings .
Advertisement
Its current ratings reflect “ our view that the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve will continue their financial support of and commitment to AIG , ” said Kevin Ahern , an analyst who follows the company for Standard & Poor ’s Rating Services .
Ahern said the federal bailout of AIG kept the credit rating for AIG ’s holding company six notches higher than it would be otherwise , and without that support the company ’s credit would sink below investment grade .
AIG ’s loss of $ 18 billion in its life insurance and retirement businesses in the fourth quarter was about the same amount that the company lost in its financial services operation , which was trading in credit default swaps and other risky instruments .
The losses for the retirement and life insurance operations came on the falling value of investments that were being furiously sold and marked down as the stock market collapsed last year .
The company said that if not for those investment losses , the operations would have been profitable .

SunAmerica , which has operations in Century City and Woodland Hills , sells variable annuities , which are retirement policies that provide a stream of payments , generally based on how well securities markets perform .
The company has assets of $ 158 billion and nearly 6 million customers .
But those policies often have embedded guarantees , meaning that benefits can only drop so low before the company has to take a hit , said Joseph Belth , a nationally known insurance expert and retired Indiana University professor .
“ Different variables have different embedded guarantees , ” Belth said .
“ But they all have one thing in common :
The company takes on a risk if there is a dramatic decline in the stock market .
And they no doubt never dreamed of the kind of stock market collapse like we have had .
“ It seems to me that if AIG had not gotten the federal money , they would have had to declare bankruptcy , ” Belth said .

Belth said in a bankruptcy , state regulators would continue to operate the subsidiaries and maintain existing insurance policies .
‘ More aggressive ’
Critics say the company brought some of its troubles on itself by engaging in risky securities practices .
In some cases , it was betting against its own long - term interests .
“ AIG investments were more aggressive , relative to other insurers , across all of their business , including life and casualty insurance , ” said Paul Newsome , an insurance analyst at investment banking firm Sandler O’Neill & Partners .
Advertisement
In a statement , AIG disputed that , saying their products carry about the average amount of risk for the industry .
“ This claim is misleading and inaccurate , ” AIG spokesman John Pluhowski said .
“ The company has maintained a generally conservative , middle - of - the - road stance on living benefits for many years . ”
But other analysts go much further in criticizing the company ’s practices .
Overall , AIG made “ the most egregious investment decisions I have ever seen , ” Vickrey said .
“ It was extremely high risk with very high levels of leverage and insufficient hedging . ”
Advertisement
AIG , along with others , began offering in recent years specialized variable annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits , Vickrey said .
The assumptions underlying these contracts turned out to be wildly optimistic , he said .
As a result , AIG is on the hook to deliver guaranteed benefits despite the fact that , even if it had invested prudently , it would not have earned a sufficient return to make good on the obligation , he added .
Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama , the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , said AIG ’s life insurance companies also played a very risky game of lending out long - term securities and investing cash collateral for those loans in securities backed by subprime mortgages .
When the mortgage market collapsed , AIG life insurance firms took a $ 21 - billion loss , Shelby said at a Senate hearing this month .
Only because those AIG life insurers were able to tap $ 17 billion in federal assistance were they able to meet policyholder claims , he said .

One of President Obama 's applause lines is that his climate tax policies will create new green jobs " that ca n't be outsourced . "
But if that 's true , why is his main energy adviser floating a new carbon tariff on imports ?
Welcome to the coming cap and trade war .
Energy Secretary Steven
Chu made the protectionist point during an underreported House hearing this month , when he said tariffs and other trade barriers could be used as a " weapon " to force countries like China and India into cutting their own CO2 emissions .
" If other ...
" State regulation extinguishes biodiversity , " Dr. Shiva explains in a 2008 paper , " and pushes all farmers into dependency on patented , corporate seed .
Such compulsory licensing has been the main vehicle of destruction of biodiversity and farmers rights in U.S. and Europe . "
Shiva regards seeds as the embodiment of democracy , in their natural abundance and diversity .
TRIPS legitimizes monopoly , forbidding farmers to save seeds .
Cargill ( now owned by Monsanto , she asserted ) hailed its GM seeds because they prevented bees from " usurping the pollen . "
And we wonder where the bees have gone .
" The aim of the seed industry is a trillion dollars of profits from royalties every year .
The aim is no farmer should have access to their own seed .
The aim is every farmer should be forced into the market every year .
" You can only do that by using multiple instruments of control over the seed .
The first instrument ... is the intellectual property laws covering both patents as well as breeder 's rights ... "
She scoffs at the absurdity of patent laws that recognize manipulation as akin to invention .
A seed is not an invention .
The seed was here before humans .
" All you can do with a seed is manipulate it .
Manipulation has never been treated as creation .
It 's often treated as cruelty .
I would call GM cruelty to seed . "
She spends a few moments discussing the Orwellian term " substantial equivalence . "
Mega - corporations assert intellectual property rights for manipulating nature into creating something " new " or " novel . "
But , do n't worry , they tell us , it 's not THAT new ; it 's ' substantially equivalent ' to what nature created .
Well , either it's a brand new invention ( and thus patentable ) or it 's not .
We are not swayed by the double speak of psychopathy .
Informed farmers in the US reject the slew of new bills requiring registration and disclosure of seeds and animals .
Wisconsin farmer , Paul Griepentrog , has been involved in raising produce , livestock and direct marketing the past 30 years .
He now collaborates with several groups and individuals to halt the sudden onslaught of " food safety " bills that seek to hyper - regulate the small and medium farms .
" Insane laws were passed [ in Wisconsin ] ... in which even a pile of hay or manure would be a punishable offense as they may harbor rodents .
That sounds good , but how am I to store hay in round bales for livestock ? "
Dr. Shiva explains the nefarious intent behind hyper- regulation of small and medium sized farms :
" You can only have a monopoly on seed thru patent if you have had a closure on the alternative supply .
Because why on earth would farmers pay royalties every year if they could have free seed they could save year in and year out ?
To create that closure , the industry has evolved compulsory licensing and registration laws ....
" This basically means farmers can't have their own seeds .
They must only grow seeds that are licensed .
They must have approval from the State . "

Unemployed for a year and with an ailing wife at home , Mike Hammer stepped out of his truck in a Concord strip mall and walked into the heart of one of the most sophisticated private welfare systems in the country .
Here , in a plain white box of a building , Hammer and other Mormons come to get groceries - everything from produce to meats , much of which comes from Mormon - owned farms and cattle ranches .
Others come for counseling , employment help and a self - canning facility , where observant Mormons can up to a year 's worth of food supplies in the event of an emergency .
All services in the building , known as a Bishops ' Storehouse , are intended to promote Mormon self - sufficiency .
" I 'm not asking for money or somebody to do things for me , " said Hammer , 36 , a Brentwood father of three who carried away bread , milk , eggs , cheese , fruits and vegetables .
" It 's eased up finances a little bit . "
The breadth and sophistication of Mormon social networks was glimpsed during the Proposition 8 campaign .
But the recession and the increased demand it 's putting on Mormon storehouses give a unique look into the elaborate organization of a religious group gaining influence in America .
" They 're damn sophisticated people , for sure , " said Rodney Stark , professor of sociology of religion at Baylor University and the author of " The Rise of Mormonism . "
What makes the 110 storehouses around the country remarkable is that they are part of a system run almost entirely by volunteers .
They grow the food on Mormon - owned farms , and package it at the storehouses .
Volunteers drive trucks and deliver the food to distant wards - what Mormons call their sanctuaries - if recipients live more than 30 miles from a storehouse .
As the recession has deepened , the church says it has seamlessly kept up with demand that increased 20 percent over the past year .
But the intensely private church declined to say how many people or how much food that represented .
The volunteers include Wayne Bishop , 65 , a retired electrical engineer from Pleasanton who is on an 18 - month stint , spending roughly 20 hours a week co-managing the Concord storehouse .
" It 's part of our dedication to the church , " said Bishop .
A calling
Volunteers are " called " to their roles .
Callings , in religious terms , are often thought of as inner motivations .
But for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , as the church is formally known , someone actually calls .
The volunteers are selected by bishops , the individuals who oversee wards , or stake presidents , who oversee clusters of wards .
Bishops and stake presidents are themselves volunteers , creating a lay priesthood that defines the grassroots nature of the faith .
The actual president of the entire church , currently Thomas S. Monson , is considered a divine prophet .
Some volunteer as a way to pay back the help they 've received .
Others volunteering at the Concord storehouse said they feel no pressure - and that they always have the choice to refuse .
The motivation is religious .
" We really feel and believe 100 percent that our church is led by a prophet of God , " said Diane Pergrossi , 61 , who is on an 18 - month calling to stock shelves and fill food delivery bins in the storehouse .
" The people he has helping him are also inspired .
It comes down to faith . "
With 5.9 million members nationally and 750,000 in California , the church has a lot of volunteers to choose from .
Observant Mormons are expected to volunteer some of their time regularly .
" The local bishop has all sorts of people for whom he 's got to find things to do , " said Stark , the sociology of religion professor .
Stark has known elderly Mormons who get taken to doctors ' appointments or have their houses painted .
" They 've got this enormous firepower to do all sorts of things . "
In addition to tithing 10 percent of their income , adherent church members fast for two meals a month and contribute the cost of those meals to the church 's welfare programs , which include the storehouses .
Lay leadership gives the church members a more personal and mystical connection to faith , Stark said , and it also means the church is run with the professional expertise its members can bring from successful business careers .
Church officials say those who've served on the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , the church 's highest leaders after the president , have included an airline industry executive , a Utah Supreme Court justice , an attorney and a heart surgeon .
This dynamic , Stark said , " makes for a very strong church . "
A long story
The origin of the storehouses stretches back to the church 's early roots .
Fleeing persecution , church members in 1847 began a series of journeys to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah .
They created storehouses of grains and other goods along the trail to ease the journey for later groups .
During the Great Depression , the current concept of storehouses was formally established .
The then - president of the church , Heber J. Grant , said that he had a revelation from God about the welfare system created by the New Deal .
" Our primary purpose was to set up , insofar as it might be possible , a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with , the evils of a dole abolished , and independence , industry , thrift and self - respect be once more established amongst our people , " Grant said , according to church officials .
The faith community 's self - reliance has been invaluable to people like Laura DeVoe , whose husband , a general contractor , has had only sporadic work for three years .
The Castro Valley family of three has come to the storehouse for food for the past four months .
" We 're not able to pay bills or buy food , " said DeVoe , 36 .
She said what they get from the church goes beyond food .
Their landlord , who is also Mormon , has let them do work instead of paying rent .
She said he told her to " pay what you can , but pay your tithing first . "
DeVoe , who supplements with food stamps what the church does n't provide , said the help has eased much of the stress during this difficult time .
" I know that when we go to church and do what we 're supposed to be doing , the Lord blesses us , " she said .
" We 're able to be a tight - knit family . "
Much has been made lately of the Obama 's pursuit of a puppy for their daughters .
As we all wait to finally put an end to the national disgrace that is the George W. Bush presidency , a little distraction from the doom and gloom is more than welcomed by a giddy American populace anxious to move on .
And while this obsession ( the photo above was the # 1 emailed photo at yahoo.com this week ) probably says something about the American people there are some more serious aspects to this story , beyond a simple promise made by the Obama's to their daughters Malia and Sasha .
The above photo shows Obama with " Baby , " a three - legged dog that lost its fourth limb following years of mistreatment at a California puppy mill .
The toy poodle spent much of its life locked in a small wire cage .
The breeders cut out Baby 's vocal chords so that they would not have to hear her cries .
In cages next to her , other dogs literally went insane , spinning repetitively with blank stares .
Still others were gravely ill , maimed and had filthy , matted coats .
A number was tattooed on the inside of Baby 's ear , marking her as just one of many dogs at the mill .
Barack Obama posed for this picture for Jana Kohl 's book A Rare Breed of Love.
Obama has co-sponsored Dick Durbin's
Bill to crack down on abusive puppy mills , and has earned the first ever presidential endorsement from the Humane Society .
The Obama 's desire to get a shelter dog has inspired great interest in animal advocacy sites such as Petfinder.com and the ASPCA .

Congressman says Hersh claims should be subject of formal probe
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , March 16 , 2009
Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) has called for a formal Congressional probe into allegations by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh that former Vice - President Dick Cheney had his own SS - style political assassination unit .
Kucinich made the call Friday in a letter to Chairman Edolphus Towns of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee which has been published on the Congressman ’s website .
Kucinich explains in the letter that , “ Mr. Hersh made the allegation before an audience at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday , March 10 , 2009 .
He stated , ‘ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving …
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office . . . Congress has no oversight of it . ’”
“ If true , these operations violate longstanding U.S. policy regarding covert actions and illegally bypass Congressional oversight , ” Kucinich adds .
“ Hersh is within a year or more of releasing a book that is said to include evidence of this allegation .
However , we cannot wait a year or more to establish the truth . ”
The claims were made by the Award - winning New Yorker writer last Tuesday when he told a University of Minnesota audience “ After 9/11 , I have n’t written about this yet , but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hersh then went on to describe how the Joint Special Operations Command was an executive assassination unit that carried out political `assassinations abroad . .
“ It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently , ” he explained .
“ They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
…
Congress has no oversight of it . ”
In our exclusive story last weekend we detailed how the assassination unit was not a creation of the Bush administration or Dick Cheney .
The Joint Special Operations Command , has in fact been active for decades , has been deployed domestically in the U.S. , has killed U.S. citizens , and continues as an integral part of Barack Obama ’s expanded wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Kucinich has previously targeted the former Vice President , when in April 2007 , he filed an impeachment resolution against Cheney charging manipulation of evidence regarding Iraq ’s weapons capabilities prior to the invasion of 2003 .
The measure was blocked by the Democratic leadership , as were articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush in June 2008 .
The full text of Kucinich ’s letter follows :
March 13 , 2009
The Honorable Edolphus Towns
Chairman
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
U.S. House of Representatives
2157 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington , DC 20515
Dear Chairman
Towns :
As you may already be aware , recent media reports indicate that investigative reporter , Seymour Hersh , while answering questions before a public audience at the University of Minnesota divulged information about what he calls an “ executive assassination ring ” operating under the George W. Bush Administration .
If substantiated , the allegation would have far reaching implications for the United States .
Such an assertion from someone of Hersh ’s credibility that has a long and proven track record of dependability on these issues merits attention .
Mr. Hersh is within a year or more of releasing a book that is said to include evidence of this allegation .
However , we cannot wait a year or more to establish the truth .
As such , I request that the Full Committee immediately begin an investigation to determine the facts in this matter .
Mr. Hersh made the allegation before an audience at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday , March 10 , 2009 .
He stated , “ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving . ”
Mr. Hersh continued , “ It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently , ” he explained .
“ They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office . . . Congress has no oversight of it . ”
If true , these operations violate longstanding U.S. policy regarding covert actions and illegally bypass Congressional oversight .
Current statute governing covert action ( 50 U.S.C. 413b ) requires a presidential finding and notification to the appropriate congressional committees .
Additionally , Executive Order 12333 clearly states that “ [ n ] o person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in or conspire to engage in assassination . ”
I urge the Committee to explore Mr. Hersh ’s allegation .
Please do not hesitate to call on me or my staff if we can be of assistance .
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congress

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Like swapping a Lamborghini for a Ford Fiesta , some credit card users are switching to the safer , less expensive payment vehicle of prepaid cards as the economy continues to travel downhill .
They ’re known as general purpose reloaded cards , and they serve as budgeting tools for those looking to trim spending , and as mobile bank accounts for those just needing a card - based way to spend .
The cards are convenient :
They can be used at any merchant that accepts the Visa , Discover , American Express or MasterCard logo on the card , and they are growing in use : About $ 7.1 billion will be loaded on them in 2009 , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2007 , according to the Mercator Advisory Group , a research and advisory firm for the payment industry .
“ Because of the economy , there is a shift with more consumers going from credit to debit and prepaid , ” Brent Watters , director of marketing for Mercator Advisory Group says .
“ People are reluctant to use credit , and it ’s pushing them to another payment vehicle . ”
Three companies , Green Dot Corporation , the NetSpend Corporation and n FinanSe Inc. , are helping with that push by managing and distributing the prepaid cards to a large number of supermarkets , drug stores and check - cashing services .
The companies also provide the software , hardware and customer support needed to control all the cards , according to a New York Times article .
It works like this :
Say you are spending too much on dinner every week and you need a way to budget that money .
Instead of allotting some cash in an envelope for dinner , you go to Walgreens , Dollar General , Albertsons or another retailer and pick out a prepaid card .
You buy the card for about $ 6 and load whatever amount of money on it you ’ll need for a week of dinner .
The company that distributed the card , whether it be nFinanSe Inc. or another , gets some of that $ 6 , plus maintenance , reload and other fees , and you get a well balanced dinner .
“ Even folks that already have a debit card are using a prepaid card to control spending or to budget , ” Watters says .
Other than consumers who need to plug their spending , folks without a bank account are also looking at prepaid cards because they do n’t include the credit checks and minimum account balances banks require .
They ’re convenient for large purchases , too , which is nice for someone who ca n’t get or does n’t want a credit card .
No one can seem to agree as to how many Americans are without a bank account , so the statistic varies greatly — somewhere between 10 and 56 million .
Determining that number is difficult because some researchers count users of prepaid cards as having a bank account , and some do n’t .
And the diverse banking regulatory system , with some banks federally regulated and some regulated by states , makes it tricky to sum up how many accounts there are and how many there are n’t .
Regardless what that number might be , it ’s certain the companies providing prepaid cards are growing .
Green
Dot started selling general purpose reloaded cards in 2001 to chains such as Kroger and Walgreens .
Today , they are selling to the retail giant Wal - Mart and pulling in $ 350 million in annual revenue , according to their website .
Austin , Texas - based Netspend has about $ 180 million in annual revenue and 300 employees .
And nFinanSe , which was founded in 2000 , now has 80,000 cards distributed through Dollar General and Winn - Dixie supermarkets .
So whether you ’re looking to reduce spending or just a new way to spend , be on the lookout for these payment vehicles to take off in the next couple years .

As I have previously pointed out , Paul Krugman is calling for the U.S. and Europe to spend an amount equal to 4 % of their gross domestic products on the financial crisis .
Today , Bloomberg notes :
The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent , lent or committed $ 12.8 trillion , an amount that approaches the value of everything produced in the country last year , to stem the longest recession since the 1930s .
In other words , instead of spending 4 % of GDP , the U.S. is committing to spending close to 100 % .
This dwarfs spending during the New Deal :
For those who argue that much of the trillions being spent today is in the form of loans and guarantees , I would argue that taxpayers will never see most of this money ever again .
It is spent , and gone .
Indeed , most of the financial giants which the loans were made to are insolvent and will be out of business in a couple of years .

Girl Scout Malia Mailes is being hailed in her hometown of La Cañada Flintridge for her crusade -- and her prescience .
Malia , a 16 - year - old La Cañada High School sophomore , had been warning for months about the safety problems posed by trucks driving downhill on Angeles Crest Highway .
Then on Wednesday , a big rig lost control on the road , barreled through an intersection and smashed into a bookstore , killing two people and injuring 12 others .
Now some residents are wondering why more people did n’t heed Malia ’s warnings .

Malia began her crusade last year after a truck carrying 78,000 pounds of onions lost its brakes and careened into a parking lot at Foothill Boulevard and Angeles Crest Highway in La Cañada Flintridge .
Malia found , among other things , a lack of signage and a lack of regulation for trucks using Angeles Crest Highway .
The review , prepared for the Girl Scouts Gold Award and put together in a Power Point presentation , was shown to the La Cañada Flintridge City Council in early March .
City officials then forwarded it to Caltrans , urging the agency to act .

When Malia heard about Wednesday night ’s accident , she rushed to the scene .
On Thursday , city officials invited her to speak at a news conference about the crash .
“ I was absolutely devastated , and I was wondering what more I could have done , ” said Malia , adding that she cried at first and then got mad .
Mayor Laura Olhasso praised Malia ’s work , but said she was disappointed that the response to the safety issues she raised was n’t greater .

“ I thought it was impressive , thorough and understood the importance of the issue , ” she said .

A man who fatally stabbed his partner after an argument about her heavy use of a Playstation was sentenced today to at least 14 years in prison .
Malcolm Palmer pleaded guilty to the murder of Carol Cannom in front of the couple 's 10 - year - old son on 18 November last year at their home in Long Sutton in northern England .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cannom suffered at least 30 knife wounds , and their son was slightly injured while trying to pull his father away during the attack .
Judge Michael Heath in Lincoln Crown Court sentenced Palmer to life in prison , with a minimum term of 14 years .
During the trial , the judge said Palmer believed the couple 's relationship had deteriorated because of Cannom 's devotion to the Playstation electronic games system .
She would stay up as late as 5 am playing games on a big - screen television in a warm bedroom while Palmer was exiled to an unheated conservatory , Heath said .
Palmer , who has three children with his partner , believed she was having an affair after reading text messages on her mobile phone .
The couple 's daughter , Claire Scott , 26 , said outside the court that because her parents had paid off their mortgage and did n't need to work , " they had a lot of time on their hands and little chance to get away from each other . "
She described her mother as a lonely woman who was n't having an affair , but simply sent a few text messages .
" Playing on the Playstation a lot ... was just a release , a bit of escapism , neither of them were happy by that time , " Scott added .

" For me this conviction is not easy .

The headlines are gone , and MSNBC no longer cares .
But that 's all the more reason to take note of the strange and disturbing turn in the Ted Stevens legal saga .
Prosecutors claimed this senior Senatorial scalp last year , winning an ethics conviction a fortnight before the octogenarian Republican narrowly lost his bid for a seventh term from Alaska .
Though media interest stopped there , the story has since become one of ambitious prosecutors who at the very least botched the job and may have miscarried justice .

This is part one of what will be a two part series on the most influential scientists in history .
While these are not technically the “ greatest ” scientists , there is bound to be some overlap as the contributions that many of these men and women made to science are among the most important .

10 Marie Curie 1867 – 1934
“ One never notices what has been done ; one can only see what remains to be done . ”
Polish physicist and chemist , Marie Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity , the only person honored with Nobel Prizes in two different sciences , and the first female professor at the University of Paris .
She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw .
Her husband Pierre Curie was also a Nobel laureate , as were her daughter Irene Joliot - Curie and son - in - law Frederic Joliot - Curie .
Her achievements include the creation of a theory of radioactivity ( a term coined by her ) , techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes , and the discovery of two new elements , radium and polonium .
It was also under her personal direction that the world ’s first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms ( “ cancers ” ) , using radioactive isotopes .
While an actively loyal French citizen , she never lost her sense of Polish identity .
She named the first new chemical element that she discovered ( 1898 ) “ polonium ” for her native country , and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute in her hometown Warsaw , headed by her physician - sister Bronis ?awa .
9 Alan Turing 1912 – 1954
“ Science is a differential equation .
Religion is a boundary condition . ”
English mathematician and logician , Turing is often considered to be the father of modern computer science .
He provided an influential formalization of the concept of the algorithm and computation with the Turing machine .
With the Turing test , meanwhile , he made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence : whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is conscious and can think .
He later worked at the National Physical Laboratory , creating one of the first designs for a stored - program computer , the ACE , although it was never actually built in its full form .
In 1948 , he moved to the University of Manchester to work on the Manchester Mark I , then emerging as one of the world ’s earliest true computers .
During the Second World War , Turing worked at Bletchley Park , the UK ’s code breaking centre , and was for a time head of Hut 8 , the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis .
He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers , including the method of the bombe , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine .
8 Niels Bohr 1885 – 1962
“ An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field . ”
Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics , for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 .
Bohr ’s work helped solve the problems classical physics could not explain about the nuclear model of the atom .
He postulated that electrons moved in fixed orbits around the atom ’s nucleus , and he explained how they emitted or absorbed energy .
Bohr mentored and collaborated with many of the top physicists of the century at his institute in Copenhagen .
He was also part of the team of physicists working on the Manhattan Project .
One of his sons , Aage Niels Bohr , grew up to be an important physicist who , like his father , received the Nobel Prize , in 1975 .
Bohr has been described as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century .
7 Max Planck 1858 – 1947
“ We have no right to assume that any physical laws exist , or if they have existed up to now , that they will continue to exist in a similar manner in the future . ”
Max Planck , a German physicist , is considered to be the founder of quantum theory , and one of the most important physicists of the twentieth century .
Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics , but his fame rests primarily on his role as originator of the quantum theory .
This theory revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes , just as Albert Einstein ’s theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time .
Together they constitute the fundamental theories of 20th - century physics .
His discoveries have led to industrial and military applications that affect every aspect of modern life .
6 Charles Darwin 1809 – 1882
“ I love fools ’ experiments .
I am always making them . ”
English naturalist and biologist , Darwin demonstrated that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors through the process he called natural selection .
The fact that evolution occurs became accepted by the scientific community and the general public in his lifetime , while his theory of natural selection came to be widely seen as the primary explanation of the process of evolution in the 1930s , and now forms the basis of modern evolutionary theory .
In modified form , Darwin ’s scientific discovery remains the foundation of biology , as it provides a unifying logical explanation for the diversity of life .
His 1859 book
On the Origin of Species established evolution by common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature .
He also examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex , followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals .
In recognition of Darwin ’s pre-eminence , he was one of only five 19th century UK non-royal personages to be honored by a state funeral .
5 Leonardo da Vinci 1452 – 1519
“ Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence ; he is just using his memory . ”
Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath .
He was an expert mathematician , engineer , inventor , anatomist , painter , sculptor , architect , botanist , musician and writer .
Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the “ Renaissance man ” , a man whose seemingly infinite curiosity was equalled only by his powers of invention .
Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity .
He conceptualized a helicopter , a tank , concentrated solar power , a calculator , the double hull and outlined a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics .
Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime , but some of his smaller inventions , such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire , entered the world of manufacturing unheralded .
As a scientist , he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy , civil engineering , optics , and hydrodynamics .
4 Galileo Galilei 1564 – 1642
“ All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered ; the point is to discover them . ”
Galileo was an Italian physicist and astronomer .
His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations , and support for Copernicanism .
Galileo has been called the “ father of modern observational astronomy ” , the “ father of modern physics ” , the “ father of science ” , and “ the Father of Modern Science . ”
The motion of uniformly accelerated objects , taught in nearly all high school and introductory college physics courses , was studied by Galileo as the subject of kinematics .
His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus , the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter , named the Galilean moons in his honor , and the observation and analysis of sunspots .
Galileo also worked in applied science and technology , improving compass design .
Galileo ’s championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime .
The geocentric view had been dominant since the time of Aristotle , and the controversy engendered by Galileo ’s presentation of heliocentrism as proven fact resulted in the Catholic Church ’s prohibiting its advocacy because it was not empirically proven at the time .
Galileo was eventually forced to recant his heliocentrism and spent the last years of his life under house arrest on orders of the Holy Inquisition .
3 Nikola Tesla 1856 – 1943
“ The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly .
One must be sane to think clearly , but one can think deeply and be quite insane . ”
Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist and inventor of the modern age , a man who “ shed light over the face of Earth ” .
He is best known for many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Tesla ’s patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current electric power ( AC ) systems , including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor , with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution .
Contemporary biographers of Tesla have regarded him as “ The Father of Physics ” , “ The man who invented the twentieth century ” and “ the patron saint of modern electricity . ”
Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering , Tesla has contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics , remote control , radar and computer science , and to the expansion of ballistics , nuclear physics , and theoretical physics .
In 1943 , the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor of the radio .
Many of his achievements have been used , with some controversy , to support various pseudosciences , UFO theories , and early New Age occultism .
2 Albert Einstein 1879 – 1955
“ A man should look for what is , and not for what he thinks should be . ”
Einstein , a German physicist , is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence , expressed by the equation E = mc2 .
Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “ for his services to Theoretical Physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect .
Einstein ’s many contributions to physics include his special theory of relativity , which reconciled mechanics with electromagnetism , and his general theory of relativity , which was intended to extend the principle of relativity to non-uniform motion and to provide a new theory of gravitation .
His other contributions include advances in the fields of relativistic cosmology , capillary action , critical opalescence , classical problems of statistical mechanics and their application to quantum theory , an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules , atomic transition probabilities , the quantum theory of a monatomic gas , thermal properties of light with low radiation density ( which laid the foundation for the photon theory ) , a theory of radiation including stimulated emission , the conception of a unified field theory , and the geometrization of physics .
Einstein published over 300 scientific works and over 150 non-scientific works .
The physics community reveres Einstein , and in 1999 Time magazine named him the “ Person of the Century ” .
In wider culture the name “ Einstein ” has become synonymous with genius .
1 Isaac Newton 1643 – 1727
“ To myself I am only a child playing on the beach , while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me . ”
Newton was an English physicist , mathematician , astronomer , natural philosopher , alchemist , theologian and one of the most influential men in human history .
His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , published in 1687 , is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science .
In this work , Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion , laying the groundwork for classical mechanics , which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering .
Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler ’s laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation , thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution .
In mechanics , Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum .
In optics , he built the first “ practical ” reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into a visible spectrum .
He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
In mathematics , Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus .
He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem , developed the so - called “ Newton ’s method ” for approximating the zeroes of a function , and contributed to the study of power series .
Newton ’s stature among scientists remains at the very top rank , as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists in Britain ’s Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science , Newton was deemed much more influential than Albert Einstein .

MONTANA HAS IT RIGHT ON SECOND AMENDMENT
By Chuck Baldwin
March 3 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
According to ABC News ( Feb. 25 , 2009 ) , " The Obama administration will seek to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 during the Bush administration , Attorney General Eric Holder said today .
" ' As President Obama indicated during the campaign , there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make , and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons , ' Holder told reporters . "
Holder also said that President Obama would seek to make the assault weapons ban permanent , close the " gun show loophole , " and ban " cop - killer " bullets .
At this point , I believe it is incumbent on me to say that both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have made a career out of doing everything in their power to strip the American people of their right to keep and bear arms .
Even under the rubric of the abovementioned " few gun-related changes , " there is the potential for widespread assault against our Second Amendment .
For example , the so - called " assault weapons " ban is as phony as the Bush - Obama stimulus spending bills -- and just as fraudulent .
A semi-automatic rifle , which is incapable of automatic fire , is not an " assault weapon . "
By definition , an assault weapon must be capable of fully automatic fire .
A civilian AR - 15 - style rifle -- in any configuration -- is functionally identical to any semi-automatic hunting rifle .
In fact , many hunters commonly use AR - 15 - style rifles for all types of hunting , both predator and big game .
The term " assault weapon " is simply a dangerous - sounding moniker that makes it easy for a compliant media to intimidate the public and public officials into passing a ban against semi-automatic rifles .
Furthermore , does anyone believe that if Obama and Holder were successful in outlawing semi-automatic rifles , pump and bolt - action rifles would not also be targeted ?
Get real !
I well remember gun control zealots during the Clinton years railing against bolt - action rifles , calling them " sniper " rifles .
And once rifles are outlawed , how long would it be before handguns and shotguns would fall victim to a similar fate ?
As always , the issue for these people is not what type of firearm it is ; the issue is the infringement of the right of the people to keep and bear arms -- any arms .
Of course , the " gun show loophole " is nothing more than the prohibition against private citizens selling and trading their own personal firearms .
I would like to remind the Obamas and Holders of this country that liberty is not a " loophole . "
In the beginning , the private sale and trading of firearms was almost exclusively the purpose for which gun shows were started .
Today , commercial firearms dealers dominate gun shows , but it is still a convenient marketplace for citizens to buy and trade guns .
This is a freedom and right that is as old as the country itself .
Shoot ( pun intended ) !
I remember when we were free to buy guns from a Sears & Roebuck catalog .
And as to banning " cop - killer " bullets , what bullet is not capable of killing ?
Any bullet that is not capable of killing a good guy is not capable of killing a bad guy ( be it two - legged or four ) .
This is just another approach to the same goal : the infringement of the right to keep and bear arms .
Obviously , any gun without a bullet is pretty much useless .
The Democrats went down this road in 1994 .
Are they really willing to go down the same road again ?
It looks like they are .
It was largely an aggressive gun control agenda that caused the Republicans to sweep both houses of Congress in 1994 and render Bill Clinton without a majority in either chamber .
It was also an aggressive gun control agenda that caused Al Gore to lose the Presidential election in 2000 .
Even Bill Clinton publicly acknowledged that fact .
All of that said , however , the underlying reality is that it is the individual States that must ultimately be guardians of the Second Amendment ( and the rest of the Bill of Rights , of course ) .
States must be willing to resist any and all efforts by the central government to intrude upon their independence , sovereignty , and liberties .
If this was not the case , why did the individual States not dissolve after the federal government was created by the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 ?
Why ?
Because the States were deemed to be superior entities .
Superior in assignment .
Superior in responsibility .
Superior in nature .
Superior in scope .

As James Madison said in the Federalist Papers , No. 45 , " The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined .
Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite . "
Therefore , when the federal government begins to intrude upon the rights and liberties of the people , it is the responsibility of the States to resist .
Obviously , the way the federal government tries to keep States in subjection is through bribery : by threatening to deny federal tax dollars unless States comply with their despotic machinations .
And , sadly , most States have succumbed to this menacing temptation for far , far too long .
The good news is that States are finally beginning to fight back .
According to NewsWithViews and WorldNetDaily , " So far , eight states have introduced resolutions declaring state sovereignty under the Ninth and Tenth Amendment to the Constitution , including Arizona , Hawaii , Montana , Michigan , Missouri , New Hampshire , Oklahoma and Washington .
" Analysts expect that in addition , another 20 states may see similar measures introduced this year , including Alaska , Alabama , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Georgia , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Nevada , Maine and Pennsylvania . "
Pertaining specifically to the Second Amendment , the State of Montana , in particular , seems to have it all together .
In anticipation of the recent Heller Supreme Court decision , a host of Montana 's senators and representatives -- along with its Secretary of State -- proposed a resolution stating " that any ' collective rights ' holding in D.C. v. Heller will violate Montana 's compact with the United States , the contract by which Montana entered the Union in 1889 . "
In essence , the Montana resolution recalls , " When Montana entered into statehood and adopted the Compact as a part of the Montana Constitution in 1889 , included was a provision guaranteeing the right to bear arms to ' any person . ' "
The resolution continues , " To be clear , the wording of the right to bear arms reservation in the Montana constitution is exactly the same today as it was in 1884 . "
Furthermore , the Montana resolution says , " There is no question that the contract into which Montana entered for statehood was predicated upon an understanding that the people of Montana would benefit from an individual and personal right to bear arms , protected from governmental interference by both the federal and Montana constitutions .
That was the clear intent of the parties to the contract . "
The resolution ended by stating sternly , " A collective rights holding in Heller would not only open the Pandora 's box of unilaterally morphing contracts , it would also poise Montana to claim appropriate and historically entrenched remedies for contract violation . "
In other words , representatives and senators in the State of Montana unequivocally put Washington , D.C. , on notice that it would not tolerate the infringement of its citizens ' right to keep and bear arms .
I do n't think I 'm reading anything into the resolution by assuming that they were implying that they would secede before they let the federal government trample their Second Amendment liberties .
( Plus , I 've just been told that New Hampshire may also be preparing to propose such a resolution . )
Montana has it exactly right !
Now it is time for every State legislative body in America that believes in the Second Amendment to step up to the plate and let Barack Obama , Eric Holder , and the rest of these gun-grabbing socialists know that they will not tolerate even one more attempt to infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms -- and that includes any so - called " assault weapons " ban .

And let 's never forget that the purpose of the Second Amendment was not to ensure the rights of hunters , but of citizens to protect themselves -- and their States -- against the tyrannical tendencies of their own government .

Chantel Harewood , 18 , a college student who grew up in the neighborhood , ordered food from Mr. Jabbar and said she liked the new name .
“ Why not ?
It ’s history , ” she said .
“ All these stereotypes .
People got to relax . ”
However , Mr. Jabbar said that the restaurant was bowing to the pressure , and that it would be renamed Popular Fried Chicken by the weekend .
Ms. Harewood did not think much of the new name .
“ That ’s so blah , predictable , typical , ” she said .
The current name , she added , gave her “ pride . ”
In the Au Monde Chic barbershop , where Mr. Obama ’s portrait hung on a back wall , Alnord Benoit cut a customer ’s hair and called the name change “ disrespectful . ”
“ Did he get permission from Obama ? ” Mr. Benoit asked .
In a nearby computer store , the manager , Earl Dennis , jokingly said he should rename his place Obama ’s Computer Store .
“ It ’s publicity , ” Mr. Dennis said .
Of the chicken restaurant , he said , “ I ’m not eating there . ”
Competition might have played some role in the new name .
Crown Fried Chicken is across the street , owned by Osman Mohibi , 47 , an Afghan immigrant .
He keeps pictures of Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. taped to the plexiglass divider by the cash register .
Mr. Mohibi said his competitor ’s misstep was winning new customers for Crown Fried Chicken .
“ He used the name , ” Mr. Mohibi said of the owner .
“ He used black people . ”
Kevin McCall , one of the community organizers who confronted Obama Fried Chicken ’s owner , said he received calls from residents disturbed by the sign , and quickly contacted the owner to tell him it was “ very offensive to African - Americans . ”
What price should we put on the head of a red squirrel or a turtle dove ?
What value does a woodland , heath or fen bring to the economy ?
Under radical new Conservative proposals to stop biodiversity loss in the UK , all would be given a cash value .
The scheme is designed to halt the decline of hundreds of habitats and species by assigning a cost to be paid by proposed development schemes that would lead to their destruction .
The damage done by a project would be given a cash value and developers asked to compensate for that damage by investing an equivalent amount in projects to protect or improve biodiversity at another location .
The plan being put forward by the new Conservative shadow environment secretary , Nick Herbert , is modelled on similar " bio-credits " initiatives , including in the US , Malaysia and Australia , which have created markets in biodiversity worth tens of millions of pounds a year .
Conservation groups said they welcomed new ideas to improve biodiversity .
However , there will be concerns about aspects of the policy including Herbert 's proposal that a scheme could be voluntary , and it should not impose extra costs on business , and the wider risk that a trading policy would encourage development on rare ecosystems which could not be replaced .
There will also be many questions over how species and habitat are valued and compared .
The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs has also asked consultants to examine the idea , which is also known as bio- banking , conservation banking or ecological offsetting .
Herbert said many concerns would be considered by a consultation with environment experts , but the policy was intended to be additional to existing protection and not to encourage more development .
" We do not want this to be a substitute for environmental , landscape or habitat protection , " Herbert told The Guardian .
" What we have in mind is schemes likely to go ahead anyway .
There is , whether we like it or not , going to be development going forward , and the risk is that will mean further biodiversity loss .
The question is how can we prevent that : we should , therefore , start looking at a system for not just preventing biodiversity loss but also enhancing it . "
The UK and the European Union have targets to halt biodiversity decline by 2010 .
However the latest figures from Natural England , the government 's advisory body on the natural environment , show continuing declines in four out of 10 of the most rare and threatened " priority " habitat , including chalk rivers , fens , wood - pasture and coastal sand dunes ; and more than a quarter of priority species , such as red squirrels , turtle doves and juniper .
At the same time there is a growing recognition of the importance of " ecosystem services " such as clean water , fertile soil , medicines and pollination of plants .
Experts say development is not the only threat to biodiversity – pollution and climate change are also serious problems .
However , development was damaging individual sites , and the fragmentation caused by building over particular habitats would make it harder for species to adapt to climate change , said Herbert .
" The problem is this is something society places a high value on but economics places no value on , " he added .
Dr Tony Whitbread of The Wildlife Trusts said : " The bio-credits idea is interesting but , as always , the devil will be in the detail .
Bio-credits raise many questions , for example : how would they work with the current planning system ?
How would they be funded , especially if they do n't put extra costs on businesses ?
And where would raised funds be spent ?
It is also vital that any new system recognises that some habitats are irreplaceable and cannot be traded . "
David Hill , a professor in ecology at Oxford Brookes University who also runs a consultancy on conservation issues , said money spent on conservation at development sites could often be better spent on extending existing nature reserves or Sites of Special Scientific Interest , or creating new ones in better locations .
He said that house builders have indicated they would be willing to pay around £ 5,000 per new home built if a scheme similar to the Tory proposals was up and running .
" Multiply that by 240,000 homes a year to be built : you suddenly realise the figures that could go into the natural environment go into the 100s of millions [ of pounds ] , " he added .
In the US , where bio - banking is widespread , the trade in wetland bank credits reached $ 350 m in 2006 , and the trade in " endangered species credits " was around $ 40 m between 2002 and 2005 .
One academic study in 1997 has estimated the value of global ecosystems as $ 33tn a year , double the economic wealth circulated - a figure criticised by different groups as too high and too low .
MPs have been told that although they are free to install PGP on their parliamentary machines the technology is not compatible with Parliament ’s remote access software , making its use impractical .
The curious response came from the House of Commons Commission via Lib Dem MP Nick Harvey in response to questions raised by Francis Maude , shadow cabinet office minister .
Maude queried whether or not MPs are allowed to load Pretty Good Privacy encryption on their parliamentary computers .
He was told that they could if they wanted to but advised that the software would frustrate support from the Parliamentary ICT ( PICT ( pdf ) ) department .
Worse still , the software is supposedly incompatible with key VPN ( remote access ) software , political blog Dizzy Thinks reports , adding an extract from the reply .
PICT has recently completed an evaluation of encryption software and Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP ) was found to be incompatible with Parliament ’s current version of VPN ( remote access ) software .
Therefore , this product is not recommended for users of that service .
As part of the evaluation PICT has identified another product that can be deployed to members ' loaned machines by PICT at no cost to Members .
The software can also be acquired by Members at their own cost , if they wish to have it installed on machines that they have purchased through PICT .
We asked PGP for comment on the compatibility of its technology with VPN software in general and the parliamentary system in particular .
The firm said there 's nothing about PGP that ought to preclude its use with VPN software , a different class of security application .
It 's still looking into the specifics of the interaction between PGP and parliamentary systems .
" VPN Technology is a network transport technology , and PGP desktop is a piece of software that provides an encryption platform application , " explained PGP marketing manager Jamie Cowper .
" The only interaction we have with a VPN , is to transport standard TCP / IP communications .
As an application , we are not involved with any part of the VPN process ( initiation , key exchange , management etc ) . "
Quite why Parliament 's remote access software might be compatible with an alternative encryption package but not PGP - a widely - used package that 's been available for over a decade - remains unclear .
The more paranoid among you might say that the other ( unknown ) product might be easier to eavesdrop upon .
You may well think that .
We could n't possibly comment .
It 's known that Colt Telecom supplies the connectivity and that MessageLabs handles the anti-spam and anti-virus filtering on the parliamentary internet connection .
The issue of whether MPs can exchange secure communications with each other and their constituents or not was thrown into focus by recent moves by the Metropolitan Police to get copies of email correspondence between Members of Parliament , without first getting a warrant .
The request was made about requests between Damian Green MP and fellow Tory David Davis .
Davis raised the issue in the House of Commons at the start of February , SpyBlog reports .
Green 's constituency and House of Commons offices were searched in November , during which equipment including papers and computers was removed , when he was controversially arrested by police investigating alleged misconduct over leaked Home Office papers .
The request for email correspondence seems to be a follow - up request in the same investigation .
Davis 's questions in House can be read in Hansard here .
SpyBlog suggested that MPs sensitive about the privacy of the communications they exchange should publish a PGP key on their website .
It 's unclear how many have taken up this option . ®

Statistics show that while Sarah Palin may face some whispers and criticism from those in her own party , because her pregnant teenage daughter did n’t get married , Bristol Palin ’s situation is actually the norm in the U.S. where less than 8 % of teenage moms marry the father of their child .
A press release released put out by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , highlighted some interesting statistics that pointed out that 8 out of 10 teenage fathers do n’t marry the marry the mother of their child , and teenage mothers who do n’t marry the father are also less likely to be married by age 35 .
There is also a changing cultural dynamic against teenage marriage .
In 1975 , 11 % of teenagers were married , but by 2002 this percentage had dropped to 2.5 % .
In 1980 , 52 % of teen births occurred in marriage .
By 2002 , this number had dropped to 20 % .
One other statistic serves to refute the social conservative argument that pregnant teens should get married .
Teen marriages are twice as likely to fail as those that occur when the woman is at least 25 years old .
This would seem to be common sense , because a general rule older people are more mature .
However , these statistics would seem to deal a blow to the social conservative myth that pregnant teen couples are better off getting married .

“ Marriage and birth patterns among teens have changed over time , shifting from a general trend of marrying before pregnancy , to marrying as a result of pregnancy , to becoming pregnant and not marrying , ” said Sarah Brown , CEO of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .
“ Even though many unmarried teen mothers have high expectations for eventually marrying the father of their child , few ever do . ”
Sarah Palin is drawing criticism , while her daughter ’s decision is being praised .
Bonnie Erbe over at US News and World Report wrote that , “ From where I sit , Bristol Palin displays a lot more personal maturity and decision - making ability than her mother , who obviously tried to persuade Bristol to wed her “ baby daddy …
Is this good for her mother ’s political career ?
Obviously not .
Social conservatives believe strongly the daughter should have been forced into marriage . ”
I think that this whole episode shows the fallacy of the social conservatives ’ position on teenage sex .
Abstinence does n’t work , and forcing teenagers to get married is a recipe for creating a broken home that would benefit the child less than being in a loving single parent home .
Although some Republicans do n’t want to face it , Bristol Palin is the norm , not the exception .
Washington , D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has joined a broad coalition of public interest groups and trade associations calling for President Obama to diversify future appointments to intellectual property policy positions and create new offices devoted to promoting innovation and free expression .
In all , 19 organizations signed the letter to the president , spearheaded by Washington D.C. - based non-profit Public Knowledge .
The coalition includes the Consumer Electronics Association , the American Library Association , and the Wikimedia Foundation .
Several of the president 's recent appointees to positions that oversee intellectual property policy have represented the recording industry or other industries that support overly broad IP protection .
But many positions with IP policy responsibilities have not yet been filled .
In the letter sent today , the coalition urges the administration to appoint individuals representing the diversity of stakeholders involved in IP issues .
" Innovators , artists , and the increasingly participatory public are all deeply invested in the future of America 's intellectual property policy , " said EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney Fred von Lohmann .
" For example , thousands of remix videos are posted to YouTube every day , and they are already an important part of political debate and artistic expression in the 21st century .
America needs policymakers who will protect new tools and new artistic works . "
The coalition also calls on the president to create new positions at the Patent and Trademark Office , the United States Trade Representative , and the Department of State dedicated to promoting innovation and advancing the cause of progress in sciences and the useful arts .
" While the content industry plays a significant role in our economy , so too do the creators of technology and their force of innovation , " said Gigi B. Sohn , president and co-founder of Public Knowledge .
" And while we recognize the rights of corporate content creators , we might also recognize the rights of consumers lawfully to create their own works and to use their own digital media .
It 's that balance the Administration needs to recognize . "

AERIAL bomb attacks that kill civilians in Iraq are as lethal as suicide bombers on foot .
Madelyn Hicks of Kings College London and colleagues analysed 60,481 deaths between March 2003 and March 2008 from the Iraq Body Count ( IBC ) , a project that records violent civilian deaths .
Suicide bombers on foot killed nearly seven times as many civilians as aerial bomb attacks ( without ground fire ) .
However , where an aerial bombing did kill civilians the number of deaths was comparable ( The New England Journal of Medicine , vol 360 , p 1585 ) .
While no one is suggesting the US and its …
More drones folks .
This time we have something from Baldwin Technology in response to a request from the US Office of Naval Research .
The concept is basically this .
The Mono Tiltrotor ( MTR ) would be small enough to go inside a cargo plane .
A crew would attach supplies such as food , batteries etc .

So Edmond G. Loves 1972 autobiographical novel , Hanging On , Or , How to Get Through a Depression and Enjoy Life was particularly intriguing to me when I found it at a local used bookstore , and his story struck me as an especially timely one given current events .
Though the book certainly includes much more then just the depression , relating , for instance , the authors college experience , it is in large part a discussion of how nation 's economic circumstances impacted the author and his friends and family and how they responded to these challenges .
( Love published several other books including Subways are for Sleeping and The Situation in Flushing .
Some of these titles are currently sold by the Wayne State University Press .
Others titles do not appear to be sold currently but are available used on Amazon .
Hanging
On was originally published by William Morrow & Company , NY , and was reprinted in 1988 by Great Lakes Books , the imprint of Wayne State University Press . )
Certainly there are many differences , in ways both good and bad , between the 1930s and today , a point made by numerous bloggers and many others in recent weeks and months .
Still , even given these differences I believe there are good general lessons which can be learned from how others have dealt with severe economic challenges and dislocations , both in our own nation and elsewhere in the world ( e.g. , Iceland , pre-collapse Soviet Union , Argentina ) .
Background
Love , a resident at the time of Flint , MI , a city then of 156,000 people , was young , college aged ( he turned 17 in 1929 ) and upper middle class .
At least in theory , the author 's father , who owned a coal and lumberyard , was worth $ 1 million though the author notes that he later realized " [ m ] ost of his fortune was on paper and mighty flimsy paper at that " ( p. 13 ) .
( One million dollars in 1930 was equivalent to about 10 million in 2007 depending on how computes this value e.g. , based on the consumer price index , gross domestic product or relative purchasing power .
See the historical value calculators .
The author 's family had a nice house , housekeeper and maid and several cars .
Love notes that his family and most of his neighbors had moved to Flint from more rural areas of Michigan in the past decade to work in trades such as plumbing or in the city 's auto industry .
Housing boomed -- according to the author his father 's lumberyard had 20 or 30 contractors as clients in the late 20s ( 96 ) and with the housing industry so too did sales for many other goods , such as ( what were then ) new types of household appliances including electric refrigerators , toasters and radios .
" Prosperity touched everyone .
It was a poor man who could n't make money in Flint , " writes the author .
For instance , Love notes that some of his friends families had second homes and he himself received a new car for his 18th birthday .
Denial
One of the undercurrents of this book , in my view , was how long it took the author and many others to realize just how drastically their circumstances had changed and that the depression was not going away anytime soon .
Though Love notes that some historians later would divide the depression into different phases ( depression , recovery ) , for him there was little to distinguish these years and when the depression finally did end , it did so fairly suddenly .
As the author explains , the depression , at least at its worst , did not happen overnight and the author was not greatly impacted in the early stages .
For instance , in September 1929 between graduating high school and starting college the author attended a military school in Missouri for a year .
He notes that between semesters some classmates could not afford to return .
His father lost most of his money in the Oct 1929 crash , ended up in debt , had to mortgage the lumberyard and came close to bankruptcy ( 46 ) .
However , the author , away at military school was largely unaware of this .
Several of the authors ' friends fathers also had lost big in the stock market and many people were worried about slow 1930 model car sales .
His family and others families started to cut spending ( 47 ) .
Still , though people were careful , they were still largely optimistic at that time hoping " [ t ] hings would be better in the spring when people started building houses again .
The situation was only temporary " ( 48 ) .
By June 1930 , with the depression 8 months old , " [t ] he panic had subsided and the wreckage had been cleared away .
Most people could look about them and see just about where they stood . "
Though the spring had passed " [ t ] here was an air of puzzlement but the optimism was there , too " with many still expressing the belief that " ' prosperity is just around the corner .  "
As the author explains ( 48 - 49 ) this idea : " would be repeated and repeated .
When the fall had some and gone , people talked about the upturn that would come the next spring .
The next spring people would say that the upturn would come in the summer , and so on .
The thing is that people really believed this .
They had a blind faith in it , and because they did , they set up a pattern of living called ' hanging on . 
If you were in a business , you kept the business going any way you could until the upturn came and things got better .
If you had a job , you hung onto it any way you could .
You took less money and worked longer hours .
Sooner or later things would return to normal .
If you were laid off from your job , you hung around close by , so that you'd be able to go back to work [ ]
This was where the optimism came in .
No one that I knew ever thought things would stay bad forever .
The silver lining was there somewhere , and it was bound to turn up . "
From the author 's perspective and observation , 1930 was bad only in comparison to 1929 .
People felt pessimistic because most certainly were worse off than they had been a year ago .
The author 's father , who employed 25 people , still had enough business in 1930 to keep 12 coal trucks going and was able to give the author a summer job without displacing anyone .
However , the author does note that when people left ( e.g. , to join the military or get married ) they were not replaced .
In Flint and elsewhere people still were living off accumulated savings and the auto companies , preparing for the 1931 model year , still offered solid employment .
The author 's fathers  lumberyard still had coal and lumber stocks and could both sell and purchase on credit .
For instance , many people purchased their winter coal supply that year on credit .
The author and his family were able to save enough to afford the author 's first semester at the University of Michigan in the Fall of 1930 where he enrolled as a sophomore ( after the one year at the military academy ) .
The college still was " closer in spirit to the twenties than it was to the thirties " since the " real pinch " of the depression had yet to be felt .
But by Labor day ( Sept. 1930 ) the nation started to experience the " real depths " of the depression .
The author 's father started to get calls from his creditors and customers no longer were paying their accounts .
By this time , " [t ] he fat on which people had been living all summer was gone . 
It was at this point , as 1931 model car sales ground to a halt , that mass layoffs began in Flint 's auto factories ( 76 ) Prices dropped ( e.g. , 8 gallons of gas selling for $ 1 , cigarettes for 10 cents a pack ) .
Prices for the coal sold by his father 's lumberyard also dropped but , unfortunately , their costs for purchasing this coal did not .
Businesses in Flint not selling necessities - clothing stores , furniture stores - started to close down and were boarded up .
His father had to start dismissing employees because he could not afford to pay his bills since his customers could no longer pay theirs .
Coal deliveries to the lumberyard had to be paid upfront in cash or the suppliers would take the shipment back .
" It was a grim and desperate time ,  the author writes .
By the summer of 1931 , " Flint seemed deserted " ( 83 ) with closed factories and boarded up stores .
Big orders ( e.g. , the Post Office buying 185 new mail trucks ) were " almost a cause for a community celebration , " helping to keep auto workers employed ( 82 ) .
( Each car purchase , according to a sign popular at the time , could support work for an employee for 71 days ) .
Inventory at the lumberyard rapidly shrank because no one was building new homes and housing contractors had gone bankrupt ( 82 ) .
By winter 1932 , auto workers were averaging four months of work for the year .
Despite including new and often untested gadgets , " [t ] he 1932 cars had been the most tremendous failures in the history of automaking . "
Complaints about gadgets like free wheeling ( cruise control ) hurt sales .
But " [ v ] ery few people had money enough to buy new cars " anyway .
Engineers and others were laid off .
Things picked up for a while in 1933 but then in March 1933 the depression hit its " very bottom . "
Michigan was the first state to close its banks following a run / panic , other states followed and Roosevelt after his inauguration on March 4th closed the banks in the rest of the nation ( 118-119 ) .
Still , according to the author , even then many believed things would soon get better .
" Just as there had been in those early days after the crash , there was not a peculiar reaction , half optimism and half pessimism .
The optimism arose from the fact that everyone was sure our banks were sound and this was only temporary .
The pessimism was slow in getting hold of people and gradually built into a panic as succeeding extra editions of the papers and radio commentators speculated on the meaning of it " ( 119 ) .
The author notes that following the bank holiday having cash on hand became critical ; a truck driver with $ 50 was better off than a wealthy executive with plenty of money saved in the bank but no cash on hand .
Panic orders for coal started pouring in to the lumberyard because " [ w ] hen the news of the bank holiday hit , people began to worry about being cold and hungry . "
( 120 ) So many coal orders came in , Love and his family had to stop accepting new orders and try to deliver to those most in need .
Everything had to be paid for in cash and no one would accept credit ; cigarette packs were broken up so the individual cigarettes could be sold ( 121 ) .
Creditors were willing to settle accounts for a few cents on the dollar .
Unable to pay cash for their coal shipments , the lumberyard eventually went bankrupt .
Though hardships continued with Roosevelt in office the tone in 1933 started to change .
" When one looks back from a distance of forty years , it is easy to see that the New Deal did not accomplish very much in good hard terms ,  Love writes .
 The period is euphemistically called the era of Recovery , but the same old disasters were overtaking us and the casualties continued .
We were still as uncertain in 1936 as we were in 1932 .
The big difference was that we felt better " ( 133 ) .
Roosevelt 's personality -- his " bearing , " courage and " rapport with the people " -- " reached out and touched everything " ( 133 ) .
Still even in 1934 many factories were closed and the author describes his tough experience job hunting after being laid off ( 148 ) .
People who were unemployed , including the author , would show up early at the Flint Journal office to get the first paper with want ads .
In the beginning , most of the New Deal programs ( Civil Works Administration , Public Works Administration ) were only for married men and the Civilian Conservation Corps , which did accept single men , required a 6 month enlistment ( 149 ) .
By June 1935 , the Depression was still bad but " [ p ] erhaps the big difference , in Flint at least , was the fact that people had learned to live with hard times by now .
They did n't stand around muttering about it as they used to .
In most cases they had learned to pinch a penny like an expert . "
During spring 1937 , when the author worked as a teacher , schools still closed 6 weeks early , cutting his salary 10 percent .
Indeed , schools had closed early since the depression started ( 240 ) .
In the summer of 1937 , according to Love , there was little business in downtown Flint and few jobs .
When he tried to get job as busboy in June to supplement his income , 20 people were already in line for the job by time he got to downtown Flint ( 245 ) .
Even in the summer of 1939 , the school in which he taught closed 5 weeks early ( 256 ) .
But as WWII began , circumstances finally started to change for the better .
" The Depression ended on the day the war began , but it did not become apparent to most of us for some time , " says the author .
He remembers that in 1940 when he went on road trip when he saw on the way down to Texarkana that there was lot of traffic and most towns seemed busy .
He recalls seeing a huge railroad yard with hundreds of tank cars .
Even in Flint things were busy and the auto factories , after the 1940 model run , did n't close that year .
At that point , the author realized the depression was over .
Within a year , the author and many of his friends were drafted into the military as the United States entered World War II .
Impact on most vulnerable
One aspect of the depression which comes through in this book is the impact on the most vulnerable - such as the elderly , large families and the poor .
In noting that the depression in summer 1930 still had not touched many Americans , the author explains : " [ i] t was people like the alcoholic , I think , who first felt the full bite of the Depression .
Lacking stability even in good times , they were the ones , in the end , who ended up in breadlines or selling applies .
There were n't so many of them as dealers in Depression nostalgia would have one believe . "
Still , even in the summer of 1930 , the author noted " disquieting undertones " such as stories of people committing suicide , going to jail ( e.g. , embezzlement ) , going bankrupt and having stress - related health problems ( heart attack , stroke ) .
" The Depression produced all kinds of casualties , " the author states ( 50 ) .
One of the authors ' neighbors was arrested for embezzlement and his family evicted .
Another friend and neighbor 's father drank himself to death .
People laid off from Flint 's auto factories lost houses , suffered breakdowns and strokes and even committed suicide ( 94 ) .
Businesses depending on the auto industry ( e.g. , car hauling businesses ) also suffered .
His father had a heart attack at age 50 in part because of the stress over the lumberyard ( 142 ) .
A friend of the authors father in his 60s ran a wholesale lumber business which went bankrupt ; the man abandoned his family in the summer of 1932 and 3 years later died in a train wreck .
He was riding the train as a hobo ( 95 ) .
Even in the middle and late thirties this continued , according to the author .
The Flint economy was tied to cars and things did get a little better because sales of the 1936 , 1937 and 1938 model years improved .
Factories started running for 6 months instead of 4 as in previous years .
But there still was no unemployment insurance to help when factories closed and the author cites several examples of suffering in his circle .
One of his friends , for instance , died of a stroke .
Another family friends husband who drove a cab to support his family worked himself to death ( 252 )
Yet given the prevailing attitudes at the time , few would have accepted public assistance even had any been offered ( at that time , there was little more than the county poorhouse for indigent older persons ) .
There was no unemployment insurance , a difficulty at a time when people , including the author , were continually being laid off ( 149 ) even if they could find a job .
" The thing most Americans forget about the Depression after all these years is that even as late as 1931 nearly everyone still though in old fashioned terms ,  Love explains ( 87 ) . "
People were expected to overcome lifes challenges on their own .
Though forms of government relief had been discussed few supported the idea .
Embarrassment and shame added to the economic challenges .
Reflecting on his fathers anguish in telling him he could not return the school , which the author had expected , Love notes that " [ w]e were living in a world where all the people were broke , where everyone was struggling for survival , where forces beyond our understanding and remedy were operating on us and still we were embarrassed to death at our predicament . 
It helped that many business people like his father understood first - hand what their customers were going through and tried to help as best they could .
The author notes that in the winter of 1930 - 1931 , a cold winter in Michigan , many people needed to start buying coal on credit , while still owing money for coal they had previously received .
" My father did n't turn many people down .
For almost everyone in a business where necessities were being sold , this was the pattern " ( 76 ) .
His father viewed his customers as basically honest and assumed they were paying what they could under the circumstances .
Communities and families
The author notes that the depression forced people to stay home .
" I always think of the early 1930s as the jigsaw - puzzle years , " the author comments .
" The main means of recreation were listening to the radio and working jigsaws  ( 83 ) .
Gardening became a popular family activity .
Families took short car rides for recreation .
New board games like Monopoly were introduced and became popular ( 216 ) .
Activities such as dancing also caught on because they were inexpensive ( $ 1 to get in , 5 cents for a coke for the author and his dates ) .
Dates were often " dutch " in the 30s ( i.e. , both men and women paying ) .
The author notes that " the Depression was a period of great elegance " in fashion , perhaps in response to " the everyday drabness about us " ( 93 ) .
The author 's stepmother in particular was extremely stressed and discouraged the author and others from spending money .
But the author admits he and his father and brothers " needed some restraint . "
The depression forced families to stick together .
Though families argued about money and other things , " [t ] he one important thing to remember about our family and most other families of the time was that the Depression welded us into tight - knit little groups .
In spite of the bickering , it would never occurred to any of us to act outside of the interests of the family . " ( 89 ) .
In the summer of 1931 , for instance , and the winter ( he did not return to college ) the author worked for his father who now ran the office alone .
He and his brother were " good cheap labor and that was all my father could afford . "
Some bloggers ( e.g. , Sharon Astyk ) have noted the value and importance of intergenerational households .
The author 's grandfather , a colorful character who was in his late 70s and lived with the family .
His grandfather devoted much of his time to watching court cases and serving on juries .
He was able to make $ 3 each day from jury duty ( always managing to get himself picked ! ) , and contributed significantly to the household 's finances during the depression ( 15 ) .
The author recounts how his grandfather helped care for an elderly widow after she and her husband were injured in an auto accident and the husband died .
The company responsible for the accident went bankrupt , leaving the widow destitute .
The author 's grandfather not only helped the widow close the couple 's store but even moved in to help care for her and even helped her buy food and medicine because " [ s ] omebody had to take care of the old lady and he seemed to be the only one to do it . " ( 88 )
Plans and Dreams
The book conveys the huge impact of the depression on young people of that time who were hit especially hard by the depression .
Many had to temporarily defer or even entirely give up their goals and dreams .
For instance , when a neighbor 's father died from heavy drinking ( cirrhosis of the liver ) , the author 's friend left college , where he was studying electrical engineering and came home to try to run his father 's plumbing business ( 83 ) .
A friend 's father working as a supervisor in an auto factory fell off a roof he was retarring ( auto factories tried to keep supervisors employed by giving them such odd jobs to do ) forcing his friend to leave school and work in one of the factories .
The author did not return to college in the Fall of 1931 though he was eventually able to go back in 1932 in part after winning a big horse racing wager .
By then enrollment at the university had dropped considerably .
( For instance only 6 of 28 of the authors  fraternity pledge class members still were in school ( 106 ) ) .
Between 1932 and 1934 " most of the frills of college life " disappeared , notes the author ( 155 ) .
Eventually , Love was forced to leave school yet again ( 124 ) .
He continued to work in the lumberyard and in 1934 got a job in an auto factory and then at a spark plug company ( 143 ) and then was able to go back to school again .
Many of his friends also had to change their plans .
A friend with a degree in business administration ended up working as a bill collector ( 252 ) .
Another friend with a graduate degree in engineering worked as a meter repairman .
A fraternity brother who had completed 3 years of college , was forced to leave and then returned to college at 25 ( 159 ) .
He wanted to be a physician and was taking premed courses but was eventually forced to work as clerk in company and give up this dream .
A friend whose father went bankrupt when he was a college junior took on odd jobs like mowing lawns and worked 10 hours a day as a dishwasher at night while going to school .
" He survived and got his degree , but I still do n't know how he did it , " the author writes .
" It left a permanent mark on him " ( 95 ) .
" It had begun to seem as though no one in my generation was ever going to get a start in life and I had reached the conclusion that none of us was ever going to be able to do the things we wanted to do ,  Love reflects ,  In the world in which all of us had reached maturity , security and a job had become the important things in life .
Most of us had taken whatever we could find and were hanging on to it ... "
Still , some managed to succeed despite the odds .
One of Loves friends with a degree in business administration got a job at a sparks plug company after graduating measuring sparkplug tips but was able to find a better way of doing this and was rewarded with a salaried job and large bonus ( 153 ) .
When the authors family lumberyard went bankrupt , his father , at age 52 , needed to look for a new job and became a traveling lumber salesman .
His father turned out to be good at this and had many contacts in the lumber business who eventually became his customers .
As his college graduation approached , the author eventually decided to become a teacher realizing that " [ a ] degree by itself was no guarantee of security at all .
I could still find myself walking the streets looking for jobs , but a degree with a teacher 's certificate was like an insurance policy ( 204 ) . 
An assistant superintendent of schools who had been one of his teachers suggested he look into a University of Michigan program offering a concentrated course for those who wanted to earn their teaching certificate .
People with college degrees or about to finish could take 19 credits in 1 semester and earn the certificate .
" This course was undoubtedly Depression - born ,  Love comments .
 In the six years since the stock market crash , a great many people had lost their jobs - - a great many women had lost their husbands .
A lot of these people had college degrees but no teaching credentials , and many of them wanted to turn to teaching to make a living  ( 204 ) .
However , it was not possible for these students to complete the standard 1 year program which would have meant moving to Ann Arbor for one year during the depression .
To assist these non-traditional students , the school not only shortened the class term but also allowed students in the concentrated program to complete the required 6 weeks of practice teaching close to home .
So , reports Love , students would spend 6 weeks in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan taking education courses , 6 weeks practice teaching at home then finish their last 4 weeks of classes .
According to the author , the concentrated course was very intense , running 8 AM to 6 PM every day .
The 26 people in his course , according to Love , included 10 widows and five former businessmen who had lost their savings in the depression .
The author completed the course , graduated with both his degree and teaching certificate in August 1936 and , at age 24 , started teaching in Flint .
Though sometimes frustrated , Love eventually earned his masters degree , reasoning that given the economy his best course of action was to do his best to improve himself in his current teaching career .
With the arrival of World War II , the author and many friends were drafted in 1941 and he did not return home until age 34 after the war .
In responding to comments that his generation later was viewed as materialistic , the author comments that " very few of us had anything before we reached the age of thirty .
With the start most of us had , I doubt we'd be normal if we did n't pay some attention to the material things . ( 284 ) .
The author notes that as he got older he always kept eye on his bank statement and was careful with stocks .
Still , looking back after many years , the author thought it was an interesting time : " I think I was pretty lucky to have been young then , but then some people have all the luck ( 285 ) .
Ingenuity
During the depression , the author and his acquaintances and others had sometimes creative ways of meeting the challenges of daily life .
For instance , when gardening became popular author 's father was able to make a significant amount of money by using unsold lumber to build cheap lawn ornaments and putting up a floodlighted rock garden to draw a crowd ( the lumberyard was on a main road ) .
The authors brother and truck drivers who had worked for his father 's lumberyard but now were unemployed came up with the idea to help fix driveways where the coal delivery trucks had had problems .
They focused on police , postal workers and teachers as customers because they " had worked steadily through most of the Depression and had a little money " ( 100 ) .
The author also discusses the chain letter craze of 1935 in which people would receive a letter and were supposed to pass on a dime or dollar to the name ( then they became the top of the chain and others then were supposed to pass on the money to them ( 176 ) .
Though this sounds silly , and subsequently was made illegal , the author and his fraternity brothers managed to make quite a bit of money when they took these letters to a nearby town where no one head heard of the scheme .
" The Depression saw a lot of crackpot schemes , but the 1935 chain - letter craze was the zaniest of them all ,  Love writes .
 Before it was over , the President had to step in and put a stop to it before the post office broke down . 
Unions and the workplace
The author lived and worked in Flint during the famous sit down strike at the Fisher Body auto factory .
Most Flint residents , the author included , were avidly anti-union in1936 .
The attitude the author and other Flint residents had toward unions reflected their generally conservative perspectives .
Recalling his view at the time , the author writes that : " I was a product of middle - class parents and I was brought up in a world that solidly embraced a middle - class philosophy .
It was a relatively small world where everyone knew everyone else .
There had never been a labor union in that world , because most people did n't believe one was needed .
One of the basic tenets of my world was the belief that each man stood on his own legs and fought his own fight [ ....]
It was a viewpoint that was incompatible with the theories of unionism . " ( 219 ) .
Having worked in three factories himself during his college years , the author also believed at the time that for the most part employees were treated fairly by their managers .
The book includes an interesting discussion of the dynamics of the labor situation in Flint during the depression .
Love observes that companies like GM had changed significantly in the 1920s .
GM was founded by Billy Durant , a resident of Flint .
Even after he lost control of the company it was managed by men from the town who understood the auto industry and the community and were close to their workers .
Executives , according to the author , were referred to by first names and workers would stop by to talk and get advice during and after work hours .
GM supported the Industrial Mutual Association ( IMA ) , Flints largest institution , which " reflected the paternal and fair view which the General Motor executives had of themselves . "
The IMA offered lakes and parks , bowling , dancing , parks and sports programs and night study for GM factory workers and their families .
Though membership was not required , most workers joined .
According to the author there were three main groups of employees those working for Buick , employees of Chevrolet and Fisher Body employees .
The author describes Buick factory workers as being the " aristocrats of Flint labor . "
These tended to be the more senior GM workers because Buick was one of the older brands .
Many employees owned their homes and cars as well as company stock .
They had savings .
While these employees suffered layoffs and tough times in Depression " as a group they had more resources with which to weather the storm than other Flint employees .
Chevrolet workers formed the second group .
Chevy was a younger company than Buick and had expanded rapidly from 1918 to 1926 .
These employees were younger than their Buick counterparts as well and tended to have less wealth .
 To them the Depression became a struggle to hold on to what little they had .
Not all of them succeeded , " Love writes .
The third group , Fisher Body workers , were most relevant to unions .
The Fisher Body plant was built in 1926 ( 221 ) and workers came from throughout the country to work there .
Many thought of their homes as being elsewhere .
They lived in slums because there had not been time to build good housing .
The depression hit in 1929 before they had made much money and they had the toughest time during the depression of the three groups .
Some men from the Fisher plant had received charter from the United Auto Workers , then part of American Federation of Labor , but there had been little union activity during the depression .
Then in 1936 National Labor Relations
Act passed .
IMA , dominated by Buick workers , was designated as the bargaining agent for workers .
But John Lewis , director of the Council of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) decided to focus his efforts on the auto industry and used the United Auto Workers chapter in the Fisher Plant as a starting point .
The author points out that United Auto Workers membership was a very small part of total Flint GM workforce in 1936 .
The sit down strike started December , 30 , 1936 .
Because the workers were a distinct minority and few workers would have been likely to support a picket line , particularly at a time when the auto factories were starting to recover , they decided to seize the plant itself ( 225 ) .
" The sit - down [ strike ] was simply a stratagem aimed at bringing about one result - the achievement of union recognition ,  the author asserts ( 225 ) .
With the New Year and holiday , few wanted to upset their plans in response to the sit down .
Both the company and union went to court but since a strike like this had never happened before there were few precedents so several days went by with little response .
The union supplied the workers in the factory with food but most in the community assumed the sit down strikers would get tired and leave .
As the strike continued , rumors started that carloads of outsiders would show up in support of the strikers .
The union threatened a general strike throughout the city , though in retrospect the author is doubtful this would have succeeded .
Union lawyers used delaying tactics and the strike continued .
The author and his friends and the citys main newspapers ( Flint Journal and Detroit Free Press ) were solidly against the strikers .
Two weeks after the strike started , the Buick and Chevy plants closed because these factories could not make cars without the bodies from Fisher .
Workers from these companies , angered , also took sides against strikers .
A Buick worker and former Flint mayor formed the Flint Alliance to oppose the strike .
The alliance held rallies and send a petition against the strike with 30000 signatures to Washington .
The alliance , reports the author , helped " bring the tension to the breaking point " ( 229 ) and there were ugly clashes .
Barricades were put up around the plant so strikers could no longer get food and water and the power was turned off .
Though some blamed GM for increasing the tension , Love disagrees .
" In spite of all that had happened to them in the previous ten years ,  he argues ,  the average citizen was still a conservative , grass - roots - oriented individual who accepted traditional views of what was right and wrong . "
( 230 ) Many viewed the seizure of the plant in fairly simple terms simply as a violation of the owners property rights .
Though urged to intervene , both the Roosevelt White House and Frank Murphy , the new Governor who had been inaugurated on Jan. 1 , 1937 , remained neutral though sympathetic to the strikers .
In the fourth week of the strike , a court finally issued an order for the strikers to leave the plant , which they ignored .
Flints mayor asked Governor Murphy to send the National Guard to evict the workers but Murphy refused declaring that human rights transcended property rights .
The county sheriff and city police chief tried unsuccessfully to evict the workers but failed , though there was considerable violence .
Before the sheriff could send in a larger force , the Governor sent in the National Guard to restore order , threatened martial law if the unrest continued and ordered GM and the union to negotiate , effectively representing a victory for the strikers and forcing GMs recognition of the union .
" The significance of what had happened was a long time dawning on me ,  the author recalls , noting that the company was unionized in 6 months with most workers quickly joining the union .
 I was seeing a lot more than a union victory in a strike .
I was seeing a way of life disappear . [ ]
The rural viewpoints that people had carried with them into the cities in the first three decades of the twentieth century were gone .
The General Motors Corporation was no longer a local concern managed by local men with a kindly regard for the workers .
The men at Fisher body knew this .
They 'd seen it long before the rest of us did and their strike was against an impersonal entity , cold and hard .
Something else had become apparent , too .
The idea that each family and each community could take care of its own and exist like a small island in a great sea was no longer valid .
The crisis of the Depression with its poverty and its hopelessness had long since proved too much for cities like Flint , for counties like Genesee County , for states like Michigan . [ ] .
The whole essence of the New Deal was the abandonment of this small , individualistic outlook in favor of the bigger , stronger , national government and the immense power it could bring to bear on the solutions of the pressing problems which faced us . 

THE days when subprime mortgages were what kept bankers awake at night are long gone — though thanks only to the barrage of explosions in other corners of finance .
In terms of toxicity , however , subprime has had no equal .
Until now , perhaps .
Even as credit markets , particularly corporate - debt markets , show some signs of improvement , mortgage loans to supposedly better - heeled Americans are souring at a gut - wrenching rate .
Of particular concern are “ Alt - A ” mortgages , offered to borrowers sandwiched between subprime and prime .
This market was trumpeted as a means of extending home ownership to those , such as the self - employed , with a reasonable credit standing but unsteady income .
Its practitioners specialised in loans with scant documentation and exotica such as negative - amortisation mortgages , which allow borrowers to pay less than the accrued interest , with the difference added to the loan balance .
That Alt - A has troubles comes as no surprise .
Last summer , for instance , it helped to bring down IndyMac , a Californian bank .
But the speed with which loans have soured in recent months , and the reaction of rating agencies , have been startling .
Delinquencies rocketed in the final months of 2008 .
They even rose sharply for loans made in 2005 , before underwriting turned really sloppy ( see chart ) .
The rating agencies are rushing to catch up with this grim reality .
Moody's , which last summer had issued a sanguine outlook for Alt - A , recently quadrupled its loss projections on bonds backed by such loans .
A steady flow of downgrades has turned into a flood in recent weeks , with thousands of Alt - A tranches taking the plunge .
The falls have been unusually steep : of the $ 59 billion of AAA - rated securities that Moody 's cut between January 29th and February 2nd , an astonishing 91 % went straight to junk , according to Laurie Goodman of Amherst Securities .
In ratings terms , Alt - A is doing worse than subprime .
Moody 's calls this “ unprecedented ” .
That is putting it mildly .
It now expects losses for 2006 - 07 Alt - A securitisations to top 20 % , compared with an historical average of well under 1 % .
In an ugly echo of the fiasco over collateralised - debt obligations , holders lower down the structure can expect total write - offs , while the vast majority of senior holders will not be spared substantial losses .
The sums involved are depressingly large .
In the worst case , losses on the $ 600 billion of securitised Alt - A debt outstanding — roughly the same as the stock of subprime securities — could reach $ 150 billion , reckons David Watts of CreditSights , a research firm .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs put possible write - downs on the $ 1.3 trillion of total Alt - A debt — including both securitised and unsecuritised loans — at $ 600 billion , almost as much as expected subprime losses .
Add in option ARMs , a particularly virulent type of adjustable - rate loan , many of which are essentially the same as Alt - A , and the potential hit climbs towards $ 1 trillion .
Part of the problem is that much of the Alt - A lending came at the tail - end of the credit boom in late 2006 and early 2007 .
By then , subprime was already getting a bad name .
So Wall Street hit on a ruse : it took borrowers who in normal times would have been subprime and dressed them up as “ mid- prime ” .
Many of these loans were doomed from the start .
According to the Bank for International Settlements , a staggering 40 % of American mortgages originated in the first quarter of 2007 were interest - only or negative - amortisation loans .
In theory , interest - rate declines over the past year should offset the “ payment shock ” felt by borrowers whose loans reset from low teaser rates to higher ones .
But house prices have fallen so steeply that perhaps half of all Alt - A borrowers are in negative equity ; for many , walking away may seem the best option .
Moreover , option - ARM borrowers who had not expected to start repaying principal until 2015 or later may now have to do so as early as this year , because they are hitting triggers that recast the loan early .
Government efforts to stem foreclosures should help these unfortunates , though they may do little for owners of mortgage - backed bonds , who could face higher losses as a result of “ cramdowns ” , in which bankruptcy courts order a reduction in the principal owed .
Alt - Aaaaaargh
The pain will be felt across the financial industry .
Insurance firms , which gobbled up large but unknown quantities of highly rated Alt - A paper , will now be forced sellers since they are not permitted to hold securities rated below investment grade .
Banks have already sold a sizeable chunk of their Alt - A holdings to hedge funds and other asset - management firms , often at large discounts .
UBS 's exposure has fallen from $ 26.6 billion to just $ 2.3 billion , for instance .
But other European banks were not so zealous .
ING , a Dutch bank , still has € 27.7 billion ( $ 35.1 billion ) of Alt - A debt .
American banks are sitting on perhaps $ 800 billion of the stuff .
As the market prices of mortgage securities have fallen , banks have had to mark down their holdings , taking “ unrealised ” losses that erode their capital position .
Multi - notch downgrades could put further downward pressure on prices .
They hit capital in another way , too , because junk - rated debt carries a punitive risk weighting ; banks must set aside five times as much capital as they have to for top - notch securities .
Rating cuts also affect income statements , by pushing banks to acknowledge that losses which they had classified as temporary are now permanent .
The weakest may now need to raise fresh equity .
If they are lucky , banks will be able to palm some of the risk on to governments via asset guarantees or “ bad banks ” that assume their noxious assets .
The Dutch government has agreed to bear the risk on much of ING's Alt - A holdings , and Citigroup 's $ 11.4 billion exposure to Alt - A bonds falls under a guarantee that formed part of its November bail - out .
It will receive further help from the industry - wide bank - rescue package that the Obama administration is preparing .
What the taxpayer will get in return is far from clear .
Officials are still wrestling with how to value beaten - up mortgages .
Assessing the worth of Alt - A loans can be especially tricky because they are maddeningly heterogeneous , thanks to a broad assortment of payment options .
Less rigorous banks carry some holdings at around 60 cents on the dollar .
Morgan Stanley 's are marked at half that .
Its shares have rebounded recently , partly on hopes that it will be able to write up these securities once the government unveils its bail - out .
The biggest single Alt - A casualties are America 's bungling mortgage agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
They waded into the market in 2006 - 07 , snaffling up business in red - hot states such as California and Arizona , comforted by down - payments of 20 % .
When house prices there fell by more than that , they were left holding the first loss , since borrowers who put in that much equity do not have to take out mortgage insurance .
Rotten as Alt - A loans are , worse may be to come .
As unemployment in America heads towards 8 % , even strongly underwritten loans will go bad .
Bankers are growing increasingly anxious about the $ 1.1 trillion of prime mortgage loans and securities , much of which they held on to themselves , assuming it to be bombproof .
This sits on their books at “ much more optimistic ” values than lower - grade mortgages , says one .
Some 70 % of prime securities will eventually have their ratings cut , according to a “ downgrade - o- meter ” produced by JPMorgan Chase .
As Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance , a newsletter , puts it : “ The mortgage storm 's first wave was subprime .
Now we are being buffeted by Alt - A .
But a bigger wave is on the horizon , and it cuts across all loan types . ”
NEW YORK , March 27 ( Reuters ) - Proposals for creating a new global reserve currency to replace the U.S. dollar are gathering momentum but need further examination , Germany ’s development minister said on Friday .
Heidemarie Wieczorek - Zeul , Germany ’s minister for economic cooperation and development , is a member of a panel of experts established by U.N. General Assembly President Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann to analyze the global financial crisis and recommend reforms .
One of the recommendations in an 18 - page report the panel issued this week is to create a new reserve currency system based on the International Monetary Fund ’s Special Drawing Rights , or SDRs , to replace the U.S. dollar as the top reserve unit , an idea China supports .
Wieczorek - Zeul said the idea , which the panel ’s chairman , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , staunchly supports , needed further development .
“ This is one of the long - term issues , ” she told reporters .
“ But it ’s clear that even though it ’s a long - term issue , it has acquired a certain momentum now that countries have spoken positively of it , such as China . ”
“ I ’m absolutely certain that we will need further work on this from Stiglitz , ” Wieczorek - Zeul said .
“ We ’ll need to discuss not only the timeframe , but also in what steps it could be could be achievable . ”
Stiglitz told reporters on Thursday that a global reserve system based on SDRs could be phased in over the next 12 months , though he said it was unlikely to happen that fast .
He also said the specifics of a new system still needed to be worked out .
For details , see [ ID :nN26504037 ] .
Asked about Stiglitz ’s remarks , a top U.N. official on Friday also spoke in favor of scrapping the single - currency reserve system .
“ We really need a system where a national issuer of currency does not have the added responsibility of providing global currency , ” Jomo Kwame Sundaram , U.N. assistant secretary - general for economic development , told reporters .
Russia earlier this month proposed creating a new reserve currency , to be issued by international financial institutions .
This week , China outlined how SDRs could take over the dollar ’s role as the global reserve unit . [ ID : nPEK257817 ] .
On Wednesday , U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the dollar would remain the top reserve currency but expressed openness to the expanded use of SDRs .
[ ID :nN26446657 ]
The reserve currency topic is expected to come up at next Thursday ’s London summit meeting of the Group of 20 major developed and developing nations on the financial crisis .
The report by the U.N. panel said an SDR - based system “ could contribute to global stability , economic strength , and global equity . ”
It also said that such a system would be “ feasible , non-inflationary , and could be easily implemented . ” ( Editing by Neil Stempleman )
Q . As children , it seemed we had to wait an eternity to wait for something to happen .
Now , the Sunday paper that just came is here once more .
Why is it that as we age , time seems to race along ?
A . Why time often seems to go faster in old age is not well understood , but an hour , a month or a year is a significantly larger part of the lifetime of a 6 - year - old than it is of an 80 - year - old .
Because of this , Stephen Hawking and others have suggested that the difference in perceptions of time amounts to a specific mathematical ratio .
Image Credit ... Victoria Roberts
The philosopher and psychologist William James quoted approvingly a passage from a 19th - century French philosopher to that effect but suggested that relative age could not totally explain the phenomenon , and that the monotony of the events of old age compared with the vividness and novelty of the experiences of youth must also be considered .
MacWorld reports on the mysterious chip pertaining to the iPod Shuffle :
An Apple spokesman confirmed the presence of the chip to Macworld .
“ As part of the Made for iPod program , we make sure that third party headphones work properly with the third generation iPod shuffle , ” the spokesman said .
However , there is no DRM in this new control chip , according to Monster Cable ’s Kevin Lee , who added , “ In fact , it ’s not even authentication .
It just gives us a way to control the iPod . ”
Basically , this is no different than the already existent “ Made for iPod ” program currently used by Apple .
Time for a rant :
It ’s crazy how people will magnify a seemingly minor issue into a launching pad for “ Apple is evil ” style attacks .
Gimme a break .
If you do n’t like Apple ’s headphones , then do n’t buy the shuffle .
If you do n’t want to spend extra money on third party headphones , then do n’t buy the shuffle .
I mean , goddamn , how many people who are out there complaining were even planning on getting a shuffle in the first place ?
I bet not many .
And as for these DRM crusaders , they really need to pick their battles more selectively .
I mean , this is n’t like Microsoft forcing 95 % of all computer users in the 90’s to use Internet Explorer .
This is a f’n iPod Shuffle !!
Do n’t like it ?
Do n’t buy it .
DRM is n’t necessarily always bad either .
It ’s sort of like a knife in that it can be used to kill , or to help ( like a scalpel ) , and people need to realize that DRM is sometimes necessary .
I mean , without DRM , the iPod would have never even had a chance to succeed , and we ’d still be paying $ 18 bucks for a 12 song CD at Borders .
Again , DRM crusaders need to pick their battles .
This iPod Shuffle headphone ‘ controversy ’ is just nonsense .
Do n’t people have anything better to do ?
Well , I apparently do n’t since I ’m ranting about it , so maybe I should n’t be bitching about this in the first place .
Oh , the hypocrisy !
Okay , ranting done .
There are two major changes in the architecture of Rails applications : complete integration of the Rack modular web server interface , and renewed support for Rails Engines .
Rails has now broken with its CGI past , and uses Rack everywhere .
This required and resulted in a tremendous number of internal changes ( but if you use CGI , do n't worry ; Rails now supports CGI through a proxy interface . )
Still , this is a major change to Rails internals .
After upgrading to 2.3 , you should test on your local environment and your production environment .
Some things to test :
Sessions
Cookies
File uploads
JSON / XML APIs
Here 's a summary of the rack - related changes :
script / server has been switched to use Rack , which means it supports any Rack compatible server .
script / server will also pick up a rackup configuration file if one exists .
By default , it will look for a config .ru file , but you can override this with the -c switch .

After some versions without an upgrade , Rails 2.3 offers some new features for Rails Engines ( Rails applications that can be embedded within other applications ) .
First , routing files in engines are automatically loaded and reloaded now , just like your routes.rb file ( this also applies to routing files in other plugins ) .
Second , if your plugin has an app folder , then app / [ models|controllers|helpers ] will automatically be added to the Rails load path .
Engines also support adding view paths now , and Action Mailer as well as Action View will use views from engines and other plugins .
The Ruby on Rails guides project has published several additional guides for Rails 2.3 .
In addition , a separate site maintains updated copies of the Guides for Edge Rails .
Other documentation efforts include a relaunch of the Rails wiki and early planning for a Rails Book .
More Information : Rails Documentation Projects
Rails 2.3 should pass all of its own tests whether you are running on Ruby 1.8 or the now - released Ruby 1.9.1 .
You should be aware , though , that moving to 1.9.1 entails checking all of the data adapters , plugins , and other code that you depend on for Ruby 1.9.1 compatibility , as well as Rails core .
Active Record gets quite a number of new features and bug fixes in Rails 2.3 .
The highlights include nested attributes , nested transactions , dynamic and default scopes , and batch processing .
Active Record can now update the attributes on nested models directly , provided you tell it to do so :
class Book < ActiveRecord :: Base has_one :author has_many : pages accepts_nested_attributes_for :author , : pages end
Turning on nested attributes enables a number of things : automatic ( and atomic ) saving of a record together with its associated children , child - aware validations , and support for nested forms ( discussed later ) .
You can also specify requirements for any new records that are added via nested attributes using the : reject_if option :
accepts_nested_attributes_for :author , :reject_if => proc { |attributes| attributes [ ' name ' ] .
blank ? }
Active Record now supports nested transactions , a much - requested feature .
Now you can write code like this :
User.transaction do User.create (: username => ' Admin ' ) User.transaction(:requires_new => true ) do User.create ( : username => ' Regular ' ) raise ActiveRecord :: Rollback end end User.find ( : all ) # =>
Returns only Admin
Nested transactions let you roll back an inner transaction without affecting the state of the outer transaction .
If you want a transaction to be nested , you must explicitly add the : requires_new option ; otherwise , a nested transaction simply becomes part of the parent transaction ( as it does currently on Rails 2.2 ) .
Under the covers , nested transactions are using savepoints so they 're supported even on databases that do n't have true nested transactions .
There is also a bit of magic going on to make these transactions play well with transactional fixtures during testing .
You know about dynamic finders in Rails ( which allow you to concoct methods like find_by_color_and_flavor on the fly ) and named scopes ( which allow you to encapsulate reusable query conditions into friendly names like currently_active ) .
Well , now you can have dynamic scope methods .
The idea is to put together syntax that allows filtering on the fly and method chaining .
For example :
Order.scoped_by_customer_id( 12 ) Order.scoped_by_customer_id( 12 ) .find ( : all , : conditions => " status = ' open ' " ) Order.scoped_by_customer_id(12).scoped_by_status ( " open " )
There 's nothing to define to use dynamic scopes : they just work .
Rails 2.3 will introduce the notion of default scopes similar to named scopes , but applying to all named scopes or find methods within the model .
For example , you can write default_scope : order => ' name ASC ' and any time you retrieve records from that model they 'll come out sorted by name ( unless you override the option , of course ) .

You can now process large numbers of records from an Active Record model with less pressure on memory by using find_in_batches :
Customer.find_in_batches(:conditions => { :active => true} ) do |customer_group| customer_group.each { |customer| customer.update_account_balance !
} end
You can pass most of the find options into find_in_batches .
However , you cannot specify the order that records will be returned in ( they will always be returned in ascending order of primary key , which must be an integer ) , or use the : limit option .
Instead , use the : batch_size option , which defaults to 1000 , to set the number of records that will be returned in each batch .
The new find_each method provides a wrapper around find_in_batches that returns individual records , with the find itself being done in batches ( of 1000 by default ) :
Customer.find_each do |customer| customer.update_account_balance !
end
Note that you should only use this method for batch processing : for small numbers of records ( less than 1000 ) , you should just use the regular find methods with your own loop .
When using Active Record callbacks , you can now combine : if and : unless options on the same callback , and supply multiple conditions as an array :
before_save :update_credit_rating , : if => :active , :unless => [ : admin , : cash_only ]

Rails now has a : having option on find ( as well as on has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many associations ) for filtering records in grouped finds .
As those with heavy SQL backgrounds know , this allows filtering based on grouped results :
developers = Developer.find ( : all , : group => " salary " , : having => " sum ( salary ) > 10000 " , : select => " salary " )

MySQL supports a reconnect flag in its connections - if set to true , then the client will try reconnecting to the server before giving up in case of a lost connection .
You can now set reconnect = true for your MySQL connections in database .yml to get this behavior from a Rails application .
The default is false , so the behavior of existing applications does n't change .
An extra AS was removed from the generated SQL for has_and_belongs_to_many preloading , making it work better for some databases .

. ActiveRecord : : Base #invalid ?
now works as the opposite of ActiveRecord : : Base#valid ? .
Action Controller rolls out some significant changes to rendering , as well as improvements in routing and other areas , in this release .
ActionController :: Base #render is a lot smarter about deciding what to render .
Now you can just tell it what to render and expect to get the right results .
In older versions of Rails , you often need to supply explicit information to render :
render : file => '/tmp/random_file.erb ' render : template => ' other_controller/action ' render : action => ' show '
Now in Rails 2.3 , you can just supply what you want to render :
render '/tmp/random_file.erb ' render ' other_controller/action ' render ' show ' render : show
Rails chooses between file , template , and action depending on whether there is a leading slash , an embedded slash , or no slash at all in what 's to be rendered .
Note that you can also use a symbol instead of a string when rendering an action .
Other rendering styles ( : inline , : text , : update , : nothing , : json , :xml , :js ) still require an explicit option .
If you 're one of the people who has always been bothered by the special - case naming of application.rb , rejoice !
It 's been reworked to be application_controller.rb in Rails 2.3 .
In addition , there 's a new rake task , rake rails : update : application_controller to do this automatically for you - and it will be run as part of the normal rake rails : update process .
Rails now has built - in support for HTTP digest authentication .
To use it , you call authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest with a block that returns the user 's password ( which is then hashed and compared against the transmitted credentials ) :
class PostsController < ApplicationController Users = { " dhh " => " secret " } before_filter :authenticate def secret render : text => " Password Required ! " end private def authenticate realm = " Application " authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest( realm ) do |name| Users [ name ] end end end
There are a couple of significant routing changes in Rails 2.3 .
The formatted_ route helpers are gone , in favor just passing in : format as an option .
This cuts down the route generation process by 50 % for any resource - and can save a substantial amount of memory ( up to 100 MB on large applications ) .
If your code uses the formatted_ helpers , it will still work for the time being - but that behavior is deprecated and your application will be more efficient if you rewrite those routes using the new standard .
Another big change is that Rails now supports multiple routing files , not just routes.rb .
You can use RouteSet #add_configuration_file to bring in more routes at any time - without clearing the currently - loaded routes .
While this change is most useful for Engines , you can use it in any application that needs to load routes in batches .

A big change pushed the underpinnings of Action Controller session storage down to the Rack level .
This involved a good deal of work in the code , though it should be completely transparent to your Rails applications ( as a bonus , some icky patches around the old CGI session handler got removed ) .
It 's still significant , though , for one simple reason : non-Rails Rack applications have access to the same session storage handlers ( and therefore the same session ) as your Rails applications .
In addition , sessions are now lazy - loaded ( in line with the loading improvements to the rest of the framework ) .
This means that you no longer need to explicitly disable sessions if you do n't want them ; just do n't refer to them and they wo n't load .
There are a couple of changes to the code for handling MIME types in Rails .
First , MIME :: Type now implements the =~ operator , making things much cleaner when you need to check for the presence of a type that has synonyms :
if content_type && Mime : : JS =~ content_type # do something cool end Mime : : JS =~ " text / javascript " => true Mime :: JS =~ " application / javascript " => true
The other change is that the framework now uses the Mime : : JS when checking for JavaScript in various spots , making it handle those alternatives cleanly .

In some of the first fruits of the Rails - Merb team merger , Rails 2.3 includes some optimizations for the respond_to method , which is of course heavily used in many Rails applications to allow your controller to format results differently based on the MIME type of the incoming request .
After eliminating a call to method_missing and some profiling and tweaking , we 're seeing an 8 % improvement in the number of requests per second served with a simple respond_to that switches between three formats .
The best part ?
No change at all required to the code of your application to take advantage of this speedup .
Rails now keeps a per-request local cache of read from the remote cache stores , cutting down on unnecessary reads and leading to better site performance .
While this work was originally limited to MemCacheStore , it is available to any remote store than implements the required methods .

Rails can now provide localized views , depending on the locale that you have set .
For example , suppose you have a Posts controller with a show action .
By default , this will render app / views / posts / show.html.erb .
But if you set I18n. locale = : da , it will render app / views / posts/show.da.html.erb .
If the localized template is n't present , the undecorated version will be used .
Rails also includes I18n # available_locales and I18n :: SimpleBackend #available_locales , which return an array of the translations that are available in the current Rails project .
In addition , you can use the same scheme to localize the rescue files in the public directory : public / 500.da.html or public /404.en.html work , for example .
A change to the translation API makes things easier and less repetitive to write key translations within partials .
If you call translate ( " . foo " ) from the people / index.html.erb template , you 'll actually be calling I18n.
translate ( " people.index.foo " )
If you do n't prepend the key with a period , then the API does n't scope , just as before .
ETag handling has been cleaned up a bit : Rails will now skip sending an ETag header when there 's no body to the response or when sending files with send_file .
.
The fact that Rails checks for IP spoofing can be a nuisance for sites that do heavy traffic with cell phones , because their proxies do n't generally set things up right .
If that 's you , you can now set ActionController : : Base.ip_spoofing_check = false to disable the check entirely .

polymorphic_url does a better job of handling objects with irregular plural names .
Action View in Rails 2.3 picks up nested model forms , improvements to render , more flexible prompts for the date select helpers , and a speedup in asset caching , among other things .
Provided the parent model accepts nested attributes for the child objects ( as discussed in the Active Record section ) , you can create nested forms using form_for and field_for .
These forms can be nested arbitrarily deep , allowing you to edit complex object hierarchies on a single view without excessive code .
For example , given this model :
class Customer < ActiveRecord :: Base has_many :orders accepts_nested_attributes_for :orders , :allow_destroy => true end
You can write this view in Rails 2.3 :
< % form_for @customer do |customer_form| %> < div > <%= customer_form.label :name , ' Customer Name : ' %> <%= customer_form.text_field : name %> </div> <!--
Here we call fields_for on the customer_form builder instance .
The block is called for each member of the orders collection .
--> <% customer_form.fields_for :orders do |order_form| %> < p > < div > <%= order_form.label :number , ' Order Number : ' %> <%= order_form.text_field : number %> </div> <!--
The allow_destroy option in the model enables deletion of child records .
--> <% unless order_form.object.new_record ? %> < div > <%= order_form.label :_delete , ' Remove : ' %> <%= order_form.check_box :_delete %> </div > <% end %> </ p> <% end %> <% = customer_form.submit %> <% end %>
The render method has been getting smarter over the years , and it 's even smarter now .
If you have an object or a collection and an appropriate partial , and the naming matches up , you can now just render the object and things will work .
For example , in Rails 2.3 , these render calls will work in your view ( assuming sensible naming ) :
# Equivalent of render : partial => ' articles / _article ' , # :object => @article render @article # Equivalent of render : partial => ' articles / _article ' , # : collection => @articles render @articles
In Rails 2.3 , you can supply custom prompts for the various date select helpers ( date_select , time_select , and datetime_select ) , the same way you can with collection select helpers .
You can supply a prompt string or a hash of individual prompt strings for the various components .
You can also just set : prompt to true to use the custom generic prompt :
select_datetime(DateTime.now , : prompt => true ) select_datetime ( DateTime.now , : prompt =>
" Choose date and time " ) select_datetime ( DateTime.now , : prompt => {: day => ' Choose day ' , : month => ' Choose month ' , : year => ' Choose year ' , : hour => ' Choose hour ' , : minute => ' Choose minute '} )

You 're likely familiar with Rails ' practice of adding timestamps to static asset paths as a " cache buster . "
This helps ensure that stale copies of things like images and stylesheets do n't get served out of the user 's browser cache when you change them on the server .
You can now modify this behavior with the cache_asset_timestamps configuration option for Action View .
If you enable the cache , then Rails will calculate the timestamp once when it first serves an asset , and save that value .
This means fewer ( expensive ) file system calls to serve static assets - but it also means that you can't modify any of the assets while the server is running and expect the changes to get picked up by clients .
Asset hosts get more flexible in edge Rails with the ability to declare an asset host as a specific object that responds to a call .
This allows you to implement any complex logic you need in your asset hosting .
Action View already had a bunch of helpers to aid in generating select controls , but now there 's one more : grouped_options_for_select .
This one accepts an array or hash of strings , and converts them into a string of option tags wrapped with optgroup tags .
For example :
grouped_options_for_select ( [ [ " Hats " , [ " Baseball Cap " , " Cowboy Hat " ] ] ] , " Cowboy Hat " , " Choose a product ... " )
returns
< option value= " " > Choose a product ...</ option > < optgroup label= " Hats " > < option value= " Baseball Cap " > Baseball Cap </ option > < option selected =" selected " value= " Cowboy Hat " > Cowboy Hat</ option > </optgroup >
The form select helpers ( such as select and options_for_select ) now support a : disabled option , which can take a single value or an array of values to be disabled in the resulting tags :
select ( : post , : category , Post :: CATEGORIES , : disabled => ' private ' )
returns
< select name= " post [ category ] " > < option > story </ option > < option > joke </option > < option > poem </option > < option disabled =" disabled " > private </option > </ select >
You can also use an anonymous function to determine at runtime which options from collections will be selected and / or disabled :
options_from_collection_for_select(@product.sizes , :name , :id , : disabled => lambda{|size| size.out_of_stock ?} )
Rails 2.3 includes the ability to enable or disable cached templates for any particular environment .
Cached templates give you a speed boost because they do n't check for a new template file when they 're rendered - but they also mean that you can't replace a template " on the fly " without restarting the server .
In most cases , you 'll want template caching to be turned on in production , which you can do by making a setting in your production.rb file :
config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true
This line will be generated for you by default in a new Rails 2.3 application .
If you 've upgraded from an older version of Rails , Rails will default to caching templates in production and test but not in development .
Token generation for CSRF protection has been simplified ; now Rails uses a simple random string generated by ActiveSupport : : SecureRandom rather than mucking around with session IDs .

current_page ?
now works properly even when there are multiple query parameters in the URL .
Active Support has a few interesting changes , including the introduction of Object#try .
A lot of folks have adopted the notion of using try ( ) to attempt operations on objects .
It 's especially helpful in views where you can avoid nil - checking by writing code like <% = @person.try ( : name ) %> .
Well , now it 's baked right into Rails .
As implemented in Rails , it raises NoMethodError on private methods and always returns nil if the object is nil .
Object#tap is an addition to Ruby 1.9 and 1.8.7 that is similar to the returning method that Rails has had for a while : it yields to a block , and then returns the object that was yielded .
Rails now includes code to make this available under older versions of Ruby as well .
The support for XML parsing in Active Support has been made more flexible by allowing you to swap in different parsers .
By default , it uses the standard REXML implementation , but you can easily specify the faster LibXML or Nokogiri implementations for your own applications , provided you have the appropriate gems installed :
XmlMini.backend = ' LibXML '
The Time and TimeWithZone classes include an xmlschema method to return the time in an XML - friendly string .
As of Rails 2.3 , TimeWithZone supports the same argument for specifying the number of digits in the fractional second part of the returned string that Time does :
>> Time.zone.now.xmlschema(6 ) =>
" 2009-01-16T13:00:06.13653

If you look up the spec on the " json.org " site , you 'll discover that all keys in a JSON structure must be strings , and they must be quoted with double quotes .
Starting with Rails 2.3 , we do the right thing here , even with numeric keys .
You can use Enumerable # none ?
to check that none of the elements match the supplied block .

ActiveSupport :: Json.decode now handles \u0000 style escape sequences .
In addition to the Rack changes covered above , Railties ( the core code of Rails itself ) sports a number of significant changes , including Rails Metal , application templates , and quiet backtraces .
Rails Metal is a new mechanism that provides superfast endpoints inside of your Rails applications .
Metal classes bypass routing and Action Controller to give you raw speed ( at the cost of all the things in Action Controller , of course ) .
This builds on all of the recent foundation work to make Rails a Rack application with an exposed middleware stack .
Metal endpoints can be loaded from your application or from plugins .
Rails 2.3 incorporates Jeremy McAnally 's rg application generator .
What this means is that we now have template - based application generation built right into Rails ; if you have a set of plugins you include in every application ( among many other use cases ) , you can just set up a template once and use it over and over again when you run the rails command .
There 's also a rake task to apply a template to an existing application :
rake rails : template LOCATION=~/template.rb
This will layer the changes from the template on top of whatever code the project already contains .
Building on thoughtbot 's Quiet Backtrace plugin , which allows you to selectively remove lines from Test :: Unit backtraces , Rails 2.3 implements ActiveSupport :: BacktraceCleaner and Rails :: BacktraceCleaner in core .
This supports both filters ( to perform regex - based substitutions on backtrace lines ) and silencers ( to remove backtrace lines entirely ) .
Rails automatically adds silencers to get rid of the most common noise in a new application , and builds a config / backtrace_silencers.rb file to hold your own additions .
This feature also enables prettier printing from any gem in the backtrace .
Quite a bit of work was done to make sure that bits of Rails ( and its dependencies ) are only brought into memory when they 're actually needed .
The core frameworks - Active Support , Active Record , Action Controller , Action Mailer , and Action View - are now using autoload to lazy - load their individual classes .
This work should help keep the memory footprint down and improve overall Rails performance .
You can also specify ( by using the new preload_frameworks option ) whether the core libraries should be autoloaded at startup .
This defaults to false so that Rails autoloads itself piece - by - piece , but there are some circumstances where you still need to bring in everything at once - Passenger and JRuby both want to see all of Rails loaded together .
The internals of the various rake gem tasks have been substantially revised , to make the system work better for a variety of cases .
The gem system now knows the difference between development and runtime dependencies , has a more robust unpacking system , gives better information when querying for the status of gems , and is less prone to " chicken and egg " dependency issues when you 're bringing things up from scratch .
There are also fixes for using gem commands under JRuby and for dependencies that try to bring in external copies of gems that are already vendored .

Digital Rights Agency
Requiring ISPs to notify alleged infringers of rights ( subject to reasonable levels of proof from rights - holders ) that their conduct is unlawful .
Require ISPs to collect anonymised information on serious repeat infringers ( derived from their notification activities ) , to be made available to rights - holders together with personal details on receipt of a court order .
protocol blocking
bandwidth restrictions
Quote from Proposals :
Development of codes of practice around enforcement measures to prevent and reduce online copyright infringement .
These would need to be strong enough to be likely to make a real impact on the problem , and could include , for example , such approaches as protocol blocking or bandwidth , in relation to persistent infringers .
* A commitment to explain to the public the consequences of unlawful use of copyright material .
This is an important task - no matter how much effort goes into trying stop people from engaging in piracy it will only work in the long run if they understand the damage infringement has on the artists and the ongoing availability of the rich content they value .
* Facilitation of negotiation and rights clearance and discussion around standards where the different interests would find that useful .
Taking into account competition concerns , there should be plenty for an agency to do in terms of making deals easier , rather than trying to get involved itself  almost certainly neither possible nor wanted by either side .
* A place where people could go to resolve disputes quickly and economically , and where consumers will find a champion where needed .
* A forum for dialogue .
We sometimes underestimate the value of providing a place where those from a different industrial perspective can meet and gain appreciation of other positions and drivers , and in many ways this will underpin all other activity .
* A gateway in to the legal remedies being set out in P2P legislation , and to an informed discussion on other potential ways to deal with persistent infringement , such as road - testing technical measures .
Should there be no agreement between industry on the utilisation of such measures , " says the document , " it would be for the regulator 
Ofcom  to chose whether to impose such measures , judging their appropriateness and need within the policy principles within which they work . " " says the document , "
The Intellectual Property Office ( IPO ) has published a draft set of proposals for tackling illegal broadband file sharing downloads by persistent infringers , among other things .
The proposals form part of a discussion piece concerning the role that a UK ( DRA ) could play .
Readers may recall that the DRA was first proposed in Lord Carters Digital Britain report during late January - Digital Britain Report  UK Illegal File Sharing Solution Proposals .
Back then there were only two firm legislative proposals put forward for tackling the problem :
However many copyright holders feel that such measures alone are not enough to tackle those who persist in such activity .
One earlier proposal , that of disconnecting the customer from their ISP , has already been ruled out by most .
The new discussion piece , while not going into much detail , has proposed two potential example solutions to the problem .
UK ISPs could employor , in relation to persistent infringers .
In other words , P2P services could be blocked or users might find their service speeds seriously restricted :
It 's not clear whether a bandwidth restriction would only impact P2P or not , although we'd hope that would be the idea .
The DRA would also seek to provide a far greater facility for tackling the problem and dealing with consumer disagreements , as outlined below :
One particularly interesting aspect of the new proposals is that it would not be limited to tackling unlawful peer to peer activity .
Instead the DRA would be geared towards finding effective ways of reducing the overall levels of online copyright infringement over time , allowing for changing behaviours and technologies ( i.e. it might tackle Newsgroups , FTP and other services where illegal usage takes place on a users account ) .
Typically all of these proposals rest on ISPs being able to reach some kind of agreement with the creative industry .
Should that fail then the " " option would be for tougher measures to be introduced through legislation . " " says the paper .
The paper stresses that the DRA would n't just be setup to tackle illegal broadband ISP file sharing ( P2P ) , it would also be a vision for facilitating a change of approach as to how content is provided , packaged and sold to consumers .
That means things such as helping legal music download channels to flourish alongside ISPs .
Sadly the more complicated issues , such as how you can reliably and accurately identify illegal downloaders on mass without being caught out by fake , redirected and or spoofed IPs and encryption is n't really touched on .
Similarly there are limits to how far UK ISPs are able to peek into the activity of their users without breaking laws , running up excessive costs or hitting technical hurdles .
We would hope that this aspect is given serious attention in the main draft .
Feedback will now be taken on the paper until 30th March 2009 and the full report should follow later .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 15 ( UPI ) -- House Democrats
Thursday offered a two - year , $ 825 billion economic stimulus plan that channels more funds to new spending and less to tax cuts than proposed .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described the House bill as a first step in what she said would be intense negotiations with the Senate and the administration of President - elect Barack Obama , The Washington Post reported .

The plan 's price tag has just about tripled since the fall .
Obama offered a $ 775 billion package earlier in January and Senate Democrats have predicted their stimulus proposal could reach $ 850 billion .
If an expected $ 70 billion alternative minimum tax patch is included in the final legislation , the finished product could top $ 900 billion and possible reach nearly $ 1 trillion , the Post said .
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , both vowed to deliver a stimulus plan to Obama by Feb. 13 .
The House bill includes about $ 550 billion in domestic spending and about $ 275 billion in business and individual tax relief .
Writers dropped Obama 's campaign proposal of a $ 3,000 tax credit for every new worker hired by U.S. companies , but kept his campaign promise of a payroll tax credit for individuals earning less than $ 75,000 and couples making less than $ 150,000 .
The proposal also includes adjustments to the child tax credit and education and new home - buyer incentives , energy incentives , healthcare proposals and temporary increases in unemployment and welfare funding , among other things .
Obama plans to discuss the stimulus proposal Friday at a wind turbine manufacturer in Bedford Heights , Ohio .
WASHINGTON 
The administration has no present plans to reopen negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement to add labor and environmental protections , as President Obama vowed to do during his campaign , the top trade official said on Monday .
“ The president has said we will look at all of our options , but I think they can be addressed without having to reopen the agreement , ” said the official , Ronald Kirk , the United States trade representative .
It was perhaps the clearest indication yet of the administration ’s thinking on whether to reopen the core agreement to add labor and environmental rules .
Mr. Kirk spoke in a conference call with reporters after returning from a regional summit meeting that Mr. Obama attended over the weekend in Trinidad .
He said that Mr. Obama had conferred with the leaders of Mexico and Canada  the other parties to the trade agreement  and that “ they are all of the mind we should look for opportunities to strengthen Nafta . ”
But while he said that a formal review of the 1992 pact had yet to be completed , Mr. Kirk noted that both Mr. Obama and President Felipe Calderon of Mexico had said that “ they do n’t believe we have to reopen the agreement now . ”
B'Tselem releases 2008 annual report - among the findings :
Of the 548 Palestinians Israel is detaining without trial , 42 have been held for over two years , according to figures appearing in B'Tselem 's annual report , published today .
Twenty - three have been administratively detained for over two and a half years , including three who have been detained between three and four and a half years , and two over four and a half consecutive years .
In fact , the vast majority of administrative detainees ( 372 ) have been held without charge or trial for at least two consecutive periods .
In 2008 , the number of administrative detainees dropped gradually : from 813 in January to 546 in December .
Six of the detainees in December were minors .
For the first time , Israel held two female minors in administrative detention ; both had their detention period extended for a second period .
B'Tselem demands that Israel immediately release all administrative detainees , or try them for the offences they are alleged to have committed .
The total number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli custody at the end of December was 7,904 .
/>
Casualties
B'Tselem 's annual report also includes figures on the number of Palestinians and Israelis killed during the course of the year ( not including in Operation Cast Lead ) .
Up until December 26 , Israeli security forces killed 455 Palestinians ( including eighty - seven minors ) .
At least 175 of those killed ( 38 percent ) did not take part in the hostilities .
18 Israeli civilians were killed by Palestinians inside Israel .
Eight of them ( four minors ) , were killed in the attack at the Merkaz Harav yeshiva , in Jerusalem and Four were killed by rocket attacks and mortar fire .
Three Israeli civilians were killed by Palestinians in the Territories .
Palestinians killed ten members of the Israeli security forces .
Restrictions on movement
In contrast to official Israeli claims , Palestinian freedom of movement did not improve significantly in 2008 .
There are sixty - three permanent staffed checkpoints inside the West Bank , eighteen of them in the city of Hebron .
In addition , the army restricts Palestinian movement on 430 kilometers of roads , on which Israelis are allowed free use .
On 137 kilometers of these roads , Palestinian travel is completely prohibited .
Forty checkpoints serve as crossing points into Israel , although most are them are located a few kilometers inside the West Bank , and not along the Israeli border .
The number of physical obstructions Israel maintained in the West Bank actually increased in 2008 .
In the first nine months of 2008 , the average number of such obstructions was 537 , compared with a monthly average of 459 in 2007 .
B'Tselem 's annual report surveys many additional violations of human rights in the Occupied Territories during 2008 .
Among them : house demolition , the continued construction of the separation barrier within the West Bank , settlement expansion and the lack of law enforcement on violent settlers .
The report also addresses the systematic lack of accountability for harm caused to Palestinians by Israeli security forces .
David Hart , former Montana state coordinator for presidential candidate Ron Paul , sent out an e-mail Tuesday urging support for House Bill 639 , which would allow the state of Montana to “ conduct various financial transactions in gold . ”
The bill , introduced by Rep. Bob Wagner , R- Harrison , may face a committee vote this week , according to Hart .
WorldNetDaily.com , a popular conservative Web site , published a story on the legislation , under the headline : “ State considers return to gold , silver dollars . ”
An excerpt :
Critics of the current financial system argue that using Federal Reserve notes as legal tender , rather than gold - or silver - backed currency , means the value of Americans ’ money – and thus their “ property ” – is siphoned away by inflation , a process perpetuated by the government ’s reliance on legal tender .
Gold and silver , critics say , do n’t lose their value on the whims of the Federal Reserve .
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , even favors abolishing the Fed ’s system of fiat currency to return to dollars backed by gold .
“ Throughout its nearly 100 - year history , the Federal Reserve has presided over the near - complete destruction of the United States dollar , ” the Texas Republican said .
“ Since 1913 the dollar has lost over 95 percent of its purchasing power , aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve ’s loose monetary policy .

March 3 , 2009  -- Bernard Madoff 's criminal defense attorney , Ira Lee Sorkin has received death threats , hostile e-mails and now an anti-Semitic threat , ABC News has learned .
" This is in regard to your efforts on the behalf of Bernard Madoff .
As one Jew to another I deeply regret that the Sorkin family did not perish in the Nazi death camps , " read an email sent to Sorkin at 8:15 am this morning , ABC News has learned .
ABC News is not publishing the identity of the sender until the sender has been reached for comment .
According to sources close to the defense team , Sorkin , a well regarded member of New York 's defense bar , has received " between 12 and 15 " e-mails of a " cursing " , " screaming " nature .
Mixed in , say sources , are also " a handful " of death threats .
News of the most recent email suggesting Sorkin and his family ought to have died at the hands of the Nazis arrived on the eve of a federal court hearing to rule on whether there is a conflict in Sorkin 's representation of Madoff .
Late Tuesday , the hearing was adjourned to next week because of scheduling reasons .
ABC News learned from investigators and lawyers in the case that one possible reason prosecutors would like Sorkin off the case is newly discovered evidence that Madoff created a phony account in the name of Sorkin , without the lawyer 's knowledge , to allegedly move stolen money from his $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme into secret accounts overseas .
Sorkin was incredulous at that suggestion and he said it was just not true .
" There are two reasons for the hearing .
That is it , " he said .
" Here are the reasons : the two issues are my representation of ( Frank ) Avellino and ( Michael ) Bienes 17 years and the account my father had with Madoff , which was then conveyed to my mother [ both of Sorkin 's parents are now deceased ] .... which I have already addressed , " said Sorkin .
The accountants Avellino and Bienes were linked to Madoff , court documents in the case showed .
In a deal with the SEC , Avellino shut down his firm , returned money to investors and paid a $ 350,000 fine .
Madoff was not sued by the SEC in the 1992 case .
Madoff Returns to Court
An official announcement from Judge Leonard Sand called the hearing a " counsel conflict , " without any further explanation .
The clerk of the court said the hearing " is over a potential conflict of interest between Mr. Madoff and his attorney . "
Madoff will appear at the hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand , officials said .
A clerk in the judge 's chambers said the hearing was scheduled for 10 a.m.
Wednesday , before it was rescheduled for sometime next week .
Madoff , 70 , has been charged in a $ 50 billion worldwide Ponzi scheme in which early investors are redeemed with the money of new clients .
The once - respected Wall Street trader and investment manager was arrested and charged with fraud in December after authorities said he confessed to running the scheme over many years .
He is the only person charged in the purported fraud and has not appeared in court to formally answer the charge .
Last month , Sorkin 's name appeared on a mailing list of 13,000 individuals and institutions filed by the trustee winding down Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York .
Sorkin said the listing was the result of his father 's account and that account was the second reason for the hearing .

From Russia with Love
Here is a rather funny story from Russia .
More pictures and the full story from : http://englishrussia.com/?p=2260
Recently Russian service centers of Canon have started receiving complains from the people having the troubles with their CanonÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦ vacuum cleaners .
It seems that one large electronics supplier in Russia has bought somewhere what they truely believed to be Canon Vacuum Cleaners , and even advertised them .
So many bought intrigued by the brand name and overall feeling to get something cool from Canon .
Now it seems it was a nice planned action to sell thousands of some third party , probably Chinese vacuum cleaners labeled as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ CanonÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , having the manual and boxes looking like actual Canon stuff .

I attended a Christian college not because I was Christian at the time ( I was far more public about my atheism back then ) but because the school had a great reputation in the region .
I encountered my share of religiously - motivated bigotry , probably more than I would have at one of the state universities in the area .
Some of the negative experiences I had did probably come about because most of the other students were Christian .
Still , I suppose this ended up being good preparation for life in Mississippi .
In fact , there is not much I would change about my college experience .
It was n't always pleasant , but it helped to make me who I am today .
Some of you who are on Twitter may have seen the recent tweets tagged with # ExposeChristianSchools .
If not , many people have been using it to share their negative experiences attending Christian schools in the aftermath of Vice President Pence 's comments about how Christian education should not be criticized because he and his wife ( i.e. , " Mother " ) are offended by such criticism .
While I support the hashtag , my experiences attending a Christian college were far more positive than most of what I saw on Twitter .
I feel very fortunate for that .
In this post , I 'd like to tell you about a particularly outstanding Christian professor who I admired and respected a great deal .
If nothing else , this may serve as a reminder that even devout Christians at Christian colleges can sometimes be wonderful teachers and good people .
The professor in question had his appointment in the departments of philosophy and held degrees in both religion and philosophy .
The course I took with him was an upper - level philosophy course on the philosophy of religion .
I ended up minoring in philosophy after being unable to figure out what I would do with a philosophy major .
I went into the course as a fairly rabid anti-theist with a chip on my shoulder .
I suppose I expected to be penalized for expressing what I really thought about religion .
Nothing could have been further from the truth .
Well , that 's not entirely accurate .
You see , I did take plenty of shit from the other students , nearly all of whom were Christians .
But the professor was nothing but accepting , encouraging , and genuinely helpful .
As we studied the various arguments for and against the existence of gods , focusing on classic and contemporary Christian apologists , the professor was clear about what he believed but equally clear that we were to arrive at our own conclusions .
He never preached or attempted to impose his beliefs .
Students were expected to wrestle with the material and critically evaluate it .
Learning what others said was part of it , but it was also expected that we would each gain clarity about what we believed and why .
In hindsight , this might have been my favorite class from my time in college .
It was quite difficult , both intellectually and emotionally , because it forced us to fully engage the material .
I saw more than a couple Christian students break down and cry in class when one of their cherished arguments was effectively demolished and they were left with questions they could not answer .
I remained an atheist , but I became more thoughtful and mature about my atheism .
Yes , this Christian professor helped me gain a better understanding of why I was an atheist .
Best of all , I experienced support and guidance from someone who clearly did not agree with me but was nevertheless committed to helping me make the best arguments I could .
I never felt as though he wanted me to be a Christian .
He was fine with me being an atheist and committed to helping me be a more effective one .
Whenever I am tempted to lump all Christians together and apply categorical statements , I recall this professor as one of the exceptions .
An early version of this post appeared on Atheist Revolution in 2009 .
It was revised and expanded in 2019 .
I will answer this question old school , PlayStation 1 , " Resident Evil " - style .

Raids intensified under former President Bush with nearly one hundred paramilitary style raids at medical cannabis facilities .
According to the Washington Times February 5 , 2009 article , ( " Bush Holdovers at DEA Continue Pot Raids " )
" Drug Enforcement Administration agents this week raided four medical marijuana shops in California , contrary to President Obama 's campaign promises to stop the raids .
The White House said it expects those kinds of raids to end once Mr. Obama nominates someone to take charge of DEA , which is still run by Bush administration holdovers .
' The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government , he expects them to review their policies with that in mind , ' White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said . "
The article adds , " Medical use of marijuana is legal under the law in California and a dozen other states , but the federal government under President Bush , bolstered by a 2005 Supreme Court ruling , argued that federal interests trumped state law .
Dogged by marijuana advocates throughout the campaign , Mr. Obama repeatedly said he was opposed to using the federal government to raid medical marijuana shops , particularly because it was an infringement on states ' decisions .
' I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue , ' Mr. Obama told the Mail Tribune newspaper in Oregon in March , during the Democratic primary campaign .
He told the newspaper the ' basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors , I think that 's entirely appropriate . '
Mr. Obama is still filling key law enforcement posts .
For now , DEA is run by acting Administrator Michele Leonhart , a Bush appointee . "
SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( CNN ) --
Search operations resumed Monday for six U.S. citizens missing since their small plane crashed Sunday evening off the north coast of Puerto Rico .
The U.S. Coast Guard found debris late Sunday night in the area where the single - engine Cessna 206 went down , half a nautical mile from the shoreline of the city of Quebradillas .
But despite five searches Sunday and two others throughout the night , rescue crews were not able to find the pilot or the five passengers from the plane , the Coast Guard said Monday .
Three searches are planned for Monday , said Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad .
The private plane , chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp. , took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening , officials said .
Three male and two female passengers were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic , said Noemi Corporan , service manager for Tropical Aviation Corp .
The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday , she said .
Four HH - 65 Dolphin helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and the Coast Guard Cutter Matinicus are taking part in the search , said spokesman Castrodad .
The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. Customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan , the Coast Guard said .
A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas .
The debris field was found around 10:30 p.m .

Paul Waugh has blogged today about the question of how long MPs spend in the Commons .
As one might expect of a blog which is rapidly moving up many people ’s ‘ must read ’ lists , it ’s a better piece than many of those written on the topic .
He does give a few outings to the point that if an MP is absent from Parliament , that does n’t mean they are not working :
A combination of generous holidays and reformed hours means that many MPs now have what is effectively a three day week ( tho in some cases it is a two - and - a - half day week ) .
This is Westminster ’s dirty little secret that no one here wants to talk about …
The main culprit is New Labour ’s creation of “ constituency days ” .
This means that the House sits very rarely on a Friday and instead Members are supposed to be devoting themselves to their constituents .
Some MPs are incredibly hard - working but beyond the Friday surgery ( which is often at tea time ) , and the odd school visit or fete , what do they really do with this day off from Parliament ?
Many of them spend time doing party work ( as opposed to Parliamentary work ) , holding street stalls , canvassing and so on .
Sadly , the only way of checking would be to follow them from morning til night around their constituency , keeping a distance like a plain - clothes copper .
Similarly , what do they do with their very generous holidays ?
…
Again , every MP here will tell you that these are not really “ holidays ” and they are all working hard in their constituencies – but we have no real idea what they do with this time .
Leaving aside the slightly odd implication that canvassing and street stalls do n’t count as proper ways for MPs to spend their time ( is n’t an MP spending time meeting the public an essential part of their job ? ) , what really strikes me about this is Paul Waugh ’s honesty in admitting he does n’t know what MPs actually get up to .
Actually , I think there are plenty of ways of finding out what MPs actually get up to without having to do the stalking act talked about in the piece .
To give just one : the register of interests gives an immediate starting point for asking some MPs how much time they spend on some of their outside interests .
And here ’s another one : the Hansard Society has done a lot of research into the behaviour of MPs .
None of them are a five minute research job , true ; they would require a reasonable investment of investigative time by a media outlet .
So full marks for the honesty , but what does it say about all the collective output of all those journalists who have opined on this subject over the years if the net result is to say , “ sorry , mate – we do n’t know what ’s going on ” ?
This state of affairs is a far more damning indictment of journalism than it is of Parliament .
Independent developer and publisher Stardock is nearly doubling its staff -- and CEO Brad Wardell tells Gamasutra the expansion will allow the company to develop a new RPG title as well as restart development on its dormant RTS / MMO hybridPart of the plan includes a new 53 - person development team , which is to begin work on a new , as yet unannounced , roleplaying game .
Stardock 's current main team , responsible for theseries as well as the upcoming , will refocus onas soon as it wraps up development onearly next year .
Wardell declined to elaborate on the untitled RPG , given its current unscheduled -- likely far - off -- release period .
But in an interview with Gamasutra last year , Wardell alluded to plans for a new development team and referenced BioWare as a touchstone .
"
We 'd like to do a roleplaying game , " he said at the time , mentioning BioWare ' sand , saying a Stardock game might well feature " the same style of isometric gameplay -- not first - person -- where I have a party that I 'm interacting with .
I think there are a lot of people who want that .
" Michigan 's governor , Jennifer Granholm , made special note of Stardock in her State of the State address last night , pointing to the company as one of Michigan 's bright spots in an economic downturn .
Wardell says it was the state 's aggressive incentive package that convinced Stardock to boost its local presence , with an expected 53 staffers to add to its existing 60 .
" Before the state of Michigan got involved with us , we were originally planning to set up a studio somewhere else -- San Francisco or Seattle , " Wardell tells Gamasutra .
" In [ those cities ] , there are more game developers than in Michigan .
But when the state heard we were considering moving , they came in and said they were going to help .
"
In addition to the considerable tax benefits offered , Michigan promised a significant upgrade of the communications infrastructure available to the studio , which Wardell says is currently deficient compared to what is available to tech firms in other states .
" Because we 're in Michigan , the communications infrastructure has lagged so far , " he explains .
" We have to upload things from our office , and we 're using Comcast -- which is fine if you 're at home , but it 's slow for what we need .
That 's the kind of thing we 're up against .
It affects our business .
" That limitation was one reason development onhalted .
" This is ridiculous , " Wardell recalled thinking .
" How could we make an MMO with this kind of online infrastructure ?
" The CEO was quick to add that those infrastructure issues have never affected users ; they have only been inconvenient for Stardock itself .
" Our actual data centers are state of the art and located all over the world , " he stresses .
But while the company has grand plans to boost its internal development , it wants to keep its third - party publishing operation focused on one game at a time , because of how closely it works with its development partners .
" As Gas Powered Games and Ironclad can tell you , we get very involved in the games , " Wardell says .
Currently , the publishing group is finishing its work on Gas Powered Games ' " [ That team ] is evaluating some other publishing projects right now , " he adds .
" We get a lot of submissions , so it 's a matter of picking the right ones , and it has to time with out own publishing schedule .
We 'd love to have published Gas Powered 's , for example , but we could n't give bothandthe attention they deserve at the same time .
" Still , Stardock is in ongoing talks with both Gas Powered and Ironclad Games , offame , both of which remain potential future collaborators .
" We have really good relations with both of them , " says Wardell , " but I can't comment right now about anything specific . "
There will be no rewrite of " Candle in the Wind " for Jade Goody 's funeral , but in her own glottal , gobby way , she jabbed a knitting needle into the subconscious of Britain just as surely as Diana Spencer did , and revealed something dark and darkening about us .
Why was a big - hearted , big - mouthed young woman who came fourth on a reality show back in 2002 seized on with such glee and turned into one of the most famous people in the country ?
Because we needed her , to salve our own soiled consciences .
In her short life , Jade showed how as Britain has spiralled into one of the most unequal and immobile societies on earth , we have begun to openly jeer and sneer at the people trapped at the bottom .
We gleefully seized on her as " proof " that the people rotting on abandoned estates were not there because of the grim accident of birth , but because they were stupid and ugly and bigoted .
And all we proved – with unwitting irony – was our own stupidity and ugliness and bigotry .
Here was a 20 - year - old girl with a noisy laugh , a quick wit , and almost no knowledge .
She thought " East Angular " was a separate country , and wondered what currency they use in Liverpool .
So the press jeered that she was " a moron " , " the High Priestess of the Slagocracy " , and " proof of Britain 's underclass " .

That summer , a string of images of white , working - class women presenting them as bestial imbeciles dominated our screens .
Vicky Pollard – a single mum so thick she swaps her baby for a Westlife CD , played by a multimillionaire private schoolboy – was becoming a national icon .
A chaotic single mum established Wife Swap as one of our favourite shows .
Words of straightforward snobbish abuse – " chav " and " pikey " – were becoming acceptable again .
Go to any extremely unequal society , say , South Africa , or South America , and you will find a furiously suppressed sense of guilt .
It 's hard not to ask , at the back of your mind , " Why am I here in this mansion , while they are in the slums ? "
This guilt is resolved one way : by convincing yourself that the poor are sub - human , and do n't have feelings like you and me .
Oh , the people in the barrios and townships ?
They 're animals !
They stink !
They 're stupid !
Jade and Vicky and the labelling of the poor as " chavs " filled that role for us .
They know nothing !
They are repulsive !
Nobody wanted to stop and ask : why does n't Jade know much ?
Here 's why .
Her mother was a seriously disabled drug addict , so Jade did n't go to school much because she stayed at home to look after her .
From the age of five , she was in charge of doing the cooking and ironing and cleaning .
Jade explained : " As early as I could remember , I 'd spent my whole life trying to protect my mum , frantically hiding the stolen chequebooks she used to have lying around the house when the police barged in on one of their raids ; desperately denying to the teachers at school that she'd hit me for fear of being sent to social services . "
Her father treated her even worse .
He stashed a gun under her cot , and her first memory was of him shooting heroin in her bedroom , his eyes rolling back and his body juddering .
Eventually , after periods in and out of prison , he was found dead from an overdose in the toilet of a Kentucky Fried Chicken .
" He died without a single vein left in his body , " Jade said .
" In the end , he 'd injected every single part of it and all his veins had collapsed , even the ones in his penis . "
Despite this , Jade always worked , in shops , for minimum wage , and stayed away from drugs ( apart from weed ) .
She applied for Big Brother because her mum was sinking into crack addiction , and she could n't think of any other way to avoid witnessing it .
To the end , she was terrified of matches , and could n't bear to have tinfoil in her house , because they reminded her of crack .
And so she appeared in British public life , and we jeered and howled and held her up as a poster - girl for " the underclass " .
Jade soon proved her latent smartness by turning her fourth place on Big Brother into a fortune , launching her own brand of perfume , a beauty salon , and a series of sensitive , rather beautiful autobiographies , all appealing to young women who had never seen people just like themselves on television before .
The perception of her slowly changed .
As people learned about her life story – and saw her chaotic , broken mother being interviewed – many realised that their gleeful poring over her mispronunciations had been vile .
The sense of superiority was , for a moment , scrambled .
Then came Celebrity Big Brother , and oh , how we rejoiced .
Jade was placed in the house with Shilpa Shetty , a sweet , unworldly Bollywood star who had been raised with servants and never had to do anything practical for herself .
She activated all of Jade 's feelings of being sneered at and patronised all her life .
Jade said : " Ultimately , we were fighting because we were from different classes ...
I did n't want anyone to think they 're better than me , just because they have more money or have had a more educated upbringing .
And , to me , she was a posh , up - herself princess . "
One day , Shilpa tried to flush an entire cooked chicken down the toilet .
Jade , enraged and perplexed , started to scream at her .
" Who the fuck are you ?
You are n't some Princess in Neverland ! " she yelled .
She said Shilpa clearly had no idea how ordinary Indians lived , and howled : " You need a day in the slums ! "
This was seized on as racist , equivalent to telling her to go back where she came from .
But it was n't .
Other housemates did say despicable , racist things about Shilpa : the beauty queen Danielle Lloyd said " I think she should fuck off home ...
She can't even speak English properly . "
But Jade did n't ; her own father was mixed - race , for one .
But here was a way we could rehabilitate our Jaded view of the white working class , and feel self - righteous about it too .
If we can't feel superior to the poor because they are stupid , then we can feel superior to them because they are racist .
One newspaper ran the typical headline " Class vs Trash " over a picture of Shilpa and Jade , and a columnist huffed that Jade 's problem was " hating her social superiors " .
Once more , we could hate the poor and feel good about it too .
And even when she was dying , we continued to jeer .
Nobody said John Diamond was " exploiting " his cancer by writing about it in The Times , but Jade 's decision to talk about it on TV so she could leave a pot of cash for her kids was apparently evidence of her " vulgarity " .
One newspaper huffs that now we will be subjected to " a chav state funeral " .
Even as she rots , we still want to see Jade Goody as a " chav " imbecile , subconsciously reassuring us that our own higher place in the class pyramid is earned by our intellect and sensitivity and anti-racism , rather than by the fluke of birth .
Believe that if you want , but you should know it 's not Jade you are condemning , but yourself .

Released Guantanamo Detainee What Did Tony Blair Know ?
Binyam Mohamed has been released from Guantanamo and arrived back in London on Monday .
The case of the Ethiopian man 's ordeal may still unveil evidence about how much the British government knew about the rendition and torture of terror suspects .
Saving is the foundation of capital accumulation , which in turn is the foundation of increasing production , employment , and credit .
Saving is the act of abstaining from consuming funds that have been earned in the sale of goods or services .
Saving does not mean not spending .
It does not mean hoarding .
It means not spending for purposes of consumption .
Abstaining from spending for consumption makes possible equivalent spending for production .
Whoever saves is in a position to that extent to buy capital goods and pay wages to workers , to lend funds for the purchase of expensive consumers ’ goods , or to lend funds to others who will use them for any of these purposes .
It is necessary to stress these facts because of the prevailing state of utter ignorance on the subject .
Such ignorance is typified by a casual statement made in a recent New York Times news article .
The statement was offered in the conviction that its truth was so well established as to be non-controversial .
It claimed that “ A dollar saved does not circulate through the economy and higher savings rates translate into fewer sales and lower revenue for struggling businesses . ”
( Jack Healy , “ Consumers Are Saving More and Spending Less , ” February 3 , 2009 , p. B3 . )
The writer of the article apparently believes that houses and other expensive consumers ’ goods are purchased out of the earnings of a single week or month , which is the normal range of time between paychecks .
If that were the case , no savings would be necessary in order to purchase them .
In fact , of course , the purchase of a house typically requires a sum equal to the purchaser ’s entire income of three years or more ; that of an automobile , the income of several months ; and that of countless other goods , too large a fraction of the income of just one pay period to be affordable out of such limited funds .
In all such cases , a process of saving is essential for the purchase of consumers ’ goods .
The savings accumulated may be those of the purchaser himself , or they may be borrowed , or be partly the purchaser ’s own and partly borrowed .
But , in every case , savings are essential for the purchase of expensive consumers ’ goods .
The Times reporter , and all of his colleagues , and the professors who supposedly educated him and his colleagues , all of whom spout such nonsense about saving , also do not know other , even more important facts abut saving .
They do not know that saving is the precondition of retailers being able to buy goods from wholesalers , of wholesalers being able to buy goods from manufacturers , of manufacturers , and all other producers , being able to buy goods from their suppliers , and so on and on .
It is also the precondition of sellers at any and all stages being able to pay wages .
Such expenditures must generally be made and paid for prior to the purchaser ’s receipt of money from the sale of his own goods that will ultimately result .
For example , automobile and steel companies cannot pay their workers and suppliers out of the receipts from the sale of the automobiles that will eventually come in as the result of using the labor and capital goods purchased .
And even in the cases in which the payments to suppliers are made out of receipts from the sale of the resulting goods , the seller must abstain from consuming those funds , i.e. , he must save them and use them to pay for the capital goods and labor he previously purchased .
In contrast , the Keynesian reporters and professors believe that sellers do nothing but consume or hoard cash .
They are too dull to realize that if that were really the case , there would be no demand for anything but consumers ’ goods .
This becomes clear simply by following the pattern of the Keynesian textbooks in allegedly describing the process of spending .
Thus a consumer buys , say , $ 100 dollars worth of shirts in a department store ; the owner of the department store , following his Keynesian “ marginal propensity to consume ” of .75 , then buys $ 75 worth of food in a restaurant , and allegedly hoards the other $ 25 of his income ; the owner of the restaurant then buys $ 56.25 ( .75 x $ 75 ) worth of books , while allegedly hoarding the remaining $ 18.75 of his income ; and so on and on .
Now , unknown to the Keynesians , if such a sequence of spending actually took place , all that would exist is a sum of consumption expenditures and nothing else .
The fact is that most spending in the economic system rests on a foundation of saving .
The seller of the shirts will likely save and productively expend $ 95 or more in buying replacement shirts and in paying his employees and making other purchases necessary for the conduct of his business , and perhaps only $ 5 on consumption .
And so it will be for those who sell to him , or to the suppliers of his suppliers , or to the suppliers of those suppliers , and so on .
Any business income statement can provide a simple confirmation of such facts .
The ratio of costs to sales revenues that can be derived from it , is an indicator of the ratio of the use of savings to make expenditures for labor and capital goods relative to sales revenues .
For the costs it shows are a reflection of expenditures for labor and capital goods made in the past .
The saving and productive expenditure out of current sales revenues will show up as costs in the future .
The higher is the ratio of costs to sales , the higher is the degree of saving and productive expenditure relative to sales revenues .
A firm with costs of $ 95 and sales revenues of $ 100 is a firm that can be understood as saving and productively expending $ 95 out of its $ 100 of sales revenues .
This relationship applies throughout the economic system .

SEATTLE , Washington ( CNN ) -- Reporters , editors and photographers at the Seattle Post - Intelligencer prepared their final contributions to the paper , toasted one another with shots of Wild Turkey and packed up their desks in an " eerily clean " newsroom as the final edition of the paper went to the presses Monday night .
SeattlePI.com will continue to cover breaking news , Managing Editor Dave McCumber says .
The paper -- which was the oldest continually operating business in Seattle -- published its final print edition Tuesday as the P - I makes a transformation into an online - only news outlet .
A skeleton crew of 20 to 25 staffers will remain at the new Seattle PI.com while more than 140 staffers will lose their jobs .
" Its been an opportunity to experience your community first - hand , " staff photographer Meryl Schenker said of her 13 years with the paper .
" You meet people from all walks of life , and that 's been a real privilege . "
P - I journalists coming into the newsroom Monday morning were told by management that they would " put the paper to bed for the last time " that day .
Other reporters and photographers on assignment when the news broke received texts about it from their colleagues .
The P - I is the largest paper to go under in an economic climate where newspapers are facing a steep drop in advertising revenues and readership .
At the same time , newspapers are also forced to compete with Web sites that republish news stories but do not share the costs of producing them .
Last month , the Rocky Mountain News in Denver , Colorado , published its final edition after nearly 150 years .
Last October , the Christian Science Monitor also announced that in 2009 , it would replace its daily print edition with its Web site .
It also offers subscribers weekly print and daily e-mail editions .
P - I Publisher Roger Ogelsby said there was no way for the paper to survive in the current environment .
See the final front page
" It was a combination of time and really rotten economic conditions that caught up with us , " Ogelsby said .
The announcement came a little more than two months after Hearst Corp .
which owns the paper , announced that it would either sell the P - I or close it .
For months , the paper 's staff prayed a buyer would come through while covering the city and the drama surrounding their own future .
" There 's some relief in knowing , " Managing Editor David McCumber said .
" And some excitement about Seattle PI.com .
We 'll be the first paper to go online only .
So I am glad the globe will keep spinning on the roof and there will still be a P - I in Seattle even if it will be online only . "
The Web site will solicit contributions from the community , link to other sites and continue to cover breaking news , McCumber said .
iReport.com :
Are you a newspaper person ?
" We want to engage as many people in the community as possible with the Web site .
It 's going to be different , there 's no question , " he said .
P - I staffers who lost their jobs and those who remained said that in its new form , the P - I will no longer be able to cover Seattle with the same depth and resources it once had .
Watch as staff puts out the final print edition »
" I wrote about the port of Seattle .
Looked at some of the ways the port was mismanaging public dollars , " said investigative reporter Ruth Teichroeb , who lost her job after 11 years with the paper .
" I 've looked at vulnerable adults who were being mistreated in group homes across the state .
I have written about children at a state school for the deaf who were mistreated for decades .
Those are the kinds of stories that the city is losing now . "
The P - I 's rival , the Seattle Times , will still publish a daily newspaper , but that paper also has been plagued with financial difficulties , prompting some Seattleites to worry that they may soon live in a no - newspaper town .
Under a joint operating agreement , the Times and P - I shared production costs while remaining editorially independent .
That competition was good for both papers , P - I columnist Mike Lewis said .
Watch more on the end of the final print edition »
" You lose two things .
You specifically lose all the stories the P - I might be doing , but you also lose a competitive news environment .
It makes us a lot sharper , and it certainly has made them a lot sharper . "
David Lonay , a subscriber since 1950 , told CNN affiliate KIRO he 'll miss the morning ritual of picking up the paper .
" The first thing I do every day is get the P - I and read it , " Lonay said , according to KIRO .
" I really feel like an old friend is dying . "
Sitting in a downtown cafe near the P- I , Jesse Stewart said he does n't read either local paper because of the environmental issues involved with producing newspapers and the convenience factor of reading news online .
" I get to work and pull up my Google news .
I guess I am part of the problem . "

This is a cut and paste of an article on http://queersunited.blogspot.com/2009/03/mormon-machine-working-against-civil.html.
I ’m reproducing it here for a number of reasons .
The first being that blogger .com looks awful ( white text on black background with a Microsoft perversion of the Helvetica font ) , secondly because blogger has been super unreliable in the past few weeks for me — and even getting this story to load took two attempts thanks , in part , to the digg / reddit effect .
The most important reason , however , is that when I originally began researching the impact of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , for my book , and their involvement in unlawfully influencing the outcome of Proposition 8 , I could hardly believe how blatant they were being about their prejudice — not to mention showing a complete disregard for the law .
This latest evidence would seem to suggest certain wards have been even further emboldened by having essentially got away with their actions in that campaign and are now seeking to influence the The Civil Union Bill ( HB 2234 ) .
I ’d also like to add , that since becoming involved with this on - going story , several of the contributors to the comments thread on various postings here , have continued to debate with me via email .
Almost all of them have shared their great embarrassment at the amounts donated to Yes on 8 by their individual churches and wards and wish that the whole thing had never been allowed to happen .
To these people I simply say that this is your chance to speak up .
Do n’t be afraid to do the right thing .
You know that this has nothing to do with the central tenets of your faith .
The fact that I do n’t happen to agree with any of the things you believe does n’t change the fact that this is wrong .
If LDS wants to transform itself into political lobby group that ’s fine , but hiding these extremely intolerant views behind religion ; views which were they being expressed by an Islamic group everyone would be rightfully angry about , should be and I believe one day will be , a very serious criminal offence .
From queersunited.blogspot.com , Wednesday , March 4 , 2009 :
[ digg- reddit - me ] 1 .
What is a lie ?
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church :
“ A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of deceiving . ”
The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil : “ You are of your father the devil , . . . there is no truth in him .
When he lies , he speaks according to his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of lies . ”
Lying is the most direct offense against the truth .
To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error .
By injuring man ’s relation to truth and to his neighbor , a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord .
The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms , the circumstances , the intentions of the one who lies , and the harm suffered by its victims .
If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial sin , it becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity .
2 . The Pope said that condoms “ aggravate ” the problem of AIDS .
Pope Benedict XVI in Africa today stated that the AIDS crisis is :
a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone , that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems .
3. To “ aggravate ” means to “ worsen ” or “ make worse . ”
4. Condoms are extremely effective in preventing the transmission of HIV / AIDS .
The Center for Disease Control :
Latex condoms , when used consistently and correctly , are highly effective in preventing heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS .
Research on the effectiveness of latex condoms in preventing heterosexual transmission is both comprehensive and conclusive .
The CDC report continued :
even with repeated sexual contact , 98 - 100 % of those people who used latex condoms correctly and consistently did not become infected .
5. Jesus said , “ I am the way , the truth , and the life .
No one comes to the Father except through me . ”
Conclusion : The Pope is lying – and rejecting truth .
Or he is willfully refusing to believe the facts – which is a form of lying .
Given the measures of the gravity of a lie from the Catechism , this must be considered a very grave lie .
People will surely get AIDS because of this statement .
I am sure for many this is no revelation – as they believe the Catholic Church is fundamentally corrupt .
The Pope ’s statement here is not much further than previous statements which emphasized that condoms are no 100 % effective in preventing AIDS .
But the brazenness and the irresponsibility of this statement is truly breathtaking .
People will die because they trusted the Pope – who is lying to them for all the world to see .
As a Catholic … I do n’t know how to react .
But the conclusion – that the Pope is lying cannot really be disputed .
That his lie is not the power - protecting lie that we are used to from the Vatican – but one that will cause deaths – makes it all the worse .
It ’s hard to see anything at the moment short of the fact that a rigid ideology can warp a mind – so that clear falsehoods must be declared true in order to maintain the edifice of belief – no matter the cost .
This is more than a moral failure .
It is a crime .
It is a grave sin .
How does the Catholic Church respond to this ?
At what point must the Pope acknowledge the sense of the faithful that birth control is not a sin ?
How can there be accountability in a monarchic system such as the Church ?

Powerful new tools like the ones used to make Monsters vs .
Aliens give filmmakers unprecedented power to manipulate imagery and create immersive cinematic experiences .
Images courtesy DreamWorks Animation
High - end filmmakers are n't just making movies these days .
They 're building virtual worlds before shooting a single frame of film , using digital tools that blur the lines between animation and live - action , virtual sets and physical soundstage , photorealistic cartoon characters and motion - captured human beings .
Over the past few years , digital moviemakers have mastered new technologies and learned to micromanage massive teams in order to bring complex collaborative visions to the screen .
The goal : to create truly immersive movies that knock the socks off even the most jaded moviegoer .
" Every technological advance in filmmaking points directly to something like Star Trek 's holodeck , where you do n't go in and watch the stories — you are actually in the bar or you 're climbing the rock or whatever is there , " said Phil " Captain 3D " McNally , the stereoscopic supervisor , who handled the 3 - D elements in DreamWorks Animation 's Monsters vs. Aliens , which opened Friday .
" That 's lucid dreaming as realized by Star Trek technology .
If you have a choice between watching a movie and going on the holodeck , I guarantee you'd be going on the holodeck . "
As with earlier advances — from silent films to " talkies , " from black - and - white to color and from sound to surround sound — the new technological tools at moviemakers ' disposal are changing not just what audiences see and hear , but the way directors and their crews work .
Movies of the Future
Tintin
Pointing toward a new model for world - building in big - budget features , director Steven Spielberg finished filming actors earlier this month and handed the baton to producer Peter Jackson .
The digital environment for Tintin and its sequel will be constructed over the next 18 months at New Zealand 's renowned WETA Workshop .
A Christmas Carol
Motion - capture pioneer Robert Zemeckis won novelty points with Polar Express and added 3 - D to the mix for Beowulf ( pictured ) .
In November , he steers texture - mapped human actors , led by Jim Carrey , toward a 21st - century spin on the Charles Dickens classic .
Goon
Reputed to be a detail - obsessed control freak , David Fincher pushes technology with each new movie .
Teaming with visual - effects wizards at Blur Studio for Goon , the famously meticulous director will likely spawn a comic book hero unlike anything seen before .
Unlike previous 3 - D cartoons , Monsters vs. Aliens was conceptualized from the get - go as a story designed for depth .
" When I worked on Chicken Little and Disney 's Meet the Robinsons , the movies were created first in 2 - D , then put it through a process of adding depth , which to me is like saying , ' Here 's a painting , now turn it into a sculpture . '
That 's not the same as sculpting , " said McNally .
The teams working on Monsters vs. Aliens authored , designed and filmed every frame in 3 - D , giving the filmmakers extraordinary ability to manipulate the imagery audiences will see .
During a screening of clips from the movie earlier this year , DreamWorks chief Jeffrey Katzenberg said using the new tools was like having the entire production team suddenly begin communicating in Russian .
" It 's a whole new language , " Katzenberg said of the powerful new tools at filmmakers ' disposal .
" It 's going to have to be learned and taught . "
Katzenberg , a major cheerleader for 3 - D moviemaking , showed several clips from Monsters vs. Aliens .
Scenes produced early in the process , as filmmakers were getting their first taste of the new digital tools , used the 3 - D in a more gimmicky way , Katzenberg said .
As the animators grew accustomed to the new way of working , they created scenes that were more subtle and muscular .
Aiming to fool the human eye with seamless tricks of perspective , Monsters was created using a new set of tools and systems that calibrated on - screen depth perception with unprecedented precision .
The advances spell the end of cardboard cutout - type characters , promises McNally , who sees 3 - D storytelling as one more pit stop along the road toward a hyperintensive viewing experience .
" Stereoscopic vision has been an obvious next step for a long time but until now , analog projectors prevented 3 - D from working in anything more than an experimental way , " he said .
" You still have to wear the glasses , but we 're at a point now where the advantages outweigh the disadvantages , and that only became possible because of innovations in digital cinema and the RealD projection system . "
McNally figures the end game for filmmakers is pointing toward the kind of " lucid dreaming " anticipated by Star Trek 's " holodeck " technology and hinted at for decades by videogame makers .
McNally said he thinks the movie - going experience will increasingly resemble gaming environments in years to come .
" I think the future of cinema is probably going to come from people who play 3 - D games and grow up to become filmmakers , " he said .
In fact , the creators of the Resident Evil 5 videogame utilized the same cameras favored by director James Cameron as he shoots his highly anticipated Avatar .
The technology allows the filmmaker to manipulate computer - generated 3 - D environments in and around actors , turning a single session of motion capture work into an endlessly tweakable scene .
For years , Cameron has championed his Titanic follow - up , a futuristic sci- fi epic set for December release , as a Hollywood game - changer that blends 3 - D , motion capture , live action and digitally rendered story elements with unprecedented photorealistic detail .
Rick Carter ( Artificial Intelligence : AI , The Polar Express ) designed the futuristic universe in which Avatar takes place , a process he calls a " huge undertaking . "
" It 's like creating real cities , " he said .
" There 's infrastructure and planning and communication and vision and technical know - how .
I went down to New
Zealand 13 times in 2007 getting both the virtual and physical parts of the set , and then figuring out how to meld them together .
I 've never encountered anything like that before , and from what I 've seen , Cameron delivers a truly grand vision . "
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 's reverse - aging plot is widely cited as an example of how new technology can bring previously unfilmable stories to the screen .
Photo courtesy SonyTo organize such a massive project —
Avatar reportedly will cost about $ 300 million — Cameron and his collaborators stepped outside the traditional production pipeline sequence to take a nonlinear path toward what Carter describes as " the movie - scape . "
" People who do digital effects are being invited earlier into the process to construct how this movie is going to be made , " Carter said .
" Cinematographers who figure where a camera is , how it moves and how it might be lit are now coming up through the computer rather than through a photographic medium .
Instead of looking at a performance now , editors look at the capture of the person and tabulate all of that information while trying to keep the emotion going .
Everything is shifting . "
For Watchmen production designer Alex McDowell , virtual environments now play a critical role in a number of disciplines .
" The big premise of immersive design , whether it 's videogames or architecture or animation or film , is that in each of those areas , world - building is the core idea , " he said .
McDowell is especially bullish about today's " pre-visualization " tools , which give moviemakers an early look at films in progress .
In place of the static sketches , concept art and hand - drawn storyboards that traditionally provided a general sense of a film 's direction before shooting began , 21st century pre-vis tools enable real - time playback of movie sequences in rough draft mode .
" By creating a 3 - D virtual production space , you can work with your fellow filmmakers in a very descriptive , data - rich , virtual representation of the film before you even start making it , " McDowell said .
These virtual environments often become just as important as the story itself .
After he become a " pre-vis " convert while working on David Fincher 's Fight Club , McDowell created the futuristic environment for Minority Report working off a two - paragraph concept summary from Steven Spielberg .
Delving into the futuristic city 's " interior logic , " McDowell came up with the vertical - drop flying taxi that featured prominently in one of the film 's most memorable sequences .
That sort of creative magic will only become more common as digital effects wizards get involved earlier in the moviemaking process .
" For me , " McDowell said , " it 's about creating a machine that both contains and triggers narrative .
At the beginning of a film , these new tools allow us to set up a kind of test - control space where you throw ideas in and test them against the logic of the storytelling . "
Citing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as a case study in technology - enabled storytelling , McDowell said : " We 're all moving towards an arena where it 's going to become less and less important whether you call it ' animation ' or ' live action . '
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was probably 30 percent animated in the end .
Watchmen is maybe 70 percent live action and 30 percent green screen .
Everything is absolutely in flux right now . "
No matter how deep the 21st century filmmaker 's bag of tricks , digital sleight of hand wo n't rescue weak performances or lame dialogue .
Despite elaborate green - screen backdrops painstakingly scanned into existence by hundreds of visual - effects techies , The Spirit flopped .
Real actors performed in real Vancouver soundstages , but production designer Alex McDowell says roughly 30 percent of Watchmen took place against a digitally generated backdrop .

* Some concerns inevitably arise about this new way of making movies .
Carter points out that a new generation of filmmakers who have " spent their entire lives in front of computer screens " might lack the real - world savvy that burnished old - school movies with a certain lived - in luster .
There 's also the matter of over - planning .
" There 's a little bit of a fear that this sort of process takes the spontaneity out of filmmaking , but I think it actually allows more freedom , " said McDowell , co-founder of the 5D Immersive Design Conference slated for October in Long Beach , California .
" We can take a photograph of an actor , cut and paste it into a 3 - D environment , light the environment to match the actor , adjust the colors in both , and do all of that in an hour .
We can say , ' Hey lets see what it looks like if we ramp up the purple in the set and ramp down the purple in the costume , ' then do it in Photoshop with a couple clicks on a mouse .
" The way we make movies now is much closer to the beginning of film , where you just had a very small group of people in a room with maximum creativity .
We creative types can enter into a new partnership with the technologists and say , we know your box can do this thing , so let 's push it .
Let 's get it to do the next level of creativity , rather than simply achieving a technological milestone — the best water or most realistic hair or whatever . "
So what 's it all mean for the movie fan who 's laid out $ 10 or more for a ticket ?
DreamWorks ' McNally predicts an ever - escalating succession of mind - blowing spectacle .
" The way movies are heading is not necessarily toward realism , but toward sensory input , " he said .
" Our base level for what we were trying to achieve 10 years ago is now just like the starting point .
Each time you finish one of these movies , the base line goes up another step . "

There is a new twist in commercial real estate action today .
Lenders are ignoring defaults of $ billions on commercial real estate as if nothing happened , praying that credit conditions will improve .
Please consider General Growth Avoids Chapter 11 .
General Growth Properties Inc. , struggling under a mountain of debt , said Monday that its latest effort to win a reprieve from bondholders had fallen short .
Under normal circumstances a company with as much past - due debt as General Growth would have been forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by now .
Creditors so far have been willing to let deadlines pass because they believe there is little to be gained and much to be lost through a bankruptcy .
" This is really rare , " said Kevin Starke , an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC , a research company that tracks distressed securities .
" It is corporate - bond limbo like I 've never seen before . "
Many creditors say that General Growth 's management is doing a good job running the company .
Its 200 U.S. malls , a portfolio second in size only to Simon Property Group Inc. , generate enough cash to cover interest on the debt .
But its properties are overleveraged and it lacks the borrowing capacity to retire those debts as their principal comes due .
" There 's no question that General Growth is a liquidity issue , " said Jeff Spector , an analyst with UBS AG .
" The properties , for the most part , are n't broken . "
My Comment
Jeff Spector , UBS AG analyst is dead wrong .
This is not a liquidity issue .
This is solvency issue .
The properties are indeed broken .
They are broken by debt .
General Growth , based in Chicago , is n't the only real - estate borrower that is getting a reprieve from its lenders these days .
Hundreds of property owners have had loans come due without a repayment made in recent months .
But most lenders have agreed to extend loan terms , hoping that the credit market will improve .
Australian shopping - center owner Centro Properties Group , which owns 650 U.S. open - air shopping centers , last year sought one short - term extension after another .
Finally , in December , after nine extensions , it averted a liquidation by agreeing to eventually grant its lenders 90 % of its stock in exchange for two and three - year payment extensions on $ 7 billion of debt .
My Comment
To be sure , General Growth may still be forced to seek bankruptcy protection soon .
Trying to dig out from under $ 27 billion in debt , the company until this month has had the relative luxury of negotiating primarily with dozens of banks on more than $ 4 billion of past - due debt and debt that could become due because of other defaults .
General Growth became even more vulnerable after a March 16 deadline passed for repaying $ 395 million in bonds .
Now , rather than dealing only with several dozen banks holding past - due debt , General Growth must negotiate with hundreds of bondholders .
Some holders bought the bonds at face value and are hoping for a recovery .
Others bought the bonds at depressed prices and might want to force a liquidation to receive a quicker payout .
My Comment
On Monday , General Growth said that it concluded efforts to get holders of $ 2.25 billion of bonds to grant it a nine - month reprieve from paying principal and interest on those bonds .
It had three times extended the deadline on its so - called " consent solicitation " because not enough bond holders signed up .
In exchange , General Growth offered the bondholders quarterly payments of 62.5 cents for every $ 1,000 of bonds , with interest accruing .
But that offer was n't accepted because many bondholders were unwilling to forfeit their ability to demand immediate payment for nine months , these people said .
The result is an unusual situation in which borrowers have allowed the due date for corporate bonds to pass without the issuer either paying them or filing for bankruptcy protection .
Often when a company defaults on corporate bonds , bondholders will force an involuntary bankruptcy petition .
A person familiar with the bondholder talks said that , while some creditors are angry , none appears ready to insist on an involuntary bankruptcy petition yet .
It is possible that bondholders did n't go along with the consent solicitation primarily because they feared that making such a pledge would reduce the value of their bonds .
Credit Market Hope Is Moot
There is more debt on those properties than can possibly be paid back .
No one will possibly buy them for the amount owed .
And every day that passes the value of those commercial properties sinks .
Bondholders are only delaying the inevitable . :
Boom , just like that , Centro lost 90 % just to get a debt extension of 3 years . :
Any bondholder hoping for recovery is delusional .
The lenders are hoping that the credit market will improve .
I have news for them :
It wo n't .
Moreover , even if credit does free up , what is the likelihood that General Growth Properties can meet their debt schedule ?
The value of that property is sinking every day while debt due and interest on the debt due is rising every day .
No lenders will refinance if the debt exceeds the value of the property .
Therefore , bondholder hope for improved credit conditions is moot .
A forced bankruptcy is coming either sooner or later .

General absurdity , non sequiturs and musings rendered in convenient JPEG format .
Everybody keeps wanting to know how we can save the software industry , the newspaper industry , and so on .
Everybody keeps asking how record labels can make money in the Internet age , and how software vendors can make money in the age of open source software .
The simple answer is that they can’t .
This does n’t mean we should try to stop the Internet and open source development communities from spreading and overtaking such industries .
It ’s going to happen .
The questions we should be asking are quite different :
How will musicians make money when RIAA labels start failing ?
How will programmers make money when software vendors collapse under the weight of their own business models ?
How does a professional writer make money writing when magazines , newspapers , and even online media publications that use modified traditional business models disintegrate beneath their feet ?
I can always speculate , of course .
There are options like donationware , a return to live performance , service and support , and advertising ( though ad revenue will likely produce less and less revenue over time ) .
That ’s not my point , though .
My point is that I should n’t be one of a very few people considering these questions , speculating about such answers .
My point is that there are a lot of people out there who should be thinking about this kind of thing but , instead , are still trying to figure out how to prevent people from copying what ’s free to copy , distributing what they create without having to go through a “ professional ” social gate , and in general hanging on to already obsolete business models by the skin of their teeth , the deviousness of their lawyers , and the lobbying power of their representatives in the political halls of power .
This is the influence of our mercantilist economy at work , by the way .
Corporate law bends market advantages far more toward large , collective entities than is really natural .
As a result , we end up with bureaucratic , risk averse organizations suffering from an institutionalized , in some sense ethical , requirement for what amounts to sociopathic behavior ( see Corporate Responsibility for more detail ) as the most powerful entities in the economy .
As an organization built around such rules of operation grows in size and dominance , it becomes increasingly wedded to the status quo , because any major changes will perforce be increasingly to the benefit of upstarts that might unseat the current market leaders .
We need to ask different questions , as individuals , in part because we need to learn to undermine the power held by those centralized repositories of economic and political power .
Such power centers in the economy are , almost tautologically , the very fonts of resistance to technological advancement .
The more we can figure out how to make money in new ways , leveraging the changing realities of our economy rather than trying to resist them , the more we can drain away the power held by the larger , more calcified organizations .
Let us compete on our own merits , rather than contributing to the continued dominance of dinosaurs interested only in maintaining control of their dominant market positions as completely as possible .
“ When a 14 year old kid can blow up your business in his spare time , not because he hates you but because he loves you , then you got a problem . “

Looking for something different to spice up your next run through Talisman ?
How about a Final Fantasy - themed game ?
After all , when it comes to swords and sorcery , few characters are more capable of taking down the big baddies than the characters of the Final Fantasy series .
These characters are made according to 2nd edition specs , but thanks to the awesome people at Fantasy Flight Games , you can run these characters in the most recent edition of Talisman on the market .
Just consider each of them as having a total of 4 fate tokens at the beginning of the game .
These character cards are fan - made , which means they are n't official and that I have no affiliation whatsoever with either Final Flight Games ( Makers of Talisman ) or the people who are awesome enough to create and bring us the Final Fantasy Series , but I 've still made them look as awesome as possible with official art straight from the series , so you can enjoy them and even mix them right into your deck if you choose !
24 - hour drinking toll : Doctors show alcohol kills 40,000 Britons a year - five times official figure
As many as 40,000 drinkers are dying every year because the Government has utterly failed to deal with Britain 's alcohol problem , leading experts said yesterday .
Doctors and academics lined up to condemn round - the - clock drinking , brought in by Labour , and the availability of cheap alcohol in supermarkets .
One accused supermarkets of having the ' morality of the crack dealer ' for selling cut - price alcohol .
Others criticised Gordon Brown for appearing to rule out a minimum alcohol price , saying this was the only way to defuse the binge - drinking timebomb .
Timebomb : 24 - hour drinking has been blamed for the sharp rise in alcohol - related deaths , now hitting 40,000 a year
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , told MPs that the number of alcohol - induced deaths was much higher than the official figure of 8,000 .
These are cases where alcohol is directly mentioned on death certificates .
He said up to five times as many deaths are directly caused by drink , including some cancers , high blood pressure leading to stroke and heart attacks , and violence .
Professor Gilmore warned that the number of alcohol deaths is comparable to the numbers dying as a result of obesity .
And although 80,000 die every year through smoking , alcohol death rates are rising sharply and look likely to overtake smoking in coming years as more people quit .
He firmly blamed the Government for the deteriorating situation , saying that Department of Health strategies on reducing harm from alcohol were scuppered because they came at the same time as Home Office 24 - hour drinking laws .
' It was in my view unfortunate that the plan coincided with a change in licensing laws which made it easier for places to stay open longer , and made it more difficult to turn down applications for licences , with no need to take public health into account , ' he told the all - party Commons health select committee .
' In that respect I think Government strategy has not worked . '
Counting the cost : Professor Gilmore said a minimum 50 p per unit cost for drinking would not affect someone enjoying a pint , but could reduce a heavy drinker 's input
He blamed cut - price supermarket deals for the surge in binge drinking , sparking a trend for young people to drink cheap alcohol at home before heading to bars and pubs .
Addiction : Researchers say the availability of cheap alcohol is leading to habit - forming drinking at home
He backed last month 's call by chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson for a minimum price of 50 p per unit of alcohol , and criticised Gordon Brown for rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would penalise the vast majority of sensible drinkers .
Professor Gilmore said the ' overwhelming ' evidence was that a minimum price would affect only heavy drinkers .
While it could cause the price of a bottle of cheap cider to rise five - fold , it would not affect the price of a pint in a pub .
He added : ' I think the biggest change in drinking habits in this country is buying from supermarkets at heavily discounted prices and drinking relatively quietly at home and developing either dependency or physical problems .
' It 's never been cheaper in real terms than it currently is and it's never been more available . '
Another witness , Martin Plant , professor of addiction studies at the University of the West of England , said : ' Supermarkets at the moment are displaying the morality of the crack dealer .
They have been told for several years that what they are doing is completely irresponsible .
Cheap alcohol kills people .'
He also condemned pubs for specifically targeting young women .
He said : ' These days if you look at any group of town centre pubs , all the advertising is aimed at young women and there are discriminatory offers such as " women can drink free tonight " .
' The degree of unrestrained and quite irresponsible marketing that we 've seen in the UK is possibly the worst in Europe . '
Professor Plant warned that alcohol was a ' gateway drug ' leading to cannabis and cocaine addiction in many teenagers .
Dr Peter Anderson , a public health consultant , said ministers had been too lenient with the drinks industry .
' Over the last ten to 12 years , Government - policy has led to an increase in the consumption of alcohol , particularly by letting alcohol become more affordable , ' he said .
However Richard Dodd from the British Retail Consortium , which represents supermarkets , said : ' There 's no relation between price and irresponsible consumption .
' All you will do by changing the law is penalise the vast majority of people who buy alcohol as part of their regular weekly shop and consume it perfectly responsibly .
' A minimum price will do nothing about irresponsible consumption , which is to do with culture and education . '
At present , 2.9 million people in the UK are classed as dependent on alcohol .
A spokesman for the Department of Health said : ' Alcohol is one of the most challenging public health issues we face .
We are working harder than ever to reduce alcohol - related hospital admissions , and to help those who regularly drink too much or are dependent on alcohol . '

York police will soon begin field testing this " pistol cam " that mounts to the barrel of a service revolver pistol .
Cameras that mount on guns are not new , but this particular model will be deployed for tests over the next few months within the Orange County 's sheriff 's emergency service team and the Newburgh Police Department .
According to WREX - TV , the president of the city of Newburgh 's police union doubts that the officers will be happy about the new system .
I fear looking at YouTube once the street finds its own use for these things .

( CNN ) --
A record number of Americans served time in corrections systems across the country in 2007 , according to a report released Monday by the Pew Center on the States .
Some of the nation 's most high - profile federal inmates are housed at the Supermax prison in Colorado .
The U.S. correctional population -- those in jail , prison , on probation or on parole -- totaled 7.3 million , or 1 in every 31 adults .
The Pew Center on the States compiled the information from Justice Department and Census Bureau statistics .
America 's prison population has skyrocketed over the past quarter century .
In 1982 , 1 in 77 adults were in the correctional system in one form or another , totaling 2.2 million people .
The United States has 5 percent of the world 's population , but 25 percent of the world 's prison inmates , the center said .
The numbers vary widely by race and gender .
" Black adults are four times as likely as whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely as Hispanics to be under correctional control .
One in 11 black adults -- 9.2 percent -- was under correctional supervision at year - end 2007 , " the report said .
" And although the number of female offenders continues to grow , men of all races are under correctional control at a rate five times that of women . "
Do n't Miss States reconsider death penalty
There are also wide differences depending on the state .
Georgia tops the nation , with 1 in 13 adults in the state 's corrections system , while in New Hampshire the figure is 1 in 88 .
Southern states tended to have higher rates , with Plains and rural Northeastern states coming in lower .
" State policy choices are responsible for creating this mess and state policy choices can get us out , " said Adam Gelb , director of the Public Safety Performance Project for the Pew Center on the States .
" There are two things , and two things only that determine the size and cost of the prison system . "
Dealing out longer sentences and putting more people behind bars have been the hallmarks of Southern states , he said .
America 's record prison population has had a huge budgetary effect , according to the report , with increased corrections spending outstripping everything at the state level except for Medicaid .
Gelb said prison costs 22 times more than community - based corrections .
" If you talk to judges and prosecutors practically anywhere in this country , they will tell you if they had stronger community corrections , they would n't have to send so many people [ to prison ] for so many low - level offenses , " he said .
For California , it has meant overcrowded prisons .
In February , federal judges tentatively ruled that California must reduce the number of inmates in its prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners ' rights .
Implementing the court 's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released , said Matthew Cate , California 's corrections and rehabilitation secretary , describing it as a threat to public safety .
The Pew Center on the States , through its Public Safety Performance Project , says it promotes " fiscally sound , data - driven policies and practices in sentencing and corrections that protect public safety , hold offenders accountable , and control corrections costs . "
All About Prisons • Crime • Parole
A couple of weeks ago , my colleague Matt Richtel — a handsome devil if ever there was one — spoke truth to power .
He said the thing that no one was saying , yet needed to be said .
Here it is in a nutshell :
For all its abilities and powers , the iPhone is a tremendous pocket computer , but a lousy phone .
And he ’s absolutely right .
I ’ve owned an iPhone 3G since Christmas , and I could add my voice to the growing angry chorus .
See , before I was with Apple and AT&T , I was a Verizon customer for years .
And I do n’t know what it ’s like where you live , but here in 212/718 , you ca n’t swing a cat and not hit a big , strapping band of CDMA frequency .
Verizon has New York in a wireless headlock .
Switching to an iPhone , I immediately noticed the difference .
My office ?
Do n’t even — I get nothing there .
At home ?
Better , but not quite the same .
And dead spots all over the place .
At any time , I can ( and do ) lose a call .
But then I realized something .
AT&T and Apple have given me a gift .
The promise of ubiquitous communication has also been its peril .
With the iPhone , I have something that can cut out , that can drop a call , that can miss a voicemail .
This is like gold in my hand :
My ability to duck , shirk and hide has been restored .
“ What ’s that ?
You called me three times already ?
Sorry , man — got an iPhone . ”
( That sound you just heard ?
That ’s the sound of freedom , baby .
Glorious , dissembling freedom . )
Not to be left out of some cheap populism , Bob Owens takes to the pages of Pajamas Media with this exclusive titled “ Contributions to Obama Campaign Track Bailout Money “ :
Barack Obama ’s lack of leadership in a down economy has now hit crisis proportions , as his claimed inability to block millions of dollars in bonuses for executives of bailout recipient AIG has caused even his supporters to turn on him .
But while the ire of Congress and the media focus are on the $ 165 million that AIG paid out in bonuses to their executives , the president is hoping you wo n’t notice the $ 100 billion in taxpayer bailout dollars that AIG paid out to other banks , including $ 58 billion to foreign banks and $ 36 billion given to French and German banks alone .
The Obama administration is allowing AIG to bail out the rest of the world with your tax dollars .
Putting aside the silly notion that it is Obama ’s lack of leadership that has caused this crisis , Owens then goes on to build the case that Obama is just shoveling money to these companies because of campaign contributions from those corporations .
He then links to Open Secrets , which has the following in BLARING RED LETTERS :
This table lists the top donors to this candidate in the 2008 election cycle .
The organizations themselves did not donate , rather the money came from the organization ’s PAC , its individual members or employees or owners , and those individuals ’ immediate families .
Organization totals include subsidiaries and affiliates .
Next , our dimwitted friend apparently did n’t even read the Businessweek piece he linked to , because if he had , he would have seen the .pdf file that they used as the basis for their report .
I ca n’t blame Owens for not reading it , as it was a massive document .
It was six pages , two of which were graphs and charts .
“ Hidden ” in page one of the document is the following :
Using funds from the emergency loan , financial counterparties listed on Attachment A ( all attachments are posted online at http://www.aig.com/Related-Resources_385_136430.html ) received a total of $ 22.4 billion in collateral relating to CDS transactions from AIGFP between September 16 , 2008 and December 31 , 2008 .
This amount represents funds provided to such counterparties after the date on which AIG began receiving government assistance .
The counterparties received additional collateral from AIG prior to September 16 , 2008 .
On November 10 , 2008 , AIG and the FRBNY established Maiden Lane III , a financing entity , to purchase the securities underlying certain CDS contracts from the counterparties to such contracts , allowing the cancellation of the contracts .
Attachment B lists payments made by Maiden Lane III to such counterparties .
Municipalities in the states listed on Attachment C received a total of $ 12.1 billion from AIGFP between September 16 , 2008 and December 31 , 2008 in satisfaction of Guaranteed Investment Agreement ( GIA ) obligations .
GIAs are structured investments with a guaranteed rate of return .
Municipalities typically use GIAs to invest the proceeds from bond issuances until the funds are needed .
Public aid was also used to satisfy obligations to financial counterparties related to AIG ’s securities lending operations .
Securities lending counterparties listed on Attachment D received $ 43.7 billion from September 18 , 2008 to December 31 , 2008 .
The time period of September 18 , 2008 to December 31 , 2008 was mentioned not once , not twice , but three times on the VERY FIRST PAGE OF THE DOCUMENT .
Apparently concerned that some folks might miss those dates , they included them in large bold letters at the top of their charts and graphs , as well :
Now , if you read Bob Owens during the campaign , you would have thought that Obama ’s first priorities as President would have been to institute Sharia law , unionize ACORN and pay them 100 dollars an hour to go door to door taking away shotguns from white people , and then burn down every small business and build a mosque in its place .
But , the times have changed , and now Owens informs us that President Obama is looting the treasury to send your tax dollars to companies that were by law forbidden from contributing to his campaign but he is sending them the money anyway , and even better , Obama managed to do it while Bush was President .

Two years ago , I briefly dated a girl still in college .
She seemed normal , except that she liked to take pictures of the two of us together , right after having sex * .
I thought that was odd , but it turns out she was pretty tame by today 's standards .
Some of us use camera phones to take pictures at a party .
Others use them to snap quick photos of a favorite band .
If you 're part of the current generation of high schoolers , you 're probably using them to take pictures of your first blowjob .
With a fancier phone , you can shoot a video for the TV !
Hippies had their " free love , " and now technology is turning a new generation of young narcissists into mega - sluts .
A recent survey shows that about 1/3 of teens have posted private , nude and / or explicit photos online .
In other words , the Vanessa Hudgens thing is actually part of a fad .
Damn it , why can't I be going to high school now ?!
We had fucking Tamagotchis and these kids now get jailbait boobies .
What we have is a generation of amateur porn producers .
Except while pornographers do it for money , our younger , YouTube ranter siblings do it because they do n't know how not to share .
Why would n't they put pictures of themselves getting anal ( still a virgin ! ) on Facebook ?
They put their thoughts , phone numbers and social security information there , so why not themselves humping ?
Apparently , when you 're young , you 're too stupid to consider the consequences of having a video where you explore your vagina pop-up on RedTube .
For us , a lot of our dumb high school mistakes are buried in the past .
For them , videos of themselves attempting to lez - out can be seen by relatives and potential employers for as long as there 's an internet .
If I ever have children ( especially daughters ) , the golden rule is going to be " Never EVER have your photo taken when you 're naked .
Your boyfriend WILL put it on the internet . "
And besides , I do n't want to accidently stumble upon that shit while rubbing one out .
So continue your camera phone antics , high schoolers ( not you , future children ) .
The internet thanks you for all the free porn .
Be comforted knowing that we 're all laughing / masturbating at / to you .
You 're welcome .
Creative Commons ( CC ) resources are all around us , and continue to multiply by the day .
You can find tons of CC texts , web pages , graphics , pictures , audio and video clips through the advanced search functions of Flickr or Google .
Barack Obama 's change.gov website uses CC , showing that even the president of the USA knows what we 're talking about here .
That 's cool , but for those of us who need enlightening , what is the Creative Commons ?
Originally , the word ' commons ' indicated those elements of the environment , like land , seas , rivers and air , that people owned , used and enjoyed together .
Today there are also cultural commons including art and historical landmarks , service - related commons ( public health , education or management of drinkable water ) and scientific commons , like the knowledge collated by the Human Genome Project .
A more detailed definition can be found at the Commons Institute .
The Creative Commons is an international movement started by Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig to deal with all those creative works protected by copyright law , including text , audio , pictures and video of any subject , in any format .
CC encourages authors to put their works into a commons , where they and everybody else can use , copy , remix and redistribute everything , thanks to copyright terms that are much more permissive than those loved by big the entertainment corporations .
To make this possible , Creative Commons provides several licences that authors can use to express how other people are allowed copy or redistribute those works , use them for derivative works , and make money from them without asking permission or paying royalties to the author .
A tour in CC land
There are a couple of things you need to have clear about CC .
The first is that the rights granted through CC licencing can only be in addition to those already present in copyright law , like fair use or fair dealing .
The second is that you can apply CC licences only to your own , original work ; in other words , you can't legally incorporate somebody else 's copyrighted work into your own because you want to distribute the result under a CC licence .
Is Creative Commons here to stay , or is it just another passing fad invented by internet hippies ?
Is it , like the world wide web in its beginnings , still restricted to the English - speaking world ?
Are people outside the anglosphere using CC , and if so , how ?
Creative Commons : the case in favour
At first glance , the CC ecosystem is alive and flourishing .
The official showcase for the project is at http://creativecommons.org/commoners, but there is already more CC content than you can shake a stick at at portals such as DeviantArt , YouTube , Instructables.com and the online bookstore Lulu .
Mediacow is an internet video community that makes it easy for social activists to produce and share their own news reports and documentaries under CC licences .
In a similar vein , Daniel Yucra , free software activist and coordinator of the SomosLibres.org community told us that CC is increasingly popular in Peru , " not only for … teaching documents or artistic works : several newspapers and news websites , like www.surnoticias.com, regularly use CC licensing " .
When it comes to education , there are already many teachers and experts worldwide trying to build a really open system for textbooks and other educational material .
The biggest CC success in this field , at least for content in English , is probably the Connexions portal .
One of its more popular authors is Catherine Schmidt - Jones , whose textbook , Basic Music
Theory , has so far been viewed seven million times .
Another popular portal of the same kind is www.opentextbook.org.
South Africa and California also have their own programmes to bring down the enormous cost of textbooks .
In Italy , the Department for Innovation and Technology of the Ministry of Public Administration has recently launched a website at www.innovascuola.gov.it to explain to teachers and students how to create CC learning material and publish it inside an online open digital library .
The National University of Cordoba , Argentina , has its own OpenCourseWare initiative , which is based on Creative Commons , and the same is true for other Latin America NGOs , like www.gleducar.org.ar or the ' Self ' project of the Via Libre Foundation whose main mission is to spread free software tools and values in schools .
Creative Commons fever has spread to all types of artistic expression and design .
The SomeRightsReserved shop from the UK cooperative KithKin features CC products as diverse as design projects , music and instruction manuals for those wishing to demonstrate outside the Palace of Westminster .
Gianluca Bernardo , singer and guitarist with the Italian band Rein , told us that , in order to only use CC licences , the band cancelled its subscription to the Italian royalty collection agency .
Gianluca is also a member of the Popular Front for Free Music , a group of artists formed about four years ago whose guidelines are cooperation and sharing .
Their main achievement so far is the CC - licensed Liberalarte !
music collection which at time of writing consists of four CDs featuring dozens of musicians .
Also in a musical vein , a great amount of Brazilian contemporary music is simply produced outside the normal studio system .
In the city of Belém , for example , ' tecno - brega ' music parties attract thousands of people every weekend , and live recordings are burned on to CDs after each party as advertising material to promote the next one : in such a context , you do n't really need to bother with CC or any other form of copyright .
CC is , instead , an important part of the Canto Livre movement , created after an idea of Brazilian musician Gilberto Gil , who is also Brazil 's Minister for Culture .
Canto Livre , which is Portuguese for ' free ( as in free jazz ) singing ' , is a certified P2P infrastructure that should give all Brazilian music , from tecno - brega to funk , carioca and forrò , a forum for sharing , remixing , collective creation and intellectual generosity .
But not everyone is in favour of Creative Commons ...
Nearly all of those interviewed said they considered their situations temporary and planned to resume their careers where they left off once the economy improves .
But there are people like John Eller , 51 , of Lee ’s Summit , Mo. , who offer a glimpse of how difficult it can be to bounce back .
Mr. Eller had been a senior director at Sprint , earning as much as $ 150,000 a year and overseeing 7,000 employees at 13 call centers , before being laid off in 2002 amid the economic contraction after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
A year later , he found another job , at roughly half the pay , managing a call center in New Jersey .
After he lost that job two years later in a downsizing , Mr. Eller found himself out of work for another year before landing a contract position running two call centers in Kansas and Illinois , earning close to six figures .
But after that ended a year later , he was unable to find work for several months .
In July 2007 , he took what he thought would be a temporary job for $ 10 an hour as a baker in a grocery store .
He was laid off again last October .
Mr. Eller quickly landed a new survival job , working as a supervisor on the overnight shift for a contractor processing immigration applications for the federal government at a salary of about $ 34,000 a year .
But with eight children and a wife to support , Mr. Eller said he was still “ below poverty level . ”
The family has not been able to make mortgage payments in five months and has been on the brink of foreclosure .
“ I ’m still scratching and clawing and trying to work my way back , ” he said .
In Mr. Cooper ’s case , relying on unemployment checks was never a serious consideration .
The maximum benefit that jobless people can collect in Arizona is $ 240 a week , among the lowest in the country — and much less than is required to cover the mortgage on the comfortable four - bedroom home in Glendale that he and his wife , Maggie Macias - Cooper , share .
Mrs. Macias - Cooper , who works as a personal trainer in a gym built in what used to be the couple ’s three - car garage , has seen her client base shrink to 10 from about 50 over the last year .
After reading Organizing Test Suites with Test : : Class , you 're probably and saying " that 's a heck of a lot of work just for testing a class . "
If this were all there is to it , you'd be perfectly justified in forgetting about Test : : Class .
However , Test : : Class really shines when it comes to code re-use .
Consider writing a subclass of Person named Person : : Employee .
I 'll keep it simple by only providing an employee_number method , but you 'll quickly understand the benefits .
package Person :: Employee ; use Moose ; extends ' Person ' ; has employee_number => ( is => 'rw ' , isa => ' Int ' ) ; 1 ;
Here 's its test class :
package Test :: Person :: Employee ; use Test :: Most ; use base ' Test : : Person ' ; sub class {' Person : : Employee '} sub employee_number : Tests ( 3 ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ employee = $ test -> class -> new ; can_ok $ employee , ' employee_number ' ; ok !
defined $ employee->employee_number , '... and employee_number should not start out defined ' ; $ employee->employee_number ( 4 ) ; is $ employee->employee_number , 4 , ' ... but we should be able to set its value ' ; } 1 ;
Notice that instead of inheriting from Test : : Class , the test inherits from Test :: Person , just like Person : : Employee class inherited from Person .
Also , this overrides the class method to ensure that tests know which class they 're using .
Remember to add Test :: Person :: Employee to t/run.t :
#!/usr/bin/env perl - T use lib ' t / tests ' ; use Test :: Person ; use Test :: Person :: Employee ; Test :: Class ->runtests ;
And when we run it t/run.t :
All tests successful .
Files=1 , Tests=31 , 1 wallclock secs ( 0.25 cusr + 0.06 csys = 0.31 CPU )
Whoa !
Wait a minute .
This new test class only had three tests .
The previous run ran with 14 , so how come the report says it ran 31 ?
Test :: Person :: Employee inherited the tests from Test :: Person .
The 14 original tests plus the 14 inherited tests and the 3 added tests add up to 31 tests !
These are n't frivolous tests , either .
Look at the new test 's output :
# Test :: Person:: Employee->constructor ok 16 - Person :: Employee -> can ( ' new ' ) ok 17 - ... and the constructor should succeed ok 18 - ... and the object it returns isa Person :: Employee # # Test :: Person:: Employee->employee_number ok 19 - Person:: Employee->can( 'employee_number ' ) ok 20 - ... and employee_number should not start out defined ok 21 - ... but we should be able to set its value # # Test :: Person :: Employee -> first_name ok 22 - Person :: Employee -> can ( ' first_name ' ) ok 23 - ... and first_name should start out undefined ok 24 - ... and setting its value should succeed # # Test :: Person:: Employee->full_name ok 25 - Person :: Employee ->can( ' full_name ' ) ok 26 - ... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ok 27 - ... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ok 28 - ... and setting its value should succeed # # Test :: Person :: Employee->last_name ok 29 - Person :: Employee -> can( ' last_name ' ) ok 30 - ... and last_name should start out undefined ok 31 - ... and setting its value should succeed
By not explicitly hard - coding the class name in the tests and because Test : : Person :: Employee had overridden the class method , these new tests run against instances of Person : : Employee , not Person .
This demonstrates that subclassing did not break any of the inherited behavior !
However , if you do need to alter the behavior of one of those methods , as you might expect with object - oriented code , all you need to do is override the corresponding test method .
For example , what if employees must have their full names listed in the format " last name , first name " ?
sub full_name { my $ self = shift ; unless ( $ self -> first_name && $ self -> last_name ) { Carp : : croak ( " Both first and last names must be set " ) ; } return $ self -> last_name . ' , ' . $ self -> first_name ; }
The appropriate test method in Test :: Person :: Employee might look like :
sub full_name : Tests ( no_plan ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' full_name ' ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; $ person -> first_name ( ' John ' ) ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; $ person -> last_name ( ' Public ' ) ; is $ person -> full_name , ' Public , John ' , '... and setting its value should succeed ' ; }
Make those changes and all tests will pass .
Test :: Person :: Employee will call its own full_name test method and not that of its parent class .
Refactoring test classes
There 's a lot of duplication in the full_name test which you should factor out into common code .
The well - known ( if poorly - practiced ) aphorism that test code is just code is even more true when Test : : Class .
Well - factored tests are easier to understand , to maintain , and to modify than poorly - factored tests .
Refactoring with methods
One approach to reduce duplication in Test :: Person class might be to create helper methods :
sub full_name : Tests ( no_plan ) my $ test = shift ; $ test->_full_name_validation ; my $ person = $ test ->class -> new ( first_name => ' John ' , last_name => ' Public ' , ) ; is $ person -> full_name , ' John Public ' , ' The name of a person should render correctly ' ; } sub _full_name_validation { my ( $ test , $ person ) = @_ ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' full_name ' ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; $ person -> first_name ( ' John ' ) ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; }
And in Test :: Person :: Employee :
sub full_name : Tests ( no_plan ) my $ test = shift ; $ test->_full_name_validation ; my $ person = $ test ->class -> new ( first_name => ' Mary ' , last_name => ' Jones ' , ) ; is $ person -> full_name , ' Jones , Mary ' , ' The employee name should render correctly ' ; }
Just like with any other OO code , subclasses inherit and can override the _full_name_validation method .
Refactoring with fixtures
When writing test classes , the startup and shutdown methods are very handy , but those run only at the beginning and end of your test class .
Sometimes you need code to run before the beginning and end of every test method .
In the Person examples , many of the test methods contained this line :
my $ person = $ test -> class -> new ;
You really may not want to duplicate that every time , so you can use what 's known as a fixture .
A fixture is " fixed state " for your tests to run against .
These allow you to remove duplicate setup code from your tests and to have a controlled environment .
You might write :
sub setup : Tests ( setup ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ class = $ test -> class ; $ test -> {person} = $ class -> new ; }
If you want to start with a known set of data , you could write :
sub setup : Tests ( setup ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ class = $ test -> class ; $ test -> {person} = $ class -> new ( first_name => ' John ' , last_name => ' Public ' , ) ; }
Now all of your test methods can simply use $ test ->{ person} ( you can even make that a method if you prefer ) to access a new instance of the class you 're testing without having to duplicate that code .
The corresponding teardown method is useful if you need to clean up on a per test basis .
This can be useful if you run tests against a database .
Next time , I 'll discuss how to manage test classes with Test : : Class .

Two policemen who were attacked by a 30 - strong mob were today recovering from their injuries – with one receiving hospital treatment for a bite wound .
The feral attack was launched after the officers asked a teenager to pick up some litter she had dropped .
One of the policemen required hospital treatment after the attack in Northend , Croydon , South London on Wednesday afternoon .
Police said that when patrolling officers asked the girl to pick up a piece of litter she did so – but then immediately dropped it .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
When they asked her to pick it up again , a friend with the girl reacted aggressively .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A group of up to 30 teenagers and adults gathered around the officers and attacked them .
One officer was bitten .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the officers , aged 34 and 29 , were now on sick leave suffering from bruising and knee injuries .
A 15 - year - old girl was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault .
She has been released on police bail .
Two men aged 34 and 38 , both from nearby South Norwood , were arrested yesterday on suspicion of assault and violent disorder .
Shopkeepers in the area told today of their horror at the level of violence used against the officers .
T- Mobile phone store manager Shil Mehta said that just before turning on the police the two girls had been fighting each other .
‘ The attack happened right outside our shop , ’ he said .
‘ I saw two girls fighting .
The officers tried to stop the girls , who were about 15 years old and both were wearing school uniforms , but then they turned on the police .
‘ When one of the policemen tried to restrain one of the girls a crowd started to develop around them .
I think he was trying to put handcuffs on the girl .
‘ There were about 30 people in the crowd at this stage , of all ages .
A couple of men aged in their 30s were screaming at the police to let go of the girls .
‘ I do n’t think they knew the girls , but just saw the police wrestling with them and had a go at the police because they thought they were being heavy - handed .
‘ Then one of these men lunged at the officer holding the girl , from behind .
I think he tried to punch him in the head – he definitely took a swing .
Then the girl tried to run away .
‘ At that point the other policeman got his baton out and pepper spray .
They managed to get hold of the girl again but by this stage the crowd was huge .
I would say about 70 or 80 people were now in the street watching .
‘ One of the policemen pinned the girl on the ground because she was maniacally trying to fight him .
‘ That ’s when the police back - up arrived .
There were three or four riot vans , three police cars and two unmarked cars . ’
Mr Mehta added : ‘ Using batons and pepper spray they managed to disperse the crowd but I have never seen anything like it .

" Some people have said , 'we do n't know if this is by William Shakespeare ' , so I 've been able to study them and say 'yes , here 's the evidence for Shakespeare but here 's also the evidence for Neville , ' so I 've been able to link the two , " Dr Casson said .
Police in Iran have arrested a group of mostly female actors who were making pornographic films , a crime that carries the death penalty under the country 's Islamic laws , local media reported today .
The arrests were made at a house in a middle - class area in the east of Tehran , the pro-reformist website Fararu said .
The website did not specify how many actors had been detained , but said most were " beautiful young women " .
Citing an " informed source " in the intelligence deputy 's office of the Iranian law enforcement agency , it said the actors had produced several amateur films which had then been sold on the black market .
The directors of the films have also been arrested .
While an underground porn market has flourished in Iran in recent years , it is rare for the police to acknowledge it with high profile arrests .
Official crackdowns on " immorality " have on occasion led to raids on rave events – often denounced by the authorities as " satanist " – at which alcohol consumption and sex orgies were alleged to have occurred .
MPs attempted to combat the growth of a local porn industry in 2007 when they passed a bill approving execution for those convicted of producing obscene films .
The legislation states that " producers " and " main elements " of such works could be sentenced as " corrupters of the world " , a phrase from the Qu'ran referring to those considered deserving of the death penalty for their crimes .
The law followed an outcry over the widespread distribution of an illicit DVD showing Zahra Amir Ebrahimi , a well - known Iranian soap opera star , apparently having sex with her former boyfriend .
Ebrahimi later claimed the film was a fake made by her ex-partner as an act of vengeance .
Prosecutors carried out an investigation to find its distributors after more than 100,000 copies were sold on the black market .
Dr Naser Fakouhi , one of Iran 's leading sociologists and the head of anthropology at Tehran University , has warned that the country 's huge number of young people – roughly 70 % of the population are aged under 35 – has caused an explosion in internet pornography and the rapid growth of an underground industry .
The trend has been compounded by a rise in the average marrying age in a society in which premarital sex is outlawed and socially frowned upon .
A recent survey by the state - run national youth organisation revealed that the average marrying age had risen to 40 for men and 35 for women , well above the government 's recommended guideline of 29 .
GOP budget proposal contains no numbers David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Friday March 27 , 2009

At the beginning of this month , the DNC launched a party of no clock that counts the time between the announcement of Obama 's budget and the presentation of a Republican alternative .
It looks like that clock will have to keep ticking until next week .
Thursday 's press conference given by House Republicans was expected to be the unveiling of the GOP budget proposal ; but the document announced by Representative John Boehner ( R - OH ) turned out to be a simple blue - print of conservative values , lacking any real budget numbers .
Republicans and some conservative Democrats have been vocal in their opposition to Obama 's budget proposal , released at the end of last month .
Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa went on record two weeks ago , claiming that the Democrat 's budget was " destroying opportunities for the next generation .
The president and his allies in Congress want to spend too much , tax too much , and borrow too much , " Grassley said .
Obama responded to criticism in a news conference at the beginning of this week , saying ,  I suspect that some of those Republican critics have a short memory , because as I recall , I 'm inheriting a $ 1.3 trillion annual deficit from them . 
He challenged the GOP to draft an alternate budget instead of simply criticizing his version .
Two days later , Boehner held up a blue booklet at a press conference and declared ,  Here it is , Mr. President . 
The Republican Road to Recovery , as the 19 - page document is titled , is a three - part outline of where congressional Republicans stand on Obama 's budget plan .
Curbing government spending , creating jobs and lowering taxes , and controlling the debt are the foundations of the Republican 's argument .
Much of the  Road to Recovery  is specific criticisms of the Democrat budget and policies , like energy and health care reform .
However , it is not a budget .
There is no plan for government spending , nor are there tables illustrating how money will be allocated .
When reporters received copies of the document , they realized that an alternative Republican budget was n't going to be announced , even though the press conference was supposed to be the announcement of that budget .
According to the Huffington Post , reporters began questioning Boehner on specifics .
 Are you going to have any further details on this today ? " one reporter asked .
" On what ? " responded Boehner .
" There 's no detail in here , " the reporter explained .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs was visibly pleased by the lack of detail in the Republican 's budget .
 It 's interesting to have a budget that does n't contain any numbers .
I think the ' Party of No ' has become the party of no new ideas . 

Spitfire found in scrapyard sold for £ 1.78 million
Thirty years ago this Spitfire was little more than a rusting shell in a South African scrapyard .
Yesterday the fighter , airworthy again after years of painstaking work , fetched a record £ 1.78 million at auction .
It was bought by British adventurer Steve Brooks who plans to keep it in this country and keep it flying .
The rare two - seat Spitfire over Truxton Airfield near Andover , Hampshire which was sold by a private seller for £ 1.78 million
' I'm a great believer that things like this were built to be used , not to be museum pieces , ' he said .
' The Spitfire is a terrific flying machine , it 's also British and should stay in Britain . '
Its auction at the RAF Museum , in Hendon , North London - kicked off with the words ' It 's Spitfire time , ladies and gentlemen ' - marks the latest chapter in the fighter 's long history .
It entered service in 1944 and was sold to the South African Air Force in 1948 .
Discovered on a scrap heap in 1979 , it passed through the hands of a number of owners .
Originally a single - seater , it was completed in July last year as a two - seater in Dutch markings - because the Dutch air force flew two - seater Spitfires .
The plane was the first airworthy one of its number to go under auction for 20 years .
Auctioneers Bonhams said it believed its sale price was a world auction record .
Buyer Mr Brooks , a 47 - year - old father - of - two , from West London , has already flown a helicopter from North Pole to South Pole and was the first person to drive across the Baring Straits from America to Russia .
He admitted he may have gone ' slightly over ' his budget in the auction room but said it was worth it .
' I'm a pilot already but I 'm going to learn to fly it . '
The TR MK IX , serial number SM520 , is one of only seven flying Spitfires with two seats .
Steve Brooks stands next to a Spitfire similar to the one that he has just bought at auction for £ 1.78 milliion
Built by the British Vickers - Armstrong company in 1944 , this particular Spitfire arrived in service too late to see action in the Second World War .
While with the South African Air Force it is thought to have had a couple of accidents before being left to scrap .
It was later sold on to British aviation enthusiast , Charles Church , who later died in a Spitfire crash .
Mr Church began the long process of restoration before the aircraft was sold in 1989 to another buyer , who eventually resold it to Paul Portelli , the founder of World 's End Tiles , in June 2002 .
He commissioned the company Classic Aero to restore the aircraft to its former glory .
A dedicated team of experts have poured hours of time into sourcing replacement parts , restoring old ones and rebuilding every inch of the plane - plus a few more in the form of the extra seat .
Peter Tuplin , of Classic Aero engineering , restored the MkIX rare two - seat Spitfire ( and below )
Some parts like the bullet proof windscreen panel and control colum remained , but others such as the four - blade propeller came from as far a field as Germany .
All the parts had to undergo rigorous safety checking and the flying machines had been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority .
The plane itself took shape at Thruxton Aerodrome , in Hampshire , from where it took its first flight .
It has , said the auctioneer , clocked up just 15 hours air time , will need a final check at 20 hours and a full service at 25 hours - the ' equivalent to an MOT ' .
It was completed in July last year and ready for sale this year , seven years after Mr Portelli purchased it — and two years after he too died , of cancer — the job is finished .
The day before the auction the plane flew a poignant mission to release Mr Portelli 's ashes .
The Core of the Teachings The following statement was written by Krishnamurti himself on October 21 , 1980 in which he summarizes the teachings .
It may be copied and used provided this is done in its entirety .
No editing or change of any kind is permitted .
No extracts may be used .
" The core of Krishnamurti's teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said : ' Truth is a pathless land ' .
Man cannot come to it through any organization , through any creed , through any dogma , priest or ritual , not through any philosophic knowledge or psychological technique .
He has to find it through the mirror of relationship , through the understanding of the contents of his own mind , through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection .
Man has built in himself images as a fence of security - religious , political , personal .
These manifest as symbols , ideas , beliefs .
The burden of these images dominates man 's thinking , his relationships and his daily life .
These images are the causes of our problems for they divide man from man .
His perception of life is shaped by the concepts already established in his mind .
The content of his consciousness is his entire existence .
This content is common to all humanity .
The individuality is the name , the form and superficial culture he acquires from tradition and environment .
The uniqueness of man does not lie in the superficial but in complete freedom from the content of his consciousness , which is common to all mankind .
So he is not an individual .
Freedom is not a reaction ; freedom is not a choice .
It is man 's pretence that because he has choice he is free .
Freedom is pure observation without direction , without fear of punishment and reward .
Freedom is without motive ; freedom is not at the end of the evolution of man but lies in the first step of his existence .
In observation one begins to discover the lack of freedom .
Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity .
Thought is time .
Thought is born of experience and knowledge which are inseparable from time and the past .
Time is the psychological enemy of man .
Our action is based on knowledge and therefore time , so man is always a slave to the past .
Thought is ever - limited and so we live in constant conflict and struggle .
There is no psychological evolution .
When man becomes aware of the movement of his own thoughts he will see the division between the thinker and thought , the observer and the observed , the experiencer and the experience .
He will discover that this division is an illusion .
Then only is there pure observation which is insight without any shadow of the past or of time .
This timeless insight brings about a deep radical mutation in the mind .
Total negation is the essence of the positive .
When there is negation of all those things that thought has brought about psychologically , only then is there love , which is compassion and intelligence . "

The First and Last Freedom
by J. Krishnamurti , published by Harper , San Francisco
" There is hope in men ,
not in society , not in systems ,
not in organized religious systems ,
but in you and in me . "
" To understand the misery and confusion that exist within ourselves , and so in the world , we must first find clarity within ourselves , and that clarity comes about through right thinking .
This clarity is not to be organized , for it cannot be exchanged with another .
Oganized group thought is merely repetitive .
Clarity is not the result of verbal assertion , but of intense self - awareness and right thinking .
Right thinking is not the outcome of or mere cultivation of the intellect , nor is it conformity to pattern , however worthy and noble .
Right thinking comes with self - knowledge .
Without understanding yourself , you have no basis for thought ;
without self - knowledge , what you think is not true . "
" Our system of upbringing is based on what to think not on how to think . "
" True liberation is an inner freedom of creative Reality .
This is not a gift ; it is to be discovered and experienced .
It is not an acquisition to be gathered to yourself to glorify yourself .
It is a state of being , as silence , in which there is no becoming , in which there is completeness .
This creativeness may not necessarily seek expression .
You need not be a great artist of have an audience ; if you seek these , you will miss the inward Reality .
It is neither a gift , nor is it the outcome of talent ; it is to be found , this imperishable treasure , where thought frees itself from lust , ill - will and ignorance , where thought frees itself from worldliness and personal craving to be .
It is to be experienced through right thinking and meditation . "
" If you really want to know yourself , you will search out your heart and your mind to know their full content and when there is the intention to know , you will know .
Then you can follow , without condemnation or justification , every movement of thought and every feeling as it arises ; by following every thought and every feeling as it arises you bring about tranquility which is not compelled , not regimented , but which is the outcome of having no problemm , no contradiction .
It is like the pool that becomes peaceful , quiet , any evening when there is no wind ; when the mind is still , then that which is immeasurable comes into being . "
" The beginning of meditation is self - knowledge , which means being aware of every movement of thought and feeling , knowing all the layers of my consciousness , not only the superficial layers but the hidden , the deeply concealed activities .
To know the deeply concealed activities , the hidden motives , responses , thoughts and feelings , there must be tranquillity in the conscious mind ; that is the conscious mind must be still in order to receive the projection of the unconscious . "
" Surely the one thing which can bring about a fundamental change , a creative , psychological release , is everyday watchfulness , being aware from moment to moment of our motives , the conscious as well as the unconscious . "
" There is no path to truth , it must come to you .
Truth can come to you only when your mind and heart are simple , clear , and there is love in your heart ; not if your heart is filled with the things of the mind . "
" To know yourself you need not go to any book , to any priest , to any psychologist .
The whole treasure is within yourself . "

The US has finished constructing a huge physics experiment aimed at recreating conditions at the heart of our Sun .
The US National Ignition Facility is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of nuclear fusion , a process that could offer abundant clean energy .
The lab will kick - start the reaction by focusing 192 giant laser beams on a tiny pellet of hydrogen fuel .
To work , it must show that more energy can be extracted from the process than is required to initiate it .
Professor Mike Dunne , who leads a European venture that is also pursuing nuclear fusion with lasers , told BBC News that if NIF was successful , it would be a " seismic event " .

" It would mark the transition for laser fusion from ' physics ' to ' engineering reality ' , " he said .
The California - based NIF is the largest experimental laser facility in the US and contains the world 's most powerful laser .
It has taken 12 years to build .
" This is a major milestone , " said Dr Ed Moses , director of the facility .
" We are well on our way to achieving what we set out to do - controlled , sustained nuclear fusion and energy gain for the first time ever in a laboratory setting . "
' Building blocks '
Experiments will begin in June 2009 , with the first significant results expected between 2010 and 2012 .
HOW TO MAKE A STAR ON EARTH A pea-sized spherical capsule is filled with fusion fuel
This comprises a 150 - microgram mix of deuterium and tritium
The NIF laser set - up pulses for 20 billionths of a second
For that time , it generates about 500 trillion watts
That 's equivalent to five million million 100 - watt light bulbs
All the laser power is focused on to the capsule 's surface
The fuel is compressed to a density 100 times that of lead
It is heated to more than 100 million degrees Celsius Under these extreme conditions , fusion is initiated " We have an incredible amount to do and an incredible amount to learn , " added Dr Moses .
Fusion is looked on as the " holy grail " of energy sources because of its potential to supply almost limitless clean energy .
But the challenge of creating a practical fusion reactor has eluded scientists for decades .
Now , however , they believe they are nearing their goal .
" We are now very close to the culmination of 50 years ' effort , " explained Professor Dunne .
There are currently several experimental facilities around the world aimed at demonstrating the building blocks of nuclear fusion .
In this process , two heavier forms of hydrogen , known as deuterium and tritium , are fused together to form helium .
Deuterium is commonly found in seawater , whilst tritium can be prepared from lithium , a relatively common element found in soil .
When these isotopes are combined at high temperatures , a small amount of mass is lost and a colossal amount of energy is released .
Energy gain Fusion naturally occurs at the centre of stars where huge gravitational pressure allows the process to happen at temperatures of about 10 million Celsius .
At the much lower pressures on Earth , temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million Celsius .
NIF will focus on a process known as inertially confined fusion , in which these extreme temperatures are achieved using ultra powerful lasers .
" When all NIF lasers are fired at full energy , they will deliver 1.8 megajoules of ultraviolet energy to the target , " explained Dr Moses .
The laser power will be focused on to a tiny pellet inside a small cylinder NIF 's beams are intended to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system .
When fired , the pulse will last just a few nanoseconds ( billionths of a second ) but it will impart 500 trillion watts of power - more than the peak electrical generating power of the entire United States .
This intense energy will be focused on a ball - bearing - sized pellet of fuel , ablating the surface and compressing the remaining material inwards .
" This process will create temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures billions of times greater than Earth 's atmospheric pressure , forcing the hydrogen nuclei to fuse and release many times more energy than the laser energy required to spark the reaction , " said Dr Moses .
This " energy gain " , as it is known , is key .
If it works , NIF will release 10 to 100 times more energy than the amount pumped into the lasers to kick - start the reaction .
Other experiments have shown that ignition is possible , but so far none has been able to demonstrate a net energy gain .
" The world is looking to NIF to provide a clear , unequivocal demonstration that lasers can initiate fusion energy gain , " said Professor Dunne .
" This would lay the fundamental physics question to rest , allowing the community to focus on harnessing this energy . "
Twin track Although NIF is only at the beginning of its experimental life , scientists are already planning its successor , a European project known as Hiper ( High Power Laser Energy Research ) .
" The technology of NIF allows the laser to fire every few hours , " explained Professor Dunne , director of Hiper .
" This is right for the demonstration of the physics ' proof of principle ' , but does not meet the requirement of a laser fusion power plant , which needs to operate a few times per second . "
Hiper aims to lay the foundations of this continuous fusion cycle by showing it can ignite a steady stream of fuel pellets .
Inside one of NIF 's two laser bays " This means a fundamentally different laser technology , a new approach to fuel pellet production , and a suite for robotic handling capability , " said Professor Dunne .
In October 2008 , Hiper received approximately 13 m euros of funding to carry out a feasibility study .
It also has access to European hardware and capability worth a further 50 m euros .
If all goes well , engineers will begin to build the Hiper facility towards the end of the next decade , bringing the vision of a commercial fusion reactor one step closer to reality .
At approximately the same time , scientists will also get their hands on another mammoth fusion experiment , the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( Iter ) , currently being built in Cadarache , France .
Iter will attempt to initiate fusion using a different method , known as magnetic confinement , in which a super - heated volume of gas is constrained by magnetic fields in a doughnut - shaped vessel known as a tokamak .
" We are entering a period when much of the technology development is common to both approaches , " said Professor Dunne .
" We believe that the two - track approach is essential given the scale of the problem , and the predicted impact on society . "

Chemists reported development of what they termed the first economical , eco-friendly process to convert algae oil into biodiesel fuel — a discovery they predict could one day lead to U.S. independence from petroleum as a fuel .
The study was presented recently at the 237th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society .
One of the problems with current methods for producing biodiesel from algae oil is the processing cost , and the New York researchers say their innovative process is at least 40 percent cheaper than that of others now being used .
Supply will not be a problem :
There is a limitless amount of algae growing in oceans , lakes , and rivers , throughout the world .
Another benefit from the " continuously flowing fixed - bed " method to create algae biodiesel , they add , is that there is no wastewater produced to cause pollution .
" This is the first economical way to produce biodiesel from algae oil , " according to lead researcher Ben Wen , Ph.D. , vice president of United Environment and Energy LLC , Horseheads , N.Y .
" It costs much less than conventional processes because you would need a much smaller factory , there are no water disposal costs , and the process is considerably faster . "
A key advantage of this new process , he says , is that it uses a proprietary solid catalyst developed at his company instead of liquid catalysts used by other scientists today .
First , the solid catalyst can be used over and over .
Second , it allows the continuously flowing production of biodiesel , compared to the method using a liquid catalyst .
That process is slower because workers need to take at least a half hour after producing each batch to create more biodiesel .
They need to purify the biodiesel by neutralizing the base catalyst by adding acid .
No such action is needed to treat the solid catalyst , Wen explains .
He estimates algae has an " oil - per - acre production rate 100- 300 times the amount of soybeans , and offers the highest yield feedstock for biodiesel and the most promising source for mass biodiesel production to replace transportation fuel in the United States . "
He says that his firm is now conducting a pilot program for the process with a production capacity of nearly 1 million gallons of algae biodiesel per year .
Depending on the size of the machinery and the plant , he said it is possible that a company could produce up to 50 million gallons of algae biodiesel annually .
Wen also says that the solid catalyst continuous flow method can be adapted to mobile units so that smaller companies would n't have to construct plants and the military could use the process in the field .
The National Science Foundation funded Wen 's research .

A recent scientific expedition in Colombia 's mountainous Darien region has unearthed 10 new species of amphibians , an environmental organization said .
A new species of salamander was one of the exciting discoveries in Colombia 's Darien region .

Scientists with Conservation International on Monday announced the discovery of 10 new species in what 's being referred to as a safe haven for frogs located in the west of the country on the border with Panama .
The discovery of 10 amphibians , which are believed to be new to science , was the result of a three - week survey of the area , the group said .
The new species were discovered as part of a CI program aimed at assessing the ecological health of a given area .
Scientists identified nearly 60 species of amphibians , 20 reptiles and 120 species of birds , the group said in a prepared statement .
The discoveries come as global extinction rates continue to rise .
Experts with Conservation International argue that the discovery is particularly significant since amphibians serve as an accurate gauge of an area 's ecological health .
Amphibians can act as an early warning sign of pollution such as acid rain due to their porous , absorbent skin .
The sensitivity of these species to low level environmental threats can also act as a barometer for human health .
Conservation International says the discovery offered renewed optimism .
" The high number of new amphibian species found is a sign of hope , even with the serious threat of extinction that this animal group faces in many other regions of the country and the world , " says Jose Vicente Rodriguez Mahecha , Scientific Director of CI - Colombia , who was part of the team that discovered the new species .
The region is , however , not immune to modern threats .
According to Conservation International , between 25 percent to 30 percent of the natural vegetation in the Darien area is currently being deforested .
For the scientists , the hope now is that the discoveries will renew efforts to conserve the region and manage its rich biodiversity .
The PlayStation 3's getting its own chance to shine on the Japanese hardware charts after last week 's Xbox success -- thanks to Sega's , it more than doubled its sales and beat the Nintendo DSi ( but not Nintendo DS sales overall ) .
Last week , the Xbox 360 enjoyed a boost in sales from the release of .
This week , PS3 sales more than doubled to 36,513 .
It has Sega 'sto thank for its jump in sales , with the game selling 372,000 units in its first week in the software sales chart PS3's performance eclipsed even the Nintendo DSi - which fell by 6,000 units to 35,827 .
Technically , though , the DS was still the best selling hardware platform of the week , with DS Lite sales of 11,774 making for a combined total of 47,601 units .
Thanks primarily to the release of Koei's , PSP sales also rose this week , up 6,000 units to 35,588 .
Wii sales also increased , but by just less than 1,000 units to 17,876 .
Despite its success last week , the Xbox 360 lost almost all of its previous gains , with sales falling by 13,500 units to 11,795 .
PlayStation 2 sales remained static at 5,099 units .
Looking at the overall software top 50 , the PS3's hardware success can be seen to be due almost entirely to , with only two other titles in the chart .
By comparison the Xbox 360 has a record four games in the top 50 , most placed higher than their PS3 rivals .
Overall in the software top 50 there were 19 titles for the Nintendo DS , 11 for the PSP , seven for the Wii , six for the PlayStation 2 , four for the Xbox 360 and three for the PlayStation 3 .
Now that electrification has begun to take hold , the roles will be reversed from present day hybrids .
Instead of a small electric motor assisting the main gas engine , the gas engine will take a backseat .
This is well illustrated in the Volt where the gas engine simply waits until its services are needed only if the battery gets low , a time that in many cases will rarely if ever happen .
Because of this limited functional requirement , gas engines will become increasingly simpler and smaller .
Eventually all of the advanced technology cooked into today 's combustion engines to make them adequately powerful and efficient will no longer be needed .
For the Chevy Volt according to John Bereisa , director of advanced engineering at GM , “ All we need is 67 horsepower , enough to maintain the batteries ’ charge when the car is cruising at highway speed .
” He explains how the choice for the Volt 's combustion engine was arrived to : “ Since there was n’t time to design an engine from scratch , we looked for the smallest existing engine capable of supplying 67 horsepower , which turned out to be G.M. ’s Family Zero design used in Europe , Asia , Africa and the Middle East .
” He also tells us the Volt 's engine when in use will run in a target range of 2000 to 3000 RPM .
He notes “ When you map an engine ’s power versus r.p.m. versus fuel consumption , the resulting chart looks like the Rocky Mountains .
In conventional cars , you ’re driving all over that map .
But in the Volt , we ’re able to keep the engine operating in what I call its happy valley , where it delivers the power that ’s required while consuming minimal fuel .
” Bereisa hints at what GM is planning for the Generation II Volt engine .
He says “ We ’d select a smaller displacement engine for the future , probably less than 1 liter , ” and “ We ’d position the catalytic converter and route the coolant lines to minimize heat losses . ”
He adds not surprisingly “ the engine for the next Volt will definitely be as simple and as light as possible .
” And so the gas - powered combustion engine shall ride off quietly into the sunset .

International Monetary Fund gives Ireland the thumbs - up
Country does not need financial assistance despite its 10 % deficit , IMF says
Ireland can solve its economic problems without outside financial assistance , the body which oversees global financial stability has predicted .
In a rare piece of good economic news , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) told the Sunday Tribune that , while Ireland was facing difficulties , it was capable of overcoming them without any bailouts .
" We do not envisage IMF financing will be needed to deal with these problems , " said the organisation 's chief spokesman , David Hawley .
Last week 's Anglo IrishBank / Irish Life & Permanent deposit scandal has led to further deterioration in Ireland 's creditworthiness and public sector unions are preparing to test the government 's resolve over plans to implement a public service pension levy .
The two events have raised concerns about the country 's ability to reduce an almost 10 % budget deficit and keep a lid on rampant unemployment .
But Hawley was positive about Ireland 's ability to cope with its problems .
" I would say that Ireland faces a difficult economic situation and will need to take steps to manage the financial sector and fiscal risks , " he said .
However , he added that the IMF was not envisaging any need for Ireland to borrow from his organisation .
The IMF , which has already bailed out Iceland , Ukraine , Belarus and Latvia , is struggling to meet the demands on its own resources from countries struggling from the fallout of the global credit crisis .
Recently it agreed to extend assistance to Hungary .
The question of IMF aid for Ireland arose a month ago when Taoiseach Brian Cowen denied he had mentioned such an idea to the social partners during talks in government buildings .
" I have never said that , " he told reporters in Tokyo during a trade mission .
" We are a member of the euro area and we have the best - performing economy in the last 10 years in the European Union . "
However , the international markets have been spooked by talk of an IMF bailout and Ireland 's credit worthiness remains under severe pressure .
Any failure to implement the public service pension levy would be highly damaging on the international bond markets for Ireland , where interest costs on Irish sovereign debt have been rising fast .
As I noted last night , there is a growing body of evidence that February ’s Stimulus Bill was too small and an increasing likelihood that a second Stimulus Bill will be needed — perhaps sooner than we imagine .
But aside from the math and economics , there ’s a point of media criticism that needs to be made .
While the bill was being debated , the news media — and particularly television — focused almost entirely on the question of whether it was too big .
The possibility that it was too small — which now seems likely — was seldom raised .
As Krugman argues , it ’s a mini-version of the press failure in the lead up to the Iraq War , with depressingly familiar dynamics .
I think the administration deserves a small amount of the blame for this for not starting the debate with a much more aggressive and expansive bill , kicking off the game with the goalposts more advantageously placed , as it were .
But fundamentally it goes back to that issue of DC and the national political media remaining wired for the GOP .
And with real consequences .

Rolling Stone 's Matt Taibbi tells us how he really feels about Rush Limbaugh on Hardball .
I 've never seen Matt pull his punches and he sure as hell does n't hold back here .
He makes some great points about what the future of the Republican party is with women and independent voters if this is the path they want to continue down as well .
Updated :
As my fellow C&L'er Max pointed out to me tonight ( thank you Max ) :
Oh he went so easy on him ...
Taibbi is the ( usually ) the most ruthless physical caricaturist there is .
He noted Taibbi's post at the HuffPo Erica Jong Thinks I Want to Do My Mother : A Response where Taibbi wrote this in response to Jong 's criticism of his remarks about Hillary Clinton .
Like other sexist men , I apparently trained my monomaniacal focus on Hillary 's appearance while while ignoring the paunches , liver spots and comb-overs of male politicians .
Jong has apparently never read anything else I 've written .
Here is a short catalogue of some of the physical descriptions I 've used in recent articles about male politicians .
Follow the link above to read the rest .
Warning before following the link , some of it may not be safe for work .
I get so tired of the undeserved politeness on these shows for Limbaugh and his ilk as Margaret Carlson exemplifies with her remarks following Taibbi's where she says that Rush is more " intellectual than the other talk show hosts " .
Really Margaret ?
Intellectual is not the first word that comes to mind when I listen to anything Rush Limbaugh says .
Nope .
Uh ... blowhard and hack , those come to mind .
Intellectual ... not even on the radar screen for me .
And as Andy already noted in the comments , I do n't think Limbaugh is beloved by anyone either .
Great points
Andy .
We have work to do : too many of the people producing our food , live a life in poverty .

Up to one - quarter of China 's carbon emissions come from exports China has proposed that importers of Chinese - made goods should be responsible for the carbon dioxide emitted during their manufacture .
China 's top climate change negotiator , Li Gao , said his country should not pay for cutting emissions caused by the high demands of other countries .
In recent years China has overtaken the US as the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases .
Mr Li was in Washington for talks ahead of a major conference in Copenhagen .
Envoys from Japan and the EU were also in the US capital for preliminary talks aimed at paving the way for the Denmark talks .
That meeting , scheduled for December , will see the start of negotiations on a new international treaty on climate change .
Participants hope to reach an agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol .
Fair deal ?
China 's latest suggestion would see its own huge export sector be exempted from any new treaty .
These products are consumed by other countries ...
This share of emissions should be taken by the consumers but not the producers
Li Gao , China 's climate change negotiator Beijing argues that rich nations buying Chinese goods bear responsibility for the estimated 15 - 25 % of China 's carbon emissions that are created by its production of exports .
" It is a very important item to make a fair agreement , " Mr Li said in Washington .
He argued that it was unfair to put the highest burden on China .
" We are at the low end of the production line for the global economy , " he said .
" We produce products and these products are consumed by other countries , especially the developed countries .
This share of emissions should be taken by the consumers but not the producers , " he said .
Mr Li also criticised proposals by the US to place carbon tariffs on goods imported from countries that do not limit those gases blamed for a rises in global temperatures .
" If developed countries set a barrier in the name of climate change for trade , I think it is a disaster , " Mr Li said .
Scepticism
Working out quite how to put Mr Li's suggestion into practice would be a logistical nightmare , other delegates in Washington said , even if the idea was ever agreed in principle .
Asking importers to handle emissions " would mean that we would also like them to have jurisdiction and legislative powers in order to control and limit those , " top EU climate negotiator Artur Runge - Metzger said .
Low - lying nations such as the Maldives are at risk from rising seas " I 'm not sure whether my Chinese colleague would agree on that particular point , " he said .
" I think the issue here is we take full responsibility and we ... regulate all the emissions that come from our territory , " said Mr Runge - Metzger .
The delegates were attending a forum hosted by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change .
World economic woes are expected to dampen progress toward climate change initiatives , but organisers said progress could still be made in Copenhagen .
Japan 's chief negotiator Shinsuke Sugiyama pointed out that whatever deal emerged from Copenhagen , it was vital that it involved the US and China this time around .
" Japan will not repeat Kyoto , " Mr Sugiyama said .
" At Kyoto we were not able to involve the biggest emitters in the world by now - and that means the United States of America and China , " he said .

After hinting a couple of weeks ago that the much - loved ( around here , anyway ) yet perpetually on - the - brink - of - cancellation series Friday Night Lights was likely getting picked up for another season , EW ’s Michael Ausiello has committed to the news , saying the done deal will be announced any day now .
Even better , the show is coming back for two seasons , most likely to be aired on DirectTV before segueing over to NBC , as was the case with the show ’s third season .
Ausiello also says that Adrienne Palicki ( Tyra ) and Minka Kelly ( Lyla ) will be leaving the show , but probably not before a multi-episode sendoff like the ones given to Scott Porter ( Jason Street ) and Gaius Charles ( Smash ) last season .
But never fear , we ’ve still got Coach and Mrs. Coach ( and , presumably , Riggins and Saracen , even though they ’re supposedly college - bound ) to keep things interesting in Dillon .

The Obama administration should join Europe in an ambitious new transatlantic pact to combat climate change , Brussels proposed today .
Seeking to seize on the excitement generated by the election of the new US president and hoping to co-opt Barack Obama 's green agenda for a powerful alliance to tackle global warming , the European commission called on the Americans to establish a joint carbon trading scheme with Europe modelled on the system operating in the EU since 2005 .
Unveiling the commission 's pitch for the crucial round of global climate talks later this year in Copenhagen , Stavros Dimas , the environment commissioner , added that if the new US administration joins the system for auctioning polluting rights , it should then be extended to other industrialised countries and later to the big developing countries , transforming it into a global carbon market by 2020 .
Dimas described this year 's Copenhagen meetings , aimed at clinching a new global climate change deal to succeed the Kyoto protocol , as " a last chance " to get global warming under control before it passes the point of no return .
He appealed to President Obama to join the EU in the fight to save the planet .
" It appears Obama prefers cap and trade , " said Dimas , describing the new US leader 's initial statements on global warming as " tremendously encouraging . "
Senior officials from Brussels set off for Washington today to try to get the measure of the new administration on climate change policy after Dimas wrote to Obama on Tuesday to try to enlist the Americans in his campaign .
" Many of the new ideas that will move us away from our carbon addiction will come from America , " Dimas told Obama .
" America has the diplomatic and financial resources that , when added to the efforts of the EU , can help bring the rest of the world on board . "
Dimas clearly hopes that such a joint EU - US strategy could bear fruit in Copenhagen in December in persuading the likes of China , Brazil , India , Russia , and Japan to forge a common front across the developed and developing world .
Today 's policy paper from the commission was the opening salvo in what will inevitably be tough negotiations in Copenhagen .
The policy outline , which is to be debated at a summit of European government leaders in March and may still be changed , calls on developing countries to limit the growth in their greenhouse gases by up to 30 % by 2020 , compared with business as usual , as revealed by the Guardian in December .
In return , it commits the EU to a 30 % cut compared to 1990 levels by the same deadline , if agreement is reached with the other big international polluters .
The EU is already pledged to a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 even without a Copenhagen accord .
The EU package is aimed at keeping the rise in the Earth 's temperature to a minimum of 2C , and Dimas believes that global carbon emissions need to be halved by 2050 .
To achieve this Europe would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 % by that date .
The cost of success in meeting the targets , said the commission , will be € 175bn a year by 2020 , with around half of that money being spent in the developing world .
Spending on research in green technologies would need to be quadrupled by 2020 .
The commission reckoned that the industrialised world will need to pour in subsidies worth up to € 54bna year into the developing countries .
But arguments are looming about who will foot the bill and about equitable burden - sharing .
NGOs such as Oxfam criticised the commission proposals as doing too little to alleviate poverty in the developing world , arguing that the poor countries faced the most " devastating impact " from global warming generated in the rich countries .
But Greenpeace welcomed the commission 's paper as a good start while complaining that precise figures on how many billions would need to be transferred to the developing world had been dropped from earlier drafts .
" The commission has come up with a decent blueprint , but has shown it is unable to put its euros where its mouth is and support credible amounts of aid to prevent a global climate catastrophe , " said Joris den Blanken , Greenpeace EU climate and energy policy director .
Dimas admitted that the issue of funding the impact of climate change in the poor countries would be a crucial topic at Copenhagen and mentioned a figure of £ 30bn in possible annual transfers from the rich to the poor .
" Without a credible financial package there will be no deal in Copenhagen .
No money , no deal , " he said .
Senior commission officials also signalled that they would use the Copenhagen negotiations to push to reform and perhaps even scrap the so - called Clean Development Mechanism , an instrument under Kyoto that allows wealthy countries to offset their emissions reductions obligations through investment in green projects in the developing world .
The officials admitted that the system is being abused by both rich and poor countries , and noted that some of the beneficiary countries were wealthier than some of the countries doing the subsidising .
" There is some cheating , " said a commission official .
" And some of the developing countries are much richer than some [ EU ] member states . "

Sen . John McCain was on Fox News Sunday today , where he did an interesting little dance , where he seemed to favor the nationalization of failing banks , but if McCain supports nationalization , does this make him a Socialist too ?
McCain supported nationalization without using the word , “ Well , you ’d sell off their assets , and you have the — unfortunately , the shareholders and others will take a beating .
But to just keep them alive when — and keep pouring billions and billions of taxpayers ’ dollars into them , when they clearly are not — their situation is not improving — these are tough choices .
I do n’t know if it ’s , quote , nationalizing , but it certainly is not continuing to — propping them up with tens or 40 or $ 50 billion of taxpayers ’ dollars and their overall value continues to decline . ”
According to the Republican Party , and Wall Street , the nationalization of banks would be socialism , so McCain played a little semantic game here .
He described the characteristics of nationalization , without actually using the word , or saying specifically that he supported it .
McCain does have a point , in saying that it does n’t make sense to keep dumping tens of billions of dollars into a system that seems to be hording the money .
His answer also demonstrates that McCain reads the polls .
A recent U.S. News and World Report poll revealed that 56 % of Americans support the nationalization of banks .
Advertisements
McCain could have said that he does n’t support nationalization , but instead he talked about selling off assets and investor pain .
McCain also would n’t blame Obama for the drop in the stock market .
I think McCain does n’t have a desire to nationalize anything .
His motivation is that he wants the government to stop dumping money into the banking system , and if nationalization would stop the federal spending then he would be willing to consider that .
The GOP is trying to paint a picture of Obama as the extreme socialist , who is out to ruin capitalism , but Obama does n’t support the nationalization of banks .
Does this mean that McCain is more of a socialist than Obama ?
The problem that the Republicans face is that they are n’t unified around an answer to our current problems .
I am sure that McCain ’s comments wo n’t be popular on CNBC , and it is a pretty safe guess that his office will be issuing some sort of clarification , but while the Republicans are fighting ideological battles , the American people want this crisis resolved , even if it involves nationalization .

Freemasonry : Midwife to an Occult Empire
- by Terry Melanson © , June 4th , 2005
Introduction
The article located at this URL , and earlier at Geocities , was first written 4 years ago .
Since then I have learned a bit more about Freemasonry and have had many communications , good and bad , with its members .
I 've been put on an " anti-mason " [ hit ] list , along with others who dare to write anything unflattering against the brethren ; I 've had heated debates and arguments in public forums and message boards ; and I 've actually been threatened , both subtly and overtly .
Curiously , many times the offended Mason claims to be a chaplain , a minister or a supposed " man of cloth " - a real surprise , at first , considering the occult nature of the organization .
The negative experiences far outweigh the positive .
The members who regularly post to forums and send out emails display the traits of having been thoroughly brainwashed by a first - class cult .
Some are far more clever , however , and are undoubtedly part of a concerted effort by the Brotherhood .
See , Masonic Disinformation , Propaganda , Dissembling , and Hate Techniques for a concise elaboration of their techniques .
Historically , Freemasonry has been charged with corruption of public officials because of the oaths and promises they swear to keep amongst themselves , above all else .
At the very least , joining a secret society , or a " society with secrets , " creates a glaring conflict of interest .
The following document does n't go into corruption or masonic favoritism .
A secret society , by its very nature - and one as widespread and established as masonry - would naturally enable such intrigue .
My only intention here is to outline its influence , and guiding hand on a unique phenomenon that occurred at the crossroads of the 19th and 20th century .
Having learned from earlier criticism , and with all brevity aside , I hope this page is seen as one of the most comprehensive and accurate expositions in this field of study .
The Hoodwinking
“ Masonry , like all the Religions , all the Mysteries , Hermeticism and Alchemy , conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages , or the Elect , and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled ... ”
“ The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple .
Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate , but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations .
It is not intended that he shall understand them ; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them .
Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts , the Princes of Masonry . ” ( pp. 104 , 105 & 819 )
General Albert Pike wrote those words in a work called Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , 1871 .
At the time his title was The Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in Washington D.C.
This book is revered by occult groups across the globe , and most masons have never read it , let alone understood it .
It deals with the occult origins of the symbols , initiations , and rituals of Freemasonry .
Morals and Dogma is typically only giving to Master Masons .
It is estimated that for every hundred Masons , ten will read it , three will finish it and only one will understand it .
The rites and rituals of Freemasonry are directly derived from ancient occult mysteries .
1
An Entered Apprentice is deceived from the beginning , as Pike has openly admitted ; at the same time revealing its likeness with the " Mysteries , Hermeticism and Alchemy . "
Pike said the initiate is " intentionally misled by false interpretations . "
Another esteemed Mason put it this way :
“ FREEMASONRY is a fraternity within a fraternity — an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect .
Before it is possible to intelligently discuss the origin of the Craft , it is necessary , therefore , to establish the existence of these two separate yet interdependent orders , the one visible and the other invisible .
The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of ' free and accepted ' men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical , educational , fraternal , patriotic , and humanitarian concerns .
The invisible society is a secret and most august fraternity whose members are dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcanum arcanorum .
Those Brethren who have essayed to write the history of their Craft have not included in their disquisitions the story of that truly secret inner society which is to the body Freemasonic what the heart is to the body human . ”
Chapter 19 - Rosicrucian and Masonic Origins ] - Manly P. Hall 33° , Lectures on Ancient Philosophy and Introduction to the Study and Application of Rational Procedure , p. 397 [
“ When a mason learns the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power , he has learned the mystery of his craft .
The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step upward , he must prove his ability to properly apply energy . ”
- Manly P. Hall , 33° , The Lost Keys of Freemasonry , p. 48
The latter quote , in particular , may be surprising to some but occultists have a clear concept of what Manly P. Hall was conveying .
To them , the true definition of occultism is the science of energy flow and energy relationships .
Occult meditation is a means of consciously and purposefully directing energy from a recognized source to the creation of some specific effect .
This is the task of the initiate in all Occult groups .
The initiator shows the candidate his latent faculties , his dormant powers , and initiates him into their use .
He explains or demonstrates how the candidate may awaken the static energy into dynamic power .
Freemasonry has always , admittedly , held deep occult secrets which it hides from the " profane " and unworthy .
One person who believed this to be true was Alice Ann Bailey .
Her praise and admiration - she appeared to be almost in awe of the craft - was evident throughout all her works .
A typical flattery can be found on p. 511 of The Externalization of the Hierarchy : " The Masonic Movement . . . is the custodian of the law ; it is the home of the Mysteries and the seat of initiation .
... It is a far more occult organization than can be realized , and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists .
In its ceremonials lies hid the wielding of the forces connected with the growth and life of the kingdoms of nature and the unfoldment of the divine aspects of man . "
The Occult Revival
“ Satanic Ritual is a blend of Gnostic , Cabbalistic , Hermetic , and Masonic elements , incorporating nomenclature and vibratory words of power from virtually every mythos ....
Masonic orders have contained the most influential men in many governments , and virtually every occult order has many Masonic roots . ”
The Satanic Rituals — Companion to the Satanic Bible , pp. 21 , 78 [ - Anton Szandor LaVey , , pp. 21 , 78 [ PDF Version here
The occult revival of the 20th century can be directly attributed to Freemasonry and its peripheral entourage of acolytes :
Theosophy , the New Age Movement , Satanism , Cabalistic Black Magic , Enochian Magic , Gerardian Wicca , Alexandrian Wicca and Sex Magic .
The Who's Who List of 19th & 20th Century Occultism
Theosophy
Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( 1831 - 1891 ) heralded the dawn of the New Age Movement .
Her writings are the foundation for many occult fraternities .
After publishing monumental works such as Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine , the Theosophical Society ( 1875 ) was formed to spread her teachings worldwide .
She claimed to receive her revelations from Secret Chiefs , or disembodied Ascended Masters ; who claimed to be aiding humanity evolve into a race of supermen .
Freemasonry took notice and many soon proclaimed her an occult genius :
" The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled are Madame Blavatsky 's gifts to humanity , and to those whose vision can pierce the menacing clouds of imminent disaster it is no exaggeration to affirm that these writings are the most vital literary contribution to the modern world .
No more can they be compared with other books than can the light of the sun be compared with the lamp of the glowworm .
The Secret Doctrine assumes the dignity of a scripture , . . . "
The Philosophical Research Society , p. 122 - Manly P. Hall 33° , The Phoenix : An Illustrated Review of Occultism and Philosophy , 1960 , , p. 122
Blavatsky soon had a great host of admirers .
The Theosophical Society had freemasons Henry Steel Olcott , George H. Felt appointed president and vice - president respectfully .
Among the early members were high ranking masons Charles Sothern and Albert Pike .
In 1907 Annie Besant became president of the Theosophical Society .
The beginnings of the modern New Age Movement began with search for their " own " messiah , as it were .
Along with 33rd degree mason C.W. Leadbeater , Annie Besant promoted a young adept as the messiah : Jiddu Krishnamurti .
Alice Bailey and husband Foster ( 32° degree mason ) continued to interlock the workings of Theosophy with the aims of Freemasonry .
Bailey , as founder of Lucis ( Lucifer ) Trust , worked laboriously to fulfill the plan toward a New World Religion , which her master Djwhal Khul had said was the ultimate aim of Freemasonry .
The Hierarchy had blessed both their beginnings , her master said .
O.T.O. : Ordo Templi Orientis
The O.T.O. founded at the beginning of the 20th century represents a reunification attempt to incorporate the traditions of the Freemasonic , Rosicrucian and Illuminist movements of the 18th and 19th centuries , the crusading Knights Templars of the middle ages and early Christian Gnosticism and the Pagan Mystery Schools .
The spiritual father of the OTO was Karl Kellner a wealthy Austrian paper chemist .
Kellner was a student of Freemasonry , Rosicrucianism and Eastern mysticism .
He developed adhesive to form an Academia Masonica which would enable all Freemasons to become familiar with all existing Masonic degrees and systems .
In 1895 , Kellner decided that the Academia Masonica should be called the ' Oriental Templar Order ' .
The occult inner circle of this Order ( OTO ) would be organized parallel to the highest degrees of the Memphis and Mizraim Rites of Masonry , and would teach the esoteric Rosicrucian doctrines of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light , and Kellner 's ' Key ' to Masonic symbolism .
Possession of the various degrees of Craft and High - Grade Freemasonry would be a prerequisite for admission to the Inner Circle of OTO .
Theodor Reuss , Kellner 's partner , was granted the charter to perform three systems of high - grade Freemasonry known as the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis of 97° , the Ancient Oriental Rite of Mizraim of 90° , and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33° .
With the incorporation of these rites , the Order was enabled to operate as a completely independent Masonic system .
John Symonds , the official biographer of Aleister Crowley , tells us that " the letters of O.T.O. stand for Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Templars , an occult society which was founded in Germany at the beginning of this century .
Its leaders were well - known Grand Masters of Masonry , such as Franz Hartmann , Heinrich Klein , and Karl Kellner .
They had decided to found the O.T.O. after the Viennese Karl Kellner had returned from an extensive tour in the East ( where he had been initiated by the Arab fakir , Soliman ben Aifa , and the Indian yogis , Bhima Sen Pratap and Sri Mahatma Agamya Guru Paramahamsa ) and had expounded the mysteries of yoga and the left - hand path which he called ' sexual magic ' .
Thus , in 1902 , the Ordo Templi Orientis was constituted for an inner circle of adepts who , in the light of this new and exciting knowledge , found the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of masonry rather tame , and the ninety - seven degrees of the tiresome Rite of Memphis quite unnecessary . "
( The Great Beast : The Life and Magick of Aleister Crowley , Granada Publishing , 1973 , p. 179 )
The O.T.O. has also claimed , " Our Order possesses the KEY which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets , namely , the teaching of sexual magic , and this teaching explains , without exception , all the secrets of nature , all the symbolism of FREEMASONRY and all systems of religion . "

Conclusion
I 've tried to keep my biases in check for the entirety of the text .
I am a Christian , but hopefully the explication of the facts have spoken for themselves ; without resorting to preaching or any appearance of a smear campaign .
Maybe that goal was accomplished , maybe not .
Many Freemasons throughout history have contributed immensely to our society , I would be remiss having not mentioned it .
However , for all the good that has been done there is still only one occult revival that has occurred on such a grand scale ( taken together as a phenomenon ) which I thoroughly believe warrants the appellation of an empire .
Historians will record this unique event , and its repercussions .
It should also be put on the record that many Freemasons of the period had more than a passing influence on its birth .

Appendix : Quotations
“ [ Freemasonry ] makes no profession of Christianity , and wars not against sectarian creeds or doctrines , but looks forward to the time when the labor of our ancient brethren shall be symbolized by the erection of a spiritual temple whose moral grandeur shall be commensurate with civilization ; a temple in which there shall be but one altar and but one worship ; one common altar of Masonry on which the Veda , Shastras , Sade , Zend - Avesta , Koran , and Holy Bible shall lie untouched by sacrilegious hands , and at whose shrine the Hindoo , the Persian , the Assyrian , the Chaldean , the Egyptian , the Chinese , the Muhammadan , the Jew , and the Christian may kneel with one united voice celebrate the praises of the Supreme Architect of the Universe . ”

“ Though Masonry is identical with the ancient Mysteries , it is so only in this qualified sense : that it presents but an imperfect image of their brilliancy , the ruins only of their grandeur . . . ” Morals and Dogma , 2nd Degree , - Albert Pike , , 2nd Degree , II - THE FELLOW - CRAFT , p. 23

“ The true name of Satan , the Kabalists say , is that of Yahveh reversed ; for Satan is not a black god , but the negation of God .
The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry .
For the Initiates , this is not a Person , but a Force , created for good , but which may serve for evil .
It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will .
They represent this Force , which presides over the physical generation , under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN ; thence came the he -goat of the Sabbat , brother of the Ancient Serpent , and the Light - bearer or Phosphor , of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend . ”

“ Masonry is a search after Light .
That search leads us directly back , as you see , to the Kabalah .
In that ancient and little understood medley of absurdity and philosophy , the Initiate will find the source of many doctrines ; and may in time come to understand the Hermetic philosophers , the Alchemists , all the Anti-papal Thinkers of the Middle Ages , and Emanuel Swedenborg . ”

“ All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it : everything scientific and grand in the religious dreams of all the illuminati , Jacob Bœhme , Swedenborg , Saint - Martin , and others , is borrowed from the Kabalah ; all the Masonic associations owe to it their Secrets and their Symbols . ” - Albert Pike , 28th Degree , XXVIII - KNIGHT OF THE SUN , OR PRINCE ADEPT , p. 744
“ [ Albert Pike ] was an honorary member of almost every Supreme Council in the world , personally receiving 130 Masonic degrees .
Pike also was one of the most physically and morally repulsive individuals in American history .
Weighing well over three hundred pounds , his sexual proclivity was to sit naked astride a phallic throne in the woods , accompanied by a gang of prostitutes .
To these orgies he would bring one or more wagon loads of food and liquor , most of which he would consume over a period of two days until he passed into a stupor .
In his adopted state of Arkansas , Pike was well known as a practitioner of Satanism , Portraits of his later years show him wearing a symbol of the Baphomet around his neck . ” - John Daniel , Scarlet and the Beast , Vol 2 , Page 37
“ It is generally agreed that the biggest single influence in the modern expansion of ritual magic , and the occult explosion in general , in the Western world , was the Golden Dawn .
This magical fraternity , founded by Freemasons at the end of the 19th century , developed a complex ritual system with ten degrees of initiation relating to the Cabalistic Sephiroth . ” - Janet and Stewart Farrar , The Life and Times of A Modern Witch , Phoenix Publishing Company , p. 121
