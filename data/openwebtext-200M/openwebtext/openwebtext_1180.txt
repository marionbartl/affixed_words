The ruler of Dubai , Sh. Muhammed bin Rashid al Makdoum , wanted Dubai to be known for something very special and unique .
Besides his intention to diversify from trade - based economy to a service and tourism - oriented .
Burj Khalifa has returned the title to the Middle East once again , for having the tallest building .
This was snatched by Lincoln Cathedral , England .
And it is done in 1311 from the Great Pyramid of Giza ( Middle East ) .
Moreover , it remained the highest man-made structure for four millennium years .
Design of Burj Khalifa :
Burj Khalifa is designed by M/s Skidmore Owings and Merrill .
Moreover , Andrian Smith being the main architect until 2006 .
This company also designed Willis Tower in Chicago , World Trade Centre in New York , besides numeral high rises .
This design is similar to planned tower Illinois , a mile - high skyscraper .
And the original intention of the promoters of Burj Khalifa was a residential tower with 73 floors .
Therefore , Andrian Smith proposed major changes in height .
The proposal was to make the top crown section to look more elegant .
And steel frame superstructure ( antenna ) at the top is designed so as to vary its height as desired to maintain the tallest rating .
The idea of Design :
The Burj design resembles the flower Hymenocallis .
The three - lobed elements wrap around the tower core , rising in spiral form .
And the cross-section area is reduced in periodic setbacks , narrowing the tower as it rises .
The Y - shape structure design offers a wide aerial view of the Persian Gulf from all sides .
Therefore , the exterior of the building is covered by stainless steel panels , glazed for maximum reflection of light and heat to withstand .
And it also reduces extreme summer temperatures to comfortable levels .
However , top floors will stay 6 oC ( 11 oF ) cooler than the base floors - by height differential .
The structural design limits the tower sway by wind pressures to a maximum of 1.2 m ( 4ft ) at the highest point .
Besides this construction contractor is Samsung Engineering and Construction .
They also built PETRONAS Twin Towers and Taipei 101 .
The structure uses reinforced concrete .
The tower base is supported by 192 concrete piles dug in 50 m ( 164ft ) deep .
And the huge height needed concrete pumping by very special pumps .
Most of the concrete is mixed with ice .
That was poured at night to prolong the setting time for uniform cool curing .
It is done to avoid as well as any cracking possibility , under the massive weight of the structure .
Buildings :
The seven hundred private apartments have been laid out on floors 45 through 108 .
These were sold completely within the same day of the offer .
The Armani Hotel occupies a lower 37 floors .
The remaining floors and spiral towers will house thousands of office suites and mini homes .
A swimming pool is located on the 78th floor .
While 123rd is a lobby and the 124th floor will contain an indoor / outdoor observation / security deck .
Moreover , the top spire will hold communication types of equipment .
An estimated 38000 persons can be housed at one time .
Double - deck super - fast elevators are being installed .
Furthermore , the project includes 7 - acre Parkland , Dubai Mall and a 30 - acre man-made Dubai Lake .
Dubai Fountain :
A very costly ( DH 800 Million ) fountain has been installed on the outside of Burj Dubai .
This is 900 ft long and shoots water jets 500 ft upwards .
Over 600 lights through 50 color projectors illuminate it .
They are also accompanied by world - class and traditional music .

Height Increases History :
The original plan was a 73 story residential building .
The upper limit was revised many times ( secretly ) probably to push through height ratings .
These changes also created a sort of history .
As it rose above the recorded towers one by one .
In February 2007 , it crossed the Willis Tower too .
Therefore , Continuing progress over other middle - order ones .
It also topped the highest Warsaw Radio Mast in Poland , Standing at 628.8 m ( 1815 ft. ) , on first September 2008 .
Burj Dubai achieved its ultimate height , finishing at 818 m ( 2684 ft. ) on 17th January 2009 .
And the inauguration is expected in December 2009 .
The National Geographic and other TV Channels have also shown documentaries on the Big , Bigger and Biggest series .
Detailing the typical engineering challenges faced by the builders during construction .
Such as compelling design changes and altering completion schedule twice .

A blast from a heat gun has turned most of the black tile in this image white .
The prototype tile , developed by recent MIT graduates , is designed to turn dark in cold weather and white in warm weather .
On a blazing summer day , a black roof gets miserably hot , while a white roof reflects the sun and keeps a home cooler .
In winter , the warmth generated by a solar - radiation - absorbing black roof can save energy .
That 's well - known and simple enough .
Unfortunately , you can't have it both ways .
Well ...
A team of recent MIT graduates has developed roof tiles that change color based on the temperature .
The tiles become white on a hot day and turn black when it 's cold outside .
When white , the tiles reflect about 80 percent of the sunlight that hits them .
When they are black , they reflect only about 30 percent .
The white state could save up to 20 percent of present cooling costs , according to other recent studies on the theory of all this .
Savings from the black state in winter have yet to be quantified .
The tiles rely on a polymer similar to that used in hair gels and water , in a solution encapsulated between layers of flexible plastic .
When cool , the polymer stays dissolved , letting a black background show through .
When warmed , the polymer condenses to form tiny droplets , whose small sizes scatter light and thus produce a white surface , reflecting the sun 's heat .
More work is needed to make the setup commercial - ready .
" It 's got to stand up to very harsh conditions , " said Nick Orf , a member of the team that calls itself Thermeleon ( get it ? ) .
" Those sorts of tests would have to be done before we 'll know if we have a viable product . "
Engineers who invented a bra that converts into a gas mask and Irish police officers who mistakenly wrote tickets to " Driver 's Licence " have all won spoof IgNobel prizes .
The IgNobels - a play on the name of the Nobel prizes awarded every October from Stockholm and Oslo - are given out by the Harvard - based humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research .
Prizes also went to Zimbabwe for issuing banknotes that ranged in value from one Zimbabwean cent to 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars , to Mexican scientists who made diamonds out of tequila , and to the leaders of four Icelandic banks that suffered spectacular collapses .
The Public Health prize went to Elena Bodnar of Hinsdale , Illinois and colleagues who designed and patented a bra that can be quickly converted into a pair of gas masks , one for the brassiere wearer and one to be given to some needy bystander .
Ireland 's police won the literature prize for writing more than 50 traffic tickets to a frequent visitor and speeder named Prawo Jazdy .
In Polish , this means " driver 's licence " .
Pathologist Stephan Bolliger and colleagues at the University of Bern in Switzerland won for a study they did to determine whether an empty beer bottle does more or less damage to the human skull than a full one in a bar fight .
" Both suffice in breaking the human skull .
However , the empty ones are more sturdy , " Mr Bolliger said by email .
This is because the pressure of the beer , aided by carbonation , makes a full beer bottle explode quickly .
The economics prize went to managers at Kaupthing Bank , Landsbanki , Glitnir Bank and Central Bank of Iceland " for demonstrating that tiny banks can be rapidly transformed into huge banks , and vice versa " .
Donald Unger of California was honoured for a lifelong experiment in which he cracked the knuckles of his left hand but never his right for more than 60 years to prove that cracking your knuckles does not cause arthritis .

Blair can't really become President of Europe , can he ?
There must be millions of us who 've been slowly managing to forget about him for the last two years , recovering as he fades into the past , the way torture victims rebuild their lives day by day , and now this dreadful figure we thought had gone forever might be back ruling us again .
It 's like finding out your new boss is the PE teacher who used to thrash you with his belt when you were in the shower , or your local councillor is Hughie Greene , or having Black Lace move in next door and sing Agadoo every night .
This is someone who made himself one of the most despised people in Europe , so loathed that Britain came bottom of the Eurovision Song Contest because of an orchestrated protest .
So that 's the ideal President of a continent , the person who had even the judges in a music contest saying " Hello – Lithuania here , ooh what a splendid night and hard to choose between so many dreadful tunes , the only easy part is giving nought to the warmongering running dogs of poodle - boy Blair 's blood - soaked United Kingdom . "
Anyway , is n't he supposed to be Middle - East peace envoy ?
Surely he wo n't want to give that up just while he 's achieving such staggering success in that post .
But this appears to be what happens to him ; he wrecks a place , then gets the job of uniting it .
Even Bin Laden did n't have the cheek to say " Aha , there 's a vacancy for President of the New York Tall Buildings Appreciation Society .
I think I 'll put in for that . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In support of Blair , David Miliband said the post should go to someone who 's a " well - known international leader " , and who is " not a shrinking violet " .
And it 's true , Blair fits into both those categories – as does Robert Mugabe .
Or maybe this explains why Karadzic did n't turn up for his trial – he's busy planning his campaign , in which his slogan will be " I 'm no shrinking violet " , at which point Austria will put forward Josef Fritzl as a compromise candidate .
Blair 's supporters also say the new President has to be someone who " stops the traffic " when he arrives abroad .
So the whole campaign revolves around his celebrity status .
And in a way he is a political version of Paris Hilton , desperate for whatever role will keep up his global profile .
If he gets the job he 'll probably arrange for the meetings to be covered by the paparazzi , so the reports will begin " Tony Blair , 53 , seen falling out of Beijing 's exclusive ' Long March ' nightclub , glared at photographers when they suggested he'd been involved in a flare - up with Colonel Gadaffi over a bottle of tequila spilt on the Libyan leader 's strapless snakeskin top at last night 's climate change summit after - party . "
Because fame is his only selling point , unless the argument for electing Blair will be that , faced with today 's global challenges , Europe needs a strong voice that can speak up loudly in favour of doing whatever America tells it to .
That may be why his only definite ally so far is Berlusconi .
Which means if Miliband was honest he'd say " Tony 's the ideal candidate to unite Europe and America – in one continent he 's known as the most strident supporter of the most unpopular President ever , and in the other he 's endorsed by a man who at 70 can still surround himself with prostitutes .
Top that . "
In any case , many countries could be bankrupted after he 's flown in to stop the traffic , when they receive Cherie 's demand for an appearance fee .
Typically , it 's claimed Blair has n't officially put himself forward yet , and the story has been derided as " only speculation " , even though he 's been lobbying for months .
As ever , you almost wish they 'd make more effort with the lying .
But there 's marvellous potential here , since his main rival is the current Prime Minister of Luxembourg , Jean - Claude Juncker , who said , " If called upon I would have no reason to refuse " .
So can you imagine the feverish dealing and smearing Blair 's team will be organising against Luxembourg , with rumours being spread that they 're building missiles that could reach the edge of Luxembourg , and issuing hypnotic stamps .
But it means this could end gloriously , if only whoever the people are who decide these things have it in them – to make Tony Blair , in his quest for the job he wants so so much , lose to the Prime Minister of bloody Luxembourg .
Is there any way we can influence this ?
There must be bribes that can be made , like they do with the Olympics .
Someone must come up with a plan – it'll be the cathartic boost the country and the world so desperately needs .

ONE year after the Georgian war , its outcome is as debatable as the cause .
Depending on where you stand , the war can be seen as the sinister culmination of a systematic provocation by a neo- imperialist Russia or as a murderously aggressive gambit by a Caucasian strongman wrongheadedly backed by the West .
The truth is somewhere in between .
Russia did systematically provoke Georgia in the months leading up to the war .
Its military counter - attack was disproportionate .
But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that President Mikheil Saakashvili 's inner circle was badly penetrated by Russia , that decision - making processes were chaotic and amateurish , and that the move to retake the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali ( pictured ) , played into his enemy 's hands .
EPA
Whose fault was it ?
With a detailed chronology of who did and decided what in the days and hours leading up to the war still ( oddly ) unavailable , an accurate assessment of the causes of war is still impossible .
Depending on where you stand , what happened next is similarly foggy .
One variant is that Nicolas Sarkozy , the president of France , intervened with panache and elan to prevent catastrophe , brokering a ceasefire deal in a way that only a big European country could have done .
From another viewpoint , Mr Sarkozy was a meddling egomaniac whose amateurism and self - importance gravely impeded the EU 's ability to intervene .
People familiar with ceasefires in the Yugoslav wars certainly thought the documents he brought away from the talks with Vladimir Putin ( and his sidekick - boss Dmitri Medvedev ) were remarkably vague .
From another point of view , the EU and NATO reaped the harvest of their neglect of Georgia in previous months .
The agreed sanctions after the fighting stopped were feeble .
Suspending the NATO - Russia council , or the putative Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia , was not even turning a cold shoulder ( more a soggy one ) to the Kremlin .
The outside world showed it would sacrifice principle for profit .
It just requires a decent interval .
Lenin 's famous dictum “ Kto kovo ” ( “ who did what to whom ” ) is the best way of clearing the fog .
Georgia is weakened , but not destroyed .
Its economy has not collapsed .
Political pluralism survives .
War - weariness has not brought a pro-Moscow regime to power .
Even Mr Saakashvili's erstwhile friends are heartily fed - up with his presidency , but Georgian politics is still commendably open and contestable .
That can not be said of Russia .
The war has made apparent to outsiders some of the worst features of Russian politics .
The Kremlin propaganda machine has used it to stoke xenophobia : Saakashvili is a monster , it says , so the West is monstrously cynical in backing him .
Yet Russia has not pursued military aggression elsewhere .
Fears for the future of Crimea and the Baltic states , vivid a year ago , now seem overblown .
The military adventure in Georgia was bad , but it was a one - off .
If it will be repeated anywhere , it will be once more in Georgia .
And confident predictions of that , earlier this year , have come to nothing .
One reason for that is that the West has not abandoned Georgia .
For all the frustration with the administration 's autocratic tendencies , and despite all the pressing priorities elsewhere , the core commitment to Georgia is intact .
America's “ reset ” of relations with Russia did not uninstall the program “ Georgia 1.0 ” .
Partly because of the principle of defending sovereignty , partly out of enthusiasm for Georgia 's political and economic achievements , and partly because of energy politics ( remember the pipelines ) , America and Europe are staying engaged .
Not that anybody has worked out what to do .
Not giving up is a good start , but only that .

Just 2 days remain until the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , the US , but will the expectations for finding a solution to 2 of the most pressing global problems , will come up ?
The reason for the lack of clarity on this issue is that these 2 most pressing issues are so complex that the need for their urgent solving makes them even harder to solve .
These are the measures to prevent repeat of the global financial and economic crisis and the new climate change deal that is to replace the unsuccessful Kyoto Protocol .
On both issues , the differences are serious .
One of the keys to achieving a common global position on prevention any repeats of the crisis , is enhancement of the global financial regulation , as well as restrictions on the remunerations of the senior managers of bank institutions .
On the issue of remunerations the positions of the US and the EU are very different .
And regarding climate change , the problem is who and what concessions will make so that in the short and the medium - term the economy would not suffer .
And here the argument is among the developed countries themselves , as well as between them and the developing states .
Regarding the first issue - the financial crisis - the EU will be represented as a legal entity at the summit , being a member of the G20 and with a common position .
The good news is that at the informal European Council last week ( the summit of EU leaders ) for the first time , I dare say , a very detailed , broad and tough position has been adopted , a position that reflects the compromises among the member states .
And the better news is that Bulgaria for the first time ( in my humble opinion ) announced its visions on some of the big issues .
The financial regulation
In its conclusions the European council insists the G20 to commit to a globally coordinated system of macro- prudential supervision , based on close cooperation of the IMF , the FSB and the supervisory authorities , with effective exchange of information .
Besides , the EU wants accounting standards - setting bodies to accelerate their joint work on a single set of high - quality global accounting standards , as well as to strengthen oversight of systemically important financial institutions .
The bonuses
A special place in the Council conclusions has been dedicated to the remunerations of the senior management personnel of large financial institutions .
In 6 points the EU leaders insists on enhanced governance to ensure appropriate board oversight of compensation and risk ; strengthened transparency and disclosure requirements ( bank secrecy ) ; variable remunerations including bonuses to be set at an appropriate level in relation to fixed remuneration and made dependent on the performances of the bank , the business unit and the individuals ; taking due account of negative developments , so as to avoid guaranteed bonuses ; prevent directors and officers from being completely sheltered from risk , i.e. to allow them take the responsibility for the bad performance of their institutions .
The EU will propose to the G20 partners to commit to additional increase of the IMF 's budget to borrow by $ 500 bn .
The Union 's leaders have agreed to provide additionally up to 50 bn euro in total up to EUR 125 billion , representing 35 % of the total amount of the proposal .
Of course the impact of the crisis also found place in the Council conclusions where a special focus is put on the quick increase of employment .
For the purpose it is recommended particular attention to be paid to maintaining employment , creating new jobs and promoting mobility ;
upgrading skills and matching labour market needs .
However , one of the problems that will occur in the realisation of those recommendations , especially workers ' mobility , will be the national restrictions , imposed by 10 EU member states on workers from the new members to access their labour markets .
In fact , the restrictions are more severe for workers from Bulgaria and Romania , compared to the other 10 member states , that joined the EU 3 years before Bulgaria and Romania .
The Bulgarian position
In this sense is the position , laid out by the Bulgaria prime minister Boyko Borisov who took part in the informal summit for the first time since he is a premier .
The position of Bulgaria binds the economic recovery and the tightening of the international regulation framework with employment : " The government supports the continuation of work on the international regulation framework of the financial sector by putting this activity in service of the real economy and continuation of efforts to prevent the crisis because it is not over yet and hardships are expected on the labour market " , the government press services has quoted the prime minister .
And although I did not want to praise the cabinet , we have to admit that the existence of a position itself on specific problem , definitely is a pleasure for the eyes , compared to the previous press releases in the sense of the Bulgarian - Soviet friendship .
Beside this , the position the prime minister presented , demonstrates good knowledge of basic European concepts such as the Stability and Growth Pact .
This is the legal fiscal framework of the EU in the financial sector .
It supervises the fiscal policies of the euro area members as well as the preparation of the others for joining it .
Before his colleagues Mr. Borisov said that his government is implementing significant cuts of the budget expenses and , as a result , the fiscal parametres of Bulgaria are now within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact .
" Our country supports the budgetary consolidation and a coordinated return to the Stability and Growth Pact criteria after the crisis is over .
For Bulgaria this process is of great importance because of the high level of integrity of Bulgarian economy within the EU and our preparation of euro area membership " .
Such a statement creates a good foundation for further discussions on Bulgaria 's joining the ERM II , followed by Eurozone membership .
The previous government for 4 years kept full silence on the discussions with the European partners on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact criteria which led , after all , the the freezing of the negotiations for entering the ERM II .
Climate change
On the second issue - the new climate change deal - there is no significant change in the recent EU position .
The developed countries should reduce their emissions by 80 % or more by
2050 , as agreed at the G - 8 Summit in L'Aquila earlier this year .
The international carbon market should be expanded and reformed through establishing and linking trading schemes in order to significantly increase financial flows to developing countries .
In a special article , dedicated to the topic , published in the Bulgarian " Trud " daily , the president of the Commission Jose Manuel Barroso writes that : " If we want to achieve a reduction of at least 80 % by 2050 , the developed countries should try and reach common reduction of 25 - 40 % by 2020 .
The EU is ready to make a 30 % reduction instead of the current engagement for 20 % if others also make such a commitment " .
The achievement of this goal will cost 100 bn euro annually by 2020 - money paid by and from the developing countries .
According to Mr. Barroso , a possible development of an international market of greenhouse gas emissions will provide the larger share of this amount .
Depending on the negotiations for the Copenhagen agreement , the EU is ready to provide from its own budget 15 bn euro per year .
However , the statement of the president of the Commission does not reflect the internal European debate on the distribution of burden among the richer member states to help the poorer , like Bulgaria , to achieve the targets .
There is no word about this in the Council conclusions too .
In its speech at the Council , the prime minister Borisov said : " Our country supports the position that the interests of all Eu member states in the Copenhagen negotiations , should be protected .
For Bulgaria the participation in the common effort for financing the climate change is based on the combination of 2 principles - " capability to pay " and " responsibility for the emissions " .
In other words , the new member states whose economy was totally ruined after almost 50 years socialism and another 20 years of hard transition , can either decrease their emissions with a smaller percentage or their base for comparison to be different for them .

Hyper-SAGE can increase the strength of a remote MRI or NMR signal 10,000 times , making it possible to detect ultra-low concentrations of clinical and environmental targets .
A new technique in Magnetic Resonance Imaging dubbed “ Hyper - SAGE ” has the potential to detect ultra low concentrations of clincal targets , such as lung and other cancers .
Development of Hyper -SAGE was led by one of the world ’s foremost authorities on MRI technology , Alexander Pines , a chemist who holds joint appointments with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California , Berkeley .
The key to this technique is xenon gas that has been zapped with laser light to “ hyperpolarize ” the spins of its atomic nuclei so that most are pointing in the same direction .
“ By detecting the MRI signal of dissolved hyperpolarized xenon after the xenon has been extracted back into the gas phase , we can boost the signal ’s strength up to 10,000 times , ” Pines says .
“ It is absolutely amazing because we ’re looking at pure gas and can reconstruct the whole image of our target .
With this degree of sensitivity , Hyper -SAGE becomes a highly promising tool for in vivo diagnostics and molecular imaging . ”
MRI is a painless and radiation - free means of obtaining high quality three - dimensional tomographical images of internal tissue and organs .
It is especially valuable for optically opaque samples , such as blood .
However , the application of MRI to biomedical samples has been limited by sensitivity issues .
For the past three decades , Pines has led an on - going effort to find ways of enhancing the sensitivity of MRI and its sister technology , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy .
Hyper-SAGE , the latest development , represents a significant new advance for both technologies , according to Xin Zhou , a member of Pines ’ research group .
“ Hyper - SAGE is a totally novel way to amplify a solvated xenon MRI / NMR signal in that instead of a chemical process , which is what previous signal enhancement techniques relied upon , it is a physical process , ” says Zhou .
“ Because gas can be physically compressed , the density of information - carrying polarized gas in our detection chamber can be much greater than the density of an information - carrying solution .
This means we can detect MRI signals from concentrations of molecules many thousands of times smaller than can be detected with conventional MRI . ”
Zhou is the first author on a paper that is now available online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The paper is entitled : “ Hyperpolarized Xenon NMR and MRI Signal Amplification by Gas Extraction . ”
Co-authoring the paper with Zhou and Pines was Dominic Graziani .
All hold joint appointments with Berkeley Lab ’s Materials Sciences Division and UC Berkeley ’s Chemistry Department , where Pines serves as the Glenn T. Seaborg Professor of Chemistry .
So Powerful and Yet so Weak
The great contradiction about MRI / NMR spectroscopy is that for being two of the most powerful tools we have today for studying the chemical composition and structure of a sample , they are based on a stunningly weak signal .
Both depend upon atomic nuclei that have an unpaired proton or neutron .
Such nuclei spin on an axis like miniature tops , giving rise to a magnetic moment – meaning the nuclei act like magnets with a north and south pole .
When exposed to an external magnetic field , these spinning “ bar magnets ” attempt to align their axes along the lines of magnetic force .
Since the alignment is not exact , the result is a wobbling rotation , or “ precession , ” that ’s unique to each type of atom .
If , while exposed to the magnetic field , the precessing nuclei are also hit with a radiofrequency pulse , they will absorb and re-emit energy at specific frequencies according to their rate of precession ( NMR ) .
When the rf pulse is combined with magnetic field gradients a spatially encoded signal is produced that can be detected and translated into three - dimensional images ( MRI ) .
Obtaining an MRI signal from a sample depends upon the spins of its precessing nuclei being polarized so that an excess point either “ up ” or “ down . ” MRI ’s inherent weakness stems from the fact that the natural excess of up versus down spins for any typical population of atomic nuclei in a sample is only about one in 100,000 .
For this reason , conventional MRI techniques are designed to detect nuclei that are highly abundant in tissue , usually the protons in water .
In addition , clinicians use contrasting agents to induce detectable changes in the MRI signal from a sample that can reveal the presence of anomalies .
However , the sensitivity is usually too low for molecular imaging , which is needed in cancer detection , for example , where the earliest detections generally produce the most favorable outcomes .
Enter Hyper-SAGE
Pines and his research group have developed numerous ways of increasing the sensitivity of MRI technology and expanding its applicability .
Previous work showed that xenon , an inert gas whose nuclei naturally feature a tiny degree of spin polarization , can be hyperpolarized with laser light to produce a population of xenon atoms in which nearly five out of every 10 nuclei – instead of one out of every 100,000 – produce an MRI signal .
Pines and his group also showed that xenon can be incorporated into a biosensor and linked to specific proteins or other biological molecules to produce spatial images of a chosen molecular or cellular target .
The new technique , Hyper - SAGE , for “ hyperpolarized xenon signal amplification by gas extraction , ” offers other major advantages over conventional MRI / NMR techniques in addition to a signal that is up to 10,000 times stronger than previous signals , according to Zhou .
“ Xenon gas has an intrinsically long relaxation time , greater than 45 minutes , which means the signal lasts long enough for us to collect all the encoded information , which in turn can enable us to detect specific targets , such as cancer - related proteins , at micromolar or parts per million concentrations , ” he says .
“ Also , Hyper - SAGE utilizes remote detection , meaning the signal encoding and detection processes are physically separated and carried out independently .
This is a plus for imaging the lung , for example , where the signal of interest would occupy only a small portion of the traditional MRI signal receiver . ”
In their PNAS paper , Zhou , Graziani and Pines describe the successful testing of the Hyper - SAGE technique on a pair of membranes that mimicked the function of the lungs .
Hyper - polarized xenon was dissolved in solution in one membrane to mimic inhalation , and was then extracted as a gas for detection from the other membrane to represent exhalation .
Explains Zhou ,
“ In a clinical setting , a patient would inhale the hyperpolarized xenon gas which would be dissolved in the blood and allowed to flow into the body and brain .
The exhaled xenon gas would then be collected and its MRI signal would be detected .
Used in combination with a target - specific xenon biomolecular sensor , we should be able to study the gas - exchange in the lung and detect cancerous cells at their earliest stage of development . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Amazon.com said on Thursday that digital books ordered for use on its Kindle electronic reader can now be read on personal computers .
Amazon will provide a software application -- available next month as a free download -- that can convert Kindle books to PC - readable ones .
The move follows the launch this week of a competing device , the Nook , from bookseller Barnes & Noble that sports a similar function .
The latest e-reader from Sony Corp is also compatible with PCs .
Amazon ’s Kindle has enjoyed dominant market share in the still - nascent electronic reader market , but analysts say increasing functionality is key to maintaining that top ranking .
Books ordered through Amazon ’s online store can be read on the Kindle , as well as on Apple Inc ’s iPhone and iPod Touch .
The company added that owning a Kindle was not required to access Amazon ’s digital bookstore , which includes more than 350,000 books .
Larry O'Brien talks to Grady Booch about the 15th anniversary of Design Patterns , the wicked problems of developing in the multicore era , what programming languages he 's using now , and the best coffee .

Larry O'Brien :
The year is 1994 .
Forrest Gump rules the box office , the Republicans take control of the legislature , and Britney Spears is just another Mouseketeer …
What is happening in the software development world ?
What are people talking about and struggling with ?
Grady : Well , in 1994 , the Web was just in its infancy ( see http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-11-n32.html for example ) .
There was none of the dynamic content we take for granted today , no meaningful search mechanisms , and very few companies had any idea how to use this new fangled thing .
Netscape had just been founded , OS / 2 was released , Yahoo was then founded , Microsoft had just released Windows 3.11 , PHP had its start , the Intel 486 was still very much in force , the object - oriented method wars were just coming to a head ( we hired Jim Rumbaugh in late 1994 , and Ivar [ Jacobson ] came in the next year ) .
People were struggling with adopting object - oriented languages , most notably C++ ( though Ada was still in play ) and there was a noticeable knee in the curve of software complexity .
Waterfall vs. iterative methods was very much a strong topic of debate .
My personal computer at the time , by the way , was a PowerMac 8100 with a whopping 16 Mb main memory .
In all , it was a really fun time to be in software , for so much was in motion and there was so much possibility .
Not unlike , I should add , today .
Although we are in a period of economic scarcity , this is still very much a time of software abundance , with still so much in motion and still so much possibility .
Larry : Your book Object - Oriented Design with Applications had already gone through two editions , Ivar Jacobson ’s use - case book had come out , Rumbaugh ’s book had been out : A lot of people were talking about analysis and design .
What did Design Patterns bring to the table that caused it to be received so well ?
Grady : I have always described the history of software development as one of growing levels of abstraction , which we see manifest in our languages , our methods , our processes , our platforms .
Design patterns were the next ( now obvious ) steps along that path .
Kent Beck and I had sponsored a retreat in the summer of 1993 to bring together folks interested in this space ( this was the genesis of the Hillside Group ) and I knew then that being able to name societies of classes that collaborated was the Right Thing .
Larry :
You initially became well known from your work with Ada , a language that people do n’t discuss much today .
Are there aspects of that language or programming system that you wish had a higher profile today ?
Grady :
You may be surprised to know that Ada is still alive ; I 'm actually engaged on a satellite project that 's producing about a half million lines of new Ada ( which is not uncommon for such satellite systems ) .
In retrospect , Ada was ahead of its time , with packaging , generics , exception handling , and its tasking mechanisms — elements that continue to be show up in contemporary practices .
Given that the frequency scaling wars are over , we see the shift to multicore ... and therein I think that Ada 's tasking mechanisms are still very germane .
Larry :
When comparing OODwA or Design Patterns / GoF with today ’s design discussions , one thing that jumps out is that today there ’s little discussion of class and component structures and relationships , while there ’s a great emphasis on dynamic structures and behaviors .
Is this a change in practice ( e.g. , OOP is dying out and people are moving towards functional approaches ) or just a change in dialogue ( e.g. , OOP and patterns are so ingrained now that they need n’t be emphasized ) ?
Grady : I think the change you see is because the notion of a class as a fundamental abstraction is so fully a part of the DNA of contemporary development that it 's just taken for granted .
Remember , when those works came out , the idea of an object as an abstraction was a profoundly disturbing and startling idea to many .
However , this is not to say that these kinds of abstractions are any easier today , for virtually all the dominant industrial programming languages have classes at their core ( including scripting languages such as Ruby , PHP , and JavaScript ) .
The fundaments of building crisp abstractions with clear separations of concern and a balanced distribution of responsibilities is as much an issue today as it was then .
Larry :
You began advocating a “ 4+1 ” view of architecture before the Web became the dominant issue in software development that it is today .
For those developing for the Web , who know that they ’re going to be dealing with JavaScript , AJAX , and browser compatibility and who know that they will have a relatively slow transport layer , a server - side domain component , a back - end database , etc. , are n’t the architectural elements of such a system established ?
Grady :
The technology elements of their platform are established , but not their architecture .
This is not unlike saying that an artist who works in clay has their domain fully architected just as much as an artist who works in oils .
One of the myths that Philippe Kruchen notes ( and btw , it was he who coined the 4+1 model view , not me ) is that “ my technology x ” is my architecture .
What you say is mostly true about developing in the domain of the Web , but there 's a whole lot of architecture yet to be done ....
Those things you mention are just the context within which one architects .
In fact , this is a good thing .
An artist or a writer faced with a completely blank slate is often less innovative then one who is somehow constrained .
It just so happens that the Web has come together so serendipitously that we have a veritable rich primordial soup of stuff from which new life forms are still appearing .
Larry :
So even when you 're using a framework like Spring or ASP .
NET MVC or Rails , it 's still important to address architecture ?
What sorts of architectural questions do these " opinionated " frameworks leave open ?
Grady :
Those things are just part of the plumbing ... one still has architectural decisions to make about things such as what the solution domain model is , the texture of the business rules that change the state of that model , and cross cutting concerns such as security and parallelism .
Larry :
One view holds that diagrams should be very semantically meaningful : that one ought to be able to look at , say , whether a diamond is filled and know something very precise about the code .
Another view holds that diagrams ought to be low - fidelity and disposable ( boxes and arrows on a napkin ) , because it ’s the textual codebase that has the final say .
What ’s your view ?
Grady : I just spoke of this very notion at the Models 2009 conference .
When Jim , Ivar , and I began our journey that became manifest in the UML , we never intended it to become a programming language .
I think that there 's a fairly narrow domain for which model - driven development makes sense ( and Ericsson is the classic example of value , for they use the UML deeply in the creation of all their cell base station equipment ) but that we should return to the roots of the UML , which was to be a language for visualizing , specifying , constructing , and documenting the artifacts of a software - intensive system — in short , a graphical language to help reason about the design of a system as it unfolds .
Most diagrams should be thrown away , but there are a few that should be preserved , and in all , one should only use a graphical notation for those things that cannot easily be reasoned about in code .
As I 've also often said , the code is the truth , but it is not the whole truth , and there are things such as rationale , cross-cutting concerns , and patterns that cannot easily be recovered or seen from code ....
These are the things for which a graphical notation adds value , and any such notation should be used only if it has predictive power or reasoning power ( meaning , you can ask questions about it ) .
Larry :
The idea of a repository that can express a programmatic idea in a diagram or in compilable text is an old idea : Rational was working on it more than a decade ago .
This year has seen some public showings of Charles Simonyi ’s Intentional Workbench , which comes at the idea from a different angle .
Have you seen that product and have a reaction to it ?
Grady : Yes ( I have seen the product ) and yes ( I have a reaction to it ) .
:-)
Actually , I 've interacted with Charles since he formed Intentional ( and as an aside , conducted an oral history of Charles for the Computer History Museum ) .
I think he 's got some innovative ideas .
Larry : Joel Spolsky said :
“ Sometimes smart thinkers just do n't know when to stop , and they create these absurd , all - encompassing , high - level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine , but do n't actually mean anything at all .
These are the people I call Architecture Astronauts .
It 's very hard to get them to write code or design programs , because they wo n't stop thinking about Architecture . ”
He also said :
“ Sometimes , you ’re on a team , and you ’re busy banging out the code , and somebody comes up to your desk , coffee mug in hand , and starts rattling on …And your eyes are swimming , and you have no friggin ’ idea what this frigtard is talking about , …. and it ’s going to crash like crazy and you ’re going to get paged at night to come in and try to figure it out because he ’ll be at some goddamn “ Design Patterns ” meetup . ”
Spolsky seems to represent a real constituency that is not just dismissive but outright hostile to software development approaches that are not code - centric .
What do you say to people who are skeptical about the value of work products that do n’t compile ?
Grady :
You may be surprised to hear that I 'm firmly in Joel 's camp .
The most important artifact any development team produces is raw , running , naked code .
Everything else is secondary or tertiary .
However , that is not to say that these other things are inconsequential .
Rather , our models , our processes , our design patterns help one to build the right thing at the right time for the right stakeholders .
Yet , while code is king , one must realize that it is also a servant , for it in the end must serve some constituency , deliver some measurable value .
Just as I loathe architecture astronauts — people who have no skin in the game , people who are so divorced from the reality of executables that they melt in the sight of a line of code — I also loathe code bigots who are so blinded by their own prowess and tools that they lose sight of why or for whom they are toiling .
Design for design 's sake is meaningless ; code for code 's sake may be fun but it is also meaningless .
Recognize also that there are very real tensions between doing the right thing in the short term and doing the right thing for the long term .
Code centricity tends to draw you to the former ; architectual centricity tends to draw you to the latter , and honestly , neither pole is correct , but rather it is the dance between the two for which a particular team with a specific culture working in a given domain must find balance .
Larry :
How big a deal for software development is the manycore era ?
Will it change the way we approach architecture and design ?
Grady : I 've said this before often as well : the average developer is not well - prepared to develop concurrent , distributed , secure software .
These are all really wicked problems .
Our languages have few really good primitives for dealing with intimate concurrency such as multicore processors demand , and thus we 've got a bit of a conundrum .
My take is that we need advances in languages , in compilers , in patterns ( such as Intel 's concurrency patterns ) and platforms ( such as Apple 's Grand Central Dispatch ) to raise the level of abstraction .
Larry :
What programming languages and technologies are you enjoying right now ?
Grady :
Yes , I still program , and I use mainly Java and PHP .
Eclipse is my development platform of choice .
Larry :
You do n’t really think that Maui coffee comes anywhere near approaching the subtle splendor of 100 % Kona coffee , do you ?
Grady :
It 's not even close ; I am addicted to Kona coffee .
We 're wondering what 's so magical about Apple 's Magic Mouse ... so we 're going to look inside to find out !

Going after McCaughey
I just finished moderating DL21C 's debate in Manhattan between Anthony Weiner and Betsy McCaughey ( of which , I hope , video soon ) , and could n't help being struck by the difference in the reception to her 1994 New Republic article , which won her a National Magazine Award , despite White House fury , and the frontal assault on her this year .
Weiner devoted about a third of his opening statement to a frontal assault on McCaughey , who he said represented the worst of the health care debate .
As she frowned nearby , and to occasional gasps and shouts of " rude man " from her supporters in the audience , he cited the headline of today 's New Republic takedown : " The Never - Ending Lunacy of Betsy McCaughey " ; he cited her " pants on fire " rating from Politifact ; he told her the thick binder she was holding was the " wrong bill " -- or at least an out - of - date version of the House bill ; he noted that her think tank takes money from PhRMA ; and he later said he felt like he was debating a " pyromaniac in a straw man factory . "
He seemed to be echoing the structure of the last such frontal attack on McCaughey : economist Henry Aaron 's appearance on a panel with her at which he ran " through PowerPoint slides that detail -- quote by excruciating quote -- McCaughey 's reputation as among the most irresponsible , dishonest , and destructive players on the public stage . "
Some of McCaughey 's claims have been substantially debunked , or do n't match up with the current legislation .
Others are broader conservative health care critiques .
In either case , she 's nowhere near the player she was in 1994 -- in part perhaps because she 's seen as a partisan , not an honest broker , and that 's due in no small part to the relentless , effective assault from the left , a refighting of the last war that ensures they wo n't lose that battle , at least .
One element of the debate 's substance also interested me : McCaughey made the case that American health care spending is not excessive , and that Americans spend more because we " earn more " and want more and better health care .
It 's a case the organized health industry would n't dare make for itself in the face of demands from Congress that it cut costs , and one that leads her to argue that the best way to deal with what she sees as the only crisis -- a number of uninsured she puts a bit over 10 million -- is simply to spend $ 500 billion insuring them .
McCaughey also allowed that one form of government intervention is positive :
The practice of refusing to reimburse hospitals for treating infections contracted in the hospital , which is the focus of the group she now heads .

Grandparents as Caregivers
The Washington Post ran an interesting article on June 23 , 2009 about a great - grandmother caring for her 7 - year old great - granddaughter who is autistic , virtually blind , and is “ medically fragile . ”
Instead of enjoying her golden years , she ’s busy changing diapers for this child as well as picking up toys and spilled cereal .
When distressed , the child bites , furies , and flails .
What a heart - breaking story .
You can read the whole story at the Washington Post Web site .
Look at these statistics in the article :
Number of children in the care of their grandparents : 2.5 million
Number of grandparents raising children : 2.5 million Married grandparents raising children : 70 percent Percent of grandparent caregivers who are raising children 5 to 17 with disabilities : 11.8 percent Grandparents who are caregivers and have their own disabilities : 30 percent Grandparents who are caregivers over age 60 and have disabilities : 40 percent
If you ’re a grandparent like me and not in any of the above categories , how fortunate we are .
( Enjoy pictures of my Facebook friends Tiz Wheeler Wemyss in England and Ken Klemm in Pennsylvania who are not “ caregivers , ” but wonderful , loving “ care givers ” ) .
Can you imagine being over 60 and not in the best of health being a primary caregiver ?
40 percent fall in that category .
How difficult it must be .
My heart goes out to those brave individuals .
Any of us could become a caregiver in an instant .
Are you ready ?

" Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good .
Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts , shooting bows and guns , and riding horses .

There is timing in the whole life of the warrior , in his thriving and declining , in his harmony and discord .
Similarly , there is timing in the Way of the merchant , in the rise and fall of capital .

You must be able to discern this .
In strategy there are various timing considerations .
From the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing , and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing , first seeing the distance timing and the background timing .
This is the main thing in strategy .
It is especially important to know the background timing , otherwise your strategy will become uncertain . "
Hilbert Curve Coffee Table Fractal Furniture
One day I got a bee in my bonnet to make some fractal furniture with copper pipe .
The Hilbert Curve was the obvious first choice .
At the time , I 'd only made one other piece of furniture out of copper pipe , and was showing it off at the Fat Man & Circuit Girl show .
They asked me what I was going to do next .
" A Hilbert Curve coffee table , " I blurted , and suddenly I was committed , though I had no idea if I could actually make it work .
How small can I make the curves ?
How small can I make the curves ?
So I got busy making sketches , trying to figure out if this was even possible .
I did n't know much about Hilbert curves , but of course Wikipedia does .
It still took me some time to get a good grasp of what 's going on and how the different fractal levels relate to each other .

The 1/2 inch elbow is the smallest " pixel " size .

At PDX Dorkbot I started cutting pipe , and attempting to lay out & put together the first Hilbert curve section .
I had hoped to get finer detail , but the half inch elbow fittings gave me a hard constraint on the size .

I decided to make it a 2x3 layout , with different fractal levels in a checkerboard pattern .
Then I got to work fitting the pieces together , fluxing & soldering the level 3 sections , then partially assembling it to get the level 2 sections right .
finally assembled .
finally assembled .
Once the top was figured out , it was time to build a two - level jig to make a shelf ( a Moore curve , also space - filling like a Hilbert curve ) .
Of course there are more details about working with copper pipe , doing the assembly ,
and putting it in a show at ON Gallery
And it turns out that teeny little orange spiders just love copper pipe !
The Twins overcame a seven - game gap in the final month , went 17 - 4 to pull even on the final weekend and won their fifth division title in eight years .
" We just feel like we have nothing to lose , man , " outfielder Denard Span said .
Both teams had chance after chance to end it earlier , and each club scored in the 10th .
Casilla was thrown out at the plate to end that inning by left fielder Ryan Raburn after tagging up .
The Tigers thought they 'd taken the lead in the 12th .
But with the bases loaded , plate umpire Randy Marsh ruled that Brandon Inge was not hit by a pitch by Bobby Keppel .
The replay appeared to show the pitch grazing Inge 's billowing uniform .
" I did not have the ball hitting him .
We looked at replays , too , and the replays we 've looked at , to be honest with you , were inconclusive , " said Marsh , the crew chief .
Said Inge : " No matter what we did , it seems like it was n't meant to be .
This is the best game , by far , that I 've ever played in no matter the outcome . "
It was the first AL tiebreaker to go to extra innings , making up for Minnesota 's disappointment last year when it lost 1 - 0 in Chicago to the White Sox in an AL Central tiebreaker .
Had the Twins lost , it would 've been the final baseball game at the Metrodome .
Instead , the Twins get the Yankees -- New York was 7 - 0 against Minnesota this season .
" We 're not afraid .
I can guarantee you that , " Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said .
Said Yankees manager Joe Girardi : " We 're not going to have to face questions like ' Can you beat them ? ' like we 've had to answer during the course of the year .
Once the playoffs start though , it 's a new series and we know the importance of each game .
You can pretty much throw everything else out the window . "
A day after Brett Favre and the Minnesota Vikings beat the Green Bay Packers at the Dome -- " Monday Night Football " is what delayed this tiebreaker for a day -- the Twins pulled off a Tuesday Night Frenzy .
Gardenhire and Leyland made so many moves for defense and relief that the lineups and pitching staffs were depleted by the end .
Tigers reliever Fernando Rodney ( 2 - 5 ) worked his longest appearance of the season , getting the last two outs of the ninth .
But he did n't have enough to get out of the 12th .
The Twins rushed out of the dugout in celebration even before Gomez reached the plate , and their comeback from a seven - game gap with 20 to play was complete .
Joe Mauer , who heard thunderous " M - V - P ! " chants from the largest regular - season baseball crowd in Metrodome history throughout the game , led his team on a sprint around the warning track as they slapped hands with fans in the first rows .
" One of the best games I 'll ever play in , " Mauer said .
Keppel , Minnesota 's eighth pitcher , loaded the bases with one out in the 12th .
After the non-call on Inge , second baseman Nick Punto then scooped Inge 's grounder and fired home in time to get the runner on the force .
Then Keppel struck out Gerald Laird to squelch that rally .
Twins closer Joe Nathan found trouble in the ninth when consecutive singles put runners at the corners , but he got a strikeout and a line - drive double play to end that threat .
The four - time All - Star gave two huge pumps of his right arm as he spun to thank his defense and run to the dugout , preserving the tie .
Inge 's two - out double in the 10th gave the Tigers a 5 - 4 lead , but Michael Cuddyer sliced a triple past Raburn in left and scored on Matt Tolbert 's bouncing single through the middle in the bottom of the inning .
On the potential winning sacrifice fly , though , Casilla strayed a bit too far from third and was thrown out by Raburn trying to score to end the inning .
The split - second Casilla needed to retouch the base might have cost him the run .
He more than made up for that mistake later .
According to sports researcher STATS LLC , only three teams since 1901 have blown a three - game lead in the standings with four games left .
The Houston Astros lost three straight games to Los Angeles in 1980 , but they recovered to defeat the Dodgers in a tiebreaker game for the NL West .
Milwaukee lost three in a row to Baltimore in 1982 to force a tie , but beat the Orioles in the final regular season game to win the AL East .
After splitting four in Detroit last week -- a loss in the series finale Thursday would 've given the division to the Tigers -- the Twins came home for the final scheduled series in the bubble needing a sweep of the Kansas City Royals and did just that .
So with 54,088 fans in attendance , the place was erupting with noise and excitement .
The chants for Mauer , who wrapped up his third batting title , were deafening .
Leyland even told his players before the game to think of the loudest experience of their life and multiply it by four to anticipate the decibel level for this game .
Dome ball came in handy again , on a day when the city was drenched by cold rain .
Rookie starter Rick Porcello pitched well beyond his 20 years for the Tigers , and Miguel Cabrera made up for a miserable weekend -- on and off the field -- with a two - run homer against Scott Baker in the third inning that made it 3 - 0 .
The crowd chanted " al - co - ho - lic " right before Cabrera went deep , a rude reference to the first baseman 's fight with his wife after he came home late and drunk .
The Twins crept back , though , and Orlando Cabrera 's two - run homer in the seventh gave them a brief lead that Magglio Ordonez ended with his leadoff homer in the eighth .
" We were dead and buried a couple times , and our team just kept coming back , " Twins general manager Bill Smith said .
Game notes
This was the ninth tiebreaker game in baseball history , and the third straight year with a 163rd game .
Only two of them went to extra innings .
...
Seven members of the Metrodome 's cleaning and maintenance crews were honored on the mound before the game for the work of those groups in converting the field back and forth from baseball to football in light of Monday 's Packers - Vikings game .

Our decision to purchase and build in Costa Rica was largely based on Gina Briguglio and her knowledge of Costa Rican real estate , as well as Mar Vista .
As a Realtor , I love to look at real estate everywhere I go , even on vacation .
We did n't go to Costa Rica with the intent of purchasing property .
Talking to and working with a Realtor who has extensive experience in both the U.S. and Costa Rica made all the difference .
Gina understood every concern and provided resources to address each one .
Purchasing property outside the U.S. seemed daunting but Gina helped us to make it a safe and comfortable process .
We 're very happy clients !

It became apparent for us right away that Mar Vista was going to be a great option .
We were really pleasantly surprised by the development and the various options for us inside the development .
We did look at multiple developments before coming back to Mar Vista .
We worked with Gina throughout the process of selecting a lot upon which to build .
Gina is clearly an experienced real estate professional .
She was informative , extremely even keeled in her demeanor and tremendously helpful in working with us .
Above other things , I valued Gina ’s no nonsense and transparent approach to all the considerations in our purchase decision .
My wife , two of our children and I , are very excited about moving into our new home in Mar Vista this September .

What a fantastic group of people .
The attention to detail and top notch customer service sets CRREC above their competitors .
Highly recommended !
Andy Hofsteader
I can't imagine going anywhere else for real estate in Costa Rica .
The people of CRREC are world - class but most importantly honest .

To the annals of global warming lunacy , add this gem from New Zealand : According to a parliamentary committee , Kiwis should accept lower standards of living to protect the national image abroad .
The findings of the " Emissions Trading Review Committee " are n't binding , but they tell much about how deep today 's green religion runs .
New Zealand has a nominally conservative government run by Prime Minister John Key .
But even Mr. Key wo n't consider completely disavowing environmental taxes in the form of cap - and - trade — he just wants ...
On the same day Microsoft unloaded a record - breaking 34 fixes , eight of which were listed as critical , Adobe has made a similar gargantuan patch offering .
The company , best known for its Reader and Acrobat software , yesterday fixed a total of 29 vulnerabilities , including one labeled critical .
That software covered by the fixes includes version 9.1.3 of both Acrobat and Reader , version 8.1.6 of Acrobat for Windows , Mac , and Unix , and version 7.1.3 of Acrobat and Reader for Windows and Mac .
Adobe encourages everyone using its programs to download the update , warning users that if they fail to do so the vulnerabilities could lead to application crashes .
In the worst case scenario , the holes could even allow a remote hacker to take control of a computer .
Patch Corrals " Protux " Trojan Horse
Adobe encourages all users of its programs to update to Adobe Reader 9.2 .
Users of this program whose systems can't make the jump to 9.2 are encouraged to seek out a special version called Adobe Reader 8.1.7 or 7.1.4 .
Acrobat users should try to get their hands on 9.2 , or at the very least version 8.1.7 or 7.1.4 .
The most concerning of the vulnerabilities is one that security firm Trend Micro says has already been exploited by hackers .
According to Trend Micro , a vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows 98 , ME , NT , 2000 , XP , and Server 2003 has already allowed a hacker to use a Trojan horse via PDF file to upload malicious JavaScript .
Called " Protux , " the Trojan has been used in the past to attack users of Microsoft 's Office suite .
( Source : computerworld.com )
" Critical bugs , " Says Security Expert
Vulnerability management company nCircle is right behind Adobe in recommending users update their systems immediately .
" All users of Adobe Reader or Acrobat will need to update their software with today 's release because these updates include fixes for the most critical kind of bugs , " said nCircle 's director of security operations , Andrew Storms .
( Source : cnet.com )
A total of four of the bugs addressed by Adobe in the update are exploitable , meaning the Trojan issue might not even be the gravest problem facing Acrobat and Reader users .
According to Computerworld , thus far Adobe has admitted that 13 of the 29 patches " could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution , " meaning a hacker could take over your system .
Royal Mail has lost a crucial contract with its second largest customer , the online retailer Amazon , as a wave of strikes threaten parcel deliveries in the busy pre-Christmas sales period .
The news comes on the eve of a national strike announcement by the Communication Workers Union that is likely to bring the simmering industrial dispute to the boil and further disrupt deliveries across the country .
CWU members are angry about the Royal Mail 's handling of its modernisation programme and are expected to escalate their programme of local strikes in a dispute they say is about consultation over changes to working practices .
But a backlog of undelivered mail has worried customers , particularly small businesses and internet retailers who argue that the unpredictable nature of the strikes has led to a collapse in reliability .
The loss of this business will be a severe blow to Royal Mail , which was relying on the growth of online shopping to compensate for the decline of its letters business due to rising email use .
Customers of eBay have already been particularly vociferous , claiming the strikes are causing damage to small businesses that suffer negative feedback and lose their online reliability ratings .
Now the Guardian has learned that Amazon.co.uk has cancelled its long - term contract to use the Royal Mail for parcels over 500 grams and will use a rival service , Home Delivery Network ( HDN ) , which also delivers for Tesco and Argos .
HDN declined to comment directly , citing commercial confidentiality , but the Amazon contract is thought to be worth at least £ 25 m and is one of the first times a major sender of medium - sized parcels has chosen to defect from the Royal Mail in this way .
Until now , the state - owned operator has won the bulk of new internet business .
HDN 's chief executive , Brian Gaunt , said he expected others to follow suit once the national strike ballot was passed .
" We are seeing a number of our customers preparing to start marketing their deliveries as free of Royal Mail risk , " he added .
Two years ago Royal Mail lost a smaller Amazon contract worth £ 8 m to deliver second class parcels during the last national strike , but fought hard to win the business back , claiming improved industrial relations .
Losing the new , bigger contract will exacerbate the operator 's financial woes , which lay behind its need to cut staff , but more worryingly sends a dangerous signal to other suppliers about Amazon 's faith in the network during the crisis .
Last night the CWU said it regretted disruption caused by the strikes , but added : " We are very concerned that if we do n't get this right now , there will be a lot more disruption to customer services in future . "
It blames the way private competition has been allowed to " cherry pick " profitable parts of the postal market and fears more damage will be done in future : " The scale of change planned … is frightening . "
Royal Mail declined to comment .
Even if private sector rivals do step in to take some of the contracts , it is unlikely to prevent major disruption .
HDN says it would be unlikely to get enough resources in place at short notice to compensate .
More importantly , there is very little alternative for delivery of letters , with private operators such as TNT and DHL using Royal Mail for crucial parts of their delivery infrastructure .
The last time CWU members called a national strike in 2007 , it was solved when Royal Mail managers agreed to series of pay deals and also offered to talk further about consulting the union on changes .
Complaints against Royal Mail
Local strikes have been spreading across the country , largely unreported .
This week alone , 24 - hour stoppages are scheduled in locations including Bristol , Kilmarnock , London , Carlisle , Coventry , Chelmsford , Leeds , Nottingham , Swindon and Warrington .
There have been reports of mountains of undelivered mail in sorting offices and claims that postal workers are not waiting to see if customers are in before leaving cards asking them to pick parcels up from the sorting office .
The Royal Mail disputes some of the claims , but has used managers to try to shift the backlog , exacerbating tensions .
The CWU is not expected to give details of its strike plans , but they are likely to involve rolling action , targeting different parts of the chain on different days , causing maximum disruption without too much loss of pay .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) thinks the tea party movement has run its course -- and predicts that the GOP leadership on the Hill will increasingly distance themselves from the " crazies . "
Frank speaking on HLN's Joy Behar Show :
There are people on the right who are upset about the culture .
They are upset that gay people are n't being shunned .
They are upset that women are n't enjoying the right to make decisions about themselves ...
So , I think that sort of spills over ...
Some of the wiser conservatives ...
I think they thought they were benefiting from all those crazies going out and venting .
I think they realized they got in the way of the rational arguments ...
So , I think you 'll still see some of the negativity -- but it wo n't be as supported by the Republican apparatus .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks rallied near midday Monday , with the Dow topping 9900 for the first time in more than a year , as investors showed optimism about the first big wave of quarterly results due out this week .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) rose 40 points , or 0.4 % , more than 2 - 1/ 2 hours into the session , rising as high as 9931.82 .
The S&P 500 ( SPX ) index gained 6 points , or 0.6 % , and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) climbed 10 points , or 0.5 % .
The Dow is moving closer to 10,000 , a key psychological level that could trigger a more aggressive wave of buying -- or a big selloff .
The Dow last crossed 10,000 on Oct. 7 , 2008 , when it briefly touched 10,124.03 .
The Dow last closed above 10,000 on Oct. 3 , 2008 , when it ended at 10,325.38 .
Analysts say it could hit that point later this week , depending on how the third - quarter reporting period goes .
Results :
This week brings results from a number of market - moving companies , including Dow components Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) , Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) and General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) .
Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , Nokia ( NOK ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) are among the other big names due to report .
Dow component Alcoa ( AA , Fortune 500 ) started things off on a positive note last week , reporting earnings and revenue that were better than expected .
The aluminum maker 's strong revenue results were especially notable , with investors focused on possible revenue growth after a quarter of little to none .
In the second quarter , there was little topline growth , and any improvement in earnings was driven mostly by cost cutting .
That trend could continue in the third quarter , but if Alcoa is an indication , some sectors and companies may see improvement .
Year - over - year profits are expected to have fallen more than 20 % from the third quarter of 2008 .
World markets : Global markets were mixed .
In Europe , London 's FTSE 100 , France 's CAC 40 and Germany 's DAX all fell 1.1 % .
Asian markets ended lower , with the Hong Kong Hang Seng down 0.9 % .
The Japanese Nikkei was closed for a holiday .
Currency and commodities :
The dollar fell versus the euro and the yen .
U.S. light crude oil for November delivery rose $ 1.47 to $ 73.24 a barrel .
COMEX gold for December delivery rose $ 8.60 to $ 1,057.20 an ounce , the third straight record high for the precious metal .
Bonds : Treasury prices tumbled , raising the yield on the 10 - year note to 3.38 % from 3.30 % late Friday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
PARIS 
The choice of Barack Obama on Friday as the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize , less than nine months into his eventful presidency , was an unexpected honor that elicited praise and puzzlement around the globe .
Normally the prize has been presented , even controversially , for accomplishment .
This prize , to a 48 - year - old freshman president , for “ extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples , ” seemed a kind of prayer and encouragement by the Nobel committee for future endeavor and more consensual American leadership .
But the prize quickly loomed as a potential political liability  perhaps more burden than glory  for Mr. Obama .
Republicans contended that he had won more for his star power and oratorical skills than for his actual achievements , and even some Democrats privately questioned whether he deserved it .
The Nobel committee ’s embrace of Mr. Obama was viewed as a rejection of the unpopular tenure , in Europe especially , of his predecessor , George W. Bush .
Tourists from all over China had flocked to the Tian ' anmen Square , where the grand celebrations were held Thursday to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China , since it was reopened to tourists Friday .

A television network cynically exploits a deranged former anchor 's ravings and revelations about the news media for its own profit .
Kenneth Chisholm < kchishol@mnsi.net > and Brian McInnis
In the 1970s , terrorist violence is the stuff of networks ' nightly news programming and the corporate structure of the UBS Television Network is changing .
Meanwhile , Howard Beale , the aging UBS news anchor , has lost his once strong ratings share and so the network fires him .
Beale reacts in an unexpected way .
We then see how this affects the fortunes of Beale , his coworkers ( Max Schumacher and Diana Christensen ) , and the network .
Bruce Janson < bruce@cs.su.oz.au >
The Union Broadcasting System ( UBS ) is the floundering fourth place American network of only four .
Howard Beale , the once popular news anchor for UBS , has seen his own declining fortunes of late .
Personal problems have led to his performance slipping , which in turn has led to declining ratings .
The network has fired him , effective in two weeks , the news given to him by the head of the network 's news division and his long time friend , Max Schumacher .
On his first broadcast following receiving this news , Beale announces on air that he will blow out his brains on the telecast in one week 's time , and the reason for doing so .
The network brass , incensed , pulls him off effective immediately , but Howard , stating he was drunk at the time over the news of his firing , pleads for one final telecast so that he can exit from news broadcasting with dignity .
When on the broadcast Howard instead speaks candidly , emotionally and profanely about what he is feeling , Diana Christensen , the relatively new and ambitious vice - president in charge of programming , thinks that Howard is the panacea to all the network 's rating problems as Howard is only stating what the public is feeling .
She is interested in counter - establishment programming .
With Max 's blessing , she wants to hijack from the news division a television news show featuring Howard .
Through this process , Diana tries to convince network brass to do what she wants not only with Howard 's show but other counter - establishment programming , Max wants to preserve his reputation as a news man with integrity , and Howard tries to convince Max and Diana that he is imbued with messages from higher powers , which is making him seem insane to Max ( who cares ) and Diana ( who cares only if his rantings from these higher powers increase ratings ) .
Despite their differences in views , Max and Diana begin a September - May romance , which plays on Max 's conscience as a faithful married man for twenty - five years and which Diana always refers to , as she does everything in life , in terms of a television show plot outline .
Huggo
In this lauded satire , veteran news anchorman Howard Beale discovers that he 's being put out to pasture , and he 's none too happy about it .
After threatening to shoot himself on live television , instead he launches into an angry televised rant , which turns out to be a huge ratings boost for the UBS network .
This stunt allows ambitious producer Diana Christensen to develop even more outrageous programming , a concept that she takes to unsettling extremes .
Jwelch5742
Howard Beale is an aging TV anchorman for UBS who is fired , effective in two weeks , after his ratings have been steadily deteriorating .
He reacts to this by sensationally announcing on live television his intention to commit suicide on air .
In doing so , Beale becomes a major TV icon and one of the most valuable assets to the Communications Corporation of America ( CCA ) , the company that is gradually taking control of UBS .
As a result he is given his own show as ' the mad prophet of the air - waves ' .
He appears live on television every week - day evening to tell the real truth to the people of America .
The program is a huge success but Beale uses his power to make startling revelations about CCA , leaving the company executives with a serious problem .

A man accused of strangling a woman recorded the rough area of where he buried her body in the memory of his car 's sat - nav system , a jury was told .
Lukasz Reszpondek , 30 , had been seeing Ermatati " Tati " Rodgers , 41 , Mold Crown Court heard .
Mr Reszpondek , who denies murder , said she died of natural causes and he had buried her near Wrexham in a panic .
But the prosecution told the jury that " quite simply " innocent people did not bury bodies .
The case continues .
Mr Reszpondek , a Polish national and married man , has admitted preventing Ms Rodgers ' " lawful and decent burial " .
At the opening of the trial , the jury was told he had buried her but tried to dig her body up again as police closed in on him .
But he could not recover the body and went to the police .
Ms Rodgers was missing for 14 months before her body was eventually found by police in March 2009 .
Prosecuting barrister Michael Chambers QC said Mr Reszpondek killed Ms Rodgers , who was originally from Indonesia , on the day he returned early from Poland by car without his family on 4 January , 2008 .
He said he had lost his temper and strangled her " against a background of the emotional and conflicting demands of the eternal triangle of a wife and another woman " .
The defendant watched the police looking for the body from the top of a nearby slag heap , hiding in bushes , wearing camouflage clothing and using binoculars
Michael Chambers QC , prosecuting
He then set about disposing of the body and might well have got away with it if he had not made certain fundamental errors , the prosecutor claimed .
Quite simply , innocent people do not bury bodies , Mr Chambers told the jury .
Mr Reszpondek and Ms Rodgers met in the summer of 2004 when they both worked together at a dairy at Marchwiel near Wrexham .
They formed a close relationship which continued after the defendant 's wife came over from Poland to join him in Wrexham .
At Christmas 2007 the defendant - a father of two - returned to Poland .
His family travelled by plane but he went separately by car .
He returned to Wrexham on 4 January , 2008 and took Ms Rodgers to his house in Rhostyllen after a 900 - mile car journey .
It was there that he killed her , said the prosecutor .
In police interview , Mr Reszpondek claimed he had gone upstairs to take a shower and had come back down to discover her collapsed and dead .
He claimed that he had buried the body because he had panicked , the court heard .
Ermatati Rodgers , aged 41 , went missing in January 2008
The following day he bought a spade , a large suitcase and other items which he used to help him bury the body .
He used his credit card , which police were able to trace .
He then recorded the approximate area of the burial site in the memory of his car satellite navigation system and named it " Tt " , the court was told .
Police surveillance found he kept returning to that area and when they began digging in the surrounding fields looking for her body , " the defendant made the error of taking the bait " , said Mr Chambers .
" The defendant watched the police looking for the body from the top of a nearby slag heap , hiding in bushes , wearing camouflage clothing and using binoculars , " he said .
" What he did not know was that the police were watching him , watching them . "
Bruising By Sunday afternoon , 22 March , the police digging was getting close to the actual field which contained the body , Mr Chambers told the jury .
" The defendant must have thought that on the Monday morning they were likely to move into the actual field and find the body , " he said .
" So on that Sunday night , he tried to move it .
" However it was more difficult that he anticipated so after about three hours he had to stop .
" It was only at that stage that he went to Wrexham police station .
" He gave the account that she had suddenly collapsed and died , he had panicked , and buried her . "
Home Office pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers conducted a post - mortem examination and he said that there was no sign of any natural causes which would have explained her sudden death .
But he did find bruising and a fractured thyroid cartilage consistent with strangulation .
Mr Chambers told the jury that police had found deleted " glamour photographs " of Ms Rodgers on his digital camera which included her in underwear and semi-naked poses .
That , he said , indicated the nature of their relationship .
He said that it could be inferred that the defendant lost his temper and strangled her in the " context of the emotional and conflicting demands of the eternal triangular relationship of wife and another woman " .
The trial , which is expected to last three weeks , continues .

It ’s a big week for LGBT issues in Washington this week .
As our colleague Richard Simon reports from Capitol Hill , the House today approved a long - debated bill that would strengthen the federal hate - crime law to cover violence against gays .
The measure , expected to come before the Senate within days , faced a veto threat from President George W. Bush , but enjoys the support of President Obama .
Today ’s action drew some complaints from Republicans because the measure , the Matthew Shepard Act , was attached to a defense bill .
Shepard was a gay college student whose killing in Wyoming 11 years ago galvanized the gay rights movement .
On Wednesday , the president announced that he planned to nominate David Huebner , general counsel of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , as ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa .
The Associated Press reported that , if confirmed by the Senate , Huebner would become the third openly gay ambassador in U.S. history .
This weekend Obama is scheduled to address the Human Rights Campaign , widely regarded as the nation ’s largest lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender civil rights organization .
This will be second time a sitting president has addressed the group .
President Clinton spoke to the organization in 1997 .
Obama ’s Saturday address will come the night before the National March for Equality , the climax of a three - day conference designed to further gay rights .
Thousands of gay rights supporters are expected to gather in Washington starting Friday for the march and other events .
Among the events Saturday : A workshop on tactics for repealing the " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " rule and the laying of a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery .
Workshops include " How to Organize on Campus " and " Adoption Option : Adoption Is an Option . "

Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says the number of conditions placed on the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam does not reflect negatively on the project .
The state 's coordinator - general forwarded the final report on the dam - with 1,200 conditions - to Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett .
Ms Bligh says no other Queensland project has had as many provisos attached and it reflects a determination to protect the environment .
" Twelve - hundred conditions on a project is very unusual , " she said .
" It demonstrates the length that the Coordinator - General has gone to ensure that not only can this dam can go ahead but it can go ahead in the most environmentally friendly way possible . "
Mr Garrett is expected to make a decision on the proposed south - east Queensland dam by the end of the year .
I ’ve had my Buck Knives Ground Combat fixed blade knives for a month and a half now , and wanted to give them a good workout before writing about them .
However , this is n’t always the case with many other writers and websites .
Many of these writers simply took the Buck press release , that was sent to them – I got it , too – and wrote their articles based on that piece of paper , without ever actually having the knives in - hand to test .
As an aside :
One big - name knife company – that I wo n’t mention by name – once had a new public relations guy , and it was pretty obvious that he was probably fresh out of college .
This young man knew just how to do public relations – by the book – not by actually having any hands - on experience .
His concept was that writers would do articles on new knives his company was producing , by him simply sending them out a press release and a couple of color slides .
Well , that did n’t happen – no one wrote any articles on those knives … it was only a few short months later , when this young man called me – almost begging me – to request some knife samples to write about – he was gone within six months .
To be clear on this , and I ’ve mentioned this before , I will never write an article , without having a gun , knife or whatever the product is , without actually having the product in my hands for testing .
If a company does n’t want to send me a sample to use and abuse – to a certain extent – then I ’m not interested in writing about their product .
It is not fair to our readers , to write - up a review , without actually having hands - on experience with a product .
When I started writing , which has been more than 28 years ago , I took the advice from my long - time friend , and brother in Christ , John Taffin , who is also a gun writer .
John told me “ never tell lies in your articles , so you do n’t have to remember those lies … ”
And , I ’ve lived by that advice .
I prefer to report the truth , the facts , my findings , and my opinions .
And , do n’t ask me what I had for breakfast yesterday – I can’t remember – see , what I ’m talking about ?
It ’s easier to report the truth than to make up lies .
Of course , readers can disagree on my findings in my articles , that ’s only natural for some folks .
That ’s okay , I simply report the facts , as I see them , and my opinions , based on a lifetime of being around firearms and cutlery .
I used to write for many of the printed gun , knife , and survival magazines – did so for a lot of years , but got sick and tired of spending more time – literally – begging to get paid , than I did testing and writing articles , so I stopped writing for all of them .
So now write for SurvivalBlog.com on a regular basis – as a paid freelance writer , and I enjoy the freedom that Survival Blog ’s Senior Editor , Jim Rawles , gives me to write about just about anything I want .
Back to Buck Knives , and their new Ground Combat fixed blade knives , I first heard about them last December , from my contact at Buck , and she thought they would be a great product for Survival Blog readers .
I waited anxiously , for the SHOT Show to be over , so I could get my samples – well , it was quite a few weeks after that , before they arrived at my door – although they were well worth the wait .
Buck does n’t come out with a lot of new knives annually .
But when they do , I ca n’t hardly wait for samples to reach me for testing .
Buck has been around for more than 100 years .
So they are well established as a premier knife making company .
On average , a knife has a life span of about three years on the market – that ’s not very long , to be sure , after that , the public wants something new and different .
However , if you look at some of the cutlery Buck is producing , it has been around 50 - 60 years – some longer than that , so Buck knows what they are doing .
The Specifications
Buck is producing two different versions of their Ground Combat fixed blade knives , one has a spear point , and the other a tanto point – quite a bit of difference between them .
The spear point blade is made out of 5160 carbon steel , where the tanto blade is made out of the same tough steel – very tough steel , to stand up to the rigors you ’d use this knife for – be it combat , survival , or just hunting .
Both knives have a 5.50 - inch blade – I would have loved a blade half an inch longer for hand - to - hand combat , but 5.50 - inches will have to suffice .
Overall length of both knives is right at 10.75 - inches , and the blade thickness is 0.200 inches .

Day in and Day out , we get to hear so many cases of the women - centric laws being misused .
Be it the 498A or the PWDVA ( Commonly known as the DV Act ) , everyone around alleges that these laws are being misused by the legal terrorists to terrorize their husbands and their families and using them as Free ATM Machines .
However , a critical study of this PWDVA law itself , makes me wonder ; is this law really being misused at all ?
Surprised ?
Let me give you some grounds to think …
The act is made to provide relief ONLY to the married women in a domestic setup .
It ’s one of the only laws that are entirely drafted and finalized by Lawyers , and not the legislation .
This seems to me like a lock designed by a team of thiefs ; and you expect that lock to be theft - proof .
This law is also famous as being a clumsy copy of the notorious VAWA law of the US , which is under a lot of criticism already .
Even otherwise this law is a direct offshoot from the US sponsorship towards breakage of Indian Family system .
This law defines Domestic Violence as anything that the wife feels as a cruelty towards her .
It might include the husband not giving her money for Kitty Party , or even he calling her step brother an idiot .
The law provides the wife to accuse anyone in the domestic relationship , including 2 months old baby , 89 years old granny or an 8 months pregnant sister - in - law .
And they ’ll all be required to run from pillar to post in the Indian Courts for as long as the Complainant or the Judge wants .
The complainant under this act can ask for any amount of money from the husband as compensation .
There ’s no limits to her imagination .
The complainant can also ask for a “ right to residence ” in any house that she might have stayed with her husband , ever .
In addition , she can also legally ask all the other residents in that house to evacuate it , on the pretext that she feels threatened by them .
The Complainant can file a case under this act at any time of her life , even after 12 years of her divorce from the accused ( ex - ) husband .
There is no penalty whatsoever for the complainant if the filed case is proven to be entirely false .
The Supreme Court of India has ruled very clearly that this Act is a Clumsily Drafted Law and so it should be scrapped .
This law is already declared as unconstitutional by the National Organization “ Save Indian Family ” in it ’s National - level Shimla Meet 2009 .
With all the above points about this particular act , do n’t you think the law was specifically designed by the Lawyers Collective for the exact purpose to destroy the very fabric of the country ?
Now that you know the background about this law , do you still think this law is being misused ?
I ’d say not at all .
The PWDVA , 2006 is actually Used properly for achieving it ’s exact objective .
The objective to destroy India and the Indian Family System , by destroying the very workforce of the country , i.e. the Men and their families .
So when a law is being used exactly as it was designed to be used , would you still call it a misuse ?
I ’d not .

Review : Beatles : Rock Band Comes Together Beautifully
At MTV Games ' Times Square headquarters Monday , Wired.com jammed on new tunes like " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " and " You Never Give Me Your Money . "
Harmonix publicist Alex Navarro also served up a few fresh facts about the newly downloadable songs :
1. Abbey Road includes new " dreamscapes . "
The trippy background settings you see during the gameplay for the Abbey Road downloads are custom - built , like those on the Beatles : Rock Band disc .
" They use existing artwork that 's already on the disc , so you 're not downloading like 300 - MB files for each song , " Navarro said .
" But they 're all customized with new camera cuts , new art design and all that sort of stuff . "
2 . There 's new behind - the - scenes studio chatter for the additional songs .
Like the other tracks included on the game disc , players will get to hear in - studio banter and warm - ups before the downloaded tracks begin .
" You 'll hear John warming up or you 'll hear Paul playing a little riff or whatever from a song , and it's for those specific tracks , " Navarro said .
( There are no new photos or factoids to unlock , however . )

__Beatles fans already know that " Because " has no drum track , and it 's the first song for the game that does n't have one .
But this time around , there 's less hassle for the full band .
" In Rock Band 2 , when you have to play a specific song ( with a missing instrument part ) , you have to sign out that instrument to play it .
For this , you don't , " Navarro explained .
" So if you 're playing as a full band , and you do the full Abbey Road DLC [ downloadable content ] album , the drummer just hangs out for a song , and he 's just out for that one and in on the next one .
It 's a lot easier . "
4 . All the Beatles : Rock Band songs are still created manually .
Despite the new capabilities of Rock Band Network , the company 's new DIY development tool to create Rock Band tracks , the songs are still crafted by the hands of Harmonix developers .
" The* Beatles * stuff is a different animal because it does involve ( producer ) Giles Martin doing a lot of the mixing , " Navarro said .
" And we still have to go to England and get the mixes and do all of that stuff .
It 's all very under lock and key . "

Some salary comparisons have become cliche .
Yes , everyone knows that teachers make a fraction of what famous athletes or movie stars make .
Why ?
Well , while General Chemistry and AP Statistics can be highly interesting , they do n’t exactly bring in droves of paying fans .
That being said , we found one comparison that is truly alarming – the amount taxpayers spend on a single prisoner annually to the starting salary of teachers .
Let ’s compare the two .
Inmates commit crimes and in many cases , hurt innocent people , while teachers work hard to educate the most innocent and precious people in our society .
The injustice of spending more on criminals than on our nation ’s educators is appalling .
Not only are there several states that pay significantly more for prisoners per year , but also in total , nearly half of the states either pay more for prisoners or have a minimal difference between the two .
Right now , six states spend more annually on their inmates than their teachers .
Those states are Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Oregon , and Maine .
Maine , believe it or not , spends over $ 17,000 more per inmate than they do per teacher and the salary for teachers is $ 26,643 .
For two parents and a child that is almost below the poverty line .
These statistics are unacceptable .
Many public libraries across the country have already shortened their hours and numerous schools have done the same or are considering cutting whole school days in order to save money .
This tactic would take valuable learning hours away from a child ’s school experience , and consequently interrupt a child ’s preparation for a prosperous and meaningful life .
Yet , people who broke the law ( whether or not we agree with the conviction or with those laws ) , get more money per person than those teaching our future leaders .
Does that make any sense ?
One of the reasons teachers leave the profession is because of the low pay .
Teachers simply do not get compensated enough for the difficult work that they do .
Educating restless young people , working in the bureaucracy of the public school system , and dealing with all of the social issues that come with teaching , is a full - time exhausting job with long hours and grueling expectations .
Anyone who has taught for a public school , and even a private one , knows how hard it can be at times .
Despite the inherit joys and rewards of teaching , teachers undoubtedly deserve more money for the honorable work that they do .
Every good parent in America wants to give their child the best chance in life .
Part of that process is school .
Hiring and retaining excellent teachers is apart of making that goal happen .
How do we expect to keep quality teachers if we barely pay them enough to live ?
Because at the end of the day regardless of how much teachers love their jobs and their students , they need to be able to eat .

Shepherd officiated in 92 Tests and 172 one - day internationals Former umpire David Shepherd has died after a battle with cancer , aged 68 .
Shepherd , who was born in Devon , officiated in 92 Tests and 172 one - day internationals , including three World Cup finals before retiring in 2005 .
He was famous for his aversion to the ' Nelson ' - scores with a multiple of 111 - which made him hop at the crease nervously between deliveries .
Only West Indies ' Steve Bucknor ( 128 ) and South Africa 's Rudi Koertzen ( 101 ) have stood in more Tests .
Shepherd had a productive career as a batsman for Gloucestershire , hitting 10,672 runs in a career lasting from 1965 to 1979 .
He was appointed as a first - class umpire in 1981 and was swiftly elevated through the ranks , making his Test debut in an Ashes Test four years later .
After his final international match , a one - day game between England and Australia at the Oval , he received a standing ovation from the fans and players .
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport : " There was a huge amount of respect for him .
He was a really good umpire , with a bit of character about him .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Ultimately he was respected because he got a lot of decisions right .
He was a nice man who used to say ' Well played or good shot . '
You get a lot of umpires these days who feel they 're not allowed to say that .
" He liked the odd beer , a pint of ale at the end of play .
Again , you would n't see that happening too much these days .
He will be greatly missed . "
Dickie Bird , who umpired many matches alongside Shepherd , said : " He was a fine umpire , we spent many happy hours together .
He was a great man and a tremendous man to umpire with .
He was a good bloke and a great friend . "
Gloucestershire chairman John Light said : " As an umpire he has always been a familiar and much - loved face , not only here but at cricket grounds around the world .
" He was friendly , outgoing and straightforward .
He believed cricket was a simple game and he took a straightforward approach to it in his cricket and his umpiring .
He always put a smile on your face . "
ICC President David Morgan described Shepherd as a " true gentleman " of the game .
" He was a fine player and a match official of the very highest quality , " he said .
" He will be remembered fondly by players , spectators and administrators as a great entertainer but also as one of the best umpires the game has ever seen . "
606 : DEBATE
He epitomes why every true Englishman loves cricket .
Despite his passing today I suspect when people reflect on their memories of him they will raise a smile
Billy Athletic
The current international umpires also issued a collective tribute to their former colleague : " He helped so many umpires in so many ways and contributed to numerous umpiring careers - many are indebted to him .
" Every time we see Nelson on the scoreboard , we will be thinking of Shep 's little jig and saying a quiet ' thank you ' for having him as one of us . "
Worcestershire captain Vikram Solanki , the professional Cricketers ' Association acting chief executive , said : " He was both authoritative and approachable on the field , while retaining a gentle sense of humour .
I have no doubt that these qualities helped to make him such a successful umpire . "
PCA vice - president David Graveney , a former team - mate of Shepherd 's at Gloucestershire , said : " He was very protective and supportive of the younger players and showed us the ropes .
The first thing I noticed was just how universally popular he was with players and crowds alike .
" His umpiring reflected just how he was as a person - looking to help without bias , explaining his decisions , and if he was n't sure on something , he would say so .
" Whether he was umpiring a second XI fixture or a Test match , you knew that the atmosphere on the field would be as good as it possibly could be . "
The MCC flag on the Grand Stand at Lord 's was flying at half mast on Wednesday .

In this tutorial we ’re going to be using the jQuery UI slider widget to create an attractive and functional content slider .
We ’ll have a container , which has a series of elements each containing different blocks of content .
There will be too many of these elements to display at once , so we can use the slider to move the different content blocks in and out of view .
j Query UI is the official library of widgets and utilities built on top of jQuery ; it ’s very easy to use , highly configurable and robust , and extremely easy to theme .
To follow the tutorial you ’ll need a copy of the latest version of the library ; it can be downloaded using the jQuery UI download builder at http://jqueryui.com/download.
Although we can choose any of the themes available , I ’d recommend using the default theme of smoothness .
j Query UI includes a copy of the current version of jQuery , so we do n’t need to download this separately .
Create a new folder somewhere handy and call it slider .
Within this folder , create two new folders ; one called jqueryui and one called images .
Unpack the downloaded archive of the library to the jqueryui folder ; in Explorer or Finder , you should end up with the following folder structure :
Getting Started
Let ’s make a start on the basic page and underlying HTML first ; in your text editor create the following page :
Save this as slider . html in the slider folder .
In the head of the page , we link to the jQuery UI style sheet , which contains all of the CSS that ’s required for each of the library components .
It may seem like a waste ; in some ways it is as we ’re only using a single component , but using a 26 KB style sheet .
However , using a tool like YUICompressor , we can easily shrink this , and with GZipping too we can get it down even further .
We also link to our own custom style sheet , which we ’ll create later .
We have n’t added any styling yet but for reference , the following screenshot shows the default slider widget :
The Underlying Mark - up
On the page all we have is the mark - up for the content and the slider ; we ’ve got an outer container element which we ’ve given the class name ui - corner - all .
This is one of the classes targeted by the jQuery UI style sheet and will give our container ( and the other elements we give it to ) nice rounded corners .
It uses CSS3 to achieve this so not all browsers are supported , but Firefox , Safari or Chrome users will see them .
Within the container we ’ve got a heading element that describes the content , followed by another container element ( which will also have rounded corners in supporting browsers ) ; when we come to add the CSS , this element will be given an overflow rule of hidden which will hide most of the individual content blocks and allow us to slide them into view using the slider .
This element will function as the viewer .
Within the viewer we have a final container element ; the reason for this is for performance – when we adjust the left CSS property with jQuery , we ’ll only be selecting and manipulating one element instead of however many content blocks there are .
We use another class name from the UI library on this element – the ui-helper - clearfix class , which automatically clears floated elements within whichever element it ’s applied to .
Following this is an example of a content block ; I ’ve only shown one of them in the code example above because to show more would be unnecessary repetition .
In the source file there are seven of them , but you can put as many in as you like and the slider will still function as it should .
Each content block contains a heading , an image and a definition list , which semantically is probably the best choice for this example , but not necessarily required in other implementations .
The content blocks can feature pretty much whatever they need to , provided each container is of a fixed size ; you ’ll see why this is important we come to add the JavaScript a little later on .
After the viewer element comes an empty container which will be transformed into the slider widget once we invoke the UI library .
This is all underlying HTML that we ’ll need .
Following this we link to jQuery and to the jQuery UI source files ; again , this file contains all of the JavaScript needed to run the whole UI library , which for this tutorial is more than we need .
There are individual files for the core and each component separately which can cut down the footprint of the library .
Both the jQuery and jQuery UI JS files are already minified .
Styling the Content
In truth we do n’t need to worry about styling the slider widget itself at all ; the theme that we downloaded with the library will do that for us .
The CSS we ’re about to add is pretty much purely arbitrary for the purpose of this tutorial , to tidy things up and give it a basic minimal look .
As long as the individual content blocks ( given a class name of item ) are given a fixed width and are floated to the left within the conveyor element , and provided the viewer has its overflow set to hidden everything should work as expected .
In a new file in your text editor add the following code :
Save this as slider.css in the slider folder .
Our page should now look like this :
Adding the Slider Widget
All we need to do now is add the JavaScript that will initialise the slider and control our content blocks .
Directly after the script element linking to jQuery UI in slider .
html add the following code :
It ’s a very short , simple snippet of code , with very little going on ; let ’s take a look at it line by line ;
Within the document .
ready short - cut we first set up a few variables so that we can cache the elements from the page that we ’ll be manipulating for performance reasons ; this makes our code run faster because we ’re only traversing the DOM and selecting each element once .
We select the conveyor element first of all by targeting its class name ; because using a class selector is inefficient , we give the selector a context of the sliderContent element .
The context is provided using an id selector , so the whole DOM does not need to be traversed .
We also select the collection of content blocks in the same way .
Once we ’ve cached our selectors we can set the length of the conveyor element ; in the CSS it was set to the width of two of the content blocks , but for it to function correctly , the content boxes need to float alongside each other , so the conveyor needs to be wide enough to accommodate them all .
So that we do n’t restrict how many content blocks can be put into the widget we do n’t hardcode a set width into it ; instead , we get the number of content blocks , and multiply this by the width of each block .
This is why it ’s important to set a fixed width on the blocks .
We need to use JavaScript ’s parseInt function when we retrieve the width of the blocks because the jQuery css method returns a string value in getter mode .
Next we create a literal configuration object which will be passed into the jQuery UI slider method and used to set some properties of the slider widget .
Our configuration object has two properties , max and slide .
The max property ’s value is an integer which represents the width of the conveyor element minus the width of the viewer .
This will be the maximum value that the slider handle can reach .
The value of the slide property is an anonymous function which will automatically receive two arguments ; the original event object and a prepared object containing useful properties relating to the widget .
We do n’t use the first argument at all , which we define as e , but we need to include it to gain access to the second argument , which we term ui .
The slide event is a custom event exposed by the slider API , and the function we set as its value will be called each time a slide interaction occurs .
Whenever the event is fired , we simply manipulate the left style property of our conveyor element negatively by the same amount as the slider is moved .
We can get the value that the slider is moved to using the value property of the ui object .
We set the maximum value of the slider to the length of the conveyor element , in this example it ends up being 2128 px , so the maximum value is 2128 .
This is n’t in pixels , as you ’ll see in the next screenshot , the slider itself is around 650 px in length .
But , if we move the slider to about halfway along the track , the value reported in the ui object will be around 1064 , so we move the left edge of the conveyor this many pixels to the left or right .
We do n’t need to worry about detecting which direction the slider was moved in ; if the slider handle has already been moved to the right , the left CSS property if the conveyor will already have a negative value .
When we minus a negative number from a negative number , the outcome is of course a positive number so the conveyor will move back as it should .
The completed page should now appear featuring the slider :
You should find that it works as expected and the different blocks of content can be moved in and out of view using the slider widget .
As well as the standard drag interaction , also built into the slider is the useful addition of a click interaction ; if click anywhere on the track , the handle is automatically moved to that position and the slide callback function is executed .
Conclusion
In this tutorial we ’ve looked at how the underlying HTML used for the slider ( a simple empty container ) , the default styling applied by the library , and how it can be configured and initialized with our code .
The slider is a great addition to any interface ; it ’s easy for us to set up and easy for our visitors to use , it ’s tactile and interactive and can be used in a variety of situations from moving content around like in this example , or as , say , a volume control on a streaming web app .

around the same time President Obama was giving his health - care speech to Congress , I was in Washington to interview some administration officials for an upcoming story in Esquire .
They were so damn .
And hardworking .
And energetic — the kinds of people who actually wake up at dawn to go running just so they can get to the office by 7:30 , who eat salads and read only useful books .
They do n't watch television .
They never drink more than a glass or two of wine .
Sometimes they might indulge in a social beer , but it reallya social beer .
No wonder they 're dumfounded by all the tea baggers who stormed the hill on Saturday .
Obama 's geeks can't seem to understand people who do n't want to share their toys , who do n't use birth control because they know sex is dirty , who would rather do the wrong thing than do what is good for them .
And here were the Obamanauts thinking they had finessed this problem of American rage — because , you know , they really do n't want to force anybody to do things .
They believe in this idea of " libertarian paternalism , " which means they 'll put the fruits and veggies right there at eye level by the counter and put the chips and sugary sodas way up on the top shelf .
They 're not going to force you to pick the public option , as the Republicans keep prodding with that new American apocalypse of command government — they 're going to use " choice architecture " to " nudge " you toward what is obviously good for you .
What these nice , intelligent people working for the president do n't understand is the imp of the perverse .
As a man wise in the ways of human madness once told me , " You think it 's money with the Republicans and sex with the Democrats , but really it 's the other way around . "
That 's why folks in the Bible Belt buy more porn than anybody else , and why their pregnancy and abortion rates are the highest in the nation .
Because it is always the Other that we desire .
Crazy two - legged beasts that we are , teetering in this awkward upright posture , we define our civilization by carving sins out of the category of acceptable human behavior — and then immediately begin committing them with the most feverish enthusiasm .
It 's no accident that much of this impulse comes from the southern states , which recent polls suggest are virtually united in their opposition to President Obama .
After all , this is the region that fought government intrusion upon its freedoms by forming its own government to intrude upon its freedoms , that imposed the Fugitive Slave Law on other states in the name of states ' rights , that fought for slavery in the name of liberty .
None of this was particularly logical , but then again , logic is just another iron law of compulsion .
This is how Edmund Wilson put it in Patriotic Gore , his classic study of the literature of the Confederacy :
" The passion for independence which with masters of a subject race so often takes the form of wrong - headedness , of self - assertion for its own sake , of tantrums , this self - will that has made an issue , and is now making a cult , of states ' rights , is now provoking certain elements to rebel against the Confederacy itself ...
The great irony is that the recalcitrance of the Southerners against any sort of central control , which has led them to secede from the Union , is also — since they refuse to submit to the kind of governmental coercion that will enable the North to win — obstructing their success in the war . "
Put another way :
There is freedom and glory in the giddy joys of rebellion , but the consequences can be ugly .
Consider what Frederick Law Olmstead found on his tour of the South just before the war :
" The traveler finds that one family he visits is putting through a road in a certain direction in order to establish communication with neighbors whom they happen to like , but doing nothing in the other direction , because they do not like the people who live there .
He is astonished at the lack of ' improvements ' of the kind that are always being made in the North , and he eventually becomes appalled at the deficiency of the South in that " culture " which means so much to New England .
There are few newspapers , and few people read them .
Almost no books are published .
The press is under virtual censorship , since no discussion of slavery is possible .
The people rarely talk about anything except narrowly local matters ...
[ There are ] neither sports nor debating societies , military companies nor libraries , theaters nor concert halls , singing societies nor amateur theatricals .
There are no civic bodies to sit on , no school boards or church corporations , no benevolent or agricultural societies , no bridge or water companies ... "
In that spirit , allow me to review :
If Republicans had gotten everything they wanted for the last seventy - five years or so , the United States of America would have no Social Security , no Medicare , no Aid to Dependent Children , no civil rights , no environmental protections , no privacy rights to make contraception legal .
There would be no business taxes , either , which could mean an even more vigorous business sector but also lots of gated communities and private security guards and — who knows ?
— maybe death squads to put down the inevitable insurrections .
And there would certainly be no " death taxes , " so we'd be burdened with an ever larger cohort of inbred aristocrats .
And our daughters and sisters would be flocking to the nation 's emergency rooms , hemorrhaging from illegal abortions .
And we might still be at war in Vietnam .
On the other hand , consider what the Republicans gave Americans during their last eight years in power :
They were asleep at the switch when Osama bin Laden attacked , overreacted by invading a country that had not attacked us ( at the cost of about $ 1 trillion dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives ) , saddled the country with $ 43 billion a year in unfunded Medicare mandates and another $ 1.7 trillion in unfunded tax cuts for the rich ( $ 2.5 trillion according to a new study by Citizens for Tax Justice PDF ) — then followed their market fundamentalist ideology right over the economic cliff and sent the whole planet spinning into recession .
And now they 're upset about how Obama is running the country ?
What gives them the right to criticize , exactly ?
Thoughts on partisan rage ?
Reflections on the anniversary of the financial collapse ?
Love letters ?

Outgoing Bank of America chief executive Ken Lewis will get no pay this year , the US government 's pay tsar has ruled .
Kenneth Feinberg , the US treasury department official who is scrutinising pay packages at bailed - out banks , said that Lewis – besieged by regulatory investigations and lambasted by shareholders – should get no salary or bonus for the year .
Lewis agreed .
He will pay back about $ 1 m ( £ 612,000 ) he has received so far out of a $ 1.5 m annual salary .
But the ruling does not apply to his previously negotiated retirement package , estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars .
" He will write a cheque to the company , " a Bank of America spokesman said , adding that Lewis agreed to the proposal because he felt it was not in the bank 's best interest " to get into a dispute with the paymaster " .
Lewis , 62 , announced last month that he would step down as chief executive and retire from the bank by the end of the year , ending a tumultuous 12 months in which Bank of America was accused of misleading shareholders about its acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
He has worked at the North Carolina - based firm for 40 years .
Bank of America is due to release its third - quarter results later today .
Wall Street has been eagerly awaiting Feinberg 's decisions about pay for 75 of the highest - earning executives at seven firms that got the most taxpayer money .
Other companies under scrutiny include Citigroup , Wells Fargo , General Motors , Chrysler and Chrysler Financial .
" The government is proving they are serious about taking money back for poor performance , " said Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities .
Bank of America 's Merrill acquisition is being investigated by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general .
The AG 's office is trying to determine whether the bank misled shareholders about $ 3.6bn in bonuses paid to Merrill employees and the investment bank 's mortgage lending losses .
Advanced Messaging & Routing with AMQP
Not all message queues are made equal .
In the simplest case , a message queue is synonymous with an asynchronous protocol in which the sender and the receiver do not operate on the message at the same time .
However , while this pattern is most commonly used to decouple distinct services ( an intermediate mailbox , of sorts ) , the more advanced implementations also enable a host more advanced recipes : load balancing , queueing , failover , pubsub , etc. AMQP can do all of the above , and yesterday ’s announcement of RabbitMQ 1.7 ( an open source AMQP broker ) warrants a closer look .
Originally developed at JP Morgan as a vendor neutral wire and broker protocol , AMQP ( Advanced Message Queuing Protocol ) is , in fact , a general purpose messaging bus .
The protocol itself is still under active development , but there are a variety of open source client and server implementations for it , as well as some big commercial supporters ( RedHat , Microsoft , etc ) .
In other words , it works , it is production ready , and I can vouch for it from personal experience - we stream tens of millions of messages through AMQP at PostRank on a daily basis .
AMQP vs XMPP : Features & Architecture
The AMQP vs XMPP debate has been raging for years now .
On the surface they both look identical , but in reality there are a number of important distinctions .
For example , presence is one of the central components of XMPP , but it is not part of the AMQP specification .
XMPP uses XML , whereas AMQP has a binary protocol .
AMQP has native support for a number of delivery use cases ( at least once , exactly once , select subscribers , persistence , etc ) and also a variety of exchange implementations which allow fine - grained control to where and how the messages are routed .
The AMQP spec is a fast and recommended read , but by a way of quick introduction , the core architectural components are : publisher , exchange , queue , and consumer .
As you may have guessed , the publisher is the data producer which pushes messages to an exchange .
Why is it called an exchange ?
Because the exchange is a routing engine which is responsible for delivering the messages to the right queues ( exchanges never store messages ) .
For example , a message may need to be routed to just a single queue ( direct exchange ) , maybe the message should be forwarded to every queue ( pubsub ) in the list ( fanout exchange ) , or perhaps the message should be routed based on a key ( topic exchange ) .
Publishing & Consuming AMQP in Ruby
The type of exchange , message parameters , and the name of the attached queue can all contribute to the delivery and routing behavior of the message .
However , for the sake of example , let ’s create a simple pubsub fanout exchange in Ruby :
require ' amqp ' AMQP . start ( : host => ' localhost ' ) do # create a fanout exchange on the broker exchange = MQ . new . fanout ( ' multicast ' ) # publish multiple messages to fanout exchange .
publish ( ' hello ' ) exchange .
publish ( ' world ' )
end
In order to consume the messages from an exchange the consumer needs to create a queue and then bind it to an exchange .
A queue can be durable ( survive between server restarts ) , or auto - deletable for cases when the queue should disappear if the consumer goes down .
Best of all , once the queue is bound to an exchange , the messages are streamed to the client in real - time via a persistent connection ( no polling ! ) :
require ' amqp ' AMQP . start ( : host => ' localhost ' ) do amq = MQ . new # bind ' listener ' queue to ' multicast ' exchange amq .
queue ( ' listener ' ) . bind ( amq . fanout ( ' multicast ' ) ) .
subscribe do | msg | puts msg # process your message here end end

Advanced AMQP Recipes
The flexibility of the message and the exchange model is what makes AMQP such a powerful tool .
Whenever a publisher generates a message , he can mark it as ‘ persistent ’ which will guarantee delivery through the broker - if there is an attached queue , it will accumulate messages until the consumer requests them .
However , if you ’re streaming transient data ( access logs , for example ) , you can also disable message persistence and not worry about overwhelming your broker .
That ’s how you achieve ‘ exactly - once ’ vs ‘ at least once ’ semantics .
Trying to build a pubsub hub ?
Create a fanout exchange and attach as many queues as you want , each consumer will receive a copy of the message .
Load balancing ?
Bind two workers to the same queue and the broker will automatically round - robin the messages ( there is no upper limit on the number of workers ) .
Failover ?
By default the AMQP broker does not require a message to be ACKed by a consumer , but with a simple configuration flag the messages will be kept on the server until the ACK is received .
If the consumer goes down without ACKing a message , they will be automatically put back on the queue .
Need to route a message based on a key ?
Topic exchange allows partial matching based on a message key that is set by the producer .
Do you want to notify the producer if there are no subscribers attached to a queue ?
Set the immediate flag on the message and the broker will do all the work .
Best of all , you can also compose these patterns to cover virtually any delivery use case !
AMQP Brokers & Ruby / Rails
There are a variety of available broker implementations : ZeroMQ , ActiveMQ , OpenAMQ , and RabbitMQ .
Because the underlying protocol is still in flux , there is definitely some variation between all the implementations - do your homework .
If you ’re looking for a speed demon , ZeroMQ claims a 15.4 microsend routing overhead ( 4+ million msgs / s ) .
However , RabbitMQ is arguably the most stable and feature complete broker implementation .
If you are a CentOS or a Fedora user , you ’ll be happy to know that it is now part of the distro ( yum install rabbitmq - server ) , otherwise follow the installation instructions .
Once the server is installed , follow the administration guide to start the broker .
If you ’re looking for a RESTful or a GUI tool to help you configure the broker , drop in Alice on the same server .
Like the SQL prompt ?
Install the BQL plugin and familiarize yourself with the syntax .
The AMQP gem is probably the best choice when it comes to Ruby clients - it is asynchronous , it is fast , and it is in use by dozens of companies .
If you ’re looking for a synchronous client , Carrot gem is the answer .
If you ’re using async - observer plugin in your Rails projects , you can drop in async - observer - amqp to migrate to AMQP .
In other words , it is easy to get started , it is incredibly powerful , and it has great library support for virtually every language .
Give it a try .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Angelo Mozilo has lots of friends .
Or at least , he used to .
The former chief executive of Countrywide Financial now faces a series of federal lawsuits , including one brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud and insider trading .
Suddenly , some of the most powerful Washington politicians are eschewing the shameful appellation “ Friend of Angelo . ”
Back in the early 1990s , when Countrywide was climbing to the top of the mortgage industry , Mr. Mozilo was looking to make friends on Capitol Hill .
According to documents obtained by congressional oversight investigators , these key VIPs were afforded preferential and personalized treatment , including specially priced home mortgage loans at below - market rates .
This generosity was not limited to elected officials but was extended as well to select congressional staff members , administration officials and Washington lobbyists .
In his aggressive pursuit of market dominance , Mr. Mozilo tried to make friends everywhere , especially among people who had a primary responsibility to craft legislation and oversee government enterprises with a stake in the U.S. housing market .
In March 2009 , the minority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform produced a detailed , 63 - page report that analyzed Countrywide ’s VIP program and Mr. Mozilo ’s successful scheme to buy political influence and manipulate public policy decisions .
At that time , I renewed my call for congressional hearings into the Countrywide scandal , but my requests have been denied repeatedly and obstructed by the Democratic majority .
While some have attempted to characterize our efforts to uncover the true scope and depth of this pay - for - play program as a partisan attack targeting specific members of Congress , it should be noted that Republicans controlled both Congress and the White House at the height of the Countrywide VIP program ’s influence .
It stands to reason , therefore , that more Republicans than Democrats could have been the beneficiaries of Mr. Mozilo ’s special treatment .
The undisputed fact remains :
We know there was corruption .
We know Countrywide ’s intent was to influence decision - makers to pursue policies that favored Countrywide ’s portfolio .
Yet congressional Democrats seem afraid to move forward with the investigation into a bribery scandal that contributed to the housing crisis and the financial collapse .
A variety of excuses have been offered for Congress ’ failure to launch a full - scale probe into the Friends of Angelo program .
At first , it was argued that deference was needed for the Senate Ethics Committee to conclude an investigation into the conduct of two senators .
Then speculation concerning a Justice Department investigation was cited to trump congressional oversight .
Never mind the fact that Democrats and Republicans in Congress had worked together to investigate the Jack Abramoff scandal , even though the Justice Department continues to prosecute actions connected to this wrongdoing to the present day .
Once the final report of the Senate Ethics Committee was released , however , the way was cleared for the House oversight committee to subpoena the records of the Friends of Angelo program to determine the full nature and scope of Countrywide ’s efforts to manipulate Congress and purchase political favor .
The limited focus of the Senate investigation was the actions of two elected officials , not the actions of an entire division of a billion - dollar corporation designed to curry favor with those officials .
Unfortunately , the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Edolphus Towns , New York Democrat , does not believe the Countrywide VIP program is worth the committee ’s time .
In a letter sent to oversight committee members on Sept. 30 , Mr. Towns characterized the VIP program as “ … enhanced customer service , in a manner similar to airline frequent flier programs or supermarket discount cards . ”
Countrywide Financial and Angelo Mozilo clearly are at the nexus of the current economic crisis .
It was Countrywide ’s packaging of subprime mortgages that helped inflate the housing bubble , and it was Mr. Mozilo ’s VIP program that sought to minimize congressional scrutiny and derail housing policy reforms that could have mitigated the crisis .
The documents that can lift the veil from Countrywide ’s VIP program are readily available , however , and their custodians are prepared to provide them to Congress upon receipt of a subpoena .
But somewhere in Washington , Mr. Mozilo ’s secrets are getting cover .
“ Public investigating committees … have always been opposed by groups that seek or have special privileges , ” wrote former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black in 1936 .
“ The spokesmen of these greedy groups never rest in their opposition to exposure and publicity .
That is because special privileges thrive in secrecy and darkness and [ are ] destroyed by the rays of pitiless publicity . ”
As Congress continues to assess the causes of the current economic crisis , the protests of those most responsible doubtless will grow louder and efforts to block congressional inquiry will only intensify .
Ironically , it was the Democratic leadership in Washington that promised a new era of transparency and accountability , but so far those promises have proved empty .
No subpoenas have been issued .
No hearings have been scheduled , and the Justice Department appears to have shelved its criminal investigation .
The only reason the American people are not learning the whole truth about Countrywide , it seems , is that Angelo Mozilo still has a few friends left on Capitol Hill .
Rep. Darrell Issa of California is the ranking Republican of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .

It has been a busy summer for our friends running the Tucson Unified School District .
As always , the annual Institute for Transformative Education summer seminar , hosted by TUSD 's amply funded Mexican / American raza - studies program , was fun .
So much racial bitterness to obsess over .
Tim Wise , the ultra-angry Tulane University poli-sci grad who has made a great living finding racism under every doormat , was the featured speaker .
Everyone was wowed .
In a year in which hundreds of district teachers received pink slips , meanwhile , TUSD spent thousands on recruiting teachers from out of state .
And it hired a coordinator at $ 80,000 per annum to lead the effort .
The recruiting was prompted by what is fast becoming the consuming passion of the TUSD governing board and its allies - to establish a corps of teachers that precisely mirrors the racial make - up of its heavily minority student population .
You can argue the efficacy of such issues legitimately , certainly .
On a certain emotional level , it is a good thing for a minority student with few incentives to achieve much academically to see others who have .
But , as always , TUSD 's race - obsessing board of governors is taking racial bean - counting to preposterous extremes .
This summer , the TUSD board adopted a " Post - Unitary Status Plan " that it expects will help the district escape a decades - old federal desegregation order .
The plan includes increasing the number of minority teachers - per the summer hiring spree , which netted 14 special - education teachers and one math - science teacher .
It also includes a vast expansion of the district 's controversial Mexican - American studies program .
Despite the budget - enforced closing of school libraries , the shuttering of arts and music programs and the layoff of teachers and counselors in other disciplines , the Post - Unitary Status Plan calls for a vigorous expansion of the program run by TUSD 's happy band of unrepentant political leftists .
The board 's plan also calls for changes intended ( however counterproductive those plans may be ) to improving the lot of minority students .
It wants to see more minority students enrolled in advanced - placement programs , for example - a laudable goal , certainly .
But consider one significant part of the plan for " improving " the academic status of TUSD 's Black and Hispanic students :
The board is calling for a two - tiered form of student discipline .
One for Black and Hispanic students ; one for everyone else .
With the goal of creating a " restorative school culture and climate " that conveys a " sense of belonging to all students , " the board is insisting that its schools reduce its suspensions and / or expulsions of minority students to the point that the data reflect " no ethnic / racial disparities . "
From the section of the 52 - page plan titled " Restorative School Culture and Climate , " subhead , " Discipline " :
" School data that show disparities in suspension / expulsion rates will be examined in detail for root causes .
Special attention will be dedicated to data regarding African - American and Hispanic students . "
The board approved creating an " Equity Team " that will oversee the plan to ensure " a commitment to social justice for all students . "
The happy - face edu-speak notwithstanding , what the Tucson Unified School District board of governors has approved this summer is a race - based system of discipline .
Offenses by students will be judged , and penalties meted out , depending on the student 's hue .
Certainly , from the point of view of a public - school administrator , such a policy is beyond insane .
TUSD principals and disciplinarians ( assuming such creatures still exist ) are being asked to set two standards of behavior for their students .
Some behavior will be met with strict penalties ; some will not .
It all depends on the color of the student 's skin .
It is an invitation to chaos .
The students of the Tucson Public School District certainly deserve more .
They deserve a chance to excel academically .
Instead , they get this .
Genuine apartheid .

The Little Black Fish
By : Samad Behrangi
The Little Black Fish ; painting by : Farshid Mesqali
I t was the longest night of winter .
At the bottom of the sea an old fish gathered together 12,000 of her children and grandchildren and began to tell them this story :
Once upon a time a little black fish lived with her mother in a small pond on the side of a mountain .
Their home was behind a black , moss - covered rock , under which they both slept at night .
The little fish longed to see the moonlight in their home just once .
From morning till evening , the mother and child swam after each other .
Sometimes they joined other fish and rapidly darted in and out of small crevices .
The little fish was an only child , for of the 10,000 eggs which the mother had laid , only she had survived .
For several days the little fish had been deep in thought and had talked very little .
She swam slowly behind her mother around the pond and did not play with the other fish .
Her mother thought her child was sick and would soon be well .
In fact , the black fish 's sickness was really something else !
Early one morning before the sun had risen , the little fish woke her mother and said
" Mother , I want to talk to you . "
Half - asleep , the mother responded
" Child , this is n't the time to talk .
Save your words for later .
Go swimming ? "
" No , Mother !
I can't go swimming anymore .
I must leave here . "
" Do you really have to leave ? "
" Yes , Mother , I must go . "
" Just a minute !
Where do you want to go at this hour of the morning ? "
" I want to go see where the stream ends .
You know , Mother , I 've been wondering where the end of the stream is ...
I have n't been able to think about anything else .
I did n't sleep a wink all night .
At last , I decided to go and find where the stream ends .
I want to know what 's happening in other places . "
The mother laughed - " When I was a child , I used to think a lot like that .
But , my dear , a stream has no beginning and no end .
That 's the way it is .
The stream just flows and never goes anywhere . "
" But mother dear , is n't it true that everything comes to an end ?
Nights end , days end , weeks , months , years ... "
" Forget this pretentious talk , " interrupted the mother - " Let 's go swimming .
Now is the time to swim , not talk . "
" No , Mother , I 'm tired of this swimming , I want to set out and see what 's happening elsewhere .
Maybe you think someone taught me these ideas but believe me , I 've had these thoughts for a long time .
Of course , I 've learned many things here and there .
For instance , I know that when most fish get old , they complain about everything .
I want to know if life is simply for circling around in a small place until you become old and nothing else , or is there another way to live in the world ? "
When the little fish finished the mother exclaimed - " My dear child , are you crazy ?
World ! ... World !
What is this other world !
The world is right here where we are .
Life is just as we have it ... "
Just then , a large fish approached their home and said : " Neighbor , what are you arguing about with your child ?
Are n't you planning to go swimming today ? "
Hearing her neighbor 's voice , the mother came out of the house and said , " What 's the world coming to !
Now children even want to teach their mothers something ! "
How so ?
" asked the neighbor . "
Listen to the places this half - pint wants to go ! " replied the mother .
" Saying over and over again I want to go see what 's happening in the world .
What pretentious talk ! "
" Little one , " said the neighbor , " let 's see .
Since when have you become a scholar and philosopher and not told us ? "
" Madam , " answered the little fish , " I do n't know what you mean by ' scholar ' and ' philosopher , ' I 've just gotten tired of these swims .
I do n't want to continue this boring stuff and be happy as a fool until one day I wake up and see that like all of you , I 've become old , but still am as dumb as I am now . "
" Oh , what talk ! " exclaimed the neighbor .
" I never thought my only child would turn out this way , " said the mother .
" I do n't know what evil person put my sweet baby up to this . "
" No one put me up to anything , " said the little fish .
" I have reason , and intelligence and understanding .
I have eyes and I can see . "
" Sister , " said the neighbor to the little fish 's mother , " do you remember that twisted - up snail ? "
" Yes , you 're right , " said the mother .
" He used to push himself on my baby .
God knows what I would do to him ! "
" That 's enough , Mother , " said the little fish .
" He was my friend . "
" Friendship between a fish and a snail , " said the mother , " I 've never heard of such a thing ! "
" And I 've never heard of a fish and a snail being enemies , " replied the little fish .
" But you all drowned the poor fellow . "
" Let 's not bring up the past , " said the neighbor .
" You brought up the subject yourself , " said the little fish .
" It served him right to be killed , " said the mother .
" Have you forgotten the things he used to say everywhere he went ? "
" Then , " said the little fish , " kill me too since I 'm saying the very same things . "
To make a long story short , the arguing voices attracted the other fish .
The little fish 's words angered everyone .
One of the old fish asked , " Did you think we 'd pity you ? "
" That one just needs a little box on the ears , " said another .
" Go away , " said the black fish 's mother .
" Do n't you touch my child . "
Another of them said , " Madam , if you do n't raise your child correctly , you must expect it to be punished . "
The neighbor said , " I 'm ashamed to live next to you . "
Another said , " Let 's do to the little fish what we did to the old snail before it gets into trouble . "
When they tried to grab the little black fish , her friends gathered around and took the fish away from the brawl .
The black fish 's mother beat her head and chest and cried , " Oh , my baby is leaving me .
What am I going to do ?
What a curse has fallen upon me ! "
" Mother , do n't cry for me .
Cry for the old fish who stay behind . "
" Do n't get smart , half - pint ! " shouted one of the fish from afar .
" If you go away and afterwards regret it , we wo n't let you come back , " said a second .
" These are useful fancies .
Do n't go , " said a third .
" What 's wrong with this place ? " said a fourth .
" There is no other world .
The world is right here .
Come back !
Said a fifth .
" If you turn reasonable and come back , then we 'll believe you really are an intelligent fish , " said a sixth .
" Wait , we 've gotten used to having you around ... " said a seventh .
The mother cried , " Have mercy on me .
Do n't go !
Do n't go ! "
The little fish did n't have anything more to say to them .
Several friends of the same age accompanied the fish as far as the waterfall .
As they parted , the fish said ,
" My friends , I hope to see you again .
Do n't forget me ! "
" How would it be possible to forget you ? " asked the friends .
" You 've awakened us from a deep sleep .
You 've taught us many things that we had not even thought about before .
We hope to see you again , learned and fearless friend . "
The little fish swam down the waterfall and fell into a pond full of water .
At first the fish lost its balance but after a while began to swim and circled around the pond .
The fish had never seen so much water collected in one place .
Thousands of tadpoles were wriggling in the water .
They laughed when they saw the little black fish ,
" What a funny shape !
What kind of creature are you ? "
The fish looked them over thoroughly and said , " Please do n't insult me .
My name is Little Black Fish .
Tell me your names so that we 'll get acquainted .
" We call one another tadpole , " replied one of the tadpoles .
" We come from nobility , " said another .
" You can't find anyone prettier than us in the whole world , " said another .
" We are n't shapeless and ugly - faced like you , " said another one .
The fish said , " I never imagined you would be so conceited .
That 's all right .
I 'll forgive you since you 're speaking out of ignorance . "
In one voice the tadpoles demanded , " Are you saying we 're stupid ? "
" If you were n't ignorant , " replied the fish , " you 'd know that there are many others in the world who are pleased with their appearances .
You do n't even have names of your own . "
The tadpoles became very angry .
But since they knew the little fish spoke truthfully , they changed their tone and said , " really , you 're wasting words !
We swim around the world every day from morning till evening , but except for ourselves and our father and mother , we see no one .
Of course , there are tiny worms , but they do n't count . "
" You ca n't even leave the pond , " said the fish .
" How can you talk about traveling around the world ? "
" What !
Do you think there 's a world other than the pond ? " exclaimed the tadpoles .
" At least , " responded the fish , " you must wonder where this water comes from and what things are outside of it . "
" Outside the water ! " exclaimed the tadpoles , " Where is that ?
We 're never seen outside of the water !
Haha ... haha ... You 're crazy ! "
Little Black
Fish also started to laugh .
The fish thought it would be better to leave the tadpoles to themselves and go away , but then changed its mind and decided to speak to their mother .
" Where is your mother ? " asked the fish .
Suddenly , the deep voice of a frog made the fish jump .
The frog was sitting on a rock at the edge of the pond .
She jumped into the water , came up to the fish and said :
" I 'm right here .
What do you want ? "
" Hello , Great Lady , " said the fish .
The frog responded " Worthless creature , now is not the time to show off .
You 've found some children to listen to you and are talking pretentiously .
I 've lived long enough to know that the world is this pond .
Mind your own business and do n't lead my children astray . "
" If you lived a hundred years , " said the little fish , " you 'd still be nothing more than an ignorant and helpless frog . "
The frog got angry and jumped at Little Black Fish .
The fish flipped quickly and fled like lightening , stirring up sediment and worms at the bottom of the pond .
The valley twisted and curved .
The stream became deeper and wider .
But if you looked down at the valley from the top of the mountains , the stream would seem like a white thread .
In one place , a piece of large rock had broken off from the mountain , fallen to the bottom of the valley , and split the water into two branches .
A large lizard the size of a hand , lay on her stomach on the rock .
She was enjoying the sun 's warmth and watching a large , round crab resting on the sand at the bottom or the water in a shallow place and eating a frog he had snared .
The little fish suddenly saw the crab , became frightened , and greeted him from afar .
The crab glanced sideways at the fish and said ,
" What a polite fish !
Come closer , little one .
Come on ! "
" I'm off to see the world , " said the little fish , " and I never want to be caught by you , sir ! "
" Little fish , why are you so pessimistic and scared ? " asked the crab .
" I'm neither pessimistic nor afraid , " answered the fish .
" I speak about everything I see and understand . "
" Well , then , " said the crab , " please tell me what you 've seen and understood that makes you think I want to capture you ? "
" Do n't try to trick me ! " responded the fish .
" Are you referring to the frog ? " queried the crab .
" How childish you are !
I have a grudge against frogs ; that 's the reason I hunt them .
Do you know , they think they 're the only creatures in the world and that they 're very lucky .
I want to make them understand who is really master in the world !
So you do n't have to be afraid , my dear .
Come here .
Come on . "
As the crab talked , he was walking backwards towards the little fish .
His gait was so funny that the fish could n't help laughing and said ,
" Poor thing !
You do n't even know how to walk .
How did you ever learn who runs the world ? "
The black fish drew back from the crab .
A shadow fell upon the water and suddenly a heavy blow pushed the crab into the sand .
The lizard laughed so hard at the crab 's expression that she slipped and almost fell into the water .
The crab could n't get up .
The little fish saw that a young shepherd was standing at the edge of the water watching the fish and the crab .
A flock of sheep and goats came up to the water and thrust their mouths in .
The valley filled with the sounds of " meh meh " and " bah bah . "
The little black fish waited until the sheep and goats had drunk their water and left , then called the lizard ,
" Dear lizard , I 'm a little black fish who 's going to search for the end of the stream .
I think you 're wise , so , I 'd like to ask you something . "
" Ask anything you want . "
" All along the way , they 've been frightening me a great deal about the pelican , the swordfish and the heron .
Do you know anything about them ? "
" The swordfish and the heron , " said the lizard , " are n't found in this area , especially the swordfish who lives in the sea .
But it 's possible that the pelican is farther down .
Be careful he does n't trick you and catch you in his pouch . "
" What pouch ? "
" Under his throat , " explained the lizard , " the pelican has a pouch which holds a lot of water .
When the pelican 's swimming , fish , without realizing it , sometimes enter his pouch and then go straight into his stomach .
But if the pelican is n't hungry , he stores the fish in his pouch to eat later . "
" If a fish enters the pouch , is there any way of getting out ? " asked the fish .
" There 's no way unless the fish rips open the pouch , " answered the lizard .
" I 'm going to give you a dagger so that if you get caught by the pelican , you can do just that . "
Then the lizard crawled into a crack in the rock and returned wit a very sharp dagger .
The little fish took the dagger and said :
" Dear lizard , you are so kind !
I do n't know how to thank you . "
" It 's not necessary to thank me , my dear .
I have many of these daggers .
When I have nothing to do , I sit down and make daggers from blades of grass and give them to smart fish like you . "
" What ? " asked the fish , " Have other fish passed here before me ? "
" Many have passed by , " the lizard replied .
" They 've formed themselves into a school and they give the fisherman a hard time . "
" Excuse me for talking so much , " said the black fish , " but if you do n't think me meddlesome , tell me how they give the fisherman a hard time .
" Well , " answered the lizard , " they stick together .
Whenever the fisherman throws his net , they get inside , pull the net with them , and drag it to the bottom of the sea . "
The lizard placed her ear on the crack , listened and said , " I must excuse myself now .
My children have awakened . "
The lizard went into the crack in the rock .
The black fish had no choice but to set out again .
But all the while there were many questions on the fish 's mind .
" Is it true that the stream flows to the sea ?
If only the pelican does n't catch me !
Is it true the swordfish enjoys killing and eating its own kind ?
Why is the heron our enemy ? "
The little fish continued swimming and thinking ,
In every stretch of the way the fish saw and learned new things .
How the fish liked turning somersaults , tumbling down waterfalls , and swimming again .
The fish felt the warmth of the sun and grew strong .
At one place a deer was hastily drinking some water .
The little fish greeted her .
" Pretty deer , why are you in such a hurry ? "
" A hunter is following me , " replied the deer .
" I 've been hit by a bullet ... right here ! "
The little fish did n't see the bullet hole , but from the deer 's limping gait knew she was telling the truth .
At one place turtles were napping in the sun 's warmth .
At another place the boisterous noise of partridges twisted through the valley .
The fragrance of mountain grass floated through the air and mixed with the water .
In the afternoon the fish reached a spot where the valley widened and the water passed through the center of a grove of trees .
There was so much water that the little black fish had a really good time .
Later on the fish came upon a school of fish .
The little fish had not seen any other fish since leaving home .
Several tiny fish surrounded Little Black Fish and said :
" You must be a stranger here ! "
" Yes , " responded the black fish , " I 'm a stranger .
I 've come from far away . "
" Where do you want to go ? " asked the tiny fish .
" I 'm going to find the end of the stream , " replied the black fish .
" Which stream ? "
" This very stream we 're swimming in , " answered the black fish .
" We call this a river , " stated the tiny fish .
The black fish did n't say anything .
" Do n't you know that the pelican lives along the way ? " inquired one of the tiny fish .
" Yes , I know , " answered the black fish .
" Do you know what a big wide pouch the pelican has ? " asked another .
" I know that too , " replied the black fish .
" In spite of all this , you still want to go ? " exclaimed the tiny fish .
" Yes , " said the black fish , " whatever happens , I must go . "
Soon a rumor spread among all the fish that a little black fish had come from far away and wanted to find the end or the river .
And the fish was n't even afraid of the pelican !
Several tiny fish were tempted to go with the black fish but did n't because they were afraid of the grown - ups .
Others said , " If there were n't a pelican , we would come with you .
We 're afraid of the pelican 's pouch . "
A village was on the edge of the river .
Village women and girls were washing dishes and clothes in the river .
The little fish listened to their chatter for a while and watched the children bathing , then set off .
The fish went on and on and on , still farther on , until night fell , then lay down under a rock to sleep .
The fish woke in the middle of the night and saw the moon shining into the water and lighting up everything .
The little black fish liked the moon very much .
On nights when the moon shone into the water , the fish longed to creep out from under the moss and speak with her .
But Mother would always wake up , pull the fish under the moss , and make it go to sleep again .
The little fish looked up at the moon and said
" Hello , my lovely moon ! "
" Hello , Little Black Fish .
What brings you here ? "
" I 'm traveling around the world . "
" The world is very big , " said the moon .
" You ca n't travel everywhere . "
" That 's okay , " said the fish .
" I 'll go everywhere I can . "
" I 'd like to stay with you till morning , " said the moon , " but a big black cloud is coming toward me to block out my light . "
" Beautiful moon !
I like your light so much .
I wish you 'd always shine on me . "
" My dear fish , the truth is , I do n't have any light of my own .
The sun gives me light and I reflect it to the earth .
Tell me , have you heard that humans want to fly up and land on me in a few years ? "
" That 's impossible , " exclaimed the fish .
" It 's a difficult task , " said the moon , " but whatever they want , humans can ... "
The moon could n't finish her sentence .
The dark cloud approached and covered her face .
The night became dark again , and the black fish was alone .
The fish looked at the darkness in surprise and amazement for several seconds , then crept under a rock and fell asleep .
The fish woke up early in the morning and saw overhead several tiny fish chattering .
When they saw that the black fish was awake , they said in one voice :
" Good morning ! "
The black fish recognized them right away and said , " Good morning !
You followed me after all ! "
" Yes , " answered one of the tiny fish , " but we 're still afraid . "
" The thought of the pelican just wo n't go away , " said another .
" You worry too much , " said the black fish .
" One should n't worry all the time .
Let 's start out and our fears will vanish completely . "
But as they were about to set out , they felt the water all around them rise up and a lid was placed over them .
It was dark everywhere and there was no way to escape .
The black fish immediately realized that they had been caught in the pelican 's pouch .
" My friends , " said the little black fish , " we 've been caught in the pelican 's pouch , but there 's a chance to escape . "
All the tiny fish began to cry .
On of them said , " There 's no way to escape !
It 's your fault since you influenced us and led us astray . "
" Now he 's going to swallow us all , and then we 'll die , " said another .
Suddenly the sound of frightening laughter twisted through the water .
It was the pelican .
He kept on laughing and said , " What tiny fish I 've caught !
Ha. Ha .
Truly , my heart bleeds for you .
I do n't want to swallow you !
Ha , Ha ... "
The tiny fish began pleading , " Your Excellency , Mr. Pelican !
We 've been hearing about you for a long time .
If you'd be so kind as to open your distinguished beak a little so that we might go out , we 'll always be grateful to you . "
" I do n't want to swallow you right now , " said the pelican .
" I 've some fish stored .
Look below . "
Several large and tiny fish were scattered on the bottom of the pouch .
" Your Excellency , Mr. Pelican ! " cried the tiny fish , " we have n't done anything .
We 're innocent .
This little black fish led us astray ... "
" Cowards ! " exclaimed the little black fish , " are you crying like this because you think this dishonest bird is merciful ? "
" You do n't know what you 're saying , " said the tiny fish .
" Just wait and see ... His Excellency , Mr. Pelican , will pardon us and swallow you ! "
" Of course I 'll pardon you , " said the pelican .
" But on one condition . "
" Your condition , please , sir ! " begged the tiny fish .
" Strangle that meddlesome fish , and then you 'll get your freedom . "
The little black fish moved aside and said to the tiny fish ,
" Do n't agree !
This deceitful bird wants to turn us against each other .
I have a plan ... "
But the tiny fish were so intent on saving themselves that they could n't think of anything else .
They advanced towards the little black fish who was sitting near the back of the pouch and talking slowly .
" Cowards !
Whatever happens , you 've been caught and do n't have a way to escape .
And you 're not strong enough to hurt me . "
" We must strangle you , " said the tiny fish .
" We want freedom ! "
" You 've lost your senses , " said the black fish .
" Even if you strangle me , you wo n't escape .
Do n't fall for his tricks ... "
" You 're talking like this just to save yourself , " said the tiny fish .
" Otherwise you would n't think of us at all . "
" Just listen , " said the black fish , " and I 'll explain .
I 'll pretend I 'm dead .
Then , we 'll see whether or not the pelican will free you .
If you do n't agree to this , I 'll kill all of you with this dagger or rip open the pouch and escape while you ... " " Enough ! " interrupted one of the fish .
" I can't stand this talk .
Oh , wee ...oh , wee ... oh wee ... " >
" Why did you ever bring along this crybaby ? " demanded the black fish upon seeing him cry .
Then the fish took out the dagger and held it in front of the tiny fish .
Helpless , they agreed to the little fish 's suggestion .
They pretended to be fighting together .
The black fish pretended to be dead .
The others went forward and said , " Your Excellency , Mr. Pelican , we strangled the meddlesome black fish ... "
" Good work ! " laughed the pelican .
" Now , as a reward , I 'm going to swallow all of you alive so that you can have a nice stroll in my stomach ! "
The tiny fish never had a chance .
Quick as lightening they passed through the pelican 's throat and were gone .
But , at that very instant , the black fish drew the dagger , split open the wall of the pouch with one blow and fled .
The pelican cried out in pain and smashed his head on the water but he could n't follow after the little fish .
The black fish went on and on and still farther on until it was noon .
The river had passed through the mountains and valleys and now was flowing across a level plain .
Several other smaller rivers had joined it from the right and the left , increasing its water greatly .
The black fish was enjoying the immensity of the water .
Soon the fish realized the water had no bottom .
The fish swam this way and that way and did n't touch anywhere .
There was so much water that the little fish got lost in it !
No matter how far the fish swam , still the water was endless .
Suddenly , the fish noticed a large , long creature charging forward like lightening .
There was a two - edged sword in front of its mouth .
The little fish thought , " The swordfish !
He 's going to cut me to pieces this very instant ! "
Quickly the fish jumped out of the way and swam to the surface .
After a while the fish went under the water again to look for the bottom .
On the way the fish met a school of fish - thousands and thousands of fish .
" Friend , " said the fish to one of them , " I 'm a stranger .
I 've come from far away .
Where is this place ? "
The fish called his friends and said , " Look !
Another ... "
Then replied to the black fish , " Friend , welcome to the sea . "
Another said , " All rivers and streams flow here , except some which flow into swamps . "
" You can join our group anytime you wish , " said one of the fish .
The little black fish was happy to have reached the sea and said , " I 'd like to travel around first , then I 'll come join your group .
I 'd like to be with you the next time you pull down the fisherman 's net . "
" You 'll get your wish soon , " answered one of the fish .
" Now go explore .
But if you swim to the surface , watch our for the heron who is n't afraid of anyone these days .
She does n't stop bothering us till she 's caught four or five fish a day . "
The black fish then left the group of sea fish and began swimming .
A little later the fish came to the surface of the sea .
A warm sun was shining .
The little black fish enjoyed feeling the sun 's bright rays on its back .
Calm and happy , the fish was swimming on the surface of the sea and thinking , " Death could come upon me very easily now .
But as long as I 'm able to live , I should n't go out to meet death .
Of course , if someday I should be forced to face death - as I shall - it does n't matter .
What does matter is the influence that my life or death will have on the lives of others . . . "
The little black fish was n't able to pursue these thoughts .
A heron dived down , swooped up the fish , and carried it off .
Caught in the heron's long beak , the little fish kicked and waved but could n't get free .
The heron had grabbed the fish 's waist so tightly that its life was ebbing away .
After all , how long can a little fish stay alive out of water ?
" If only the heron would swallow me this very instant , " thought the fish , " then the water and moisture inside her stomach would prevent my death at least for a few minutes . "
The fish addressed the heron with this thought in mind .
" Why do n't you swallow me alive ?
I 'm one of those fish whose body becomes full of poison after death . "
The heron did n't reply .
She thought , " Oh , a tricky one !
What are you up to ?
You want to get me talking so you can escape ! "
Dry land was visible in the distance .
It got closer and closer .
" If we reach dry land , " thought the fish , " all is finished . "
" I know you want to take me to your children , " said the fish , " but by the time we reach land , I 'll be dead , and my body will become a sack full of poison .
Why do n't you have pity for your children ? "
" Precaution is also a virtue ! " thought the heron .
" I can eat you myself and catch another fish for my children .
. . but let 's see . . . could this be a trick ?
No , you can't do anything . "
As the heron thought she noticed that the black fish 's body was limp and motionless .
" Does this mean you 're dead , " thought the heron .
" Now I ca n't even eat you !
I 've ruined such a soft and delicate fish for no reason at all ! "
" Hey little one ! " she called to the black fish .
" Are you still half alive so that I can eat you ? "
But she did n't finish speaking because the moment she opened her beak , the black fish jumped and fell down .
The heron realized how badly she 'd been tricked and dived after the little black fish .
The fish streaked through the air like lightening .
The fish had lost its senses from thirst for sea water and thrust its dry mouth into the moist wind of the sea .
But as soon as the fish splashed into the water and took a new breath , the heron caught up and this time swallowed the fish so fast that the fish did n't understand what had happened .
The fish only sensed that everywhere was wet and dark .
There was no way out .
The sound of crying could be heard .
When the fish 's eyes had become accustomed to the dark , it saw a tiny fish crouched in a corner , crying .
He wanted his mother .
The black fish approached and said :
" Little one ! . . . Get up !
Think about what we should do .
What are you crying for ?
Why do you want your mother ? "
" You there . . . Who are you ? " responded the tiny fish .
" Ca n't you see ? ... I 'm ... dy... ing . O , me ...oh , my ...oh , oh ... mama ... I ... I can't come with you to pull the fisherman 's net to the bottom of the sea any more ... oh , oh ...oh , oh ! "
" Enough , there ! " said the little fish .
" You 'll disgrace all fish . "
After the tiny fish had controlled his crying , the little fish continued , " I want to kill the heron and find peace of mind to all fish .
But first , I must send you outside so that you do n't ruin everything . "
" You 're dying yourself , " replied the tiny fish .
" How can you kill the heron ? "
The little fish showed the dagger .
" From right inside here , I 'm going to rip open her stomach .
Now listen to what I say .
I 'm going to start tossing back and forth in order to tickle the heron .
As soon as she opens her mouth and begins to laugh , you jump out . "
" Then what about you ? " asked the tiny fish .
" Do n't worry about me .
I 'm not coming out until I 've killed this good - for - nothing . "
The black fish stopped talking and began tossing back and forth and tickling the heron 's stomach .
The tiny fish was standing ready at the entrance of the heron 's stomach .
As soon as the heron opened her mouth and began to laugh , the tiny fish jumped out and fell into the water .
But no matter how long he waited , there was n't any sign of the black fish .
Suddenly , he saw the heron twist and turn and cry out .
Then she began to beat her wings and fell down .
She splashed into the water .
She beat her wings again , then all movement stopped .
But there was no sign of Little Black Fish , and since that time , nothing has been heard .
The old fish finished her tale and said to her 12,000 children and grandchildren , " Now it 's time to sleep , children .
Go to bed . "
" Grandmother ! " exclaimed the children and grand - children , " You did n't say what happened to that tiny fish . "
" We 'll leave that for tomorrow night , " said the old fish .
" Now , it 's time for bed .
Goodnight . "
Eleven thousand , nine hundred and ninety - nine little fish said goodnight and went to sleep .
The grandmother fell asleep too .
But try as she might , a little red fish could n't get to sleep .
All night long she thought about the sea .....

THE TRUTH ABOUT HALLOWEEN
There are many versions of halloween .
This is one of them .
Do some major Deliverance on yourself for ever celebrating halloween .
Burn any left over halloween stuff in your home .
Do n't even open your doors to pass out " tracts " .
If you do , then you are celebrating this unholy day .
No matter what you think of halloween , know that it is the very highest satanic holy day .
As a Christian , you should not be observing it in any way , especially IN your church .
The catholic church is responsible for this day to be placed in the church .
Halloween has never been a Christian holiday , and it has no place in the life of a born again Believer in JESUS CHRIST .
In fact , it is an abomination to God , and we should take our stand firmly against it .
As we look at its history , we find that its roots go deep into heathenism , paganism , satanism and the occult ; and its modern expression is no better .
HISTORY OF HALLOWEEN
Celtic New Year
October 31 is the most important day in the satanic year .
[ It is known as the devil 's birthday . ]
It marks the Celtic new year .
It was the end of the growing season .
It became a festival of death .
On this day , the god of the Celtics was to have called up the spirits of the wicked dead who had died during the past year .
At the same time , other evil spirits arose and went about the countryside harassing the people .
On October 31 , the Celtics expected to be harassed by ghosts , evil spirits and demons ; and it was no fun and games to them .
They would light bonfires to guide the spirits to their own town and to ward off evil spirits .
DRUIDS
The Celtics had priests called druids .
On October 31 , the druids went from house to house demanding certain foods , and all those who refused were cursed .
The people were tormented by means of magic .
As they went , the druids carried large turnips which they had hollowed out and on which they had carved demon faces as charms .
Each one was believed to contain the demon spirit that personally led or guided that priest : his little god .
DIVINATION
Those who practiced fortune telling and divination found that this was the night that they had the most success .
They called upon satan to bless their efforts .
One form of divination was to put apples in a tub and bob for them .
The one who first successfully came up with one without putting them in his teeth was to have good luck throughout the year .
They would then peel the apples and throw the peeling over their shoulders and then quickly look around .
They expected to see a vision or an apparition of the one they were to marry .
SACRIFICES
These things happened several centuries before CHRIST .
Sacrifices were made to the gods , especially the god of death - Samhain ( pronounced Sah win ) .
Sacrifices all the way from vegetable to human were offered .
This went on and on , and , in some parts of the world , still goes on today .
8th CENTURY
In the 8th century , the Pope , in an effort to get the people to quit the festival of Sam hain , invented All Saints Day ( Nov. 1 ) .
This was an attempt to get the people to turn away from the horrible observance of Sam hain .
All Saints Day was intended to honor the martyrs of the Roman persecutions .
It did not work !
It never works to Christianize a pagan holiday .
The holy and the profane do not mix .
THE MIDDLE AGES
In the Middle Ages , there was a great revival of satanic practices and witchcraft and magic - like there is today .
During this time the belief developed that witches traveled on broomsticks to the black Sabbaths to worship satan on October 31 .
They were guided by spirits in the form of black cats .
The Druids worshiped cats believing them to be reincarnated evil people .
CHURCH INVOLVEMENT
This festival of death has survived all the efforts of the church to stamp it out .
The church is joining the opposition by celebrating this festival .
All Saints Day became All Hallows Day .
Hallow means holy or sacred .
October 31 is the evening before All Hallows Day and came to be called in the western world all hallows evening and then all hallows een .
Een is an abbreviation for evening .
Finally , the word was reduced to the way we have it today , Halloween .
That 's where the name came from , and even if it is called all hallows evening , it has nothing to do with Christian faith , and it never did .
MODERN HALLOWEEN
Now let 's look at the present day celebration of Halloween .
Is n't the whole theme one of darkness , death , fear , threats , destruction and evil ?
There are witches , broomsticks , bats , owls , ghosts , skeletons , death , and monsters .
You dress up your children as demons and witches and ghouls and monsters and werewolves and send them out into the street in the darkness to reenact the Druids ' practice of demanding food from people under threat of tricks ( or curses ) if they do n't comply .
You take , not a turnip , but a pumpkin and carve demon faces in it and decorate with it .
At Halloween there will be apple bobbing , divination , fortune telling , haunted houses , candles lit and spirits called up .
There will be seances and ouija boards in the name of fun and excitement .
There will be sacrifices of dogs , cats , rats , chickens , goats and even humans !
You say , " Well , we do n't take it seriously . "
But the devil does and so does God .
Particularly this is true when the Church which He purchased with His own precious blood builds houses of horror in its fellowship halls so that the little lambs who have been entrusted to its care can be terrified and opened up to invading spirits of fear and torment and confusion .
How this must Grieve the Lord !

A . Three hundred years before JESUS was born ; among a group of people called the Celtics who lived throughout the British Isles , Scandinavia and western Europe .
Q. Who started it ?
A. A secret society of priests and pagans called the Druids , who served the demonic god of death -- Samhain .
Q. How did the custom begin ?
A. Each year on Oct. 31 , the Druids celebrated the eve of the Celtic new year with the Festival of Samhain .
Q. What did the Druid priests do during the festival ?
A . They would go from house to house demanding all sorts of foods to offer to Samhain .
If the village people would not give them the foods , they would speak a curse over the home .
History claims then that someone in the family would die within a year .
This was the origin of " trick or treat . "
Q. Where did the Jack - O - Lantern come from ?
A . When the Druids were going house to house seeking food for Samhain , they would carry a large turnip that had been hollowed out .

The name of the SPIRIT eventually became JOCK .
Q . How did pumpkins come to be used and where did the name Jack - O - Lantern come from ?
A . When the practice came to America in the 18th and 19th centuries , turnips were n't that prominent , so the pumpkin was substituted .
JOCK became Jack , who lives in the lantern or Jack - O - Lantern .
Q. Where did the name Halloween come from ?
A. During the ninth century , the pope declared Nov. 1 be called All Saints '
Day and would be set aside to honor all the martyred saints of the Catholic church .
Oct. 31 became the eve of All Saints ' Day .
The Mass said on All Saints ' Day was the Allhallowmas .
Over the years , the evening before All Saints '
Day became known as All Hallow 's Eve , All Hallowed Eve , All Hallow E'en and finally Halloween .
Q . Where did the tradition of dressing in costumes come from ?
A . In Ireland , during the festival of Samhain , children would dress like IMPS and fairies to lead the ghosts and goblins out of town after the Feast of Samhain .
In England , after All Saints '
Day was created , children would dress in each other 's clothes and go door - to - door begging for soul cakes .
Here is a letter that can be sent to " Letters to the Editor " .
It is 200 words long .
" HALLOWEEN , TRICK OR TREAT ?
You can call a duck a horse , cow , cat , etc. , but it is still a duck .
You can call what you do a " fall festival " , " alleluia party " , etc. , but you are still observing halloween , even if you dress up as bible characters .
Halloween is the highest satanic holy day of the year .
On October 31st , the high priest of all witch covens are required to make a human sacrifice .
God condemns witches and everything to do with them .
The head of the first satanic church said , " a witch is a witch " , when referring to black and white witchcraft .
All their power comes from the devil .
People think it 's funny to scare people to " death " .
II TIMOTHY 1:7 says , " For God has not given to us the spirit of fear ... " .
So guess who is scaring you ?
Tell your children the truth about halloween .
Revelation 21:8 says liars wo n't make it to heaven .
Then , parents , you will be doing your job as the high priest of the family like you are suppose to be .
If you open your doors to pass out tracts , you are still observing halloween .
Why do n't you pass them out another time ?
Stop being worldly , Christians . "
The following article came from THE CLARION - LEDGER of Jackson , Mississippi on July 13 , 1996 :
" CHURCH'S HELL HOUSE GOING NATIONWIDE WITH HOW -TO KITS
Arvada , Colo . --
A controversial Halloween spectacle called Hell House , dramatizing real - life horrors from abortion to teen suicide , is being marketed nationwide .
The Abundant Christian Life Center , which produced last year 's Hell House , is SELLING how - to kits to CHURCHES around the country for $ 149 .
For another $ 15 , the CHURCHES also can get the compact disk of Hell House 's awful sounds .
The CHURCH has spent about $ 10,000 marketing and producing the kits .
' God allowed this to happen for His glory and honor , ' said the Rev. Keenan Roberts , youth pastor and the writer - director of Hell House .
' And we needed to cultivate it and share something with such a radical impact .
We want to shake other cities like we did Denver . '
More than 5,000 people saw Hell House during the five nights it was staged last October .
At $ 5 a head , the CHURCH took in $ 25,000 last year and made a $ 17,000 profit .
Supporters say the gory dramatization , which included a ' funeral ' for a person who died of AIDS , a simulated abortion , and hell , was necessary to reach a sinful world .
But others call Hell House nothing more than a MONEYMAKING SCHEME that preaches hatred and intolerance . "

Spirit of Halloween
" For Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , " 1 Sam .

WITCHCRAFT - SATANISM
Witches are for Halloween or for superstitious primitives in seventeenth century Salem .
That seems to be the " modern " outlook sophisticated skepticism and a knowing smile when it comes to witchcraft .
And yet Time 's recent cover story would indicate that witchcraft is not a thing of the past .
Satan is not dead .
Young people by the thousands are probing seriously the mysteries of " the other side , " from seances to Satan worship .
Leading universities report over - enrolled courses on witchcraft . . . occult book sales have doubled in three years . . . most American high schools have their campus " witches and warlocks " . . .
And occasionally the headlines shatter our complacency with the terror of Manson - style violence .
Halloween is celebrated by children in the United States .
This issue is becoming debatable inside of Christian circles because of the rise of the occult in America .
Witchcraft - Satanism revivals and their obvious tie with pagan holiday causes Christians to question if the church should participate in Halloween .
Children are in costumes and masks with Halloween pumpkins of ' Jack O' Lanterns ' name for ( Will Wisps ) an ancient symbol of a damned soul , too long considered harmless fun , and innocent pranks .
Halloween is celebrated masquerading as Church fund - raising bazaars decorated with black cats and witches ; skeletons , scarecrows , haunted houses , bats , vampires and dummies in coffins .
It should not be integrated with the holiness of the scared house of God .
It 's wicked and brings curses , ( Deut . 11-36 , 28 . )
Some see it as evil and will have nothing to do with the celebration ; others as harmless fun partake fully : costume parties , Halloween decorations and ' trick - or - treat .
Still others try to find a " middle " approach , allowing trick - or - treat and masquerades , but as " Bible characters " instead of demonic and occult figures .
Some Churches are now seeing the influence of its fruit .
One cannot deny the occult - metaphysical nature of Halloween is not in line with the Christian in character .
Despite this clear contrast , Christians defend their complicity in the holiday asserting their " liberty " in Christ from the bondages of " legalism , " declaring it is only innocent fun !
God never gave us liberty to engage ourselves in evil !
" Learn not the way of the heathen . . . for the customs of the people are vain , " ( Jeremiah 10:2 - 3 ) .
" And what concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ?
For ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , " ( II Corinthians 6:15 - 17 ) .
THE SPIRIT WORLD
The Bible clearly teaches that there is both a natural , material world as well as an invisible and spiritual world .
The domain of physical human beings is the physical world , whereas the " heavenlies " are people or occupied by spirit beings .
Among these spirit beings there are two classes , the good and the evil .
In the Scriptures , both holy and unholy spirit beings are designated as angels ( Revelation 12:7 ) .
Unusually the unholy angels are referred to as demons , translated in the King James Version as devils .
They are called seraphim , cherubim , angels , principalities , powers , rulers of the darkness of this age , ( Ephesians 6:12 ) , thrones , dominions ( Colossians 1:16 ) , fallen angels ( 2 Peter 2:4 ) , spirits in prison ( I Peter 3:18 - 20 ) , demons , seducing spirits ( I Timothy 4:1 ) .
There are an " innumerable company of angels " , ( Hebrews 12:22 ) .
They are referred to as " mighty angels " but they are not almighty ( 2 Thessalonians 1:7 ) .
One angel destroyed 185,000 of the Assyrian army in a night ( 2 Kings 19:35 ) , .
One angel rolled away the stone from the tomb of Jesus and one angel will bind Satan and cast him into the " bottomless pit " .
They are glorious beings according to Luke 9:26 and they seem to posses great knowledge but they are not omniscient -- all know .
The angels are " all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister ( serve ) for them who shall be heirs of salvation " ( Hebrews 1:13 - 14 ) .
They are also responsible for ' taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ ' ( 2 Thessalonians 1:7-8 ) .
The chief of the fallen angels is an archangel who has at least forty names given in Scripture .
Some are proper names , others are descriptive .
For example , in Revelation 12:10 he is called the " accuser of the brethren " .
He is called " that old Serpent " , ( Revelation 20:2 ) , indicating his guile , Lucifer , " Son of the Morning " , ( Isaiah 14:12 ) , his title when he fell .
Devil means " accuser or slanderer " , and it is of Greek origin ( Revelation 12:9 ) .
Satan means " adversary or resister " , and is of Hebrew origin ; " Apollon " , means " destroyer " , the term " Dragon " .
speaks of his power .
He is also called " Prince of devils . " ( Matthew 9:34 ) , " Prince of this world " , ( John 12:31 ) , " Belial " , is implied to be his title in II Corinthians 6:15 .
In II Kings 1 : 2 , 6 , 16 , he is referred to as " Beelzebub " , implying a prince of demons .
As Dr. Lewis S. Chafer says , " In power , prominence and importance , Satan appears in the Bible second only to the Trinity . "
Two of his most powerful names are :
" The prince of the power of the air " , ( Ephesians 2:2 ) and " the god of this world " , ( age ) ( 2 Corinthians 4:4 ) .
Satan 's origin is shrouded in mystery .
There are two passages of Scripture to explain his origin .
Ezekiel 28:11 - 19 and Isaiah 14:12 - 17 .
Dr. Chafer points out the " Demon influence , like their activity , is prompted by two motives : both to hinder the purpose of God for humanity , and to extend the authority of Satan .
They therefore , at the command of their king , willingly cooperate in all his God- dishonoring undertakings .
This influence is exercised both to mislead the unsaved and to wage an increasing war against the believer , " ( Eph. 6:12 ) .
Derek Prince writes , " Today , by divine providence , the veils of convention and carnality are once again being drawn aside , and the church of Jesus Christ is being confronted by the same manifest opposition of demon power that confronted the church of the New Testament .
In these circumstances , the church must once again explore the resources of authority and power made available to her through the truth of the Scripture , the anointing of the Holy Spirit , and the Name and the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ . "
The Bible warns : " Be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour , " ( I Peter 5:8 ) .
He is after you , your family and your children !
THE BATTLE TODAY
No one can dabble in the occult and come away unshackled .
It is not harmless games and fun .
Occult involvement whether done innocently or not , is disobedience to God 's Word .
When people ignore God 's warning and enter a forbidden realm , they witness spiritual phenomenons .
The Devil does have supernatural power .
However , everything he does for people , he requires payment .
The result of occult involvement causes oppression , depression , confusion , delusion , and physical ailments of all sorts .
We are warned not to be ignorant of Satan 's devices in ( II Corinthians 2:11 ) .
Playing with the occult has become very attractive to Americans .
Every where you go , you will witness occult activity .
It is blatant .
Psychic and astrologers are using 900 numbers .
Occult themes are being worked into many television programs .
Talk shows are featuring astrologers , divinatory , clairvoyants , scientologists , Satanists , witches , psychics , crystal gazers , dream analysis , yoga , reincarnations , hypnotists , fortune - tellers , spiritualists , parapsychologists , numerologists and New Agers .
Even Disney
World is deeply involved in the promotion of the occult .
" Many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh .
This is a deceiver and an Antichrist .
Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God .
If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds , " 2 John 7 .
Michael Harper writes these encouraging words : " These wicked beings can suggest evil , but cannot coerce the will of another creature .
They may spread snares and device to ruin the children of God , but cannot compel any other being to comply with their designs , nor can they employ God 's creation other than as He decrees .
They have never been able to defeat God , and actually God uses them as instruments to correct the erring Saints .
See Luke 22:31 - 32 ; I Corinthians 5:5 ; I Timothy 1:20 .
Someone has remarked that Satan is like a monkey wrench which the Lord uses to tighten up loose nuts !
Be of good cheer , saints of God !
Satan is severely limited and all his bluster and bluff about " all power " is sham .
Our God is still on the throne and He rules !
Hallelujah !
Remember you choose to participate with the wiles of the devil .
You are also called to educate your children concerning his games .
" Success for the Christian will depend in a large measure on recognizing the work of the devil and knowing how to defeat and expel him from every situation ... " says Michael Harper .
ALL HALLOWS EVE
Halloween or ALL HALLOWS ' EVE , was originally a festival of fire for the dead and the powers of darkness .
It is the evening of 31 October , the night before the Christian festival of Hallows ' or ALL SAINTS DAY .
All Hallows '
Day commemorates the saints and martyrs , and was first introduced in the 7th century .
Its date was changed from May 13 to November 1 in the following century , probably to make it coincide with and Christianize a pagan festival of the dead .
All Souls ' Day in the Roman Catholic calendar is November 2 .
It is marked by prayers for the souls of the dead .
Before the coming of Christianity , the pagan Celts in northern Europe held two great fire festivals each year , Beltane on the eve of May 1 and Samhain on the eve of November 1 to mark the beginning of summer and winter .
These dates have no connection with the equinoxes or solstices , or with sowing and reaping , but seem to date from very early times when Celtic society depended heavily on cattle for subsistence .
Samhain marked the beginning of winter and was the time when the cattle were brought in from pasture to spend the winter under cover .
It was also the beginning of a new year .
Because the Celtic day started at sunset , and ran to the following sunset .
The festival began on the eve of November 1 .
Bonfires on high hills were a blatant feature of The Old Halloween rites , though in England they have been gradually transferred to November 5 to mark the arrest of Guy Fawkes .
In the 1860 's a traveler in Scotland counted 30 fires on the hilltops between Dunkeld and Aberfeldy , each with a circle of people dancing round .
Down to the end of the 19th century , fires blazed on the hills in Lancashire on the eve of All Hallows .
In north Wales every family built a bond fire and each person threw into the ashes a white stone which he had previously marked .
Prayers were said round the fire and next morning if a stone was missing , it was thought that its owner would die before he saw another Halloween .
The same belief existed in the Scottish Highlands and many forms of fortune telling were a traditional feature of Halloween - probably because it was the Celtic New Year 's Day and so a suitable time for predicting the events of the coming years .
In Aberdeenshire and Buchan in the 19th century , boys collecting fuel for the bonfire would ask for ' peat ' to burn the witches .
When the fire was lit , the boys danced round it shouting " Fire !
Fire !
Burn the witches . "
When the fire died down , the ashes were scattered and when the last spark had gone out , the cry went up into the ominous darkness .
" The devil takes the hindmost " and they all ran for their lives .
In Wales ' the cropped black sow ' would take the hindmost .
All Hallows '
Eve was a night when the dead stalked the countryside .
Offerings of food and drink were put out for the ghosts .
They passed by to the west always , the direction of the dying sun at sunset .
The fairies could also be seen moving from one fairy hill to another with the music of bells and elf horns .
They were sometimes identified with the dead .
Darker and colder creatures still roamed through the night on Halloween - demons and hobgoblins , witches who straddled broomsticks or shank bones , flew in the sieve or eggshells , or rode on coal - black horses .
The fires helped to keep them off and at Balmoral in Queen Victoria 's time the effigy of a hideous old witch was ceremoniously burned on a bonfire at Halloween .
The guisers went from house to house , singing and dancing .
Their bloodcurdling masks and grotesque costumes may have been meant to keep evil at bay or , more likely , were some visible representations of the ghosts and goblins that lurked in the night .
The masks have now been transferred to the children who , in the United States , visit the neighbors for the food - offerings which once belonged to the dead - or play tricks akin to the legendary destructiveness of witches and imps abroad on this night .
" When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abomination of those nations , " ( Deut. 18 -9 ) .
MASKS
A very popular Halloween custom is the wearing of masks , ( false faces ) such as , witches masks , devil masks , cat masks , bat masks , monster masks , and the list goes on .
People hide behind all sorts of ' masks . '
Some hide behind ' hats ' and still others , including many of today 's youth , and others , hides behind dark sunglasses .
From earliest times , people all over the world have worn masks for all sorts of reasons . . . droughts , epidemics , or other disasters .
They hoped that the demons who had brought the disaster would see the mask and think they were demons , too , and be frightened off .
In imaginative primitive societies , a mask was more than a means of changing one 's appearance ; it was a link with the world of the spirits , a channel by which men could tap the forces of the supernatural .
The wearing of a mask was believed to change a man 's identity and personalities , for the assumed appearance was believed to affect the wearer 's inner nature and to assimilate it to that of the being represented by the mask .
During the middle ages , witches often put on masks or smeared their faces with soot and paint .
People of nobility attending a witch 's Sabbath would always arrive ' masked . '
Masks can be divided into two categories , the religious and the profane .
Masks are worn by the dancers in the religious ceremonies of West African Tribes .
The theater of ancient Greece is an example of the secular use of the mask .
The use of the masks enabled actors to double and triple the number of parts they could play during any one performance .
Protection against supernatural dangers is a function of masks worn in certain ritual situations , such as at funerals .
This is done ' in order to avoid recognition by the souls of the dead . '
Masks are sometimes worn by ' warriors ' to symbolize a superior power by identifying themselves with this force .
While there are civilizations where the mask plays an important role in ritual activities , there are regions of the world where the wearing of a mask is unknown .
Masks are worn in some initiation ceremonies of certain organizations .
The wearer of the mask partakes of the power of the divinity or spirit which the mask symbolizes .
Thus , the wearer of the mask is believed to be elevated above the common mass of the uninitiated .
PAGANISM OCCULT
History traces to the ancient religion of the Druid , a religion so evil that Rome forbad its practice .
The American Peoples Encyclopedia explains , " The origin of Halloween customs antedate Christianity .
The Druids ( members of pagan orders in Britain , Ireland and Gual ) Festival of Samhain .
It was a night of ghosts and faeries , in which bonfires were built and futures were foretold and witches rode through the sky . "
Superstitions linking cats with reincarnation made them special objects of notice on Halloween .
Numerous legends surrounded the holiday , but two significant things supposedly occurred on that night :
First , it was believed that the dead would rise out of their graves and wander the countryside , trying to return to the homes where they formerly lived .
Frightened villagers tried to appease these wandering spirits by offering them gifts of fruits and nuts .
If not placated villagers , feared that the spirits would kill their flocks or destroy their property .
This the origin of our present day Trick - or - treat !
In a custom born out of superstition , and pagan superstition at that !
Also , it 's a blasphemous perversion of the Christian belief in the Resurrection , in a glorified , immortal body .
In Druidism , the dead are raised as horrifying creatures of the night , hideous monsters , decaying skeletons , vampires , etc. , they received not glorified bodies but grotesque ones ; not immortal bodies but inhuman ones .
Second , Samhain was the supreme night of Demonic jubilation .
This was a celebration of the beginning of ' Winter and Darkness , ' as day light grew noticeably shorter , and night lengthier .
The hoards of hell would roam the earth in a wild celebration of darkness and death , all in honor of Samhain !
The poor mortal forced to travel on such a night !
The only thing the superstitious people knew to do to protect themselves on such an occasion was to masquerade as one of the demonic hoard , and hopefully blend in unnoticed among them !
This is the origin of Halloween masquerading as devils , imps , orgres , and other demonic creatures .
STATEMENT WITCHES IN MODERN TIME
Bats . . .
Brooms . . .
Witches . . .
Ghouls . . .
Ghosts . . .
Goblins . . .
. Skeletons . . . Jack o' Lanterns . . . every type of gory , ugly thing that can be imagined and people dressed as creatures of the world of the dead or the unknown world of hobgoblins and devils .
The modern sophisticate , who does not realistically face the evil and danger surrounding this time of year , may say , " Witches are for Halloween .
It is a time for children to visit the neighborhood to get candy and apples .
There is no harm in celebrating Halloween with its witches and devils . "
To some , ' witches ' are figments of the imaginations of the superstitious seventeenth century Salem primitives .
If witches are for Halloween - a thing of the past , then why are so many young people and older ones alike being swept into the grips of Satan by ' dabbling ' in those things which relate to him ?

Anyone informed about witchcraft would tell you that there are certain rituals and spells that can only be cast on Halloween night .
That is the night when the " veil " believed to separate the living from the dead is thought to be the thinnest and futures are easier and more accurately foretold by diviners .
Those who oppose Christ are known to organize on Halloween to observe Satanic rituals , to cast spells , to oppose churches and families , to perform sacrilegious acts , and to even offer blood sacrifices to Satan .
Last year , newscasters in numerous cities warned their viewers to guard their animals on Halloween nights .
Dogs and cats are thought to be the most often sacrificed animals on Halloween .
In rural communities it is not uncommon for farmers to awake to find the mutilated remains of their farm animals ( cows , calves , chickens , even horses ) that were ritualistically slaughtered in Satanic sacrifices .
The practices that accompany such rites are almost too revolting to believe - the drinking of animal ( or human ) blood and urine , the digestion of entrails and orgiastic rituals , substance abuse becoming more frighteningly common across the U. S. , as is human sacrifice .
Paulus Grillandus said of the practice of witchcraft : " Those witches who have solemnly devoted themselves to the Devil 's service , worship him in a particular manner with ceremonial sacrifices , which they offer to the Devil , imitating in all respects the worship of Almighty God , with vestments , lights , and other ritual observance , so that they worship and praise him , just as we worship the true God . "
THE HALLOWEEN WITCH
If you thought Halloween was a time for cornstalks , pumpkins , apples , and apple cider - a time for children dressed in cute costumes of witches , goblins , ghosts or devils to knock at you door call " trick or treat , " you had better wise up .
There is more to Halloween . . . much more !
Halloween is not children 's play .
It is an abomination in the eyes of God !
The Halloween Witch is a strange - looking female in black cloak and peaked hat riding a broomstick along with her symbolic cat .
Her name is derived from the Saxon word wica , which means " wise one . "
Artists of the Middle Ages often showed witches preparing to fly off to one of their Sabbaths .
It was believed that angels and devils were supposed to be able to fly , so it was easy to believe that witches , too , could fly .
The broomstick , originally made from a stalk of the broom plant with a bunch of leaves at the head , was said to be used by poor witches who went on foot .
The broom or pole was used to vault over brooks , streams or thorny patches .
Due to its use as an indoor cleaning tool , the broom became the symbol of women .
Before setting out for a Sabbath , witches would rub ' Sacred ' ointment called ' unguent ' into their pores .
One ingredient in the ointment confused the mind .
Another speeded up the witch 's pulse .
Still , another numbed the feet .
This gave them a feeling of flying .
If they had been fasting , the ointment seemed to make them feel even giddier .
Bat blood was another ingredient in that ointment .
In England , during initiation ceremonies , new witches were sometimes blindfolded , smeared with the unguent , then placed on a broom .
The pealing of church bells was believed to be a defense against aerial witches .
In the Slav countries people used to fire muskets at the clouds , screaming as they did so , " Curse , curse Herodius , thy mother is a heathen damned of God , " while others laid scythes and bill hooks on the ground , edge upward , to assure that the witches would not have a safe landing .
The black of a witch 's cloak reminds us that Halloween is a " festival of the dead . "
TRADITIONS OF WITCHES
Trick and Treat is the fun time of many unsuspecting children and adults , but the " trick " is really on the one who is playing right into the trap of the devil .
Halloween is a day of celebration for the devil and his worshipers .
The cauldrons are boiling ; potions are brewing ; the yule logs are blazing ; the forces of Satan are in their height in rituals and ceremonies .
The powers of the demonic world are loosed and they are running around crazily seeking bodies to enter .
Real witches held high revels on All Hallows '
Eve and this was one of the ways in which they preserved pagan customs .
The witches of Aberdeen in 1596 said that they had danced round the market cross at midnight on Halloween and also round an old grey stone at the foot of the hill at Craigleuch , the Devil himself playing music before them .
MODERN WITCHES HAVE KEPT UP THE TRADITION
In 1963 , for instance , a journalist watched the Halloween festivities of a coven of witches at St. Albans .
The high priestess , naked except for a string of beads and watched by the other 12 members of the coven , drew a circle on the ground with the point of her magic knife .
A candle burned in each quarter of the circle , with a fifth candle on an altar in the middle .
The reporter did not reveal the details of the ceremony but he did record a remark of the high priestess .
" We are not anti-Christian , she said , we just have other means of spiritual satisfaction .
It 's hard to describe that satisfaction . "

WITCH GIVES INSIGHT TO MODERN RITUALS
Rev. Irene A. Park , gives insight to modern rituals .
Secret ceremonials , rituals , obligations and covenants are being kept by cultists and Satanists on particular days and nights .
Multitudes are gathering in worship , prayer , and sacrifices to the god of the world , Lucifer .
Family spirits gather like a family reunion or holiday celebration in the natural or earthly realm ; only these are the demon spirits of the departed dead that gather for rituals and sacrifice , ( not ghosts but devils ) .
Some of the demon spirits gather for rituals and sacrifice , some of the demon spirits present at the celebration come from embodied living clans or tribal members , ( demons who lived in these people while they were alive ) .
These are the ones that are vying for the powers .
Some come just to celebrate the traditional gathering and festivity's .
Sometimes the assignments that the demon spirits receive bring about rebellion in the supernatural Satanic realm .
The spirits want to continue to control the area they are in , whether body , nation , society , system or whatever control they received for their obedience to Satan .
They do not want to be dislodged .
They like to continue to embody members of the same family ; they prefer humans but will settle for animals .
Millions of people are vying for power , supernatural powers of evil to work curses , hexes , spells , power to manipulate , controlling power over lesser forces of darkness and power to control this present world system !
A reformed witch once told me that vying for power meant that a supernatural battle ensues between the other covens .
Whosoever demonstrated the greatest power won the control of certain areas , such as seas , cities , etc .
Satan would give the witch a part of all illegal finances collected in her area .
For instance , Laura Cabot has political control over Salem , Massachusetts and maybe over the entire state .
Recently when Jeff Fendhold visited her occult book store , within thirty seconds the policemen were on the scene driving police cars with the symbols of a flying witch on the side .
Then the Attorney General of that state called Jeff saying that he was wanted by the law for " harassing witches ! "
Christians had better wake up and begin old time prayer meetings for this nation !
Dr. Parks writes , " Many of the people are saturated in demonology with demonic spirits and are already in control of government establishments , militaries , religious organizations , financial systems , educational institutions , etc .
These spirits are superior and receive their origin in Satan and are under the powers of the familiar spirits ( spirit guides ) that work divination and will only impart power to those totally yielded to obedience and in every obligation required by Lucifer .
Witches , druids , wizards , magicians , sorcerers , pagans of every breed are in high mass , tribe and clan leaders are calling a reunion in the supernatural realm .
These are Sabbaths to the worshipers of Satan , " people in the occult , " and they take these days very seriously .
Christians should begin to pray for their families , church leaders , and cover the children with the blood of Jesus and the protection of God during these days .
There is no question that human sacrifices are occurring .
Bind the powers of darkness and lose the power of God according Matt.
18:18 .
( There are more than two million children missing every year .
Many too young to run away .
At least 7,000 are found dead every year ) .
Dr. Parks says , " The highest Sabbath mass is the eve of October 31 .
This a time of proclaiming powers for control and leadership in the Satanic realm world systems .
There are blood sacrifices offered up to the god of Baal worship , the sun god Ra , and to the goddess of fertility Diana .
Christians should begin their defensive spiritual warfare weeks before Halloween .
Witches begin their preparation on the 18th day of October .
" On the 18th day of October , faithful followers of evils spirits gather for 13 days before the eve of Halloween of Sabbath .
During this time they offer sacrifices ( human or animal ) to the god of the spirit world , Satan .
These sacrifices are to obtain spiritual power .
All the followers must give a blood sacrifice ; some give their own blood , others offer an animal 's blood , the more power they want , the greater the sacrifice .
" There is every conceivable type of orgy happening from the 18th until 31st October .
Disembodied spirits loosed from the bodies of animals are being vied for by spiritualists , witches , druids , wizards and Satan worshipers .
All of the corrupt evil wickedness and vile filth one could imagine is happening .
Something is happening in the open , but most of the spiritual activity is well guarded from every corner of the earth at the command of the Lord Druid .
" And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . "
Ephesians 5:1 , 11 .
HOW TO BECOME BORN AGAIN
Accept God 's
Word that He loves you and wants to give you an abundant life .
" For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish , but have everlasting life , " ( John 3:16 . )
" I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly , " ( John 10:10 . )
1. Accept God 's word : that you are a sinner ; and this separates you from God : that you must truly repent or " turn away " from sin .
" For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God . " ( Rom. 3:23 ) .
" For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . . . " ( Rom. 6:23 . )
" But God commendeth
His love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us , " ( Rom. 5:8 . )
2. Accept that Jesus Christ is our only contact with God .
" Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me . " ( John 14:6 ) .
" For there is one God , and one mediator between God and man , the man Christ Jesus . " ( 2 Timothy 2:5 ) .
3. Receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord by your personal invitation .
" But as many as received Him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God , " ( John 1:12 ) .
" Behold I stand at the door and knock ;
If any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come into Him . . . " Christ speaking ( Revelation 3:20 . )
Do you feel Jesus moving in your heart right now ?
This is how He knocks .
Jesus wants in !
Will you receive Christ right now ?
You can be saved in seconds !
Open the door and Pray :
Dear Father , I 'm a lost sinner .
I repent .
Please forgive me and come into my heart and save me .
Thank
You for saving my soul !
In Jesus ' name , Amen .
If you are backslidden , say the same prayer .
The Lord loves you and will forgive you .
Obedience is the practical acceptance of the authority and will of God , including both the inward glad submission and the outward expressing of actions , reactions , words and thoughts .
Disobedience is evidence of rebellion and distrust in God , preference to self will and the lack of surrender to and desire for the will of God in all things .
God expects obedience ( Deut. 11:26 -28 ) .
To choose Christ is to choose obedience , ( John 14:15 , 21 ) .
To become disobedient is to sin or rebel against God 's expectation and rights ( I Sam . 15:22,23 )
" Behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse ; A blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
And a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known , " ( Deut. 11:26-28 ) .

The following comments were received from another ministry .
Bonfires :
The original word is bone fires .
The bones of the sacrificed animals or humans said to appease Satan and endue his followers with heightened powers .
Brooms for witches , wiccans , etc :
Were and are used as part of a coven ceremony to heighten sexual frenzy and evoke more demonic powers .
Pumpkins on porches with candles : Pumpkin on porch showed the people in the house has appeased evil spirits by giving of food , etc .
Candle in it showed the people had not given anything .
A member of their family was taken for sacrifice in the bone fire , while inward parts , usually fatty parts were put in the center of the hollowed out gourd with a wick in it .
This appeased the gods of the druids and cursed the people in the house .
Sacrifices :
The most pleasing sacrifice to Satan is something pure .
The highest is a child , preferably newborn .
Next a virgin , next an animal .
Prayers on Halloween Eve : Christians not informed about warfare and the power of the blood of Jesus are primary targets .
Every curse imaginable is loosed this night with heightened power to bring them to pass .
Some are immediate curses , some are curses that are spread out through the year , and some are " specialized curses " .
Terror and fear are always sent with each curse to the victim .
Most holidays are paganistic : Easter ( goddess of fertility ) , Christmas ( many pagan and idol things ) .
The one totally dedicated to Satan and his followers is Halloween .

THESE ARE SINS IN THE EYES OF GOD , AND ARE ALSO DEMONS .
THE BIBLE MAKES IT CLEAR THAT SIN CANNOT GET INTO HEAVEN .
For a digital bible , Wired has been turning surprisingly analog over the past year .
The latest regressions :
The publication just fired two top editors from Wired.com and may soon lose the founders of Reddit.com .
Wired.com managing editor Marty Cortinas and copy chief Tony Long were laid off last week , sources tell us , though it 's expected the two will stay on through the end of the year .
The loss of two people , even high ranking ones , might not seem too brutal but for the website 's recent history : it lost a quarter of its staff last November , along with a closely - aligned development executive at parent company CondéNet ; then in April it lost more staff , including managing editor Leander Kahney , two other full - time employees , an unknown number of freelancers and several writers at Wired Digital 's Ars Technica website .
On top of that , people close to the company whisper that the two founders of social news website Reddit , and potentially other staff , may soon be out the Wired door .
Co-founder Alexis Ohanian is planning a celebration to take place on the third anniversary of the site 's acquisition by Wired Digital on Oct. 31 .
And there 's reason to think this will be more jovial than your typical Halloween party :
Three years is a typical outer limit used in " earn out " agreements , in which startup founders vest progressively more money from their acquirers as time goes on .
This gives them incentive to integrate their creation into the acquiring company rather than bolting for the door .
Ohanian , believed to be hitting his final earn - out date along with co-founder Steve Huffman , declined to comment .
Of course , there 's nothing unusual about entrepreneurial Silicon Valley programmers moving on to new challenges .
Reddit would likely continue operating just fine without Ohanian and Huffman .
And Wired.com marches forward under editor Evan Hansen .
But it 's not lost on some Wired.com insiders that the further reduction of Wired Digital comes as New York - based parent company Condé Nast clings to a magazine - centric business model that 's been a real disaster lately .
After hiring McKinsey & Company 's consultants , Condé closed four magazines and slashed magazine budgets , by 25 percent at many titles .
And while Wired Digital 's already - bled websites and blogs may have strong traffic , advertising and critical notice — they were recently nominated alongside the Washington Post , BBC and New York Times for the Online News Association 's general excellence award — they 've been included in the cuts .
So how is Condé expecting to survive the next big tumble in magazine advertising , if not with its websites ?
Through the vision of print side editors like Wired 's Chris Anderson , who seems , to some Condé Nasties at least , to have spent so much time on books and speaking gigs he 's forgotten to help sell ads — or to try and truly integrate his magazine with his website ?
Anderson 's ad - hemorrhaging Wired print , mind you , has thus far escaped unscathed by the McKinsey cutbacks , we 're reliably informed .
Despite his good fortune , Anderson is even rumored to be advocating that Wired.com get by on more crowdsourced , written - for - Free blogs like GeekDad .
Asked about this , Anderson wrote , " Evan Hansen runs Wired.com , not me . "
Hansen declined to be interviewed .
Or maybe the Apple Tablet , Microsoft Courier and Amazon Kindle , among other e-readers , will miraculously allow Condé Nast 's old business model to seamlessly transition to the digital age , with no real internal changes necessary .
That might all sound preposterous .
But it 's the best rationale we 've come up with for why Condé Nast would starve key websites — the best hope for its future , really — of resources .
Granted , it 's much easier to remain in a state of denial than to confront real and looming problems .
But we thought Condé might have already hit rock bottom and changed its thinking .
Apparently not .

I do n't want war !
All I want is peace ... peace ... peace ...!

A little piece of France ,
A little piece of Austria
And Hungary , perchance !
A little slice of Turkey
And all that that entails ,
And then a bit of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales ! "
- Mel Brooks , To Be Or Not To Be
I guess the news peg for this is the anniversary of the start of WWII in September 1939 , but Pat Buchanan has gone ahead and apologized for Hitler , claiming he sought no empire or wider war with Europe , and had merely benign interests of German unification at heart :
Indeed , why would he want war when , by 1939 , he was surrounded by allied , friendly or neutral neighbors , save France .
And he had written off Alsace , because reconquering Alsace meant war with France , and that meant war with Britain , whose empire he admired and whom he had always sought as an ally .
As of March 1939 , Hitler did not even have a border with Russia .
How then could he invade Russia ?
Matt Yglesias does quick work of the historical inaccuracies - Hitler invaded Russia as soon as he achieved a border with them by conquering Poland .
And this is a decent riposte as well - Buchanan seems to expect a crazy person to also be a rational military strategist , and when he's not , searches for alternative explanation ( " Hitler could n't have wanted war because he did n't have enough planes !
So it 's Britain 's fault ! " ) .
But I 'll take the less dainty approach .
In 1939 , in a small town called Averduct on the German - Polish border , practically every member of my family was rounded up by Nazi authorities , herded into a local synagogue , and burned alive inside .
This would fall in Buchanan 's revisionism as part of the supposedly honest and forthright effort by Hitler to annex Danzig and restore the German homeland ( hey , Hitler just wanted some Lebensraum - why not let him annex whatever he decided was part of Germany , right ?
Do n't you want to save lives ? ) .
But my dead ancestors did n't live in Danzig ( now Gdansk ) .
They had nothing to do with such a conflict .
Maybe that was the work of a few bad apple Nazis acting alone .
That and the other 6 million incidents .
But the bigger point here to be made is that Pat Buchanan is paid by the allegedly liberal cable news network MSNBC , he has been on it for years , if you add up all his appearances throughout the day he probably spends as much time on the air as anyone outside of the Morning Joe crowd , and that 's ...
OK .
Calling Hitler misunderstood is not a firing offense at the liberal cable news network MSNBC .
Good to know .
My favorite comment in the Buchanan thread , by the way :

It ’s time for my latest update on the status of jailbreaking iPhones .
In a previous column , posted before iPhone OS 3.0 was released , I explained why I was reluctantly ready to give up on jailbreaking .
The situation is now worse .
Much worse .
Barring some unlikely breakthrough , all iPhone users may be forced to give up on jailbreaking — and rather soon .
Many iPhone users already find themselves in this boat .
Jailbreaking , for those unfamiliar with the term , is a way of bypassing Apple ’s restrictions on iPhone access .
More specifically , jailbreaking ( 1 ) gives you access to the iPhone ’s Mac OS X system software and ( 2 ) allows you to install apps independently from the App Store .
Apple and jailbreak hackers have been playing a cat - and - mouse game ever since the iPhone was first released .
Hackers would uncover some “ flaw ” in the iPhone firmware and exploit it so as to jailbreak the device .
With the next update to the iPhone OS , Apple attempted to block the exploit .
If the block was successful ( and it usually was ) , hackers worked to find a new exploit ( which they typically did within a few days of the OS ’s release ) .
Still , with each new iPhone OS release , Apple has upped the ante to stay in the game .
At one time ( what I now nostalgically refer to as “ the golden age of jailbreaking ” ) , jailbreaking an iPhone was as easy as launching QuickPwn and following its simple prompts .
In a few minutes , the job was done .
This is surely what led to as many as 10 % of iPhone users jailbreaking their phones ( according to some reports I read ) .
This golden age is over .
Probably for good .
Apple has won the battle .
The jailbreak mouse may not be officially dead yet , but it has been fatally injured .
Before you start writing to tell me how you can still jailbreak your iPhone , allow me to continue …
The crux of the problem lies with the iPhone 3GS .
With earlier models , jailbreaking is still feasible .
But that ’s small comfort .
Within the next two or three years , the vast majority of iPhone users will be using an iPhone 3GS or newer model .
Unless hackers figure out a way to solve the 3GS dilemma , jailbreaking is effectively over .
Here ’s the full story :
• If you purchased an iPhone 3GS running iPhone OS 3.0 , you had a chance to jailbreak it before iPhone OS 3.1 was released .
This was a fairly standard jailbreak .
If you did this , congratulations .
As long as you do n’t upgrade to iPhone OS 3.1 or need to restore your iPhone for any reason , you should be fine .
Of course , this means you do n’t get the benefits of the new features in iPhone OS 3.1 .
But that may be okay for now .
You may view the trade - off as worth it .
But at some point , perhaps when iPhone OS 4.0 comes out , the benefits of updating will outweigh the benefits of jailbreaking .
Then it will be game over .
• Okay .
I exaggerated a bit .
If you purchased an iPhone 3GS prior to the release of iPhone OS 3.1 , there is a way both to update to iPhone OS 3.1 and jailbreak the device .
However , it requires that you previously obtained your iPhone ’s iBEC ( also called ECID ) and iBSS data .
You can find a tutorial for doing this at iclarified .com .
This task is not for the non-geeky feint of heart : among other things , it requires interrupting a restore / recovery of your iPhone to perform an esoteric UNIX command in Terminal .
But it can be done .
• Or at least it could be done .
If you have n’t already obtained the needed data , it ’s now too late to do so .
As I understand it ( and , as always in these matters , my understanding may be faulty ) , the method in the cited tutorial wo n’t work anymore .
Why ?
As stated in an article by Jay Freeman ( saurik ) : “ Apple decided to strike hard with the new iPhone 3G [ S ] .
Apple decided that every restore of the device would be verified as being valid and safe by Apple itself .
Not only does this allow Apple to keep custom firmwares from getting loaded onto the device , but it also allows them to recall existing firmwares by keeping people from restoring to them in the future .
To do this , they simply would refuse to ever sign , for example , iPhone OS 3.0 again . ”
In other words , the technique wo n’t work if you ’re running iPhone OS 3.1 .
Period .
And if you ’re running iPhone OS 3.0 , it also wo n’t work now because — after the release of iPhone OS 3.1 — Apple stopped signing off on the 3.0 OS .
The required restore step now fails .
Even if you had the foresight to obtain the needed data beforehand , you still apparently will have to wait awhile before you can jailbreak .
The relevant software tools have not yet been updated to work with an iPhone 3GS ( at least that ’s the latest word from the iPhone Dev- Team folks ) .
• The bad news keeps coming .
If you buy an iPhone 3GS today , it comes with iPhone OS 3.1 pre-installed .
This means the door is already shut for any solution that requires that you do something before updating to 3.1 .
The situation will , of course , be the same for all future iPhone purchases .
• According to Jay Freeman ’s article , there is a potential escape hatch here .
Even with an iPhone 3GS running 3.1 , and even without having previously acquired the ECID data , you may be able to jailbreak your iPhone — by accessing its signature data from a Cydia server .
Even better , if this works , your iPhone becomes “ registered ” at the server and you should be okay to use the server going forward .
In theory , this preserves your ability to update a jailbroken iPhone to new OS versions and still retain the jailbreak capability — unless Apple finds a way to defeat this latest exploit .
However , yet again , the procedure for doing all this is far from simple .
Even if you do it correctly , you ’ll wind up having to deal with error messages , such as “ An unknown error occured ( 1015 ) . ”
Only a tiny segment of the iPhone population will likely attempt this .
And even if you do make the attempt , it may fail .
As Jay Freeman notes : “ If you encounter ‘ unknown error ( 3002 ) , ’ you probably do not have your ECID SHSH ’s for 3.0 ‘ on file ’ with Cydia .
Unfortunately , as Apple is no longer allowing users to sign the 3.0 firmware , it is no longer possible to register your device with Cydia . ”
In other words , you ’re out of luck .
While there may ultimately be a solution that gets around all of these obstacles , in a way that the average iPhone user finds acceptable , I am not holding my breath .
Bottom line .
If you own an iPhone 3GS , your options for jailbreaking your iPhone range from slim to none , and slim is on its way out of town .
Note : Apple ’s new signing restriction has negative implications even for users who never intend to jailbreak their iPhones .
For example , suppose you are still running iPhone OS 3.0 and need to restore your iPhone 3GS .
For whatever reason ( perhaps to deal with some app compatibility problem ) , you do n’t want to update to OS 3.1 yet .
With other iPhone models , you can accomplish this goal by holding down the Option key when clicking the Restore button .
An Open dialog appears , allowing you to select the 3.0 firmware file stored on your Mac .
This keeps you at 3.0 , rather than the default of updating to 3.1 .
While I cannot yet confirm this with certainty ( if I ’m wrong here , let me know ! ) , this should no longer work with a 3GS because Apple will not sign off on keeping the OS at 3.0 , even for this legitimate purpose .
The Option dialogue will appear and a selection is allowed , but the Restore attempt fails .
Note : Apparently , the iPod touch models released this month share the same signature mechanism as in the iPhone 3GS .
There was a form of kernel signature check with the prior iPod Touch ( 2G ) models — but it was easier to circumvent than what is used in the the current devices .
Nortriptyline has been found to cause a ten - fold increase in suicidal thoughts in men when compared to its competitor escitalopram .
These findings are published in the open access journal BMC Medicine .
The research was carried out by Dr. Nader Perroud from the Institute of Psychiatry , Kings College London , who headed up GENDEP , an international team .
Dr Perroud said " Suicidal thoughts and behaviours during antidepressant treatment have prompted warnings by regulatory bodies " .
He continued " the aim of our study was to investigate the emergence and worsening of suicidal thoughts during treatment with two different types of antidepressant . "
Both escitalopram and nortriptyline have their effect through the mood modulating neurotransmitter systems .
The former is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , preventing serotonin from re-entering the cell and thereby prolonging its effect on nerve synapses .
The latter is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline , and to a lesser extent , that of serotonin .
The study was carried out on 811 individuals with moderate to severe unipolar depression .
Whilst an overall trend in reduction of suicidal thoughts was observed , men who took nortriptyline were found to have a 9.8 - fold increase in emerging suicidal thoughts and a 2.4 - fold increase in worsening suicidal thoughts compared to those who took escitalopram .
Perroud concludes , " Our findings that treatment - emerging and worsening suicidal thoughts may also be associated with psychomotor activation triggered by antidepressants needs to be investigated in future studies .
The study also refutes the idea that newer antidepressants such as the SSRIs are worse than older medications in terms of increasing suicidal thoughts . "
Hulu , at the behest of its co-parent News Corp , is going to start charging for content in 2010 .
This is not so good , this here news .

Here 's the money quote from NewsCorpian Chase Carey , so there 's no confusion :
It 's time to start getting paid for broadcast content online .
I think a free model is a very difficult way to capture the value of our content .
I think what we need to do is deliver that content to consumers in a way where they will appreciate the value .
Hulu concurs with that , it needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business

An optimist might interpret this as a move toward tiered access , or even the decidedly good addition of paid premium content , like HBO and Showtime .
But read carefully :
It 's time to start getting paid for broadcast content online
It does n't get any less premium than broadcast content , which is exactly what Carey says we 'll soon be paying for — sometime in 2010 , he supposes .
( Though to be fair , there 's a scrap of reassurance later in the same article : " not all content on Hulu would be behind a pay wall . "
Cool ? )
This is extra - extra - foreboding next to last week 's statements about a paid Hulu from Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes , highlighted by TVBizwire : " That 's not an if , " he said " that 's a when . "
It was fun while it lasted , I guess .

Update : Reader Frank pinged Hulu about the issue , and got this not - quite - specific - enough - to - contradict - Carey 's - statements response :
Do n't worry , Hulu 's mission has always been to help people find and enjoy the world 's premium , professionally produced content .
We continue to believe that the ad - supported , free service is the one that resonates most with the largest group of users and any possible new business models would serve to complement our
existing offering .

It 's a purposely vague reassurance , but a definitive , public " we 're not going to charge you for what is currently free " statement would be awfully easy to make , and would quell the concerns of people like Frank .

They have n't made it .

World oil prices hit their highest point for a year yesterday , as a major new report urged governments around the world to take drastic action to head off an approaching oil supply crunch .
US light crude futures pushed above $ 79 a barrel , supported by the view that a recovering world economy would raise demand for crude .
Oil prices have more than doubled from the low point they hit in the spring , but are still around half the all - time high of nearly $ 150 a barrel they reached in early summer last year .
Analysts have been surprised at the recent resilience of oil prices given the impact on energy demand of the global recession .
In spite of this year 's volatility in the oil price , the underlying trend for a decade has been for it to rise steadily .
A report from the non-governmental organisation Global Witness – famous for its exposé of so - called " blood diamonds " – pointed to an impending supply shock that could be so severe that many of the world 's poor countries would simply be shut off from the world of energy by sky - high prices .
Two years in the preparation , Global Witness 's report , Heads in the Sand , accused governments of ignoring the fact that the world could soon start to run short of oil .
This would lead to huge consequences in terms of price shocks and much higher levels of violence around the world than last year 's food riots .
" There is a train crash about to happen from an energy point of view .
But politicians everywhere seem to have entirely missed the scale of the problem , " said the report 's author , Simon Taylor .
" We are all addicted to oil but if you look at the mathematics of the problem , they simply do n't add up in terms of future supply and demand . "
The report went through the latest figures from the oil industry and the Paris - based International Energy Agency , which last year drastically reduced its estimate of the available oil .
The IEA figures showed there could be a gap of 7 m barrels a day between supply and demand by 2015 .
That represents about 8 % of the expected world demand by then of 91 m barrels a day .
The IEA expects production from existing oilfields to fall by 50 % between now and 2020 and warned the world needs to find an additional 64 m barrels a day of capacity by 2030 – equivalent to six times current Saudi Arabian production .
But Global Witness took issue with the IEA 's recommendation that the oil industry spend $ 450 bn a year chasing these supplies , many of which may well not be there .
Because of the demands of climate change , the report argued , the money would be better invested in moving rapidly to a post- oil world of renewable energy and conservation .
Taylor said even the new IEA projections of how much new oil the world would discover were likely to be over - optimistic .
He said the so - called " big " oil discoveries of the last few years added up to nothing like the " discovery rate " needed to replace the world 's dwindling supplies from existing fields .
They have totalled around 16bn barrels , or only around 1.7 m barrels a day , once up and running .
The report said that between 2005 and 2008 , global oil production ceased to grow in spite of widespread investment and rising prices , which should normally have brought forth a big rise in supply .
It notes that the biggest year for new discoveries was 1965 , since when they have been falling .
Global oil production overtook new discoveries in 1984 and has outpaced them ever since .
It also dismissed as myth a widely held expectation that tar sands in Canada could fill the supply gap .
Tar sands are unlikely ever to yield more than 3 - 4 m barrels a day , equivalent to the pace at which existing fields are declining every year .
Taylor said the four key issues about oil – declining output , declining discoveries , increasing demand and insufficient projects in the pipeline – have been apparent for many years .
" But governments and multilateral agencies have failed to recognise the imminence and scale of the global oil supply crunch , and most of them remain completely unprepared for its consequences , " he said .
" There has been a decade of dithering and it is now too late to avoid the consequences unless the authorities move like there is no tomorrow . "
Dr Jeremy Leggett , author of books on peak oil and convenor of the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security , said : " A steep premature descent in global oil production would be worse than the credit crunch in terms of economic impact .
Unlike the credit crunch , however , the peak oil risk assessment involves big companies sounding the alarm alongside organisations like Global Witness . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Some private security guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan say their contractor has allowed widespread mistreatment , sexual activity and intimidation within their ranks , according to the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight ( POGO ) .
A spokeswoman for watchdog group POGO said hazing at a camp for security guards went " well beyond partying . "
The group sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday , and briefed reporters on its findings , which it said are based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul .
The company -- ArmorGroup , North America -- has a security contract with the State Department to provide services through July 2010 , and has been cited several times for shortcomings in the security required by the contract .
A U.S. Senate panel two months ago was critical of the State Department for not closely supervising ArmorGroup , after a series of warning letters from the State Department in the year leading up to the panel 's inquiry .
When CNN contacted Wackenhut , the corporate parent of ArmorGroup , a spokesperson there said the company would have a response Wednesday .
The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it was taking the allegations very seriously .
" Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of all Embassy personnel -- Americans and Afghan -- and respect for the cultural and religious values of all Afghans , " it said in a statement .
" We have taken immediate steps to review all local guard force policies and procedures and have taken all possible measures to ensure our security is sound . "
Should initiation rituals such as hazing be allowed ?
Sound off below
POGO says two weeks ago it began receiving whistleblower - style e-mails , some with graphic images and videos , that are said to document problems taking place at a non-military camp for the guards near the U.S. diplomatic compound in Kabul .
" This is well beyond partying , " said Danielle Brian , POGO 's executive director , after showing a video of a man with a bare backside , and another man apparently drinking a liquid that had been poured down the man 's lower back .
She told CNN that ranking supervisors were " facilitating this kind of deviant hazing and humiliation , and requiring people to do things that made them feel really disgusted . "
Watch claims that alleged hazing at the U.S. Embassy pose a threat to security »
" This is not Abu Ghraib , " she said , referring to images and videos of abuse by U.S. military troops against prisoners held at a facility in Iraq .
" We 're not talking about torture , " she continued , " we are talking about humiliation , " by supervisors causing a breakdown of morale , and a " total breakdown in the chain - of - command . "
In the letter POGO sent to Clinton , Brian wrote that the problems are " posing a significant threat to the security of the Embassy and its personnel . "
Among the recommendations from the group : immediate military supervision of the private security guards , a review of whether the contract should be revoked , and consideration as to whether government forces should replace private security in a combat zone .

Well that turned out to be well wide of the mark , so while you have to say Rio are favourites ahead of Madrid when you bear in mind London are hosting 2012 and Sochi are hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014 - can we really see three Olympics in Europe in a row ? - I 'm reluctant to make any predictions after the shock of earlier . "
redandblackT1899 on 606 : " Seems the Obama lustre has well and truly worn out .
Or maybe the Chicago bid was dead in the water long before today and not even Barack 's oratory skills could save it .
One to ponder ! "

1650 : Party time already in Rio de Janeiro - although , when is n't it on Copacabana beach ? - and the crowds in Madrid are also breaking in their dancing shoes ahead of the official announcement in just under an hour .
Olympics fans in Chicago and Tokyo lick their wounds , though , and not many will have predicted the former of those bowing out at the first hurdle .
The emotional pleas of the Obamas fell on deaf ears then ?

tigermilkboy on 606 : " Intriguing !
I think Rio and Madrid accumulated a large portion of votes first time round - Madrid picking up a large number of votes due to Juan Antonio Samaranch .
Seems like a lot voted for Madrid in the first round to appease the ex-IOC President , not really expecting Chicago to get knocked out so early .
Hence the surprise gasps !
It must be Rio , it simply must be Rio . "
BBC News ' Adam Brookes in Chicago : " The shock of Chicago 's elimination was greater for the fact that it came in the first round .
And greater for the fact that President Obama had taken valuable hours from his packed and tense political schedule to travel to Copenhagen .
His legendary powers of persuasion will be said to have failed him , though in reality it will be Chicago 's bid that failed him .
Nonetheless , this is a moment which allows the president 's detractors to allege waning prestige on the part of his presidency .
And it will raise questions about the political advice that he is receiving . "

1635 : We have a winner , people .
No need for IOC president Jacques Rogge to use his vote and that means everyone - well , everyone except the Madrid and Rio delegates of course - can relax .
The announcement ceremony kicks off at around 1730 BST , with the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games expected to be announced before 1800 .
Tense ?

Now - here 's how voting works .
There will be an initial vote .
If , as expected , no city wins a majority , the bid with the least votes will be eliminated and another vote will take place .
This will continue until one country boasts a majority of the IOC member votes .
This is very likely to go all the way to the third round , folks , given this is expected to be the closest bid vote in recent memory , possibly ever .
Chew those nails ...

AP report that former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch " made an unusual appeal for Madrid " and " reached out to voters " when he reminded IOC members that he is 89 .
They added : " Samaranch still has influence with some members and could swing a few crucial votes in Madrid 's favour . "
AFP felt Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero delivered a " markedly more sober and dry speech compared to his political counterparts from Chicago , Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo , but packed a serious message . "

1520 : While the IOC Evaluation Committee make their final report , then , a ( very ) brief look at one of the main selling points of the four bids .
Madrid -
No bidding city public wants it more .
Tokyo -
The green Games .
Rio de Janeiro - South America is due an Olympic Games .
Chicago -
A financially sound bid backed by US president Obama .
Much more to the bids than that , though , and a huge amount for the voters to consider .

Alongside Samaranch , Madrid really tried to pull out the big guns - Spain 's King Juan Carlos , Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and Real Madrid captain Raul were all present .
Too little too late , or the coup de grace ?

1405 : Ooh - it's that time again - here are some facts of the Madrid bid .
The proposed budget is $ 6.2bn , with $ 317 m set aside for new venues and all costs covered by the government , though more than 65 sponsors are already in place for the bid .
Bid organisers say that 70 % of the venues are complete , though the 70,000 - seat Olympic stadium and the basketball arena must be built .
For those of you who like a drink and a boogie ( heaven knows that 's not me , obviously ) , Madrid boasts 33,000 bars and nightclubs .
Plenty of opportunity for celebration / sorrow - drowing then .
Is that an IOC consideration ?

I think that 's unlikely .
The good things going in their favour is how close to beating London for 2012 they were .
They have a good compact bid with a lot of venues within a short distance of each other , there is a lot of political will behind them and one of their advocates Juan Antonio Samaranch is a very powerful man within the IOC having been president from 1980 until 2001 .
But with London hosting the Games in 2012 and with Russia hosting the 2014 winter Games , I would be surprised if they came back to Europe so soon . "

They kicked off their presentation with a 15 - year - old gymnast talking about being part of the future -
It got a round of applause but did n't have the pizazz and polish of the Chicago presentation we saw earlier on . "

PITTSBURGH ( Reuters ) -
The Group of 20 is set to become the premier coordinating body on global economic issues , reflecting a new world economic order in which emerging market countries like China are much more relevant , according to a draft communique .
Leaders of the G20 developed and developing nations also agreed to make the International Monetary Fund more representative by increasing the voting power of countries that have long been under - represented in the world financial body , said the draft G20 communique obtained by Reuters .
It called for a shift in IMF voting by at least 5 percent , although several G20 representatives said it was a 5 percentage point shift from developed to under - represented countries .
Currently , the split in voting power is 57 percent for industrialized countries and 43 percent for developing countries .
The shift would make the split nearly 50 - 50 .
The G20 was formed in 1999 for finance ministers and central bank chiefs following the Asian financial crisis .
The idea was to help the G7 -- the United States , Germany , Britain , France , Italy , Canada and Japan -- talk with the wider world .
Following are some of the implications of the decisions :
* The shifts reflect a recognition by the United States and Europe of a new global economic reality in which emerging market economies play a bigger role , especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that hurt developed economies more than developing ones .
* By making the G20 the new global economic coordinator , countries are committing to maintaining cooperation even after the global financial upheaval and recession recede .
The G20 was upgraded from a ministerial to a leaders - level forum only last year as the crisis deepened .
* Adopting the G20 as the new economic steering committee raises questions over the whether or not the Group of Eight , which makes up the world ’s industrial countries , will eventually be faded out .
Diplomats said the G8 would continue to function but would focus on non-economic issues .
* The agreements are big wins for U.S. President Barack Obama , hosting his first international summit .
Since his election last year , he has pushed for changes in the global financial architecture to recognize the increasing economic clout of China and other emerging markets .
The agreement to overhaul the IMF ’s voting structure is especially big for the new Obama administration , given that the United States proposed the 5 percentage point shift .
The speed with which the G20 agreed to the change -- if the draft communique is eventually adopted -- is surprising because of the politically sensitive nature of the issue for Europe , which will see the biggest dilution in its voting power .
* Giving developing nations more say at the IMF and a bigger say in global economic affairs could help Obama succeed in his push to get big exporters like China to increase domestic demand , helping slower - growing economies like the United States to find new markets .
* The shift of at least 5 percentage points in voting power is the largest increase ever seen in the IMF ’s voting structure and is likely to see China overtake old European powers Britain and France which have long resisted the move .
* The G20 decision on IMF voting reform will give momentum to a 2011 deadline for overhauling IMF governance which will then be voted on by the IMF ’s 186 member countries .
* The G20 also agreed the head of the IMF should be selected based on qualifications and not nationality , according to the draft communique obtained by Reuters .
The decision is significant because the head of the IMF has always been a European , while the president of the World Bank has always been an American .
Between 1922 and 1967 up to 10,000 children migrated from Britain to Australia under officially - approved schemes .
While some remember the experience fondly , others became victims of beatings and sexual abuse .
And newly - discovered records show that the authorities had been warned that the system had few safeguards .

Jackie still remembers the day she arrived at Fairbridge Farm , Pinjarra , Western Australia in 1950 .
Like the other children , she 'd been kitted out with a complete new outfit for the trip : shirt , cardigan , skirt , shoes and socks .
Pictured just before she got on the boat , she even has a ribbon in her hair .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The month long voyage was " great fun " , she recalled .
But as soon as Jackie , then ten , arrived at Fairbridge Farm , her beautiful new clothes were taken away .
Everyone had to wear a t - shirt and shorts .
No shoes - they were only for church on Sundays .
Jackie , looking excited with a ribbon in her hair , before leaving for Australia " We all got stone bruises , " she said .
" That 's what we called them - the bumps on your feet from going barefoot everywhere . "
But that was n't the worst thing - by far .
" The punishment was shocking , " Jackie added .
Fairbridge Farm was supposed to have more of a family atmosphere than most children 's homes of the time - instead of big dormitories the children lived in cottages with a resident member of staff - a " cottage mother " .
Some children seem to have been fond of their substitute parents , and have good memories of the Farm , but Jackie 's cottage mother was cruel .
Lonely and scared , Jackie started wetting her bed at night .
The cottage mother would force her head into the toilet - and then flush it or lock her into a dark cupboard under the stairs .
Jackie tried to run away - but she was always brought back .
" There was no - one to turn to , " she told me .
Grossly overcrowded Jackie was disgusted to learn that the Home Office had been specifically warned about the Farm three years before she arrived but had still sent children there .
They did n't look after us then but they should look after us now .
Jackie , child migrant to Australia
I found a file in the National Archives from 1947 - released in recent years - showing a Miss Lucy Cole Hamilton wrote to officials in October that year .
She herself had worked as a cottage mother at Fairbridge Farm , Pinjarra , for 11 years .
She 'd taken a party of children there in 1934 and stayed through the war .
She 'd read reports that the government planned to start sending child migrants to Australia again , and she was " very anxious " for information about safeguards and inspection .
" I do not think the system at present conducive to the children 's happiness or welfare in a great many ways , " she wrote .
Pictures of happy children at Fairbridge Farm belie unhappy conditions Officials invited Miss Cole Hamilton up to London , and she gave more details .
The facilities were poor , she said , and cottages " grossly overcrowded ... 24 children living where at most there was space for 12 " .
She was very worried about the way children were treated , and about their education .
" Very few children went out to school .
Girls went automatically to domestic service , boys to farming , " she told them .
The staff were on the whole " of low quality " .
She felt that supervision from " this side " was " very necessary " .
The file makes clear that officials had already heard poor reports of the Farm .
They noted " what she told us ... confirmed our existing information " .
And yet , they apparently did nothing .
The final sentence runs : " Note : it would not be desirable to use of the information given here as ' evidence ' in any discussion with the Fairbridge Society " .
The society was the UK based charity responsible for the School .
The last comment is simply " lay by " .
Yet , according to Jackie and other former child migrants , Miss Cole Hamilton had identified the key problems in the system .
" I 'm nothing " Bill was sent to Bindoon , a farm in Western Australia run by the Christian Brothers , in 1954 .
He was just nine years - old .
He describes it as a " hellhole " .
Children were welcomed to Australia but many found life there terrible Bindoon is now notorious for the many allegations of horrific abuse : a Committee of British MPs heard evidence from one man who said Brothers there had competed to see who could rape him a hundred times .
Bill himself was raped there .
He 'd been a good student in England .
At Bindoon , his education was negligible , and ceased altogether when he was 11 .
" I could have been anything , " he told me .
" I could have been the prime minister .
But I 'm nothing , I 've got nothing , because I have n't been educated . "
Lucy Cole Hamilton had stressed the necessity of supervision from the UK , but the files show inspection was limited .
Bindoon was visited in 1951 by John Moss , a British official , but he gave it a good report .
He even relayed the senior Brother 's request for younger boys : " He prefers boys of nine or 10 , " Bindoon wrote .
Children leaving the UK thought they were heading for a better life Bill finds it hard to understand how an inspector could have so misread the Home .
In later years , there were more warnings about the Home , but Lucy Cole - Hamilton does seem to be the first to make a serious attempt to blow the whistle , according to Margaret Humphreys of the Child Migrants '
Trust .
She was struck by the level of detail in the file .
" This is just clear evidence ...
Evidence of someone concerned about the appalling level of care , evidence of someone raising the alarm , and the government does nothing about it as far as we can see , " she says .
The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said he will apologise for the policy .
But , as this file underlines , it was Britain who sent the children out , and failed to monitor them effectively .
Many former migrants believe Britain should say sorry too , and offer compensation .
Jackie still has a British passport : she calls England " home " .
" It 's my country , " she told me .
" They did n't look after us then but they should look after us now . "
Fairbridge was was reconstituted as a charity in 1992 and now does well - respected work getting young people into education , employment and training in the UK .

Die Schwatzgelben planen nun offenbar ein Leistungsschutzrecht ( LSR ) für Verlage , vermeldet die ( großartige und recht verlagsferne ) Online - Publikation Carta , die offenbar an einen Entwurf des entsprechenden Teil des Koalitionsvertrages gelangt ist – und wenn dieser Entwurf in Gesetzen münden würde , wäre der Carta - Text von dem geplanten Leistungsschutzrecht möglicherweise nicht geschützt , weil Carta als selbsterklärter „ Autoren - Blog “ wahrscheinlich gar nicht als „ Presseverlag “ anerkannt wäre .
Und für die soll das Leistungsschutzrecht ja gelten .
Diese
Welt ist schon manchmal lustig .
Ganz kurz für alle , die das LSR bisher nicht genug interessiert hat , um nachzulesen , was das soll :
Es würde bedeuten , dass Presseverlage wie z .
B. Musikverlage eine Gesellschaft gründen könnten , die für jede öffentliche „ Aufführung “ eines von einem Verlag produzierten Inhaltes Geld einsammeln und an den Verlag auszahlen könnte .
Bei Musik macht das die GEMA , die von jedem Radiosender , Clubbetreiber und Konzertveranstalter Gebühren für die gespielte Musik erhebt und an die Rechteinhaber verteilt .
Das klingt im ersten Moment logisch , aber das ist es nicht , und mein Magen zieht sich immer stärker zusammen , je länger ich versuche , dieses System zu durchdenken .
Denn es geht hier ja nicht darum , dass ein Autor oder ein Fotograf die Rechte an seinen Werken behält , auch nicht darum , dass Verlage für eine unerlaubte Nutzung wesentlicher , originärer Teile einer Arbeit entschädigt werden .
Das ist längst geregelt , und zwar im Urheberrecht .
Das Leistungsschutzrecht geht darüber hinaus – in einem
Wort zusammengefasst geht es natürlich um Google : Der Suchmaschinenbetreiber soll für jedes Mal , bei dem er die Headline und die ein , zwei oder drei Zeilen , die er im Suchergebnis ausgibt , bezahlen .
Denn schließlich steht neben dem Suchergebnis potenziell eine Anzeige , mit der Google Geld verdient .
Die großen Medienkonzerne des Landes und mit ihnen die Neu- Koalitionäre sind der Ansicht , Google müsste für diese Möglichkeit , Geld zu verdienen , eine Art Zugangsgebühr bezahlen .
Ich bin völlig anderer Ansicht .
Und die komplette Konstruktion dieses Schutzrechtes ist so obskur , dass in der Argumentation seiner Verfechter nur noch der Satz fehlt „ der Pantelouris hat recht “ um klarzustellen , dass ich recht habe .
Alles andere ist gesagt .
Gucken wir uns das der Reihe nach an : „ Presseverlage “ würden also einen Sonderstatus erhalten , der ihre drei Zeilen schutzwürdiger macht als die drei Zeilen , die Google möglicherweise zu diesem Blog - Eintrag anzeigt .
Welche Definition wir auch immer für „ Presseverlag “ finden ( vielleicht bin ich dann ja auch einer ) :
Es wird also in Zukunft Texte geben , die ein besonderes Recht genießen gegenüber dem Angebot eines Elektronikmarktes oder dem Newsletter einer Bio-Käserei .
Da stellt sich schon die erste Frage : Warum ?
Es ist ja nicht so , dass die Verlage gezwungen sind , bei Google gelistet zu werden .
Sie können Google ausschließen .
Aber das wollen sie nicht .
Sie wollen Traffic von Google , aber Google soll noch dafür bezahlen .
Als Argument dafür werden mal abwechselnd und mal gleichzeitig zwei Gründe angeführt : a ) Google verdient ja auch Geld damit und b ) die Presse erfüllt einen unverzichtbaren Auftrag für die Demokratie .
Das verwirrende an diesen Argumenten ist , dass sie gleichzeitig richtig und falsch sind : faktisch stimmen sie , aber für die Argumentation sind sie irrelevant .
Google verdient Geld mit Anzeigen neben allen möglichen Einträgen .
Nach dem Prinzip des LSR müsste also zunächst einmal jeder Urheber , dessen Einträge von Google gefunden werden , ein moralisches Anrecht auf eine Beteiligung an Googles Einnahmen haben , denn wenn nicht einmal die Denkfigur richtig wäre , dass Google mit fremden Inhalten Geld verdient , dann wäre das gesamte Unterfangen der Verlage unmoralisch .
Könnte es also sein , dass wir als Gesamtheit der Internet - Urheber prinzipiell ein Anrecht auf Teilhabe an den Google - Einnahmen haben , weil Google ohne uns nichts hätte , dass es listen könnte ?
Das hieße auch , dass die Gesamtheit der Telefonbesitzer prinzipiell noch eine Rechnung mit der Telekom offen hat , weil die ja Werbung auf die Telefonbücher druckt , die es ohne uns nicht gäbe .
Wie gesagt , alles theoretisch , denn niemand glaubt , dass das realistisch zu bewerkstelligen wäre .
Aber wäre das in der Theorie gerecht ?
Die Antwort ist nein .
Google bietet einen Service , wie das Telefonbuch einen Service geboten hat ( und vielleicht manchen immer noch bietet ) .
Das Argument , dass der Ordnende seine Objekte bezahlen muss , weil er ohne sie nichts zu ordnen hätte , ist meiner Meinung nach schon im Kern nicht darstellbar : Müssten sonst Kartenverlage an jede Kommune zahlen , die auf ihren Landkarten auftaucht ?
Oder zumindest nachfragen , ob sie auf der Karte zu sehen sein wollen ?
Muss die Stadtreinigung mich dafür bezahlen , dass ich den Dreck mache , den sie dann wegräumen können ?
Schon prinzipiell ist dieses Recht also ein falsches Konstrukt , aber was ist , wenn wir die Ausnahme betrachten ?
Wenn wir sagen :
Die deutsche Presse erledigt eine so wichtige Aufgabe für die Demokratie , dass wir sie selbst mit prinzipiell falschen Maßnahmen unterstützen müssen ?
Kann das sein ?
Nun ja : Selbst wenn es so wäre , käme doch auch weiterhin ein großer Teil des Traffics auf journalistischen Seiten von Google .
Google erledigt also auch eine wichtige Aufgabe für die Demokratie .
Vielleicht sollte man Google also lieber von Steuern befreien und noch einfacher noch mehr Nachrichten an noch mehr Leser verteilen lassen ?
Aber in Wahrheit ist das Argument auf einer noch einfacheren Ebene falsch : Die Presseverlage wollen und sollen besser gestellt werden als der Käseladen mit seinem Newsletter , und Google soll den Verlagen Geld zahlen , dem Käseladen aber nicht .
Wie gesagt , mit dem Argument , dass Google ja mit den Inhalten der Verlage auch Geld verdient .
Nun ist es aber so : Google verdient mit dem Käseladen auch Geld , nur gilt dessen Geschäftsziel nicht als wichtig für die Demokratie .
Das Problem dabei ist : Nicht alle Geschäftsziele eines privaten Verlages sind wichtig für uns als Gesellschaft .
Um die Demokratie zu befördern , muss ein Verlag nicht reich sein .
Insofern ist ein – prinzipiell ja falsches – LSR als Ausnahme wegen der demokratiefördernden Wirkung von Verlagen eigentlich nur denkbar , wenn Verlage diese eine , demokratisch relevante Aufgabe sonst nicht erfüllen könnten .
Es müsste eine Grenze geben , die klar definiert , welche Inhalte bis zu welcher Größenordnung förderungswürdig sind , ansonsten muss ich sagen : Für unsere Gesellschaft ist meiner Meinung nach auch journalistische Unterhaltung wichtig .
Auch das Sudoku .
Auch der Wetterbericht .
Sehr wichtig sogar .
Aber nicht wichtiger als Käse .
Dann müssten wir plötzlich alles fördern .
Kurz :
So lange es das wichtigste Ziel eines Verlages ist , Geld zu verdienen , sehe ich keinen Grund , warum man das mit einem falschen Gesetz staatlich fördern muss .
Und das andere gibt ’s ja schon : die Öffentlich - Rechtlichen .
Aber warum sollte etwas , das bei der Musik mit der GEMA leidlich funktioniert , bei uns nicht gehen ?
Vorweg :
Ich glaube persönlich nicht , dass das Komponieren und Interpretieren von Musik mit dem Journalismus vergleichbar ist , weil das eine aus meiner Sicht eine Kunst ist und das andere eine Art handwerkliche Dienstleistung .
Journalismus ist keine Kunst , auch wenn es ein paar aufgeblasene Selbstdarsteller geben mag , die das immer noch behaupten .
Aber wir sollten , um auch das letzte Argument gehört zu haben , noch einmal einen Blick auf die Musikwelt werfen .
Dort
zahlt man Geld , wenn man fremde Stücke öffentlich nutzt .
Und das aus meiner
Sicht überall da zu recht , wo es kommerziell passiert .
Wenn ich fremde
Werke zu meinem finanziellen Vorteil ausnutze , muss ich dafür bezahlen .
Aber tut Google das , wenn sie einen Link setzen mit einem inhaltlichen Teaser und einer Headline ?
Ich glaube nicht .
Sie weisen auf die Existenz eines Inhaltes hin , aber das nutzt noch nicht diesen Inhalt .
Das wäre ja , als würde ein Reisejournalist die Stadt Venedig zu seinem finanziellen Vorteil ausnutzen , wenn er über sie schreibt .
Seine Dienstleistung weist darauf hin , dass es die Stadt gibt ( und er schickt ihr möglicherweise sehr realen Traffic ) , aber zu behaupten , er nutze ihre Existenz aus , überspannt doch ein bisschen meine Vorstellung von Nutzung ( aus eigener Erfahrung kann ich sagen :
Ich habe weite Teile meiner Jugend damit verbracht , auf die Existenz von Winona Ryder hinzuweisen .
Es hat nichts genutzt ) .
Und , nebenbei , wenn jemand eine Nachricht bei Google nicht ansurft , weil ihm die zwei oder drei Zeilen unter der Headline schon genug Auskunft gegeben haben , dann haben die Verlage ( die dadurch auf einen Klick verzichten müssen ) eine schwere Lektion offensichtlich noch nicht verinnerlicht :
Wer auf Grundlage dieser wenigen Worte einen Link nicht anklickt , der verzichtet nicht deshalb darauf , weil er diesen wenigen Worten schon genug über die Nachrichtenlage entnommen hat – sondern weil ihn die Nachricht nicht interessiert .
Google ersetzt keine Nachrichtenseite .
Es bewahrt uns nur davor , Dinge zu lesen , die wir gar nicht lesen wollen .
Und da sind wir bei der Wahrheit angelangt : Verlage haben viele Jahre lang ein Geschäftsmodell zur Perfektion gebracht , in dem a ) alle Leser die ganze Zeitung kaufen und bezahlen mussten , auch wenn sie sich nur für einen winzigen
Teil davon interessiert haben .
Und haben b) mit diesen Verkaufszahlen auch noch Anzeigenkunden angelockt , die so ihr Geld in unkontrollierbare , oft uneffiziente Werbeformen stecken konnten zu deren Gunsten dann auch noch c ) immer mehr Hefte und Zeitungen immer weniger echten Inhalt für Leser geboten haben – Anzeigenumfelder statt Journalismus .
Wir sitzen also da mit einem Produkt , das in den meisten Fällen , in denen es nicht verkauft , auch nicht besonders gut ist und von dem Leser wenig erwarten .
Wir haben zu viel Scheiß produziert , und nur weil wir damit viel Geld verdient haben hatten wir damit noch lange nicht recht .
Es hat Spaß gemacht , aber jetzt ist die Party vorbei .
Der vernünftige journalistische Impuls wäre heute , die Qualität zu verbessern und es möglichst vielen Menschen zu ermöglichen , das auch zu erkennen .
Dafür braucht es guten Journalismus und viele , viele Links die auf ihn verweisen .
Aber das scheint nicht der
Weg zu sein , den sich die großen , mächtigen Verlagsorganisationen und Konzerne vorstellen .
Stattdessen wollen sie offenbar lieber die nächsten Jahrzehnte mit Suchmaschinenoptimierung und dem Einsammeln von indirekten Staatshilfen verbringen ( denn was sonst ist ein ungerechtes Gesetz zugunsten von Organisationen , mit denen Politiker es sich nicht verscherzen wollen ?
Nur bezahlt es in diesem
Fall nicht direkt der Steuerzahler , sondern Google – falls sie nicht einfach aufhören , Inhalte von Presseverlagen zu listen ) .
Das geplante Leistungsschutzrecht ist also falsch .
Es ist prinzipiell falsch , weil wir hier eine Dienstleistung retten wollen indem wir ihr Rechte geben , die ihr nicht zustehen – und sie dabei auch noch verschlechtern .
Es kann sein , dass dieses Leistungsschutzrecht für kurze Zeit die wirtschaftliche Situation einiger großer Verlage verbessert , wenn diese in Zukunft noch mehr Kraft investieren , um von Google besser gefunden zu werden .
Aber für den Journalismus im Internet wird es meiner Meinung nach kontraproduktiv sein .
Aber vielleicht irre ich mich ja auch total : Möglicherweise finden wir einen
Weg durch dieses Gesetz , mit dem plötzlich jeder von uns 15 „ Presseverlage “ unter verschiedenen URLs gründen und so die ganz große Umverteilung beginnen kann .
Aber ich fürchte , das alles ist nur eine ganz große Lüge , bei der es um nichts anderes geht , als dem reichen Google irgendwie Geld abzunehmen und es dann unter den auch nicht Armen zu verteilen .
Das Leistungsschutzrecht belohnt hier keine Leistung sondern Suchmaschinenoptimierung , es bietet keinen Schutz sondern führt zu einer Zwangsabgabe und es ist vielleicht ein Gesetz – aber recht ist es mir deshalb noch lange nicht .
If you 're like most Americans , you will consume 22 teaspoons , or 355 calories , of added sugar today .
Now , the American Heart Association would like you to cut back dramatically .
Added sugar is commonly found in soft drinks , candy , and cookies but it can lurk in many healthful foods too .
For the first time , the group has issued guidelines that say most women should consume no more then 6 teaspoons ( about 100 calories or 25 grams ) of added sugar daily , and most men no more than 9 teaspoons ( about 150 calories or 37.5 grams ) .
But here 's the tricky part :
Added sugar not only includes the white table sugar you might spoon into a cup of coffee or a bowl of cereal , but also sugar added to food and drinks before you even purchase them .
Added sugar is commonly found in soft drinks , candy , cakes , and cookies ( though it lurks in many types of food , including some yogurts and even granola . )

Some of the most common added sugars are corn sweetener , corn syrup , dextrose , glucose , high fructose corn syrup , honey , maltose , malt syrup , molasses , sucrose , and syrup .
In contrast , the most common naturally occurring sugars are fructose and lactose , found in fruit and dairy products , respectively .
The new guidelines were published Monday in Circulation : Journal of the American Heart Association .
The primary pitfalls of added sugars , according to lead author Rachel Johnson , are that they deliver empty calories and they tend to replace other nutrient - rich foods in our diet .
" Because most of us lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle , the food we do eat needs to be packed with nutrients , " says Johnson , who is a registered dietitian and a professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont , in Burlington .
Health.com : 5 healthy snacks for people with ( or without ! ) diabetes
One of the specific challenges of limiting added sugars is simply recognizing them .
Food manufacturers do n't have to list the amount of added sugar on products , says Johnson .
Instead , added sugars are lumped in with naturally occurring sources , and usually listed together as " total sugars . "
Johnson suggests identifying which sugary foods your family consumes most often , and investigating their specific sugar contents , either by finding the product 's Web site online , or by consulting the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's food composition database .
Although added sugar is not directly linked to heart disease , it is associated with risk factors such as obesity , high blood pressure , high levels of triglycerides , and high levels of C - reactive protein , which has been linked to oxidative stress and inflammation , says Linda Van Horn , a registered dietitian and chair of the American Heart Association 's Nutrition Committee .
In contrast , foods with naturally occurring sugars deliver nutrients while still satisfying our craving for sweetness .
For example , fruits have essential vitamins and minerals as well as protective agents known as phytonutrients , such as carotenoids and polyphenols ; dairy products contain calcium , protein , vitamin D , and more .
Health.com : Alicia Silverstone :
How a vegan diet makes you sparkle
In the past , there have been few formal guidelines on how much added sugar is too much .
The American Heart Association went so far as to recommend only that people " limit added sugars " or consume them " in moderation . "
The USDA says that based on an average adult 2000 - calorie diet , 10 teaspoons of added sugar , or about 40 grams , is the maximum .
So how do you cut down on added sugars ?
The No. 1 . strategy is to eliminate or at least reduce the biggest source of extra sugar in our diets : soft drinks and other sugar - sweetened beverages .
For example , one can of soda delivers 130 calories and 8 teaspoons of added sugar .
Health.com : Slideshow :
The slimming power of mint
Sodas containing artificial sweeteners can be used as a " transition beverage " to help reduce the number of sugary drinks consumed , recommends Johnson .
Even better alternatives for soda are water , unsweetened iced tea , and low - fat milk , she suggests .
Another tactic : Limit processed foods , and opt for as many fresh , whole , unpackaged , and unprocessed foods as you can , such as fruits , veggies , grains , nuts , and seeds .
Elisa Zied , a registered dietitian and American Dietetic Association spokesperson , says staying away from heavily refined foods means " you 'll not only save yourself from too much sugar , but you 'll also reduce the risk of overloading on sodium and fat and calories in general . "
Health.com : Dietary fats can help -- or harm -- your heart
You can " save up " your added sugar calories and use them to enhance the flavor of healthy foods , says Zied .
For example , reserve your extra sugar for nutrient - rich choices such as fruit - flavored yogurt , chocolate milk , or frosted whole - grain wheat cereal .
According to the AHA , the limits recommended for men and women are a rough estimate .
They say a person 's daily intake of added sugars should not exceed half of the daily allotment of discretionary calories , which are those calories left over after consuming foods recommended for a healthy diet , such as fruit , vegetables , low - fat dairy foods , high - fiber whole grains , and lean fish and meats .
You can calculate your own daily dose of discretionary calories on the USDA 's Web site , using several factors including age , sex , weight , height , and level of physical activity .
Parents wondering about the right amount of added sugars for their children can also use the same Web site to figure it out .
In addition to sugary sodas , fruit juices and fruit drinks are common sugar traps for kids , according to the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) .
Not only do they provide fewer nutritional benefits than whole fruits , but sugary beverages are also associated with malnutrition , tooth decay , and stomach problems such as diarrhea and gassiness in some children , says the AAP .
Parents should choose 100 percent fruit juices and stay away from fruit drinks altogether , according to the pediatricians ' guidelines .
Kids ages 1 to 6 should not have more than 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice a day ; the older kids ' limit is between 8 to 12 ounces ; babies under 6 months should not drink juice at all .

Bug Fixes

I just tagged the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit with version 1.1.3 .
It 's been some time since the last release , and I wanted to use this post to make a summary of the changes and to describe some of the new features that have been added to the library .
I 'll start with the new features : I added some new global configuration properties to the SpaceTree : align and indent .
Align sets the alignment of the tree to center , left and right :
The indent parameter sets an offset between a parent and its children when the alignment is left or right .
You can also use the switchAlignment method for changing the alignment of the tree with an animation .
I added two new methods to the SpaceTree : addNodeInPath and clearNodesInPath .
These two methods allow you to add a node to the " selected - nodes " path .
When a node belongs to the " selected - nodes " path it remains always visible ( as in always expanded ) .
I made this small video to show the feature : I added a SpaceTree configuration property called multitree .
If multitree=true , the visualization will search for the $ orn data property in each node and display the subtrees according to their orientation .
In this example I set multitree=true and set $ orn= ' left ' for some nodes and $ orn= ' right ' for others .
This way I create a partition of the tree : I also use the setRoot method to set the clicked node as root for the visualization .
This way the clicked node is centered and a centrifugal view from that node is drawn .
I 've been fixing a couple of bugs also , most of them have to do with Treemaps : I also want to thank Guido Schmidt for his interest in the library and work on the GWT JIT component .
There 's also been some JIT development for Grails done by Bertrand Goetzmann .
Anyway , things are looking good ! :)
Re : Mtv tres
oh by the way , Zoe beat out just about everyone for best rock and roll band .
Note : please refrain from using terms like , ' rock en espanol ' because those terms are meant to draw lines in the sand .
I 've never heard anyone say ' rock in english ' or ' rock in french ' it just does n't make any sense .
A chance conversation in Macau last year between the head of the Harvard - Yenching Library and the director of the National Library of China , two men with a passion for ancient texts , led to the signing yesterday of an ambitious , six - year pact to digitize Harvard ’s treasure trove of 51,000 rare Chinese books .

WASHINGTON --
The idea of creating a government - run health - insurance plan , once on life support in the Senate , is making a recovery among Democrats writing health - care legislation .
So far , no one is talking about a nationwide Medicare - like plan of the sort sought by many liberals , but several variations short of a national plan are being considered .
One ...
Do We Need a 37 - Cent Coin ?
Dubner thinks we should do away with the penny .
A young economist I know , Patrick DeJarnette , believes a much more radical change in currency is warranted .
Here is what Patrick writes :
Late one night I was curious how efficient the “ penny , nickel , dime , quarter ” system was , so I wrote a little script to compare all possible 4 - coin systems , with the following stipulations : 1 . Some combination of coins must reach every integer value in [ 0,99 ] .
2. Probability of a transaction resulting in value v is uniform from [ 0,99 ] .
In other words , you start with $ 10 and no coins .
You buy something at the store .
Afterward , the chance you have 43 cents in your pocket is equal to the probability that you have 29 or 99 cents in your pocket ( in addition to any bills ) .
Requirement ( 1 ) implies the penny is necessary , as you must have a combination of coins that reach value = 1 cent .
With this in mind , the current combination of coins ( penny , nickel , dime , quarter ) results in an average of 4.70 coins per transaction .
What ’s a little surprising is how inefficient our current setup is !
It ’s only the 2,952 - nd most efficient combination .
There are effectively 152,096 different combinations of penny + three coins .
In other words , it ’s only in the 98th percentile for efficiency .
How can you tell that Patrick is a young economist from the preceding discussion ?
Because he finds that the current government solution for the coins we use is 98 percent efficient and thinks this is inefficient .
The other day I was walking through the halls of the University of Chicago economics department and heard a faculty member say that the right rule of thumb for government spending is that it is worth only 10 cents on the dollar because of inefficiency .
Anyway , Patrick then tackles the question of which combinations of coins would be most efficient :

Cricket bats are manufactured mainly from English willow , a kind of cultivated timber which grows in large plantations in wetland areas throughout Essex , Suffolk and Norfolk .
Each tree is individually planted by hand and during its natural life - span , the willow will be tended by the grower to ensure that the tree will be suitable for bat making .
For each willow that is felled , two new trees are planted .
In this way the industry , countryside and the actual species are protected .
The willow cleft is then sawn , the ends waxed and then air or kiln dried to reduce the moisture content .
The cleft then undergoes various machining processes to be cut into the basic blade shape .
Once the blade has been correctly graded and machined , the next stage is pressing .
The willow fibers have to be compressed in order to strengthen the timber sufficiently to withstand the impact of a cricket ball .
The blade is pressed up to 2,000 lb per square inch .
After pressing the handle , constructed from cane and rubber strips , is fitted through the precise splicing of the handle into the blade .
The blade is now shaped with a draw knife .
During the shaping process , the bat is constantly tested for balance and form by the bat maker .
Next comes sanding .
The bat will be both coarse and fine sanded through various drum and belt sanding machines .
Once the bat has been shaped and sanded , the handle and blade are blended together to obtain a seamless bat .
Finally , the bat is waxed and polished , a rubber grip fitted to the handle and labeled .
The bat is now ready to ship .

著名な人々が仕事を成し遂げている9つの仕事場
Kevin Purdy / 青木靖 訳
2009年9 月24 日
あなたはスティーブ・ジョブズや37 Signalsのようなミニマリズムを好むだろうか、あるいはティナ･フェイやPixarのような創造的混沌を好むだろうか?
有名な人たちの仕事場から学べることはたくさんある。インスピレーションが得られるよう、9つの仕事場を集めてみた。
アル・ゴ ア
重要な仕事にはディスプレイが3つ必要なんだと自分を納得させるためのもう一押しがほしい人には、合衆国前副大統領アル・ゴアのオフィスが助けになるだろう。有名な講演家であるゴアがホワイトボードではなく紙のスケッチ帳を使う理由は我々にはよくわからない。(元の記事) [ via TIME ]
デビッド・アレ ン
ジェイソンが元の記事で書いているように、GTDの創始者デビッド･アレンは説教している通りのことを自分でも実践している人物だ。とくに思考や「あ、そうだ」という瞬間を捉えるという部分で。彼の机にある、変わっているがふさわしい2つのアイテムは、ラベルプリンターと砂時計だ。ビデオクリップの作者はこれがインタビューの時間の最後に慌ただしく撮られたものだと書いていたが、David Allen Co.のオフィスのエッセンスがよく伝わっている。[ YouTube ]
ビル・ゲイ ツ
ゲイツ はMicrosoftの会長とチーフソフトウェアアーキテクトをやめてこの場所を去ったが、レドモンドのキャンパスではきれいに片付けた場所で仕事をしていたようだ。最近では、ゲイツは3つのディスプレイとOneNoteを駆使して仕事をしている。彼のホームオフィスも是非見てみたいものだ。[via CNN ]
スティーブ･バルマ ー
MicrosoftのCEOが正面を向くとき、そこには1つのディスプレイと( Microsoft製の)マウスとキーボード、電話、それにランチを食べられるわずかなスペースがある。彼が横を見たりファイルに手を伸ばすときには、棚と壁を埋める家族や友達の写真が、彼の子供たちによる創作の努力の結果とともに並んでいる。こういう人たちも人間だということを我々は忘れがちだ。[via
The New York Times ]
スティーブ・ジョブ ズ
ダイアナ・ウォーカーがこの部屋の写真を撮ったとき、Appleの大ボスはMacintoshに取り組み始めた頃で独身だった。ミニマリストの機能性に対する志向がどこから来ているのか容易に分るというものだ。写真に付いていた説明はこう。「私は独身で、必要だったのは一杯のお茶と、明かりと、ステレオだけであり、それが私の持っていたものだった 」 [ via Diana Walker / The Bigger Picture Gallery ]
37 Signals
ミニマリストの精神を持ったもう一組の技術の思想家たち、Basecampや Campfire やRuby on Railsの背後にいるチームは、空っぽの白い部屋で働いているわけではないが、装飾は簡素にし、空間をオープンにしている。[via Signal vs. Noise ]
マーチン･エイミ ス
このイギリスの作家は庭の小さな離れにある素敵なオフィスの写真を公開している。彼は働く者すべてがある種の「小屋」を持つべきだと言っている。「以前は家の屋根裏部屋を使っていましたが、妻のイザベルがこの部屋をあんまり使っていないようだったので、使わせてもらうことにしました。ここは理想的です。子供の声は聞こえないし、たばこだって吸えます 」 [ via Guardian UK ]
ディルバートの究極のキュービクル
居心地が悪く抑圧的な作業環境を知っている「ディルバート」の作者スコット･アダムズは、デザイン会社のIdeoとともに、例を通してそれを変えようと試みている。何千というディルバートファンからのフィードバックを集め、アダムズとIdeoは「ディルバートの究極のキュービクル」をデザインした。1日のうちの時間に応じて光源の方向を変えられるモジュラー構造をしており、ハンモックを取り付け可能、椅子/コンピュータ/デスクの配置を調整することができ、ハムスターの回し車モジュールや熱帯魚水槽モジュールさえ用意されていて、同じように捕らわれの生き物と心を通わせることができる。ディルバートは実際この部屋で仕事しているわけではないが、心を自由にさせることができたなら、きっとそうすることだろう。[via Ideo ]
ティナ・フェ イ
これはアメリカンエクスプレスの広告のために撮られた写真なので、ひどく散らかった様子(「忙しすぎて他のカードなんて使えない!」ということらしい)は多少誇張されたものではあるだろう。しかし「30 Rock」の脚本家兼プロデューサーが時間やアイデアをポストイットで管理しているというのは本当らしく思える。碁盤目状に妙に整理された感じのコルクボードや、さらに向こうの壁の上の整理されたメモに注目してほしい。取り散らかしながらも、彼女は半ダースのプロットが同時に進行する番組の脚本を書いているのだ。(元の記事)
Pixar
多くの批評家が今日最もクリエイティブで価値のある映画スタジオだと言っている場所で働けるだけでなく、Pixarのチームには仕事の仕方について非常に大きな自由が認められている。過去のプロジェクトの遺品がずっと取っておかれており、照明はクリエイティブであることが基本で、寮は1950年代風の小さな家のようだ。キャンパス中に広いオープンスペースがたくさんある。給料がどこから出ているのか忘れてしまわないように、角のところにはサーバのラックがあって現実を思い出させるようになっている。[via Office Snapshots ]

Do you want to reduce your expenses ?
e-Invoicing is the solution !
Do you want to reduce your expenses ?
e-Invoicing is the solution !
There are about 28 billion invoices issued in Europe each year .
About half of them in B2B market segment .
Using e-Invoicing makes it possible to cut costs even by 70 % .
Why not use this solution ?
e -Invoicing stands for electronic invoicing and implies electronic transfer of invoicing information ( billing and payment ) between business partners ( i.e. seller and buyer ) .
e -Invoicing is an essential part of an efficient financial supply chain and it links the internal processes of enterprises to the payment systems .
According to estimations of the European Commission , European e-invoicing initiative can bring savings of around EUR 64.5 billion per year for businesses .
Since 1 January 2004 there has been a legal obligation for undertakings operating in the European Union to accept electronic invoices .
However , experience shows that not all companies make the use of this possibility .
Until now the situation is as follows : the e-Invoicing system is used mainly by larger companies while the small and medium - sized ones have to learn and to follow this approach .
This system offers a huge cost saving potential .
It is estimated ( Deutsche Post ) that a traditional invoice causes costs amounting to EUR 0.70 - 4.00 for an issuer ( costs of billing system , printing , enveloping and transportation ) and EUR 2.00 - 3.00 for a receiver ( scanning , manual finishing and ERP system ) .
But cost savings are not the only advantage of the e-Invoicing system .
Such issues as quality improvement , prompt posting , increased efficiency due to automatic processing and no-paper model are characteristics of the system as well .
As the example of one of the leading pharmaceutical corporation shows , the costs for invoice exchange between business partners can be reduced even by 70 % using e-Invoicing .
The corporation has set an objective to receive 63 % invoices in electronic form – this goal has been almost achieved after just 10 months .
One of the advantages is that 99 % of e-Invoices received can be posted in the bookkeeping system without having to process them manually .
How does data archiving look like under the e-Invoicing system ?
e-Invoices are saved in the IXOS archive ( the documents are non-changeable , including verify log ) and in an electronic archive in accordance with the legal requirements .
Paper invoices are scanned and after that kept sorted by their scanning date in a high rack archive .
e -Invoicing …
Why not use this opportunity and save some money ?

As I discussed last week , members of Congress not only have great health insurance , they also have access to the superb on - site Office of the Attending Physician for themselves and their family for a mere pittance .
So of course they do n't understand !
I think Nick Kristof makes a fine suggestion here and we should ask Congress to do it to show they 're working in good faith :
Let me offer a modest proposal :
If Congress fails to pass comprehensive health reform this year , its members should surrender health insurance in proportion with the American population that is uninsured .
It may be that the lulling effect of having very fine health insurance leaves members of Congress insensitive to the dysfunction of our existing insurance system .
So what better way to attune our leaders to the needs of their constituents than to put them in the same position ?
About 15 percent of Americans have no health insurance , according to the Census Bureau .
Another 8 percent are underinsured , according to the Commonwealth Fund , a health policy research group .
So I propose that if health reform fails this year , 15 percent of members of Congress , along with their families , randomly lose all health insurance and another 8 percent receive inadequate coverage .
Congressional critics of President Obama ’s efforts to achieve health reform worry that universal coverage will be expensive , while their priority is to curb social spending .
So here ’s their chance to save government dollars in keeping with their own priorities .
Those same critics sometimes argue that universal coverage need n’t be a top priority because anybody can get coverage at the emergency room .
Let them try that with their kids .

In this round - up we 'll be looking at 5 JavaScript libraries that can really ease the development of modern , attractive web sites .
The libraries that we 'll be looking at are n't libraries in the same sense as something like jQuery or the YUI ; they 're much smaller and much more specialized .
But they 're the best at what they do and provide unique functionality .
1. Fixing PNGs in IE6 with DD_BelatedPNG
Created by : Drew Diller
License : MIT
Usage : Fixes alpha - transparent PNGs in IE6
Size : 6.86 kb ( compressed )
Compatibility : IE6 only
View Demo
Download
DD_belatedPNG was created for the single purpose of allowing alpha - transparent PNGs to be used in IE6 without resorting to Microsoft 's proprietary AlphaImageLoader filter .
As anyone who 's tried to use PNGs in IE6 before knows , although they can be made to work to a very basic degree , things like repeated background - images are out of the question .
Using the AlphaImageLoader filter only fixes half of the PNG problem in IE6 as it can only be used with background images .
To make use of alpha - transparent PNGs on < img > elements , another fix is used , which is typically the HTC fix which relies on a transparent PNG and an HTC behavior file .
Additionally , as Firebug and YSlow users will be aware of , Microsoft 's AlphaImageLoader is slow ; one of YSlow 's guidelines is to avoid the filter at all costs .
DD_belatedPNG uses Microsoft 's implementation of VML to replace PNGs with VML elements , which do support alpha - transparency .
It can be used with both full < img > elements and CSS background - images .
When background - images are replaced , common features such as background - repeat and : hover states can also be used so this library solves all of the common PNG problems in IE6 .
Usage
Using DD_BelatedPNG
is exceptionally easy ; it only needs to be used with IE6 , so the main script can be included in the page using a conditional comment :
The library has a single method , fix , which is used to supply simple CSS selectors that are targeted by the library , any < img > element that has a PNG src attribute , or any element using a PNG CSS background with the matching class name will be fixed .
This part of the script can go into the conditional comment as well so that only IE6 will need to process these additional rules :
Fixed PNGs in IE6 will now appear as they should and can be background - positioned and repeated , and also work with : hover states , unlike Microsoft 's proprietary filter .
The following image shows a before and after picture of an alpha - transparent background image :
2. Use any Font with Cufon

Compatibility : All ( all common versions from all common vendors , including IE6 )

Typography is one area of web development that has seen painfully little advancement when compared with other areas of the industry .
Web developers have been forced to rely on a small set of ' web safe ' fonts that are likely to be installed on the majority of their visitor 's computers .
Image and flash - based solutions have arisen , both of which have downsides to using .
Cufon offers developers a robust and fast solution , which can be displayed in the browser without requiring third - party plugins using features built in to browsers .
Cufon fonts can be used as VML for native IE implementation , or the < canvas > element for other more capable browsers .
Awesomely , we can also set different styles of the replaced text , such as its color and size using pure CSS .
Usage
This library differs from the others in that a little bit of preparation is required before use ; a new font file needs to be generated which can be done easily using the cufon website .
The will generate an SVG font and save it in a JS file .
This file needs to then be linked to any other < script > resource after the cufon core file :
Then it 's just a case of telling Cufon which elements to replace :
The API offers other solutions for using multiple fonts on the same page and for improving performance in IE .
Although I 've called this section , " Using any Font " … you should remember that only fonts that are licensed to be embedded should be used .
The following screenshot shows a replaced heading :
3. Use Firebug in any Browser

All the power of Firebug in browsers other than Firefox

Compatibility : All non-Firefox browsers

Firebug is without doubt one of the greatest assets to web development available ; I certainly use it on a daily basis when developing for the web , and I know it 's the plugin of choice for many others too .
An unfortunate side - effect of Firebug 's excellence is that other similar tools for other browsers pale in comparison and appear inferior .
Trouble - shooting layout issues and CSS bugs in IE for example can be a lesson in futility .
This is where Firebug Lite steps in ; this is a simple JavaScript library that recreates most of the key features of the Firebug interface , bringing our debugger of choice to all other platforms .
Fixing layouts and troubleshooting cross - browser issues becomes easy once more .
One of the greatest things about Firebug Lite is that you do n't need to download it or install anything in order to start using it ; when you want to debug a page you 're working on in browsers that are n't Firefox you can just include a script file whose SRC points to the online version :
That 's it , when you run the page in any other browser , Firebug Lite will be present on the page .
For off line use , the script file , as well as a CSS file , can be downloaded and should just be used like any other JS or CSS file .
The following screenshot shows Firebug Lite in Safari :
4. Render Interactive 3D Shapes with Raphael JS
Created by : Dmitry Baranovskiy
License : MIT
Usage : Draw SVG shapes on the page
Size : 58.4 kb ( compressed )
Compatibility : All ( all common versions from all common vendors , including IE6 )
View Demo
Download
Ok , so this library is n't quite so small , but there 's a reason for that ; the library does a huge range of things and adds complete SVG control to a web page .
Frankly , its power is awesome .
Imagine being able to draw smooth curves across a web page and create custom shapes on the fly – Raphael does that .
You can do rounded corners that are completely cross - browser with no images ( other than those actually drawn by the library ) , you can create faded reflections for any images , rotate the images dynamically and much more .
As all paths are drawn using SVG elements , you can attach JavaScript events to them so that people can interact with the images on mouseover or click ( or any other JS events ) .
The possibilities are endless and the API provides a wide range of different methods that make working with the library a pleasure .
Usage
The library must of course be linked to :
This is it , there are no other dependencies .
Now we can begin creating our SVG shape :
The library is made to be easy to use and we 've only used a tiny fraction of its capabilities in this example .
The page that this is used on should appear like this :
5. Progressively Enhance Your Site into the Future with Modernizr
Created by : Faruk Ateş and Paul Irish .
License : MIT
Usage : Detect HTML5 and CSS3 support
Size : 7 kb ( compressed )
Compatibility : All
View Demo
Download
It 's an exciting time for web development with CSS3 and HTML5 advancing by the day , but it's also a frustrating time because we 've got all these advanced new technologies coming out with very little support .
We want to start using all the great new HTML5 and CSS3 features , but most of the new HTML5 elements for example are only supported in maybe a single browser .
Modernizr is a tiny little library which simply tests whether the current environment supports a series of advanced features , such as the new < audio > and < video > elements .
A JavaScript object is then created by the library which contains Booleans indicating whether each feature is supported .
So if the current browser does support the new < audio > element , Modernizr.audio will return true .
It 's that simple .
The library also adds class names to the < html > element that we can target with CSS in order to hide certain elements to the page , so when the < audio > element is supported , < html > element will receive the class name .audio .
When browsers that do n't support it view the page , the element will get the class . no-audio .
This is incredible because it means that we can safely add these new features to our pages for the browsers that do support them , without causing chaos in the browsers that do n't .
In the nature of progressive enhancement , we can create an accessible and broadly support core of content , and then progressively add more and more features for browsers that support them .
Usage
Let 's see it in action to display some nice CSS3 effects ; first we just link to the very tiny library using the standard < script > element :
Then we can add the following CSS :
This will ensure that browsers which do not support the < audio > element do not see it .
The element does provide a built - in fallback for browsers that do n't support it , but this way is better .
The body of the page could then look something like this :
Once this is done we can detect whether the browser supports HTML5 audio and show or hide the link to the media ( we could easily do this using just the CSS , but this way we get to see the Modernizr object in action ) :
This is all we need ; capable browsers will see the < audio > element but not the link , while less capable browsers will see the link and not the < audio > :
Conclusion
Each of these libraries caters to a very specific problem ; they 're generally much smaller than more well known and general purpose libraries , but just as useful for their specialized purpose .
Each of them can aid us in one way or another when developing web sites from either easing development in IE6 , using non-standard fonts without cumbersome replacement techniques , to detecting support for the latest CSS3 and HTML5 technologies or generating complex and interactive images .
Have you ever wondered what happened to the fifty - six men who signed the Declaration of Independence ?
This is the price they paid :
Five signers were captured by the British as traitors , and tortured before they died .
Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned .
Two lost their sons in the revolutionary army , another had two sons captured .
Nine of the fifty - six fought and died from wounds or hardships resulting from the Revolutionary War .
These men signed , and they pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor !
What kind of men were they ?
Twenty - four were lawyers and jurists .
Eleven were merchants .
Nine were farmers and large plantation owners .
All were men of means , well educated .
But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty could be death if they were captured .
Carter Braxton of Virginia , a wealthy planter and trader , saw his ships swept from the seas by the British navy .
He sold his home and properties to pay his debts , and died in rags .
Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly .
He served in the Congress without pay , and his family was kept in hiding .
His possessions were taken from him , and poverty was his reward .
Vandals or soldiers or both , looted the properties of Ellery , Clymer , Hall , Walton , Gwinnett , Heyward , Ruttledge , and Middleton .
Perhaps one of the most inspiring examples of " undaunted resolution " was at the Battle of Yorktown .
Thomas Nelson , Jr. was returning from Philadelphia to become Governor of Virginia and joined General Washington just outside of Yorktown .
He then noted that British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headqurt , but that the patriot 's were directing their artillery fire all over the town except for the vicinity of his own beautiful home .
Nelson asked why they were not firing in that direction , and the soldiers replied , " Out of respect to you , Sir . "
Nelson quietly urged General Washington to open fire , and stepping forward to the nearest cannon , aimed at his own house and fired .
The other guns joined in , and the Nelson home was destroyed .
Nelson died bankrupt .
Francis Lewis's Long Island home was looted and gutted , his home and properties destroyed .
His wife was thrown into a damp dark prison cell without a bed .
Health ruined , Mrs. Lewis soon died from the effects of the confinement .
The Lewis 's son would later die in British captivity , also .
" Honest John "
Hart was driven from his wife 's bedside as she lay dying , when British and Hessian troops invaded New Jersey just months after he signed the Declaration .
Their thirteen children fled for their lives .
His fields and his grist mill were laid to waste .
All winter , and for more than a year , Hart lived in forests and caves , finally returning home to find his wife dead , his chidrvanished and his farm destroyed .
Rebuilding proved too be too great a task .
A few weeks later , by the spring of 1779 , John Hart was dead from exhaustion and a broken heart .
Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates .
New Jersey 's Richard Stockton , after rescuing his wife and children from advancing British troops , was betrayed by a loyalist , imprisoned , beaten and nearly starved .
He returned an invalid to find his home gutted , and his library and papers burned .
He , too , never recovered , dying in 1781 a broken man .
William Ellery of Rhode Island , who marveled that he had seen only " undaunted resolution " in the faces of his co-signers , also had his home burned .
Only days after Lewis Morris of New York signed the Declaration , British troops ravaged his 2,000 - acre estate , butchered his cattle and drove his family off the land .
Three of Morris ' sons fought the British .
When the British seized the New York houses of the wealthy Philip Livingston , he sold off everything else , and gave the money to the Revolution .
He died in 1778 .
Arthur Middleton , Edward Rutledge and Thomas Heyward Jr. went home to South Carolin tight .
In the British invasion of the South , Heyward was wounded and all three were captured .
As he rotted on a prison ship in St. Augustine , Heyward 's plantation was raided , buildings burned , and his wife , who witnessed it all , died .
Other Southern signers suffered the same general fate .
Among the first to sign had been John Hancock , who wrote in big , bold script so George III " could read my name without spectacles and could now double his reward for 500 pounds for my head . "
If the cause of the revolution commands it , roared Hancock , " Burn Boston and make John Hancock a beggar ! "
Here were men who believed in a cause far beyond themselves .
Such were the stories and sacrifices of the America revolution .
These were not wild eyed , rabble - rousing ruffians .
They were soft - spoken men of means and education .
They had security , but they valued liberty more .
Standing tall , straight , and unwavering , they pledged : " For the support of this Declaration , with firm reliance on the protection of the Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other , our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . "
BELLINGHAM , Wash . --
Arcing wires are being blamed for a spectacular explosion that took place in this Northern Washington city over the weekend .
Trouble began when a 60 - foot poplar tree swaying into high voltage power lines Saturday afternoon .
The tree branches danced closer and closer to the lines , eventually catching on fire .
Kaleb Skurdal was driving by when he saw the flames .
He stopped his car , and started filming with his cell phone .
Raw video of the tree fire " Like for five minutes I 'm just like standing here , " he said .
Skurdal and several others called the fire department .
But after 10 minutes , fire trucks had yet to arrive at the scene .
Meantime , the electricity began pulsating , and the flames were intensifying , Skurdal said .
" Like every time it would hit , it would be like , ' Dzzzzz , ' and basically sounded like a light sabre -- the light sabre sound in Star Wars . '" Then it happened .
A huge arc sent a bolt of fire like lightning down the tree , and everyone around felt the jolt .
" It basically felt like a bomb going off , " said Skurdal .
" I was like , ' This is what its like to live in Israel . '" Fortunately nobody was hurt and everyone in the house below the tree were able to get out safely .
The arc caused a power surge , damaging many computers and circuit breakers in the neighborhood .
Some 4,500 people were left without power .
" The computer fried , a fax machine fried , things like that , " said Chris McCoy , computer technician for 3D Corp .
The Bellingham Fire Department says it got a call of arcing wires and passed that information on to Puget Sound Energy .
Asst . Fire Chief Roger Christensen said the department does n't typically respond to call of arcing wires unless flames are also reported .
In this case , the spokesman said , nobody did .
I used to be a smoker .
The first thing I did when I woke up at 6 am was to reach out of bed , grab a cigarette and light up .
It was my start to the day , every day .
I tried several times to give up , but only lasted a few months before going back .
During one of the periods when I was off cigarettes , I went to the pub .
Somebody bought a round , then someone passed round a packet of fags .
I foolishly took one – I 'd had a few drinks – and the next thing I was a smoker again .
That was about 30 years ago , and I finally managed to kick the habit soon after that , partly because I met a woman who did n't smoke .
We married and had four children .
Much has changed in our behaviour and attitude towards smoking .
Happily , far fewer people now smoke – it's down to 21 % of those over 16 in England , compared to 39 % in 1980 – and smoking has been restricted in a number of useful ways .
The action this government has taken against smoking has been very welcome and it deserves credit for that .
They have banned most tobacco advertising , brought in graphic picture warnings on cigarette packets , and raised the age at which it 's legal to buy cigarettes from 16 to 18 .
The government also introduced the ban on smoking in public places , such as pubs and restaurants , which has made a big difference to public health , although they did wait until Scotland and Ireland had changed the law before following suit .
Tomorrow , the House of Commons will see the third and final reading of the Health Bill .
I believe MPs must support the clause that would ensure that cigarettes being sold in shops must be stored out of sight , though I 'm puzzled and concerned as to why so many seem reluctant to back this move .
Ending point - of - sale displays in this way is an excellent idea and necessary .
Whether by accident or design , the primary colours used on both the outside of cigarette packets and the shelves they are kept on attract children .
It 's the same marketing technique that is used with confectionery .
Tobacco companies can't be trusted to make cigarette packets a colour that does n't work in this way , so they should be put out of sight .
This is very important because most smokers get hooked as teenagers – few start at 18 – so if we can stop children being addicted tobacco companies will soon run out of customers .
The government 's " de- normalisation " of tobacco is welcome , but it 's taking too long .
The Health Bill proposes to restrict cigarette - vending machines in pubs .
But they should be banned altogether .
Even smokers do n't like them , because they typically give you only 16 cigarettes instead of a normal packet of 20 and cost £ 6 , about £ 1 more than in the shops .
And many pub landlords think the government 's halfway - house proposals are unworkable because bar staff would have to check people 's age ID before operating the machine by remote control .
In my view smokers who currently stand outside a pub or restaurant having a fag should have to stand at least several yards away from the front door , to save the 79 % of us who do n't smoke from breathing in their smoke when we go in or out .
We should curtail the rights of the 21 % and increase their responsibilities towards the 79 % .
In other words , we should stop them killing us and our children .
Studies estimate that about 11,000 people a year die because of passive smoking .
This is n't nanny statism , Big Brother , or wrongful interference in people 's personal freedoms – it's the right thing to do to protect the health of the vast majority of us who do n't smoke from the declining minority who do .
Smoking should be banned in cars , and particularly any vehicle with children in it .
On a school visit I met a 12 - year - boy who wanted to be an athlete who told me that every morning his mother lit up when she was driving to school , even though he'd begged her to stop .
He should be able to report her to the police .
It should also be illegal to smoke at home in front of children .
I accept that enforcing such a law would be difficult , but it would send a message that such behaviour is unacceptable .
And shops should need a licence to sell cigarettes .
They need a licence to sell alcohol , which is sometimes addictive and certainly harmful , just like tobacco , so why not ?
That would make shopkeepers less likely to sell fags to people under age .
Some shopkeepers are genuinely afraid of a ban on tobacco displays .
But that is because the tobacco industry have been up to their old tricks .
They tried to convince pubs that the smoke - free law would drive them out of business so they would lobby against the law .
Now they are doing the same thing with shopkeepers .
A retailer from the northeast recently went to Ireland to find out the truth and the shopkeepers he spoke to told him that now they had won their displays back from the tobacco companies who controlled them , they were free to promote products that allowed them to make a healthy profit .
Recently I spent some time in Mauritius ; not the six - star hotel bit , but the parts where the poor people live where so many die of heart attacks because of smoking .
The island 's surgeon - general said that he wanted Mauritius to become the first totally no-smoking country in the world .
I would like the UK to get there first .

Cable stations which flout the ban face fines
Authorities in Venezuela say they will punish TV stations if they continue to broadcast episodes of cult US animation Family Guy .
Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami says the show should be banned because it promotes the use of marijuana .
He took exception to a recent episode in which one character - Brian , a talking dog - started a campaign to legalise the drug .
Cable stations which refuse to dump the show would be fined , El Aissami said .
It is not the first time the government of President Hugo Chavez has reacted badly to a cartoon .
Last year ,
The Simpsons was deemed unsuitable for children after officials decided it flouted regulations prohibiting " messages that go against the whole education of boys , girls and adolescents " .
One local station was threatened with financial sanctions for broadcasting the adventures of the dysfunctional family in an early morning slot .
Televen avoided the fine by pulling the show and replacing it with Baywatch .
However , they were still forced to show public service films as an apology .
Venezuelan TV is known for filling its schedules with re-runs of old US series and Latin American soap operas .
It also includes a talk show hosted by the country 's president , Hugo Chavez .
New regulations for cable TV in the country could also see cable channels forced to carry Chavez 's frequent speeches .
It comes up a lot in discussions of women in computer science , women who write code , women in open source .
Eventually , someone brings up the fact that women score slightly lower on math tests .
Clearly , they claim , this biological inferiority must explain why there are fewer women in math heavy fields .
It sounds like a compelling reason , and it gets a lot of play .
Except , you know what ?
It ’s a lie .
I ’m a mathematician .
I ’ve looked at those numbers , I ’ve read some papers .
The research into biologically - linked ability is fascinating , but it simply is n’t significant enough to explain the huge gender gap we see in the real world .
I used to do this presentation on the back of a napkin for people who tried to spout this misconception to my face , and I finally put it online :
Love it ?
Hate it ?
Learn something ?
Catch the Mathnet reference ?
Let me know .

Editor 's Note : JohnnyG was riled up about the latest iteration of " maybe the Toronto Maple Leafs should get dropped from Hockey Night in Canada " .
So riled up in fact that he put together the cold hard numbers that should forever put this familiar hobbyhorse to rest .
Imagine if the Leafs were good !
Recently there was an article in the Toronto Sun written by Rob Longley that surmised after speaking with Scott Moore ( Executive Director of CBC Sports ) via e-mail that the Leafs could possible be dropped from the HNIC national broadcast .
I put up a fanshot on the article here .
He deduces ( with some sort of logic that I cannot comprehend ) that the Leafs may be dropped due to falling ratings and then quickly backs that up with ratings numbers that show that they are the most watched sports show in Canada .
This train of logic makes about as much sense as a Drunken Don Cherry Rant .
Well the article got me into a bit of a fight with a co-worker .
I explained that I highly doubted that it was anything more then lip service given that the CBC will likely run the games that gives them the highest ratings .
They argued that I could not possibly know that .
I pointed out that it in fact happened multiple times in 2008 - 2009 that Toronto actually had a Saturday off .
I am sure most of the members of this site can remember those Saturdays last December ; we were all kinds of lost and bored on Saturday night .
In any case , I started out to find out proof of my assertion and with the help of blindfolded tank driver I was able to find a site that contained Rankings for Canadian Television .
All of the ratings and viewership numbers were taken from www.bbm.ca individual links here , in the national archive .
A couple of notes before you look at the data .
There are 27 Saturdays in the regular season in 2008 - 2009 , 26 if you deduct the day off for the all - star game .
In total there was 3 Saturdays in which the Leafs did not play ( 4 if you include the all - star game ) .
Secondly I was going to include the 2nd HNIC game of the night in the calculation for a reference but unfortunately out of the 26 weeks they only made the top 30 lists 6 times , and anything outside of the top 30 was not recorded in the archives .
Full data table and summary notes after the jump .
In Millions Date Week HNIC # 1 Oct 6 - 12 Week 06 1.323 Montreal @ Toronto Oct 13 - 19 Week 07 1.31 Toronto @ Pittsburgh Oct 20 - 26 Week 08 1.306 Ottawa @ Toronto Oct27 - Nov2 Week 09 1.021 New York Rangers @ Toronto Nov 3 - 9 Week 10 1.568 Montreal @ Toronto Nov 10 - 16 Week 11 1.376 Toronto @ Vancouver Nov 17 - 23 Week 12 1.518 Chicago @ Toronto Nov 24 -30 Week 13 1.372 Philadelphia @ Toronto Dec 1 - 7 Week 14 1.22 Washington @ Toronto Dec 8 - 14 Week 15 0.942 NIL Dec 15 - 21 Week 16 1.163 Toronto @ Pittsburgh Dec 22 - 28 Week 17 0.9 NIL Dec29 - Jan4 Week 18 0.84 Ottawa @ Toronto * Jan 5 - 11 Week 19 1.136 Toronto @ Philadelphia * Jan 12 - 18 Week 20 1.075 NIL Jan 19 - 25 Week 21 All Star Game = 1.516 Jan 26 - Feb1 Week 22 1.284 Pittsburgh @ Toronto Feb 2 - 8 Week 23 1.372 Toronto @ Montreal Feb 9 - 15 Week 24 0.988 Pittsburgh @ Toronto Feb 16 - 22 Week 25 1.833 Vancouver @ Toronto Feb 23 - Mar 1 Week 26 1.141 Toronto @ Ottawa Mar 2 - 8 Week 27 1.428 Edmonton @ Toronto Mar 9 - 15 Week 28 1.159 Calgary @ Toronto Mar 16 - 22 Week 29 1.274 Toronto @ Montreal Mar 23 - 29 Week 30 1.153 Boston @ Toronto Mar 30 - Apr5 Week 31 1.209 Montreal @ Toronto Apr 6 - 12 Week 32 1.027 Ottawa @ Toronto
-- On Average the ratings for HNIC Game 1 are in the 1.228 million range .
When the Leafs play it is 1.262 Million .
When the Leafs do not play it is 0.972 Million .
That means on average the CBC loses approx .
289,000 viewers when the Leafs do not play .
That is a drop of almost 24 %
-- Week 18 - January 3rd Lowest rated game of the season was played with Ottawa and Toronto .
This is actually a fairly slow TV week as only 7 programs in all of Canada broke the 1 Mil viewership total during that week .
Also worthy of note is that the Leafs game started at 7 PM Eastern Time and the World Jr Hockey Team started at 7:30 which raked in 1.855 Mil Viewers .
Clearly the Juniors and the Holidays had an effect on numbers
-- Week 25 - February 21st - Highest rated game of the season with 1.833 Million , this was a clear winner for a couple of reasons .
1 , Vancouver and Toronto are two of the biggest markets in Canada .
2 , It was Hockey Day in Canada .
And 3 , it was Mats Sundin 's return to Toronto .
You may remember ?
He scored the game winning shootout goal .
-- 2 out of the 3 lowest rated games of the year were when the Leafs did n't play which were really only saved by the fact that the world juniors it 's a crazy popular event in Canada and it ruined the January 3rd ratings
-- Toronto and Ottawa was a horrible draw last year , this should not be a surprised to anyone that watched the game .
The Battle of Ontario has become incredibly stale and boring since the playoff matches .
They averaged only 1.0785 Million per game on Saturday
-- Toronto and Montreal as expected was a very good draw on average pulling in 1.3492 Million , I am sure the CBC wishes they could have a dozen of these games each year .
( Go Go Crazy Grabbo )
--
The best part about all of this , is that the ratings from the games so far this year hover in the range of 1.6 to 1.75 Mil .
Which is of course higher then any game we had at all last year .
The CBC is doing better with this team so far in the ratings they did vs. almost any single game from last year .
That should tell you right away that they will not drop the Leafs .
So what does this all teach us ?
It tells me that CBC would have to be run by a bunch of Monkey 's to drop the Leafs from the National Broadcast .
While there is not much Data to go on in the small 3 game sample that we have .
There is a clear sign that no Leafs = Less People .
So what do you tell people when they say the CBC favours the Leafs ?
You say Damn Right and for good reason :
I wrote before about JAIPHO , a mobile optimized web gallery that can be installed on both mobile and standard websites .
Now the developer of JAIPHO has created a server side solution – Pipho .
Pipho reads photos from any directory , creates resized thumbnail and slide images , and combines it with the Jaipho javascript .
It also supports text files as descriptions for both gallery and slides .
Pipho requires PHP5 and is written in the Zend Framework , but does not requires any Zend class .
All PHP classes are stored in library folder .
[ singlepic id=211 w=106 h=200 float=left ]
If you ’ve designed your iPhoneized site using iUI , Jaipho / Pipho integrates very well .
It is currently works on iPhone only , but testing is underway for Android and so far it looks promising .
Plans are in the works to support other smartphones as well .

A gang of more than 100 alleged phishers has been charged in the U.S. and Egypt in connection with a global scheme to steal bank credentials of victims and siphon money from their accounts .
A total of 53 defendants ( .pdf ) ranging in ages 18 to 44 are charged in a thickindictment ( .pdf ) unsealed Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles .
An additional person is being charged at the state level , and another 47 alleged co-conspirators have been charged in Egypt .
The indictment is the culmination of a two - and - a - half - year investigation , dubbed Operation Phish Phry .
The suspects in Egypt allegedly sent bogus e-mails purporting to be legitimate correspondence from the victims ' banks , urging the victims to update their online banking records .
The e-mails referred recipients to a fake bank website under the criminals ' control , which prompted the victims for an account number and password .
Authorities allege that the U.S. ringleaders – named as Kenneth Joseph Lucas , 25 , Nichole Michelle Merzi , 24 , and Jonathan Preston Clark , 25 – recruited people to set up bank accounts at Bank of America and Wells Fargo .
The gang members in Egypt would then access the victim accounts and initiate wire transfers to siphon funds to the receiving accounts .
Once the money was withdrawn from these accounts , it was transmitted by wire service to gang members in Egypt , minus a portion kept for the U.S. participants .
“ This international phishing ring had a significant impact on two banks and caused huge headaches for hundreds , perhaps thousands , of bank customers , " said Acting United States Attorney George S. Cardona in a statement .
The indictment does n't indicate how much money the gang stole .
But FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller says that authorities have so far identified $ 1.5 million that the gang transferred from victim accounts .
Not all of that money was successfully withdrawn from the receiving accounts by the criminals .
In some cases , she said , the banks discovered the fraudulent transfers and halted the funds before they could be withdrawn .
The 51 - count indictment charges the U.S. defendants with unauthorized access to computers , bank fraud , conspiracy to commit wire fraud , aggravated identity theft , and money laundering .
Each of the 53 U.S. defendants is charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud .
Some of them are also charged with the various additional counts .

Ms. Flynn , the mother of three daughters , with no college degree 
“ I had ‘ life experience , ’ ” she said with a smile  applied at American Eurocopter as soon as she heard it planned to open its original facility , a plant making civilian rescue helicopters , at the nearby Golden Triangle Airport .
She landed an office job , and after four years worked her way to supervisor in the materials department .
Known to her co-workers as “ Miss Judy , ” she is easy to spot by her bright blue lanyard , bearing her company identification card and lapel pins with pictures of American Eurocopter aircraft .
Still , for her , as for many American Eurocopter employees , the adjustment was n’t so easy .
In the company ’s first year , turnover was rampant as workers struggled to adjust to the painstaking routine of assembling helicopters .
Inside the factory , the time - consuming work was as challenging as a skilled trades position in a car plant , demanding precision , attention to detail and a reasonable understanding of helicopter mechanics .
It was a departure from the routine of a typical factory .
The dropout rate was high , “ mainly driven by the fact of people not knowing very well what we were doing , ” said Marc Paganini , the chief executive of American Eurocopter .
Executives soon realized that something had to be done to protect their new investment .
Most of the original workers had left , taking what little experience they had with them , and newcomers were making all kinds of mistakes , which were costly given that the helicopters being assembled were used for rescue missions , where lives were quite literally at stake .
But instead of giving up on their workers and replacing them with more - experienced counterparts from overseas , managers decided to spend more time interviewing and assessing American workers , and to provide more training once they were on the plant floor .
Ms. Flynn said the attitude at the plant became , “ We will help you to succeed ; we are determined you will succeed here . ”
Soon , the turnover slowed , and a second plant opened next door .
The factories gave EADS the opening it wanted in the American market , letting it compete for an even bigger prize : a $ 35 billion contract to build refueling tanker planes for the Air Force , which it landed in February 2008 in a stiff competition with Boeing .
Terry Holdbrooks arrived at Guantánamo detention camp in the summer of 2003 as a godless 19 - year - old with a love of drinking , hard rock music and tattoos .
By the time he left Cuba the following year , he had alienated his army colleagues , won the respect of the detainees and , most astonishingly , converted to Islam in a midnight ceremony in the presence of one of the detainees , who had become his mentor .
When I meet Holdbrooks , now 26 and named Mustafa Abdullah , he is wearing a black Muslim cap , a thick beard and long - sleeved traditional robes that almost obscure the tattoo on his right arm that reads " by demons be driven " .
Holdbrooks grew up in Arizona , the only son of junkie parents who split up when he was seven years old .
He was raised by his ex-hippie grandparents .
Tired of being poor , determined not to follow in his parents ' footsteps and keen to see the world , Holdbrooks signed up for the military .
He was stationed with the 253rd Military Police Company , mostly doing administrative support work , when he was told he was to be deployed to Guantánamo .
During a two - week training course , the new guards took it in turns to act as detainees , and were also taken to Ground Zero .
" We were not taught anything about Islam , " he says .
" We were shown videos of 11 September and all we kept being told was that the detainees were the worst of the worst – they were Bin Laden 's drivers , Bin Laden 's cooks , and these people will kill you the first chance they get . "
Holdbrooks skims over the words , as if he is quoting from his forthcoming memoir , Traitor ?
" I was questioning things from day one , " he says .
" The first thing I saw was a kid who is all of 16 who had never seen the ocean , did n't know the world was round .
I am sitting there thinking , what can he possibly know about the war on terror , what could he possibly know ? "
Holdbrooks ' duties at Guantánamo including cleaning , collecting rubbish , walking up and down the block to ensure detainees were n't passing anything between cells and ferrying them to and from interrogations .
There were plenty of opportunities for communication .
Holdbrooks 's friendliness towards the detainees – they called him " the nice guard " – earned him unwelcome attention from his fellow guards .
" I did n't have a very high impression of my colleagues , " he says .
Many of them were " ridiculous Budweiser - drinking , cornbread - fed , tobacco - chewing drunks , racists and bigots " who blindly followed orders , and within months he had stopped talking to them altogether .
There were frequent physical altercations : " One time one of them said to me , ' Hey , Holdbrooks , you know what we are going to do today ?
We are going to skull - fuck the Taliban out of you – you 're a sympathiser and we do n't like that . "
That led to another fist fight . "
While the guards indulged in alcohol , porn and sports , Holdbrooks says he needed to learn how the detainees could endure abuse and still smile , while he was utterly miserable .
" I knew nothing about Islam prior to Guantánamo , " he says , " so this was a complete culture shock to me .
I wanted to learn as much I could , so I started talking to the detainees about politics , ethics and morals , and about their lives and cultural differences – we would talk all the time . "
What began as curiosity turned to disciplined study , with Holdbrooks spending at least an hour a day learning about Islam and talking in chatrooms online .
Among those he talked to were the Tipton trio of British Muslims who featured in Michael Winterbottom 's docudrama , The Road to Guantánamo ; another was a man the other detainees referred to as the General – Moroccan - born Ahmed Errachidi , who had lived in Britain for 18 years , working as a chef , and spent five and a half years in Guantánamo accused of attending al - Qaida training camps .
( He was later released and cleared of any wrongdoing . )
" We 'd talk for hours and hours , " Holdbrooks says .
" We 'd talk about books , about music , about philosophy : we would stay up all night and talk about religion . "
Finally , six months into his time at Guantánamo , Holdbrooks was ready .
On 29 December 2003 , in the presence of Errachidi , he repeated the shahada , the statement of faith that is the sole requirement for converting to Islam : " There is no God but God and Muhammad is his prophet " .
The Guantánamo guard was now a Muslim .
He stopped drinking and even gave up music , because his interpretation of Islam suggested that this , too , was unacceptable .
" It was not easy praying five times a day without my colleagues finding out , " he says .
" I told them I had to go the bathroom a lot . "
Converting to Islam made Holdbrooks even more unhappy about his work – he felt he was worse off than the detainees .
" They were having a lot more fun than I was .
The Tipton trio were always playing tricks on the guards and the interrogators .
The detainees had a lot of freedom in their confinement : I had all the freedoms they did n't have , but I was a slave to what the army wanted me to do . "
This claim sounds implausible , but Holdbrooks says he is referring to their freedom of thought : he was impressed by the independence he saw in the detainees , compared to his fellow guards .
This still seems a rather self - pitying analysis , particularly when he goes on to describe how he had seen detainees being tortured .
" It was my job to take prisoners to interrogations , so sometimes I would sit and watch , " he says .
" I would see detainees who would be locked up for hours in horrible positions – for hours upon hours upon hours , in a room that might be 50 degrees or 60 degrees .
" There was one man who had defecated on himself and this ogre of an interrogator would douse water on him and then ask him if he was going to talk , and he would say he had nothing to talk about , and I remember thinking , what good is this going to accomplish ?
You cannot abuse and torture people and expect to get results that are accurate and credible . "
In the summer of 2004 , Holdbrooks left Guantánamo and was later discharged from the army on the grounds of a " general personality disorder " .
The alcohol problem that had plagued him before enlisting returned , and when his marriage dissolved , he sought solace in the old comforts of drinking , casual sex and music .
" I was having nightmares about my time in Guantánamo , " he says , " and I spent the best part of three years just trying to drink Guantánamo out of my mind . "
Today , Holdbrooks is a practising Muslim again , but he does not seem to be at peace .
There is a blankness in his gaze that hints at the scars his childhood and Guantánamo have left on him .
Why had this hard - living Arizona boy embraced Islam ?
The question needles me throughout our conversation .
It is only when , towards the end , Holdbrooks reveals that his favourite words are " structure " , " order " and " discipline " that the pieces fall into place .
Holdbrooks 's life had been a search for order : the regimentation of army life had appeared to offer structure , and when it let him down , he turned to religion .
Holdbrooks has more in common with his former colleagues than he realises : their allegiance to the army is matched by his adherence to faith .
" Islam is a very disciplined , regimented faith and it requires a great deal of effort and conviction , " he says .
" I 've had an unbelievable fascination with structure and order for as long as I can remember : structure , order and discipline – I just love them . "

Did Steve Clemons ever contact you , as he said he might ?
It seems I 've become personna non gratis with Steve since I pressed this issue on his blog .
But I 'm still posting there at TWN , and I do not intend to let up on the issue .
He expressed a " like " for you , no matter whatever transpired between him and Sibel , so I was hoping that you could convince him that this story deserves exposure on a grand scale .
I think , possibly , his friendship with Grossman may be the main factor fueling his reticence to get involved in a journalistic or blogging sense , and whatever transpired between he and Sibel is just a smokescreen .

What do you think of the following paragraph from WMR , about the Schakowsky situation , and what it could mean for the compromise of US Intelligence , particularly with regard to Iranian nuclear program and Israel 's insistence that it be destroyed ?
Currently , Schakowsky is chair of the House Select Committee on Intelligence ’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations --- which puts her in a conflict - of - interest in investigating Turkish and related Israeli intelligence penetration of the FBI and State Department , as stated under oath by Edmonds , and the paying of bribes by Turkish government interests to current and former members of Congress .

Styve @ 12 asked :
What do you think of the following paragraph from WMR , about the Schakowsky situation I think it 's damned irresponsible to go on record with that based on an anonymous source .
Particularly when there is no evidence , that I 'm aware of , that the Congresswoman in question ( whether Schakowsky or anybody else ) necessarily knew she was even being set up for blackmail .
She may not have even known it do this day , unless WMR has evidence to the contrary .
If so , he should present it .
If you 're gonna name names on something as damning as that , and state is as fact , it seems you should offer some actual evidence as to wrong - doing by the person you 're naming .
Otherwise , you 're just " outing " , as far as I can tell .
And offering no evidence to back up your outing in the bargain .

I believe , if memory serves me , that steve mentioned a friendship or close contact with Grossman in a personal email he sent to me .
I will look for it , but if thats the case , I certainly would not be comfortable sharing such a correspondence .
If he meant it for public perusal , he would have simply posted it on his blog .
It is also possible he mentioned it on his blog , prior to the thread I am linking to , ( in response to my constant needling on unrelated threads ) .
I will examine those , as well to see if I can find the comment about thier " relationship " , if any .
Here is the initial thread that Steve put up as a result of me , and others , needling him in January of ' 08 , and it does shed some small light on Steve 's position .
Its also interesting that Giraldi commented on the thread , as did " Lukery " ....
http://www.thewashington...s/2008/01/sibel_edmonds/
By the way , I see no reason that it is constructive for me to " middle man " any correspondence or contact you and Steve might initiate .
My suggestion would be for you to directly contact Steve , and express your curiousity about Steve 's read on the issue , especially as it pertains to Marc Grossman .

I do n't have any particular animosity for Madsen , Molly .
I just find him to be an * incredibly * irresponsible writer .
( Yeah , he also seems to have a serious anti-semetic thread , but that 's a separate issue ) .
He has gotten huge elements , in important story after important story completely wrong , and failed to bother to correct it even when called on it .
He has brought a great deal of damage to important stories that folks wo n't touch if they see that Madsen has touched them ( often extraordinarily incorrectly and irresponsibily ) .
I 'd refer you back to his initial inaccurate coverage of Clint Curtis .
His wholly inaccurate claim that he had in his hand a check for $ 12 million written by Saudi Arabia to throw the 2004 election for Bush , and so much more .
As I said , I have no particular animosity for him , and hope that he is well and healthy .
But it would be helpful for all of us if he considered a different profession where he can't cause quite as much damage to serious issues that need real investigation versus " my unnamed super - secret sources say " .
Hope that clarifies .

Most of this she testified to in a court of law , and is subject to laws of perjury if she knowingly was misrepresenting the truth .
Now its possible that there might be some complex disinformation campaign to cover up something that is legitimate , but i that is the case , then someone like Marc Grossman needs to be prepared to accept the costs of such a disinformation campaign and be subject to criminal prosecution for treason .
That 's not a very smart disinformation campaign if he values his life .
Gone unprosecuted , it promotes distrust of our government not following the rule of law to protect our country from within .
I think if you claim their 's inconsistencies out there that merit throwing out everything she says , you owe it to us to provide us links to substantiate that claim .

Brad , you 're not making sense regarding your disrespect for Wayne Madsen .
First of all , I 'm wondering why you did n't address " Styve 's " concern ( comment # 9 ) regarding your initial discrediting in early August of Madsen 's report that the Congresswoman in question was Jan Schakowsky .
In August you called him irresponsible for using unnamed sources , which happens to be a near universal practice for those who chose to protect them from retribution .
Today ( Comment # 19 above ) you answered Molly 's question ( # 18 above ) regarding the basis of your disrespect , repeating the accusation that Madsen 's use of unnamed sources discredits his credibility .
Yet , today 's " explosive " story has Edmonds confirming Madsen 's initial report that it was in fact Jan Schakowsky .
Instead of acknowledging Styve 's " I told you so " regarding Madsen 's now proved veracity , you ignore it and then use Molly to reaffirm your now discredited claim .
By the way , I have found Wayne Madsen to be one of the very few journalists to exercise a healthy skepticism --- at times even outrage --- regarding the dangerous and disproportionate influence of the Israel Lobby within our " republican democracy " , but I 've never , ever observed him to be " anti- semetic " ( sic ) , as you assert .
Dude , you need to come clean and let go of what now appears to be professional jealousy .

Progress @ 29 asked :

" Near universal " ?
Nonsense .
We will use unnamed sources here on on the absolute rarest of occasions , and even then , largely when there is some form of documentation to present to go with it and / or other corroborating and independently verifiable information for readers .
Madsen uses " sources say " constantly , while presenting little or no documentation to go with it .
Often it 's complete and utter nonsense .
When he has used documentation ( see the Saudi check , for example ) , it was phony , and took about 15 minutes for us to check it out and find that to be the case .
He never bothered to do so , and then never came clean about it , but instead told readers that it had really been a clever trick by the Bush crime family , or some such , to keep him from noticing a different story ( the Clint Curtis story , which he then proceeded to also botch ) .
Sorry .
Those are the facts .
As I said , I 'm sure he 's a very nice fellow and means well .
But he does no favors for the profession of journalism .
I assure you , there is no " professional jealousy " here , as someone suggested upthread .
I wish him all the luck in the world .
Just wish it did n't come at such a huge cost to so many important issues , and to the credibility of legitmate reporters on the Internets .
Yet , today 's " explosive " story has Edmonds confirming Madsen 's initial report that it was in fact Jan Schakowsky .
A broken clock is also correct twice a day .
That aside , I do n't enjoy this report on Schakowsky myself , as there is no evidence that she 's committed any crimes , or even knew about the taping , if it 's true .
However , Edmonds has now made the claim , in print , on the record , and so it needs to be reported out as such .
Madsen neither quoted any sources , nor cited any crimes in his article .
That is irresponsible in my opinion , as I mentioned previously .
Hope that clears it up .
And I agree with the poster who says this sort of discussion is unseamly , which is why I 've tried to avoid doing so .
But as I 've been asked now several times in these recent threads by readers , I thought I 'd reply .
Nothing to hide , and nothing to be concerned about .
I just find him to be an unreliable source of news , and so I do n't either read him or cite him .
I also have been trying to avoid disparaging him for many years , because it 's just ugly and a huge distraction from what actually matters .
Which I hope we can now get back to .
Thanks !

" Hearsay " ?
No. Aside from Edmonds ' credibility having been attested to by high officials in both houses of Congress , in the DoJ inspector general 's office , by a number of her colleagues in the FBI and in other branches of the government , various elements of the story have been indepdently corroborated by papers such as the Sunday Times of London , Vanity Fair and more .
How would a translator for the federal cops even have had access to most of this if it were true ?
You need to read up on her stories .
I 've offered many links for you in the above story .
There are scores more here at BRAD BLOG and hundreds more elsewhere .
Not to say that it can't be true , but it falls below the standard of evidence , allegation does n't mean fact .
You are correct .
Allegation does n't mean fact .
Which is why her allegations are pointed out as such .
And why investigation is called for ( and being done , by those of us who give a damn , even with the meager resources we are able to scrape together ) .
A better question may be why folks like Henry Waxman did not hold an investigation once his party attained the majority in Congress , as he supposedly had promised he would .
Another question is why the U.S. corporate media has n't seen fit to investigate .
The media in other countries have done so , but by and large the U.S. corporate media has been entirely silent , save for 60 Minutes ' 2002 report .
Why have n't they followed up , now that she 's able to speak and tell the whole story ?
Investigation is not a bad idea of course .
Glad to see you agree .

Brad ,
Although I 'm happy this story is reaching a wider audience ; and although I 'm supportive of your right to write the articles on this blog as you see fit ; I would prefer that you spend less space pondering upon the juicy mysteries of a bi-sexual " hooking " operation , and more space as to how our political system has been subverted in more ways than one .
For those of us that had the opportunity to watch Sibel 's deposition , yes , I 'm sure all of us are curious as to who this mystery - congresswoman is .
I grant you that .
and perhaps we have a good reason to want to know , even though Sibel cannot say whether or not this congresswoman even compromised herself .
but , again , for those of us that already watched Sibel 's deposition , what we really need now is a well - thought analysis , and perhaps more information to spread around the blogosphere .
you know what I mean ?
what I mean to suggest is : say you 're encountering this story for the first time .
what are the immediate impressions you would come away with ?
and are those the impressions that you , as the writer , hope to convey ?
sex is distracting .
one tends to lose their train of thought .
it 's the whole physiology thing .
like I indicated above , I 'm glad you 're getting the story out .

Sex is not distracting .
Sexual blackmail is a foreign espionage tactic .
This is a case of foreign espionage , and blackmail is central to it ( see Hastert and Google sexpionage ) .
Mossad is the world leader in this tactic and has every phone in the US wiretapped .
Lewinsky ?
Chandra Levy ?
Do the math .
It is clear that AIPAC only allows men and women who are subject to some form of blackmail to enter the political arena at the outset .
How many closeted gay Republican Senators and Congressman are there , really ?
How long is the list of prominent public officials caught in the web of sexpionage by foreign " swallows " and " ravens ? "
Whatever happened to the story about the wild poker parties at the Watergate ?
It 's not just relevant , it 's central .
A feature , not a bug .

EDMONDS : Absolutely .
And we also had Pentagon officials doing the same thing .
We were looking at Richard Perle and Douglas Feith .
They had a list of individuals in the Pentagon broken down by access to certain types of information .
Some of them would be policy related , some of them would be weapons - technology related , some of them would be nuclear - related .
Perle and Feith would provide the names of those Americans , officials in the Pentagon , to Grossman , together with highly sensitive personal information : this person is a closet gay ; this person has a chronic gambling issue ; this person is an alcoholic .
The files on the American targets would contain things like the size of their mortgages or whether they were going through divorces .
One Air Force major I remember was going through a really nasty divorce and a child custody fight .
They detailed all different kinds of vulnerabilities .

Thanks Brad for an extremely well - written summation of Sibel 's revelations .
While the word " explosive " may well be an understatement , I can't say that we should be shocked by any of this .
Corruption is endemic to the very structure of our corporate , ad revenue - based electoral system that in most instances excludes any who do not sell their souls to the multinational corporate conglomerates , Wall Street and international finance in order to acquire the money required for deceptive campaign advertising .
From the betrayal of the American electorate it is but a small step to the betrayal of the nation to foreign lobbyists and governments .
Even if every one of the individuals Sibel names were successfully prosecuted for treason ( no doubt , many should be ) , the problem will remain so long as we allow ourselves to be deceived by the corporate - owned media and the PR industry .
In this context , the corporate media 's failure to cover Sibel 's explosive allegations is understandable .
Once the word gets out , people may begin to raise the very question as to whether the explanation for endemic corruption lies in the structure of a system which permits a handful of giant media conglomerates to not only control 95 % of what we see , hear and read but to determine whom we elect , with those not willing to play the corporate shell game marginalized as " unelectable .

Fine I will slam it a second time Your comment is awaiting moderation .
Wanna know what I 'd like to see now ?
1000 + hours over the next year , of pure hard core blood sweat and production work ( e.g. Air Time / Final Product on Broadcast Spectrum ) in all network studio's , all discussing this , and forcing by proxy of sheer volume of people becoming informed to force the government to get to the bottom of this ASAP .
And the REASON is :
If corruption IS in government , it needs to get the hell out of Classified Computer Networks , and our Classified Documents as fast as possible , with accuracy , and without becoming a witch hunt .
If someone is named and we simply shut them down ( by limiting their fucking security clearance ) until it can be proven they are n't a screw up .
Why is this concept so hard to understand ?
Cause nobody explains it to YOU like this .
That 's why .
Simultaneously 400 + hours on electronic vote tabulation devices .
Nice how the media neglects this shit until election crunch time and then uses TIME ITSELF as a weapon against us , when the friggin electronic vote count screws the pooch with no public oversight .
Simultaneously 400 + hours on Senators , and the Monetary system .
Before the dollar goes to zero and the bond market forces our Government to be " no more . "
Simultaneously 400 + Hours on FISA and the Path to roll back our Constitution to the pre- 1970 's backup .
I joke somewhat but it ain't funny , my country feels DIRTY !
Simultaneously 400 + hours on Fascism in 2009 and public methods to hold responsible the Media by making the comments in their public file 's hold the key to their ability to hold a frequency allocation and station license .
If they are not in the public interest then what are they doing on public spectrum ?
That ought to fit the FCC's " education for children " on all Broadcast spectrum .
Even reading rainbow should be shoved to the side .
With the added benefit , we can start cleaning our government up , one arrest warrant at a time , while the people clean up the representatives up , one transparent paper ballot hand counted with an unbroken public chain of custody at a time .
Alternatively " they " ( do n't tell me you do n't know who they is ) can just keep driving the United States Of America off the cliff .

These allegations , makes all of our representatives suspect - each a potential traitor , far worse than Robert Hansen .
Now each must be cleared of the cloud of espionage against the people of the United States of America .
Against each of us - sold out for a few peices of silver and dirty movies .
Of all crimes large and small there is none worse than that of traitor to ones own country and people .
Ms. Edmonds should ( but will not ) go down into history books as the greatest patriot to have served her country and her fellow citizens .

I DO realize that politicians are corrupt , however this is NOT corruption this is espionage under United States Code ( USC ) Title 18 , para 794( a ) Espionage against the people of the United States and Para 794( c ) Conpiracy to commit .
When I was granted access to classified information , I took my oath seriously ( as do everyone except traitors ) , and realized the penalty for breach of that oath is and remains DEATH .
Sir , or Madam , this is not simple corruption .
I believe that anyone including Ms. Edmonds holds the same view , and understands the implications of espionage and sabotage , and the gravity of the protection of classified information , regardless of sensitivity .
These traitors put each and every American citizen at risk .
Again far more so than Robert Hanssen , who until this occured was the worst spy and traitor in the history of the United States .

I can't help but notice how the article is written .
The trivial stuff -- whether Schakowsky hd an affair -- is featured close to the beginning of the article while the important stuff -- Perle , Wolfowitz , and Feith discussing invading and partitioning Iraq four months BEFORE 911 is only covered at the end of the article .
Maybe you have a reason for this -- like trying to attract the attention of the MSM -- but this article seems like a trivilization of an incredibly important story .
I do n't care who Schakowsky did or did n't have sex with .
I do care that many thousands of human beings have died because Pentagon officials thirsted for war with a country that posed absolutely no threat to us .

As a European Union report into last year 's conflict between Georgia and Russia puts a large part of the blame on Georgia , the BBC's Tom Esslemont in Tbilisi asks where this leaves the small Caucasian nation .
Even before the EU - sponsored report was published , Georgia was pushing the line that it does not matter who fired the first shot .
The main issue , it said , is Russia 's ongoing " occupation " of its sovereign territory and years of stoking tensions between Georgia and its rebel regions .
Now the independent inquiry into the conflict has concluded .
But it is not entirely the conclusion Georgia wanted to hear .
Georgia 's president has not yet reacted to the report
It said Georgia 's use of force on the night of 7 August 2008 was not justifiable in the context of international law .
It also said that it could not substantiate " Georgian claims of a large - scale presence of Russian armed forces in South Ossetia prior to the Georgian offensive on 7/8 August " .
The Georgian government 's response - as expected - has been to dismiss those comments .
Wednesday evening 's national TV news bulletins said the report pinned the blame on Russia .
' Divide and rule '
For his part , Temuri Yakobashvili , state minister for reintegration , told the BBC that , although most of the facts in the report were accurate , he disagreed with some elements of it .
" I disagree with the notion that Georgia used excessive force in the attack on Tskhinvali because , as I mentioned , there are ample evidences of Russian deployment and these were not just peacekeepers , so one can hardly judge what is proportionate , " he said .
" One can hardly judge what is proportionate or disproportionate in this case . "
The Georgians have always maintained that Moscow was intent on subverting Georgia in an effort to " divide and rule " .
Indeed , the report states unequivocally that while " the onus of having actually triggered off the war lies with the Georgian side , the Russian side , too , carries the blame for a substantial number of violations of international law " .
Many Georgians who fled during the war have been unable to return home
So , with these conclusions , where does Georgia go from here ?
In the very short term , both countries ' reactions to the findings have only emphasised the deep divide that exists between Georgia and Russia and have shown that any hope of the two agreeing on the origins of the war is far - fetched .
Secondly , it has highlighted just how deep - seated the problem is .
For example , there are more than 20,000 displaced ethnic Georgians living in temporary accommodation in Georgia proper as a result of the 2008 conflict , unable to return to their homes in South Ossetia .
The region , and Georgia 's other disputed territory of Abkhazia , have declared independence and are both home to thousands of Russian troops .
Russia , together with Nicaragua and Venezuela , has recognised their independence .
Absent figure
The chance of Georgia regaining control of its breakaway territories is dim .
But , argues Lincoln Mitchell , a professor of international politics at Colombia University , the report might be good for Georgia , a country dependent on all the support it can get from the EU and one which has aspirations to join Nato .
" This [ report ] lays out the extent of the problem the country faces , " argues Mr Mitchell .
He also says it will not " change the European thought [ that ] Georgia should be a member of Nato " .
But , he argues , the West still does not want it to happen quite yet .
Continued destruction which came after the ceasefire agreement was not justifiable by any means

Press endorse Georgia war report
The one notably absent figure in Georgia 's official reaction to the report has been its controversial president , Mikheil Saakashvili .
He was the one who ordered the assault on Tskhinvali - a decision at the centre of this report 's conclusions .
Although the document is considered the most impartial and authoritative investigation into the conflict to date , it is unlikely to have told Western leaders and experts anything they did not already know , most of them having long since concluded that Georgia - or moreover Mr Saakashvili - fell into a Russian trap when the attack on South Ossetia was launched .
Most Georgian people have also made up their minds .
Large - scale street protests calling for Mr Saakashvili's resignation in April 2009 were in part an expression of demonstrators ' belief that their president recklessly dragged the country into a war Georgia could not win .
But the country 's leader refused all calls to step down , pointing out that only a minority of his countrymen had taken to the streets to denounce him , and the protests eventually fizzled out .
Heidi Tagliavini 's independent war inquiry team has completed its mission .
Now it is up to Europe - and to history - to decide what to do with it .

JACKIE KLEIN is a devoted mother of two little boys in the suburbs of Portland , Ore .
She spends hours ferrying them to soccer and Cub Scouts .
She reads child - development books .
She can emulate one of those pitch - perfect calm maternal tones to warn , “ You ’re making bad choices ” when , say , someone does n’t want to brush his teeth .
That is 90 percent of the time .
Then there is the other 10 percent , when , she admits , “ I have become totally frustrated and lost control of myself . ”
It can happen during weeks and weeks and weeks of no camp in the summer , or at the end of a long day at home  just as adult peace is within her grasp  when the 7 - or 9 - year - old wo n’t go to sleep .
And then she yells .
“ This is ridiculous !
I ’ve been doing things all day for you ! ”
Many in today ’s pregnancy - flaunting , soccer - cheering , organic - snack - proffering generation of parents would never spank their children .
We congratulate our toddlers for blowing their nose ( “ Good job ! ” ) , we friend our teenagers ( literally and virtually ) , we spend hours teaching our elementary - school offspring how to understand their feelings .
But , incongruously and with regularity , this is a generation that yells .
Raj Rajaratnam , the authorities say , masterminded one of the biggest insider - trading schemes in a generation .
But if Mr. Rajaratnam was trading on insider information , apparently he was not very good at it .
A close examination of the trades that led to his arrest last week reveals a startling fact :
In all , Mr. Rajaratnam lost millions from what prosecutors characterize as illegal trading .
One bad trade , in the shares of the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices , cost his hedge fund , the Galleon Group , $ 30 million .
That loss more than wiped out the profits that prosecutors claim Mr. Rajaratnam and his accomplices reaped with their scheme .
Prosecutors highlighted the winning trades in a case that they say stretched from the secretive world of hedge funds to some of the country ’s biggest technology companies .
They did not mention the losers .
Beyond all the negative headlines , what do we really know about Britain 's teen boys ?
Simon Hattenstone takes a trip deep into boy world and finds that it 's very different from what you might expect …
" So what is Export ? "
The teenage lads look at me as if I must be joking .
Jake bursts out laughing , then Elias , then the others .
" Xbox , " Jake says .
" Not Export .
Xbox – it's a computer game . "
We are outside Nasif 's house , waiting for him to get back from school .
Elias says that 15 is a funny age – you 're too old to stay at home , too young to go clubbing .
" That 's why we go to our friends ' houses , " Ali says , perching precariously on his bike .
" It 's warm , comfortable , relaxed . "
A second later , they 're on to talking about girlfriends .
Most can't be bothered with them – they went through all that nonsense years ago .
" Girls just never stop wanting , " Ali says .
" They 're greedy . "
For what ?
" Anything . "
Going out with girls is something you might do when you 're younger , more naive , they say , the voices of world - weary experience .
Nas arrives and we go inside .
Ten boys in a small living room , making a racket , eating biscuits , drinking juice , controllers in hand , battering each other to bits in a video wrestling game .
What is a typical teenage boy like ?
In a way , it 's a daft question – there is no typical .
But speak to enough lads , immerse yourself in their world , and patterns start to emerge .
It 's 30 years since I was their age .
In my era , the 1970s , many teens went to football to start scraps rather than watch the match , and yet somehow they were not demonised as they are today .
There were " hoolies " , but we knew they were the minority .
Back then the only time we heard the word feral was on wildlife programmes ; the idea of " hoodies " had n't been invented .
I 've read all the stereotypes about today 's teenage boys , but my experience of them is virtually nonexistent – I have two teenage daughters , who do n't play Xbox , let alone roam the streets in a manner likely to unnerve Middle Britain .
So I decide to immerse myself in Planet Teen Boy .
Nasif Mugisha .
Photograph : Frederike Helwig
Nasif Mugisha lives down the road from me .
I see him most days in passing .
He 's full of life , seems kind , likes to run , and looks a little scary in his super - spruced cadet 's uniform .
But what do I really know about Nasif 's life ?
Nothing .
So I knock on his door .
He 's babysitting for his eight - year - old brother , Nooh , and three - year - old - sister , Aliyah .
" Nas , " I stutter , " I want to become part of your life . "
I blush – he 's going to call the police on me at this rate – and start again .
" Nas , we 're doing a piece on teenage boys , and we want to know what it 's like to be a teenager .
I was wondering if I could stalk you for a few days . "
He grins nervously .
Only joking , I say .
He looks relieved .
But I do want to follow him , do what he does , eavesdrop on his conversations .
A few days later we 're playing Xbox .
Nas and his friends go to the local comprehensive in north London , five minutes ' walk from where we live .
Four of the boys are virtual wrestling , while the others make a rowdy audience .
" Batter this guy , batter him , " shouts Ali .
" Just let me get up !
Ah oh !
Ah oh !
Oh my God ! " yelps Liam , the Living Legend who 's just been floored .
Their favourite game is Call Of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare in which they kill loads of people .
It baffles me .
" But none of you seems particularly violent , " I say .
" We 're not , " Elias says .
" It 's a fantasy game .
You can't do that in real life , that 's the appeal . "
Would any of them join the military ?
" No , no , no , " they scream in unison .
" Only if you had as many lives as in Call Of Duty , " adds Liam .
Actually , Nas does want to join the forces .
He 's wanted to be a pilot since he was four and first flew in a plane .
At 15 , he 's already thinking ahead to A - levels , then , if things work out , a degree and career .
All the boys talk of the pressure of exams – at 14 there is coursework , at 15 GCSEs , then , for many , it 's straight into AS - levels .
It 's unrelenting : much more so than when I was their age .
In the early evening , after Nas 's mum , Sophia , has made some delicious noodles , we wander to the park .
Me and 10 boys .
Adults move out of the way , often giving us hostile looks .
It feels weirdly empowering , but also annoying .
What 's wrong with them ?
Why stare at us when we 're not bothering them ?
7.30 am Sunday , sunny but cold , and Nas is stacking his newspaper trolley .
Copies of the local paper with five leaflets to go with each one .
" It can be pretty depressing when it 's pouring down , delivering all those papers through the wind and rain .
But at times it 's really good .
Especially Tuesday . "
Why Tuesday ?
" Payday . "
Nas has been credit - crunched .
Two years ago when he started he was paid £ 20 for delivering the papers , and with the leaflets it could rise to £ 30 .
Now it 's just £ 10 for the papers , or £ 15 on a good day .
I pull the trolley with both hands behind my back .
It 's heavy , cumbersome work .
" They do n't call us newspaper boys any more , we 're walkers .
I call myself a newspaper distribution expert . "
He rubs his hands together , and blows on them .
Nas 's mother was born in Uganda , his father Rwanda .
They divorced when he was three , and even here he considers himself fortunate – both parents remarried and now he 's got two great sets of families .
" These days my mum treats me like a sixth - former .
She confides in me .
Beforehand , certain things happened and mum would say , ' Ah , you 're too young to know . '
Now , she tells me . "
Nas talks more formally than most of his friends – full sentences , little slang , no swearing .
There are expectations of how a teenage boy will talk and act – especially a black teenage boy , he says .
But he 's not having any of that .
" The bottom line is , it 's not me .
African parents want you to do well and they always push you to speak properly .
Mum and Dad go mad if I say ' Innit ' . "
Nas is more confident than he was at primary school .
Back then he was quiet , a little withdrawn .
" It all changed when I joined the cadets . "
He learned practical skills such as map - reading and ironing , found his voice , even got himself a girlfriend .
At school , he says , the older you get , the more fixed groups become .
Because he is so busy with extracurricular activities , he 's left out at times .
But he 's turned this into a strength – he can float from group to group .
" At school there is the cool group , and then lots of others . "
What is the cool group like ?
" They are really the kids who get up to no good . "
Do many drink and take drugs ?
" More than you 'd think .
I 'd say a third smoke or drink – cigarettes and a bit of dope as well . "
Does he drink ?
" I do n't drink or smoke at all .
Apart from when I was four and I thought wine was apple juice and drank it and spat it straight out . "
Why does n't he drink ?
" First of all , I 'm Muslim .
But also I do n't see the appeal .
At our age people drink just to get drunk .
I think it 's easier to speak to a girl if you 're drunk .
Also , it 's much easier to get off with a girl if she 's drunk .
For me , though , I think if you 're an interesting enough person you can be interesting at a party without alcohol . "
He 's been going out with Hannah for seven months now .
Is it a serious relationship ?
Nas says he 's never sure what serious means .
" Hannah goes to cadets .
I like her , she likes me , and we 're really good friends .
There are times you 'll go out with a girl cos she 's really fit , simple as that .
Then you slowly realise you have nothing in common and she 's boring or really loud and in your face . "
He usually sees Hannah once a week .
" We might go to the cinema , or I 'll make her lunch and we 'll just chill in the park .
It 's really nice . "
I 'm gradually becoming more expert at newspaper distribution as Nas chats away about the difference between girls and boys .
On the whole , he reckons , boys have it easier – less emotional upset , no periods , not the same pressure to dress well .
" There 's so much more going on with girls .
Boys , we 're simple creatures .
As long as we 've got some food , some entertainment , we 're pretty much fine . "
Character - wise , he says there 's also a big difference .
" There 's always bitching going on in girls ' friendship groups .
And often there 's a debate about who 's best friends , whereas with guys it 's pretty easy – we 're mates , and if you do n't like somebody you just give them a punch in the face . "
That 's only happened once , though .
" I was around my dad's , and this boy brought my mum into it .
I warned him .
Twice .
I was 14 , and I said , ' This ain't funny any more , I will hit you . ' " Did he enjoy punching him ?
He looks embarrassed .
" It felt so good , yeah .
He got a really big bruise .
The funny thing is , the same day he apologised . "
Joe France is off school with a cold , and he 's not happy about it .
He loves school .
Joe , 14 , is a clever boy from a working - class background in Walsall , in the Midlands , who already has his future mapped out .
Last year , he came top of the class in his grammar school , and he 's happy to be seen as a swot .
" If I get called a geek I 'll say , ' Yes , I am , what 's the problem ?
Just because I get more A*s than you does n't mean there 's anything wrong with me . ' "
Joe is on the small side for his age ; many adults do n't realise he 's a teenager .
Does he feel intimidated by groups of teenage boys ?
" Normally I 'd just walk past them and not pay them any attention .
I 'd drift to one side probably , but if they were all walking together , blocking the main path , I 'd just carry on , and not stare at them . "
The way they walk might look aggressive , he says , but it 's rarely meant to be .
" Most of the time they stand together so they can all talk without having to turn round .
They do n't like to have to drift behind each other . "
There are changes he 's noticed in himself .
His emotions fluctuate more than they used to , he thinks more about girls , he gets annoyed more easily , and he 's more self - conscious .
About what ?
" The most obvious thing is spots .
I did n't pay much attention to them till the summer holidays .
Then I realised I had spots on my forehead and one on my nose .
When I run my hand over my forehead I can feel them there .
They feel bumpy and strange . "
And then there 's his height .
" I 'm definitely self - conscious about people growing past me .
I had one friend who was the same height as me at the end of year nine and he 's suddenly grown and now he 's four inches taller than me . "
Does he feel jealous ?
" Not jealous , it just feels a bit late .
They say you have a growth spurt at 13 and your voice will break at 14 , and then when it does n't happen you think , ' Hang on , is it ever going to – or am I just going to stay short ? ' "
But there are things he loves about being a teenager : not least the freedoms .
He 's got his own laptop , so he no longer has to share with his mum and dad .
He likes the fact that his friends talk about more serious things these days , such as politics , and he loves shopping for clothes , which he used to hate .
" I was in London a couple of weeks ago with my little cousin and we both needed a new pair of jeans .
He just got really tired , moaning , walking everywhere slowly , but I do n't get bored so quickly now .
I 'm much more interested in buying stuff than I was . "

Recently he stood in a class election .
" I wanted to be form captain , and then one of the kids from the popular group stood .
He got 20 out of the 24 votes .
My friend got three votes , I got one . "
Has it put him off standing again ?
" No , I 'm going to keep trying till I beat him one day . "
Joe 's favourite hobby is reading ; his class recently read Lord Of The Flies .
If he was trapped on a desert island , does he think he'd become a savage like Jack or a civilising influence like Ralph ?
Typical Joe , he comes up with a third way .
" I think I 'd be more of the civilised influence .
When we were reading Lord Of The Flies we had to do a role play and I was automatically chosen as Ralph in our group .
But I think I 'm a half Ralph and half Piggy figure .
I 've got the intellect of Piggy but I 'm not quite confident at pushing ideas forward .
Piggy knows more than he seems to . "
Akeim Mundell and his friends Isaac , Connor , Callum and Jamico have just had their photos taken and found themselves a car park to play football .
They are in London for the day from Manchester – all have been brought up in the tough district of Moss Side .
Some were on the verge of getting into trouble when they joined an organisation called Reclaim that has helped turn their life around .
Akeim is the smiliest boy I 've met .
" I 've calmed down a lot now , " he says .
" I used to get in trouble for silly stuff like chatting back to the teachers . "
Callum , a broad lad with red hair , puts in a lovely cross which Isaac heads past Akeim .
" See , I told you I was sick at crosses , " Callum says .
The boys talk about some of the football fans they saw on the way down to London .
" They was drinkin ' beer at 10 in the morning .
It was ' angin ' , " Connor says .
' Angin ' ?
" Yeah , horrible .
Why would anybody do that ? "
Does Akeim ever drink ?
" Nah . Except every Christmas I have a Babycham .
We drink Coke and Grape Soda . "
Akeim goes to Manchester Academy in Moss Side , and wants to be a doctor .
If that does n't work out , he 'll settle for nursing .
He 's not going to go to the local sixth - form college because he thinks he 'll concentrate better if he 's not surrounded by his old friends .
It 's late September and the Sun has just splashed with the headline , " FERAL UK UNMASKED : Police allowed this teen and his gang to torment a mum and her disabled daughter to death . "
The headline is accompanied by a photograph of a teenager in a hoodie , riding a battered bike .
It 's a desperate story , but is it at all representative , as we 're led to believe ?
The same day Gordon Brown plays to the gallery at Labour 's party conference , promising more asbos and tougher action on " teenage tearaways turning town centres into no - go areas " .
Nothing has been used to demonise teen boys more than the hoodie itself – a simple item of clothing that children and adults have worn for decades .
Conor McPherson , a 15 - year - old from Aberdour in Scotland , says that " it 's the biggest stereotype in the country and has alienated almost the entire teenage population .
Last night I went out in a hoodie and a woman crossed the street .
When I passed her , she crossed back over .
I felt confused , a wee bit upset .
It means that the stereotype , which has been spread by the government , has crept into the whole population 's mind . "
A report commissioned by the organisation Women
In Journalism last year showed that the word most commonly used to describe teen boys in the media is yobs .
Other common words were thugs , feral , louts , hoodies , evil , frightening , monsters , scum and heartless .
More than 60 % of the stories about teen boys concerned crime – 90 % of which showed them in a bad light .
Eighty - five per cent of a sample of 1,000 boys thought the press portrayed them negatively .
To accompany this article , Guardian Weekend commissioned a survey of 1,000 boys by Echo Research , which also carried out the Women In Journalism report .
Some of the findings are predictable – 57 % of boys spend at least one hour a day social networking online .
More alarmingly , 10 % spend at least five hours a day social networking online , 55 % have been exposed to inappropriate online content , and 21 % have had experience of cyber bullying .
But perhaps the most astonishing finding is just how positive teen boys are : 95 % believe their career prospects are good , 96 % are ambitious about their future careers , 94 % are happy in their home and family lives , 93 % are happy in their social lives and 91 % are happy in their school or work lives .
But perhaps it 's not so surprising , after all .
The research chimes with my experience .
Of the boys I have met , some have issues , yes , and there are definitely pressures , but none is unhappy with his lot .
Back in Manchester , Akeim is tired of reading that all teenagers are trouble .
The image presented in the tabloids bears little relation to his friends .
Yes , he has known a couple of lads who carry knives , but he always kept his distance .
He says there have been times when he's got into trouble running his mouth off , but he 's also used his mouth to talk his way out of trouble .
" I 've never been in a fight all my life . "
What does he spend his time doing when he 's not at school ?
" I 'm not going to lie .
All I do is go home and stay at my computer .
Facebook , MSN and that 's it . "
Does that mean he 's antisocial away from the computer ?
No way , he says .
" Over the weekend I 'm never in . "
Like Joe , he 's recently discovered the joy of shopping .
" I go to the Trafford Centre .
You look in my room now , I 've got four wardrobes full of clothes .
I love buying stuff . "

His weekends are hectic .
On Saturday he gets the bus into town where he meets his friends .
How many ?
" There are 25 of us .
We go to the cinemas and then to Nando's every Saturday . "
Life is fun , he says , but of course there are things for him and his friends to worry about .
If he is to become a doctor , and Callum is going to be a police officer and Connor a soldier , as they hope to , they 're going to have to focus .
Has his life been touched by violence ?
" No . " He stops .
" Well , only when Jessie got shot . "
In September 2006 , 15 - year - old Jessie James was killed while riding his bike through a park with friends .
He was the 24th person shot dead in Moss Side since 1999 .
" We 'd known Jessie since he was a baby and through primary school and secondary school .
That was sad …
We lived on the same estate . "
Did it make him scared ?
" No , it just made me more set that I 'm not going in no gang . "
What makes him happiest ?
That 's hard to answer , he says .
" I 'm always happy . "
Does he like the way he looks ?
" Yeah .
I used to be short , but now I 'm taller .
Is there anything I 'd change ?
No .
Not really .
I think I 'm all right . "
He bursts out laughing .
Richard Deane , 16 , goes to grammar school in Tonbridge , Kent and is just starting his A - levels .
He plays guitar in a band , and when he suggested to his mother that he could skip university if the band takes off , she gave him a look he 's not forgotten .
He thinks there are different expectations for boys than girls – boys , for example , always want to be the best .
If you 're good at sport , you 're made , he says .
If you 're not , you can struggle .
" There is a sporty group at school , and you have to be really good to be part of it .
I 've never been good at sport , and do n't even talk football .
One of my friends joined the sporty group and we 've become less close . "
He 's more interested in music .
Yes , there are stresses , he says – he 's sick of hearing about boys who left school with amazing A - level results and still could n't get into university .
And yes , his parents are a little overprotective , and do n't seem to trust him quite as much as they could .
But he 's become more understanding of that , and they 're not nearly as bad as many people he comes across .
Richard is offended by adult attitudes towards teenage boys .
" The other day I was standing outside the house and a woman came out and said , ' Would you mind not swearing cos I 'll be reading a bedtime story to my children ? '
She just assumed that we'd be swearing because we were teenage and we were boys .
There are people who are n't so nice .
But most teenagers are good people . "
It 's Monday evening and Nas and I are on the way to Air Cadets – two buses and a short walk .
He 's pleased because his group finished third out of 15 in last week 's drill competition .
They put in so much time and effort ( Nas spent eight hours polishing his boots ) that tonight , as a reward , they do n't have to wear their uniform .
Nas will give a map - reading lesson to the junior cadets , some of whom are older than him , and he warns me that it 's all extremely disciplined .
The juniors must address him as Corporal and he has to address his next in line as Sergeant .
There 's a lot of shouting and bossing , but they are having a good time .
The group is racially mixed , and the kids appear to be colour blind , yet as they line up to salute the picture of the Queen , we could be back in the 1950s .
Many arrive in their hoodies and , if photographed on the streets , could doubtless be portrayed as yobs .
Like all the teenage boys I 've met they exude an inspiring mix of innocence , joie de vivre and experience .
Perhaps I 've just struck lucky , but I do n't think so .
Nas , Joe , Richard and Akeim all seem so much more mature and prepared for adult life than my generation was .
In a strange way , maybe Britain 's demonisation of teen boys has made them grow up more quickly .

The Crash of the X - 15A - 3 15 November 1967 The Rocketplane Jointly flown and maintained by the U.S. Air Force and NASA , the North American X - 15 was a hypersonic rocket - powered aircraft that was part of the X - plane series of experimental aircraft which set numerous speed and altitude records in the 1960s .
Reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design , the X - 15 's official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a manned , powered aircraft , set in October 1967 when William J. Knight flew Mach 6.72 ( 4,520 mph ) at 102,100 feet During the X - 15 program , 13 flights by eight pilots met the USAF spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of 50 miles , thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts .
The last qualifying flight was flown on November 15 , 1967 , by Major Michael J. Adams - but he would not live to pin on his wings .
The Pilot Michael Adams was born in Sacramento , California , in 1930 , and graduated from Sacramento Junior College .
Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1950 - he earned his pilot wings and a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1952 at Webb Air Force Base , Texas .
After training in F - 80 and F - 86 Sabres at Nellis AFB 's gunnery school , he proceeded to fly fighter - bomber aircraft in 49 combat missions during the Korean War before being transferred to the 613th Fighter - Bomber Squadron at England AFB , Louisiana , and six months rotational duty at Chaumont Air Base in France .
In 1958 , Adams received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma .
A year later , when the first group of American astronauts was announced , Adams set his sights on joining the astronaut corps .
After studying astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , he was selected for the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB , Calif. , in 1962 .
While at TPS , he won the A.B. Honts Trophy as the best scholar and pilot in his class , Class 62C , and continued on to joined the fourth class at the Aerospace Research Pilot School .
While attending the school , on August 28 , 1963 , was flying in the back seat of a F - 104B , tail number 56 - 3721 , piloted by fellow student ( and future astronaut ) Capt .
David R. Scott .
As Scott was making an approach simulating a X - 15 flame - out for training and evaluation purposes into Edwards ' runway 4 , the jet suddenly lost engine thrust and began to descend rapidly .
Trial by Fire ...
Both pilots realized that the jet would hit hard , and each made opposite decisions that saved their lives .
Scott elected to stay with the airplane while Adams chose to eject .
Adams pulled the ejection handle just as the F - 104 slammed into the runway , breaking off its landing gear and sliding a couple thousand feet down the runway .
Had he ejected before impact , his parachute would not have had time to deploy due to the rapid rate of descent .
If he had delayed ejecting for even a fraction of a second , he would have been crushed when the airplane 's jet engine slammed forward into the rear cockpit .
Adams ' parachute opened just seconds before he hit the ground .
He waved to Scott , who was climbing safely from the burning wreck .
As the cockpit floor disintegrated , Scott 's ejection seat had partially sequenced during the initial impact , locking his feet into the stirrups , but did not fire because the torque tube was unable to rotate due to crash damage .
If Scott had ejected , he would have been killed .
Recovered from minor injuries but losing a shot at being in the second group of astronauts , Adams graduated with honors from ARPS in December 1963 , and worked on several flight test programs , like conducting stability and control tests in the Northrop F - 5A jet fighter and the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory variable stability T - 33 program .
In 1964 , Adams became one of four aerospace research pilots from Edwards to participate in a five - month series of NASA moon landing practice tests with the Martin Company in Baltimore , Md . The tests simulated lunar landing missions in a full - scale command module and lunar excursion module crew compartment mock - up .
Four seven - day simulated lunar landing missions were conducted , each with a three - man crew .
Experienced in what it took to handle long duration space flight , in November of 1965 , he was selected to be one of the first 8 astronauts in the U.S. Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory program .
An early space station design , the MOL , also known by its classified designation and codename of KH - 10 Dorian , was designed to serve as a space - based reconnaissance platform .
To be a series of five , or more , two - man flights - lasting up to 30 days - in polar orbit to begin in 1968 , the astronauts were to use surplus Gemini spacecraft attached to a new , cylindrical laboratory , with the whole platform launched by a Titan - III rocket from Vandenberg AFB , Calif .
The development on the MOL project moved slow , as there were delays in production and testing hardware .
Adams realized that , with the advent of the Corona ( KH - 4 ) unmanned reconnaissance satellite program , there was little chance of a MOL flight in his future , and he requested transfer to the well - underway X - 15 program , which was granted on July 14th , 1966 .
The X - 15 Program Nearly three months later , on September 28 , 1966 - Adams readied for his first flight aboard the X - 15 , but it was aborted due to weather .
A week later , the flight was scrubbed , as a malfunction of the canopy seal regulator prevented the cockpit from pressurizing .
But on October 6th , 1966 , Adams made his first X - 15 flight , designated 1-69 - 116 .
Aboard X - 15 # 1 , he rocketed from the mothership , NB - 52A # 52-0003 , to Mach 3 and an altitude of over 75,000 feet .
However , the forward fuel tank bulkhead ruptured in flight , causing the engine to shut down early , and forcing Adams to make an emergency landing at Cuddeback Lake .
The next five flights , spread out over the following year , all had issues - from radio malfunctions and engine control problems , to airborne experiments not deploying and and circuit breakers popping .
During his third flight , on March 2 , 1967 , the X - 15 lost cabin pressure while climbing through 77,000 feet .
This caused his pressure suit to inflate and made it more difficult for Adams to fly the airplane .
However , as Adams reached the top of the climb , a peak altitude of 133,000 feet and a maximum speed of Mach 5.59 ( 3,822 mph ) , his inertial computer failed , blanking all of his flight data readouts .
Flying blind , Adams successfully returned to Edwards AFB
On approach he radioed the ground controller , fellow X - 15 pilot Major William J. " Pete " Knight , saying " I thought you said every once in a while something goes wrong , Pete ? "
In a post - flight debriefing , Adams revealed that he had suffered vertigo during the climb - out .
It would not be the last time this happened .
But by November of 1967 , just about everything that could go wrong for Adams had during the program .
But he continued on to fly his seventh flight .
X - 15 Flight #3-65-97
On the morning of November 15 , 1967 at 10:30 a.m. , the X - 15 - 3 dropped away , Major Adams at the controls , from its B - 52 mothership at 45,000 feet near Nevada 's Delamar Dry Lake .
Starting his climb under full power , he quickly passed through 85,000 feet when an electrical disturbance distracted him and slightly degraded the control of the aircraft .
In the Dryden Flight Research Center flight control room , Pete Knight was working as mission controller , monitoring the mission with a team of engineers , and noticed something was wrong .
As the X - 15 climbed , Adams started a planned wing - rocking maneuver so an on - board camera could scan the horizon .
The wing rocking quickly became excessive , by a factor of two or three .
When Adams concluded the wing - rocking portion of the climb , the X - 15 began a slow , gradual drift in heading .
Forty seconds later , when the craft reached its maximum altitude of 266,000 feet , it was off heading by 15° .
As the plane came over the top , the drift briefly halted , with the plane yawed 15° to the right .
Then the drift began again ; within 30 seconds , the plane was descending at right angles to the flight path .
At 230,000 feet , encountering rapidly increasing dynamic pressures , the X - 15 entered a spin at hypersonic speed !
In the flight control room there was no way to monitor heading , so nobody suspected the true situation that Adams now faced .
The controllers did not know that the plane was yawing , eventually turning completely around .
In fact , control advised the pilot that he was ” a little bit high , ” but in ” real good shape . ”
Just 15 seconds later , Adams radioed that the plane ” seems squirrelly . ”
At 10:34 came a shattering call : ” I 'm in a spin , Pete . ”
A mission monitor called out that Adams had , indeed , lost control of the plane .
Another pilot present said quietly , ” That boy 's in trouble . ”
Plagued by lack of heading information , the control room staff saw only large and very slow pitching and rolling motions .
One reaction was ” disbelief ; the feeling that possibly he was overstating the case . ”
But Adams again called out , ” I 'm in a spin . ”
As best they could , the ground controllers sought to get the X - 15 straightened out .
They knew they had only seconds left .
There was no recommended spin recovery technique for the plane , and engineers knew nothing about the X - 15 's supersonic spin tendencies .
The chase pilots , realizing that the X - 15 would never make Rogers Lake , went into afterburner and raced for the emergency lakes , for Ballarat and Cuddeback .
Fighting For His Life ...
Adams held the X - 15's controls against the spin , using both the aerodynamic control surfaces and the reaction controls .
Through some combination of pilot technique and basic aerodynamic stability , the plane recovered from the spin at 118,000 feet and went into a Mach 4.7 dive , inverted , at a dive angle between 40 and 45 degrees .
Adams was in a relatively high altitude dive and had a good chance of rolling upright , pulling out , and setting up a landing .
But one more technical problem arose - the Honeywell adaptive flight control system began a limit - cycle oscillation just as the plane came out of the spin , preventing the system 's gain changer from reducing pitch as dynamic pressure increased .
Adam 's corrective action created a pilot - induced oscillation - a rapid pitching motion of increasing severity .
All the while , the plane shot downward at 160,000 feet per minute , dynamic pressure increasing intolerably .
High over the desert , it passed abeam of Cuddeback Lake , over the Searles Valley , over the Pinnacles , narrowing on toward Johannesburg .
As the X - 15 neared 65,000 feet , it was speeding downward at Mach 3.93 and experiencing over 15 g vertically , both positive and negative , and 8 g laterally .
The airframe 's structural limits were grossly exceeded , and the plane broke up into many pieces amid loud sonic rumblings , impacting in the desert northeast of Johannesburg some ten minutes after launch .
Two hunters heard the noise and saw the forward fuselage , the largest section , tumbling over a hill .
On the ground , NASA control lost all telemetry at the moment of breakup , but still called to Adams .
A chase pilot spotted dust on Cuddeback , but it was not the X - 15 .
Then an Air Force pilot , who had been up on a delayed chase mission and had tagged along on the X - 15 flight to see if he could fill in for an errant chase plane , spotted the main wreckage northwest of Cuddeback .
Mike Adams was dead and the X - 15 destroyed .

Aftermath
In the wake of the accident , NASA and the Air Force convened an accident board , chaired by Donald R. Bellman .
Ground parties scoured the countryside looking for wreckage ; critical to the investigation was the film from the cockpit camera .
The weekend after the accident , an unofficial NASA search party found the camera ; disappointingly , the film cartridge was nowhere in sight .
Engineers theorized that the film cassette , being lighter than the camera , might be further away , blown north by winds at altitude .
Engineer Victor Horton organized a search and , two weeks after the crash , during the first pass over the area , Willard E. Dives found the cassette which was flown to Boston for specialized processing .
The film revealed the puzzling fact of Adams ' complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation .
The accident board concluded in its report , issued two months after the mishap , that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate as the result of a combination of Adams ' becoming distracted by the electrical disturbance , his misinterpretation of the instrumentation display , and possible vertigo .
An electric motor that was part of an experiment carried on the wingtip created a disturbance that interfered with the flight control system as the airplane shot out of the atmosphere .
Adams , whose known susceptibility to vertigo had been ignored when he was assigned to the X - 15 program , apparently became disoriented .
From there , Adams ' confusion was compounded as a needle on his primary attitude indicator could be selected to display either roll or yaw .
Adams got mixed up and tried to correct with yaw for what was actually a roll cue .
While the controllers on the ground could not tell what was happening , the airplane was rotating about its vertical axis until , when it reentered the atmosphere , it was flying sideways .
A violent and dizzying ride followed .
Adams reported that he was in a spin — a situation that had never before been encountered in hypersonic flight , and for which no recovery procedure was known .
At first , however , the problem corrected itself , its rotation slowing as it straighten back into alignment with its flight path .
For a brief period it was inverted but stable , with sufficient altitude for a recovery .
But then the adaptive flight control system began pitching the aircraft up and down with increasing violence until , somewhere beyond 8 Gs , the airplane broke apart .
A switch on the panel could have shut the runaway system off , but no one thought of it until too late .
The board made two major recommendations : install a telemetric heading indicator in the control room , visible to the flight controller ; and medically - screen X - 15 pilot candidates for sensitivity to vertigo .
As a result of the X - 15 's crash , NASA added a ground - based " 8 ball " attitude indicator in the control room at Dryden to furnish mission controllers with real time pitch , roll , yaw , heading , angle of attack , and sideslip information .
Posthumous Honors ...
Afterwards , Michael Adams was laid to rest at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Monroe , Ouachita Parish , Louisiana .
The U.S. Air Force posthumously awarded Adams Astronaut Wings for his last flight , as its surpassed an altitude of 50 miles above the Earth 's surface .
In 1991 , Adams ' name was added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The Crash Site Today
Very little remains at this site .
Small , scattered pieces are sprinkled there , and finding anything of the aircraft at the site is nearly impossible .
However , portions of the X - 15A - 3 such as an engine access panel , a reaction control rocket for maneuvering in the upper atmosphere , a piece of the horizontal stabilizer , and a section of vertical stabilizer that had the numerals ' 72 ' on it , were found as late as 1992 .
In fact , aside from a small American flag posted in the center of the site , the average person would been totally unaware of the historic nature of their surroundings .
Unlike most other crash sites , there is virtually nothing to be found of the aircraft laying on the surface .
On June 8 , 2004 , a memorial monument to Adams was erected near the crash site as part of an Eagle Scout project .

Updated Login credentials for more than 10,000 Microsoft Live accounts have been posted to the internet , most likely by miscreants who found them or harvested them in a phishing attack .
In all , there were 10,028 pairs of user names and passwords posted to multiple pages of public upload website Pastebin.com , some of which remained live at time of writing .
The stash is likely only a small sample of a much larger haul , since the alphabetical list begins with the user name ararat973@hoymail.com and concludes with blando2713@hotmail.com .
The discovery coincided with unsubstantiated posts that claimed passwords for all Windows Live accounts had been leaked .
That seemed highly unlikely .
If one assumed there were 5,500 accounts beginning with each letter of the alphabet - a crude estimate based on the sample - that would come to just 143,000 compromised accounts total .
That 's a tiny fraction of the 450 million or so total Windows Live accounts out there .
The leak is most likely the result of miscreants who harvested the passwords using keystroke - logging trojans or phishing scams .
A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that the company does n't store passwords in the clear and said its security team has been investigating the leak since this weekend .
" Upon learning of the issue , we immediately requested that the credentials be removed and launched an investigation to determine the impact to customers , " she wrote in an email .
" As part of that investigation , we determined that this was not a breach of internal Microsoft data and initiated our standard process of working to help customers regain control of their accounts . "
A quick web search reveals a wide variety of active campaigns to steal hotmail login credentials .
One of them , documented here on the NirSoft. net blog , is dubbed the msn-blocked .com scam and is named after one of the early domain names used to hoodwink users into revealing their hotmail password .
Over the past few months , the people behind it have repeatedly changed the domain names used in the scam and have also added support for multiple languages .
The sites promise to send invitations to all a victims ' contacts .
No doubt , other password - stealing scams abound .
The question is how the details , which normally are kept under wraps by the people who worked so hard to filch them , managed to go public .
One theory is they were inadvertently published when they were stored on a server that was visible to search engine spiders and then republished on Pastebin .
Or the miscreants may have decided to share them with world + dog out of twisted sense of altruism .
While one of the pages containing the credentials was published on October 1 , Google caches show the same details published almost a week earlier .
The list has been the topic of conversation on several online forums , with some participants making the unconfirmed claim that all accounts were breached .
The appropriation of a web - based email account can often lead to much bigger compromises because many people tie online accounts for banks and e-commerce sites to their addresses .
Those who have any doubt about the security of their Windows Live addresses ought to change their passwords immediately out of an abundance of caution . ®
A classic work in political philosophy , intellectual and cultural history , and economics , The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians , scholars , and general readers for half a century .
Originally published in England in the spring of 1944 — when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin , and Albert Einstein subscribed lock , stock , and barrel to the socialist program —
The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production .
For F. A. Hayek , the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy .
First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18 , 1944 , The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate attention from the public , politicians , and scholars alike .
The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly , and within six months more than 30,000 were sold .
In April of 1945 , Reader 's Digest published a condensed version of the book , and soon thereafter the Book - of - the - Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers .
A perennial best - seller , the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States , not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German , French , Dutch , Swedish , and Japanese , and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain .
After thirty - two printings in the United States , The Road to Serfdom has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville , John Stuart Mill , and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority .
This fiftieth anniversary edition , with a new introduction by Milton Friedman , commemorates the enduring influence of The Road to Serfdom on the ever - changing political and social climates of the twentieth century , from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher " revolutions " in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s .
F. A. Hayek ( 1899 - 1992 ) , recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974 , was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century .
On the first American edition of The Road to Serfdom :
" One of the most important books of our generation .
. . .
It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay On Liberty .
. . .
It is an arresting call to all well - intentioned planners and socialists , to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop , look and listen . "
—
Henry Hazlitt , New York Times Book Review , September 1944
" In the negative part of Professor Hayek 's thesis there is a great deal of truth .
It can not be said too often — at any rate , it is not being said nearly often enough — that collectivism is not inherently democratic , but , on the contrary , gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of . "
— George Orwell , Collected Essays
The campsite in central Brittany meandered in and around the ruins of a 13th - century castle .
While I cooked in its original medieval kitchen , a small older woman fresh from rabbit - hunting entered .
She offered me a glass of " cidre " from an unlabelled green bottle , and despite my basic French , I was able to glean that what was passing my lips began life in her small orchard .
Strong , dry , and full of ripe fruit , this surely was bough - born champagne .
With the sugar peeled away , the subtle complexities of apple were revealed : seeds , skin , leaves , bark , and earth were right there in every sip .
When I told her that cider this good cannot be purchased in Canada , she let me know that it could n't be bought in France either .
I realize that I will never own an apple orchard or a cider press , but after this experience , I refuse to drink high - production cider made from apple - juice concentrate .
I got to thinking , How difficult could it be to turn a jug of good - quality apple juice into hard cider ?
Facing the problem of making something into alcohol , I usually go to Dan Small of Dan 's Homebrewing Supplies ( 310 Commercial Drive ) .
On the way there , I picked up a four - litre jug of unfiltered , organic apple juice for $ 6 .
Pointing to the jug I heaved onto the counter , I asked Small , busy grinding barley , for the simplest way to turn its contents into booze .
He stopped long enough to suggest pouring in a packet of champagne yeast ( 99 ¢ ) , then popping in a rubber bung with a fermentation lock ( $ 2.50 ) .
In a few weeks it would be about 7.5 - percent alcohol , he declared , after taking a hydrometer reading of my apple juice .
Then all I would have to do is rack and bottle , tossing in a little corn sugar for carbonation , and in a couple of weeks , I would be ready to party .
Small , having achieved an enviable poetic simplicity , is something of the local brewing laureate , but this just seemed too easy , and I had to question him on it .
Despite wanting to get back to his barley mill , he related to me how simple cider is to make .
On the farm where he grew up near London , Ontario , each fall his father crushed all of the windfall apples .
He threw this mash into an oak barrel where the pulp would settle .
" Us kids were n't allowed any of that juice after Halloween , " Small recalled with a grin .
" By Christmas it would have been fully fermented out . "
At this point , dad would have to remove a circular pane of ice from the barrel to dip his cup , naturally fortifying the cider as he did so .
Small laughs as he tries to figure out how strong the cider would have been by January .
" Of course , Mom did n't know . "
Small admitted that epicureans might suggest refinements on his suggested brewing method .
He mentioned Shirley Warne , who was n't home when he phoned but who walked in five minutes later , like a muse invoked .
While Small continued milling barley , I spoke with Warne , a slight but intense woman with spiky silver hair .
Despite branding herself a " neophyte " , she demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of cider - brewing .
Her method involves a little more equipment ( although no oak barrels ) and a few more steps .
She usually brews six jugs ( about 24 litres ) per batch , pouring all into a sterilized primary fermenter with a loose - fitting lid that allows for some headroom .
Warne finds champagne yeast overly efficient , as it tends to ferment out every last speck of sugar ; her preference is a more finicky Swiss ale yeast for the flavour it imparts and the residual sweetness it leaves .
She lets the primary run for about a week at 15 º C , racking it into a 23 - litre carboy once it is no longer active , then adds a teaspoon of powdered gelatin to help the yeast to " flocculate " ( brewer 's talk for " sink to the bottom " ) , then lets this secondary fermentation sit somewhere cool ( eight to 12 º C ) for a month , after which it is usually ready to bottle .
Warne eschews carbonating with corn sugar , preferring the German technique of " krausening " , which involves adding a small amount ( eight percent of the total volume ) of fresh juice , which may be inoculated with a pinch of yeast , back to the newly fermented cider .
This , she said , will give it a softer carbonation , which is smoother on the palette , and a cider you cannot buy here , or anywhere , for ready money .
It 's not .
And what is even worse is that we are deeper in debt with nothing good to show for it .
In September of 2007 , just months before the current crisis began , our national debt was a little over $ 9 trillion give or take a few billion .
As of late last week , our national debt was quickly approaching $ 12 trillion .
That is an increase in debt of $ 3 trillion in just two years !
Of course , most of the new debt is a result of stimulus spending , other government handouts to stimulate the economy , and war – things Keynesians have always historically believed would turn any economy around .
That theory has been disproved previously and this current economic crisis is just the most recent repudiation of it .
So , with all this spending what do we have to show for it .
This week the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that unemployment is at a 26 year high in the United States at 9.8 percent .
Payroll employment has fallen for 21 consecutive months , with total jobs lost equaling 7.2 million .
This is only the phoney government number .
It does n't count workers who have been unemployed so long they have given up on finding a job and those working part time that prefer full time .
The total unemployed number , meaning the number the government has always used up until the Clinton years , is actually 17 percent !
This is a Great Depression number .
So it is interesting when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke says his monetary policies have kept us from an economic calamity .
In addition to higher unemployment , with the new debt we also have lower consumer confidence .
The 2nd Quarter real gross domestic product number went down at an annual rate of .7 percent .
And lastly , Americans continue to lose their homes to foreclosures .
They increased by 17 percent in the 2nd quarter in spite of a government spending program meant to help borrowers save their homes .
Taking all these facts together , only a fool would believe the economy is recovering , Keynesian economics works , and Ben Bernanke has saved us from an economic abyss .
However , there is one sector of the economy that is doing pretty well as a result of all this new debt – big banks .
As a group their stock prices are up .
They are receiving a good rate of return on their bailout money being held in their Fed reserve accounts .
Bonuses are being paid .
And they are enjoying the privileges that come with Fed membership – anonymity when given our money and protection against failure .
Perhaps when Bernanke , Biden , and Obama talk of recovery they have the big banks in mind .
One thing is clear .
Most of America is not experiencing an economic recovery .
$ 3 trillion more in debt and the economy is still in the dumper .
The so - called jobless recovery policymakers speak of is an insult .
It does n't give much comfort to the 7.2 million folks who have lost their jobs since December 2007 .
The only jobless recovery that is acceptable is the one that will result when the scoundrels that caused this mess lose their jobs .
Americans will have this opportunity starting next year .
Hopefully , they will take full advantage of it .

Half of standards making is minutia ; the other half is politics .
Rightly or wrongly , I ’ve long suspected that Atom was born , not of necessity , but because of conflicts between the XML crowd and the founders of RSS .
Likewise , rightly or wrongly , I reckoned HTML5 was at least partly Hixie ’s revenge against XHTML served as text / html .
And then a funny thing happened .
Some friends and I gathered at Happy Cog ’s New York studio to hash out the pros and cons of HTML5 from the perspective of semantic - markup - oriented web designers ( as opposed to the equally valid perspectives of browser engineers and web application developers — the two perspectives that have primarily driven the creation of HTML 5 ) .
Our first task was to come to a shared understanding of the spec .
During the two days and nights we spent poring over new and changed semantic elements , we discovered that many things we had previously considered serious problems were fixable issues related to language .
Easy language problems
Some of these language problems are trivial indeed .
For instance , on both the WHATWG and W3C sites , the specification is sometimes called “ HTML 5 ” ( with a space ) and sometimes called “ HTML5 ” ( with no space ) .
A standard should have a standard name .
( Informed of this problem , Hixie has removed the space everywhere in the WHATWG version of the spec . )
Likewise , as an end - user , I found it confusing to be told that there is an “ HTML5 serialization of HTML 5 , ” let alone an “ XHTML 5 version of HTML5 . ”
I requested that the two serializations be referred to as “ HTML ” and “ XHTML ” — emphasizing the distinction between the two kinds of syntax rather than drawing needless attention to version numbers .
( Again , Hixie promptly updated the spec . )
Names and expectations
Some language problems are tougher — but still eminently fixable , because they are language problems that mar the presentation of good ideas , not bad ideas that require rethinking .
For example , in order to choose suitable names for the new semantic elements in HTML 5 , Hixie analyzed classnames on thousands of websites to see what web designers and developers were already doing .
If many designers and developers use classnames like “ header ” and “ footer ” to contain certain kinds of content , then HTML 5 should use these labels , too , Hixie and his colleagues reasoned .
Doing so would make the purpose of the new elements intuitively obvious to working web professionals , removing the learning curve and encouraging proper element use from the get - go .
It ’s a beautiful theory that comes straight out of Bert Bos ’s W3C Design Principles .
There ’s just one problem .
Header , and especially footer , behave differently from what their names will lead web designers and developers to expect .
Developers will use it for the footer of the page — not for the footer of each section .
And they will be frustrated that the footer in HTML5 forbids navigation links .
After all , the footer at the bottom of web pages almost always includes navigation links .
To avoid misuse and frustration , the content model of footer should change to match that of header , so that it may be used concurrently as a template level element ( the expected use ) and a sub-division of section ( the new use ) .
Alternately , the element ’s name should be changed ( to almost anything but “ footer ” ) .
Expanding the content model is clearly the better choice .
For the love of markup
HTML5 is unusual in many ways .
Chiefly , it is the first HTML created in the time of web applications .
It is also the first to be initiated outside the W3C ( although it now develops there in parallel ) .
Not surprisingly in a specification that goes on for 900 pages , there are at least a dozen places in HTML5 where a thoughtful standardista might request clarification , suggest a change , or both .
My friends and I have taken a stab at this ourselves , and will soon publish our short list of recommendations and requests for clarification .
Nevertheless , the more I study the direction HTML5 is taking , the better I like it .
In the words of the HTML5 Super Friends , “ Its introduction of a limited set of additional semantic elements , its instructions on how to handle failure , and its integration of application development tools hold the promise of richer and more consistent user experiences , faster prototyping , and increased human and machine semantics . ”

Deanna of Collector 's Quest wrote about 19th Century vampire killing kits .
These are expensive kits , made for the wealthy ; not some cheap and cheesy plastic novelty items .
Such luxury concedes a seriousness — a deadly seriousness .
These items were made to address deep , dark , primal fears .
And then , like our fears often are , they were not thrown away but stored in equally dark and out of the way places …
Antique wooden killing kits in the attics of old houses , just waiting for the day when the creatures creep from the attics of our minds .
Fascinated , I spoke with Dwight Stevens , of Stevens Auction Company , on the phone yesterday about the antique piece of vampire history .
" I do n't believe in vampires — I 've never met one .
But somebody believed in them , something drove people to believe …
From New Orleans to Vicksburg , these old boxes remain . "
Stevens has sold four vampire killing kits in his 27 years as an auctioneer , most recently selling one a year ago , in Natchez , Mississippi , for $ 1485 .

Little wonder Australians are reconsidering the nuclear option for electricity production .
The recent wave of euphoric predictions of a global nuclear renaissance from industry promoters has created high community expectations .
But on closer scrutiny , nuclear power 's real potential is disappointing .
Despite over half a century of intensive subsidisation and promotion , it produces less than 15 per cent of the world 's electricity .
This may seem hard to believe , given the fervour with which its promoters have been singing its praises of late , but the numbers speak for themselves .
In addition to 430 reactors operating worldwide , 52 reactors are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency as ' ' under construction ' ' .
Thirteen have been on that list for over 20 years , and 24 still do n't have an official planned start - up date .
One oft - quoted goal of the nuclear industry is to grow to 730 reactors worldwide by 2030 .
This would require one to be completed every 24 days , every year for the next 20 years .
And it would assume none currently operating will be shut down .
This seems improbable as the average age of operating power plants is 25 years .
Meanwhile the industry gestures excitedly at China ( 16 under construction ) , India ( seven under construction ) and Russia ( nine under construction ) , which are unlikely even to compensate for lost global capacity as older reactors will have to close .
Point and click adventures — one of classic gaming 's most revered and , until recently , most forgotten genres — have seen a renaissance of late .
That 's something I 'll be exploring more fully in a future column , but , for now , it 's a point best proven by what will surely be one of the highest profile indie games released this month : Amanita Design 's adventure Machinarium , due for release this Friday for PC and Mac .
Best known for their early web adventure Samorost — a game that swapped out pixel crafting for a photo - surreal landscape built on rusted cans and gnarled , mossy roots ( ' samorost ' , not coincidentally , being the word for ' gnarled ' or ' twisted ' in Amanita head Jakub Dvorský's native Czech ) — the studio quickly established themselves as the indie forerunners of the then - niche form with Samorost 2 , and promotional games for Dallas - area glee - rockers Polyphonic Spree , Nike , and the BBC .
Machinarium looks to be the studio's most ambitious work , here fully hand - drawn as opposed to their former photo - shoppery , and digging deeper into the genre 's past with inventory - based puzzling and exploration rather than rote hot - spot - hunting points and clicks .
Presented here , then , ahead of its imminent release , a rare hi-res look into the sketchbooks of Dvorský and fellow artist Adolf Lachman showing the conceptual origins and creation of its rusted iron steamworks world , alongside a selection of images of the completed product .
Machinarium can be pre-ordered directly from Amanita ( which comes with a downloadable bonus soundtrack thank - you gift ) , or for via Direct2 Drive ( for PCs ) and GamersGate ( for the Mac ) , where you 'll also find a demo version for each platform .

For a domestic audience , President Obama ’s Nobel Peace Prize is arguably awkward .
Concern - troll Mickey
Kaus is already editorializing that he should turn it down , in a concession that , as Morrissey once crooned , he just has n’t earned it yet .
And I do n’t know .
But turning it down would be a slap in the face to an international community that is showing , in the most generous way possible , that it wants the U.S. back as a leading component of the global order .
The issue is not Barack Obama .
It ’s what the president represents internationally : a symbol of an America that is willing , once again , to drive the international system forward , together , toward the humane positive - sum goals of peace and disarmament .
The fact that Obama has n’t gotten the planet there misses the point entirely .
It ’s that he ’s beginning , slowly , to take the world again down the path .
Rep. Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , observes that the award is a “ recognition of President Obama ’s work to strengthen international cooperation .
It validates the president ’s approach to tough trans-national challenges such as global warming and the spread of nuclear arms .
And it celebrates his steady efforts to improve America ’s standing around the world . ”

Biofuel comes from some strange sources –watermelon , coffee grounds , and poop , to name a few .
But when does the weirdness cross over into immorality ?
Perhaps when we start burning bunnies for biofuel .
As unbelievable as it may sound , stray rabbits in Stockholm are reportedly being captured , frozen , and shipped to a heating plant to be used as biofuel by a local company called Konvex .
It ’s not quite as cruel as it first seems .
Thousands of strays and abandoned pets hop around the streets of Stockholm , and they ’ve begun to munch on crops in city parks .
So in a way , turning the rabbits into biofuel is just an efficient method to get rid of an invasive animal .
But unsurprisingly , the killings are angering animal right activists .
Sweden ’s Society for the Protection of Wild Rabbits claims that parks could be sprayed with chemicals to make them unattractive to rabbits .
Rabbit hunters protest that this will just move the problem without eradicating it .
Killing the animals does seem like the simplest and least toxic solution , but using the mass slaughter of a single species for fuel does n’t sit well .
It ’s true that dead human bodies have been used by some towns for their waste heat , but the humans involved were n’t killed for their energy potential .
The rabbits , on the other hand , are methodically killed and packaged .
What do you think –have we gone too far ?

All 1.6 million books digitized so far by the Internet Archive , the San Francisco - based non-profit dedicated to the universal sharing of knowledge , will be available free to children around the world who have laptops built by the Cambridge , MA - based One Laptop Per Child Foundation ( OLPC ) , Internet Archive director Brewster Kahle announced today at the Boston Book Festival in downtown Boston .
Kahle said the announcement capped a year - long collaboration between the Internet Archive and the OLPC , which was founded by MIT computer scientist Nicholas Negroponte .
“ We ’ve been working for the last year , since Nicholas invited us , to show that we can do this , ” Kahle said .
“ We took all of the one million , six hundred thousand books and reformatted them to work with the OLPC laptop . ”
The little green laptop , called the XO , “ makes a really good reader , ” said Kahle , an MIT - educated computer engineer and entrepreneur who co-founded the Internet Archive in 1996 .
The Internet Archive operates 20 scanning centers in five countries , where hundreds of workers are manually scanning books from public and university libraries , mostly public - domain works for which the copyright term has expired .
It collects these books at its Open Access Text Archive .
It also makes them available to people in developing nations via a network of satellite - connected print - on - demand “ bookmobiles . ”
Now the books will also be available to the roughly 750,000 to 1 million schoolchildren in developing countries who have XO laptops .
The announcement came as part of a Boston Book Festival panel session on electronic books , entitled “ The Future of Reading : Books Without Pages ? ”
The session , held at the Boston Public Library , was part of a day - long celebration of books and reading funded by Boston ’s State Street Bank and organized by Deborah Porter , a freelance book reviewer who is Negroponte ’s significant other , according to the Boston Globe .
OLPC and the Archive have been working together for a year to get the books ready for display on the XO Laptop ’s screen , which was designed to be visible in full sunlight and to use less energy than existing commercial LCD screens .
The books are being converted into the open EPUB format , which will be cleanly readable on an XO after a coming update to the devices ’ operating environment .
“ We set a date of this meeting , a year ago , to say let ’s get our books in really good shape , ” Kahle told Xconomy after the panel session .
“ We were first going to do it in PDF , because the screen is a really a beautiful screen , but we found that if we were really going to make it work for people in developing countries — if you want to get this to kids in Uruguay — then having a 10 - kilobyte file beats the heck out of a 5 - megabyte file .
So we went and converted our books such that it would work .
And the One Laptop Per Child guys went and made it so that those worked well on the XO .
They are working very hard to make it so that … Next Page »

Ugandan gay people have long alleged persecution A Ugandan MP has proposed creating an offence of " aggravated homosexuality " to be punishable by death .
Ruling party MP David Bahati wants the death penalty for those having gay sex with disabled people , under - 18s or when the accused is HIV - positive .
Homosexual acts are already illegal , but the Anti-Homosexuality Bill proposes new offences and urges the toughening of existing penalties .
Earlier versions of the bill were widely criticised by rights groups .
The BBC's Joshua Mmali , in the capital Kampala , says the bill has a good chance of being passed as senior figures from the ruling National Resistance Movement are likely to back it .
President Yoweri Museveni has made several speeches outlining his own anti-gay views .
Gays ' persecuted '
There are estimated to be 500,000 gay people in Uganda , from a population of about 31 million , according to gay rights groups .
Gay activists have long alleged persecution and existing laws already allow large fines and life imprisonment for some homosexual acts .
Members of parliament are overwhelmingly supporting this bill because homosexuality is illegal
John Otekat Emile
Independent MP
Mr Bahati's bill proposes widening the definition of homosexual acts and wants to fine or imprison anyone found to be promoting homosexuality .
The bill states that its provisions are intended to " protect the traditional family by prohibiting any form of sexual relations between persons of the same sex " .
The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission has urged the bill to be dismissed .
They say it violates several international agreements Uganda has signed up to - as well as contradicting the country 's own constitution .
But John Otekat Emile , an independent MP , said he believed the bill had a " 99 % chance " of being passed .
" Members of parliament are overwhelmingly supporting this bill because homosexuality is illegal in Uganda , and we have that clearly in the penal code , " he told the BBC .
Emmanuel Dombo , an MP with the ruling party , agreed and said it was an important issue to investigate .
" What we need to look at are the sentences - what kind of sentences or punishment should be prescribed for sexual offenders in this respect - that is the big question , " he said .
But our correspondent says the authorities already find it difficult to prove cases under current laws because evidence is difficult to obtain .

Is A Mess
The Problem : When is that game coming out ?
With the release of the PSP Go , the industry is intently watching how Sony will use the PlayStation Store to support the first digital - only console .
Unfortunately , at least in my opinion , there are still a lot of problems with the PlayStation Store - both on PS3 and PSP .
There are issues that hinder the buying experience which by now , three years after the PlayStation Store 's launch , should have been fixed .
Many of them are relatively small , but when grouped together , showcase a somewhat significant problem with the Store .
Here , we take a look at what I think are the 10 main problems with the PlayStation Store , and what Sony and game publishers can do to make the experience better for consumers and help boost digital console gaming :
One thing Microsoft has been good at is worldwide releases .
Besids a few exceptions , all games come out in most Xbox Live regions , and all on the same day .
This is because Microsoft has a single submission process for XBLA games - you only have to submit the game to the Microsoft office , and they will test it for all the regions in which the publisher wants to release it .
Sony , on the other hand has gone for 3 major submissions - North America , Europe and Japan .
A game might get through the submission process in America , but will get stuck ( or be submitted later ) in Europe .
Therefore the European process has to start all over again , which can mean a month or more of waiting for the game to come out .
With a single worldwide Xbox Live Arcade release , publishers can concentrate on a single campaign .
They can build hype , have competitions and release trailers or screenshots in a timely manner .
If a game has a staggered release , the hype dissipates , and causes potentially disgruntled would - be customers to care less and less about a game .
Take Trine for example .
The game came out in Europe two weeks ago , after two months of being out on the PC .
The game will finally hit the U.S at the end of October .
But by the time is comes out , people will be already be over the peak of interest , publisher Nobilis may have exhausted all of their press budget , and any sort of post - release buzz from other territories will be gone .
That 's a terrible way to run a business .
It sounds like it would be impossible to make a single system now , since Sony is quite adamant that they want to keep SCEE , SCEJ and SCEA separate .
What needs to happen is for the three territories to start talking to each other and organize dates , so that we can get consistent releases .
With the launch of the PSP Go , we 've seen a ton of games pop up onto the PlayStation Store - some of them with very large file sizes .
For example , Daxter is over a gigabyte in size , and the recently released Gran Turismo PSP is quite large too .
Unfortunately for you , if you 're not using your PlayStation 3 or the Media Go download manager on your PC , you have to wait that whole download period before you can start doing anything else .
If you accidentally lose your connection at some point , you have to start your download all over again .
I do n't know whether the PSP has enough memory for background downloading .
But I would at least like the luxury of bring able to pause a download or start from where it left off -- or even allow the PSP to be used in a more limited mode with browser and MP3 playback still available .
The PlayStation Network has a feature called " preview " .
This allows players to have a look at screenshots or trailers of the game they 're looking at .
The problem is that -- for whatever reason -- hardly any of the games on PSN use it .
Right now , titles that have screenshots on the PlayStation Store are few and far between .
People do n't even know it 's there most of the time - it 's tucked away at the payment screen , just after the " buy " button .
Few people would venture into the payment screen , since the description is already in the shop menu .
Some games do use it , and it appears that some PSP Minis developers have started to take advantage of it .
Bt even then , there are inconsistencies .
Some games have screenshots on the American store , while the same game does not have any on the European front .
PSP Mini Fieldrunners goes one step further - a video in the U.S , screenshots only in Europe .
But then we 're only talking about the PlayStation 3 store .
If you 've got a PSP , you 've got no preview options whatsoever .
If you have a PSP Go you 'll have a hard time figuring out what you want .
Japan , on the other hand , does have screenshots for nearly everything .
They do it by circumventing the " preview button " entirely , throwing the screenshots in the same space as the description .
On the PS3 the screenshots are quite small and difficult to see , but are fine on the PSP store .
In the digital age , screenshots need to be mandatory across the store landscape to keep the consumer informed , and give them a much better chance of buying the product .
When looking through the PlayStation Store on the PS3 , you can see each games ' icon quite clearly .
As there are no screenshots , you have to use them to get an idea of what the game might look like .
On the PSP , however , you can't see a thing -- as if someone used the " pixel resize " option in Photoshop instead of any smoother options .
One thing iPhone developers will remind you is that your icon is very important .
The icon is the first thing they will see on the store front , and should be enticing enough for the consumer to continue reading about your game .
If the PSP icons look so relatively unattractive , how are developers supposed to get gamers interested ?
There are two ways about this - either find a way for the current icons to be re-sized in a smoother fashion , or have developers create PSP - specific icons alongside the PS3 counterparts , so that they 're made for the right resolution in the first place .
When the PSP Minis were announced we , felt this was the branding that PSP finally needed for download only PlayStation Store games like Super Stardust Portable and Echocrome Micro .
But now that the system is out , we now realize they do n't fit the criteria , because they offer too much .
The new game Thexder Neo just came out , which has all of the qualities of a Mini .
It 's small in file size ( 33MB ) , it retails for a relatively inexpensive $ 9.99 , and it seems like a perfect example .
But the game includes online multiplayer , which the Minis program does not allow right now , and therefore gets thrown in with the other hundred or so PSP retail titles .
The same thing will happen with Loco Roco Midnight Carnival - a $ 14.99 , download - only Loco Roco game .
In North America these games do get a little bit of recognition - they 're considered " PlayStation Network exclusives " .
But there is no such place in the European store , so they have nowhere to call home .
It also seems quite inaccurate - Thexder does not appear as a ' PlayStation Network exclusive ' , while Ratchet & Clank : Size Matters does , when that game did get released in stores .
The Minis initiative is meant to give developers a shorter time in the certification process , which is why online play is not permitted at this time .
I believe that the Minis certification process should be an option , and if a developer or publisher wishes to go that extra mile for their Minis title they should be allowed to go through the more expensive process , while still being able to use the Minis name .
Some people may say that the Microsoft Points scheme is a little confusing , but it is consistent .
If a game is 800MSP in the U.S , it 's 800MSP everywhere else .
What a MSP is worth is up to the store , but for the most part they 're close .
The PlayStation Store on the other hand can be all over the place .
While most games in North America keep to the same price point - such as $ 9.99 or $ 14.99 , converting that over to Europe is another thing entirely .
For example , Flower came out earlier this year for $ 9.99USD .
In Australia a $ 10USD game gets converted to $ 12.95AUD .
Or does it ?
Bomberman Ultra just came out , and it's $ 15.95AUD .
Heavy Weapon gets released for $ 12.95AUD while Capcom 's previous efforts , like Commando 3 , convert to $ 15.95 .
The same thing also happens for more expensive titles .
Both Battlefield 1943 and Fat Princess were released for $ 14.99 in the U.S , but in Australia they 're priced at $ 19.95AUD and $ 23.95 respectively .
As a consumer , this variation in pricing is very frustrating .
It 's unknown who 's making the conversion prices - Sony or the publisher -- but it needs clearing up .
Keep things consistent - almost every other digital store does .
The PlayStation Store has kept itself pretty consistent across Europe and North America - a clear cut , simple icon with a graphical border surrounding it .
In North America they 've continued the tradition with the PSP minis , but in Europe and Asia , they 've decided to use a bright purple border which does n't mesh with anything else in the store .
It sticks out like a sore thumb , almost to say " stay away from me " .
The icons in North America work far better .
Just use those .
So you 've just bought your PlayStation 3 or PSP and want to start out by checking out a few demos .
If you 're in Europe , good luck with that .
While the United States have a section at the top of the store for demos , Europe does not .
Unless it is in the latest downloads , or you specifically know which game you 're after , you 'll have no idea where to go .
What 's taking the place of the Demos section is the splitting of " PS3 Games " and " PSP Games " into separate sections , while the U.S store simply has " Games " with separate PS3 and PSP sections within it .
While it's an extra step away , it 's still better than no demo section at all .
While Xbox.com is basically the same across all regions , with some additional pages for specific territories , each region of PlayStation.com has a wildly different idea on how to deal with a website - U.S JP and Asia have completely different designs and features .
Looking for more about a game ?
Japan and Asia 's websites have a pretty comprehensive database of PSP , PS2 and PS3 games .
The North American website attempts to do the same , but appears quite difficult to navigate , and is missing a large portion of new releases , even if they 're on the PSN store .
There 's nothing on the U.S. store which hints at Bomberman Ultra being available on PSN , but they 'll gladly tell you that Bomberman Fantasy Race came out on the PSOne .
On the other hand , the European PlayStation.com does not claim whether a game is on the PlayStation Network or not .
There are very limited search options - you can't check by alphabet , and there does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to how " browse games " is sorted at all .
New releases like Motorstorm Arctic Edge and SoulCalibur Broken Destiny are hidden away in the third page of the " browse " section .
The stores might be seperate , but there 's no reason why Sony can't use the same technology across multiple websites , or at least get the game database in some sort of shape .
It seems like everyone is a little clueless about when their game is coming out on the PlayStation Network .
Switchball came out a few weeks ago in North America , and it was released with no fanfare whatsoever .
It was a quality game on the Xbox Live Arcade .
But to suddenly spring the game on an unknowing populace is just poor , and publishers should know better .
While this is more the publisher 's fault than the PlayStation Store ( in this case , it was Sony Online Entertainment that forgot it was releasing a game ) , Microsoft at least has a system set up for some advance knowledge .
It announces games on Monday , and releases them on Wednesday , and for the most part it gets it right .
This allows the press to alert everyone that the game is coming out ahead of time , and allows consumers to decide whether or not they will buy something that week .
This almost never happens with the PlayStation Blog -- but they are getting a little better with allowing the developers to guest blog on the week of release .
It appears that Sony will continue with the Thursday updates , despite the release of the PSP Go , where the UMD versions will come out at all times of the week .
The PlayStation Blog should -- at the very least list -- off the PSP and PSN games that will be available that week ahead of time .
This allows for reviews to be written , and for websites to spread the message .
Videos and DLC might be up in the air , but surely they have an idea of what will be released in four days time ?
O.K. , folks , this is it .
It ’s the defining moment for health care reform .
Past efforts to give Americans what citizens of every other advanced nation already have  guaranteed access to essential care  have ended not with a bang , but with a whimper , usually dying in committee without ever making it to a vote .
But this time , broadly similar health - care bills have made it through multiple committees in both houses of Congress .
And on Thursday , Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , unveiled the legislation that she will send to the House floor , where it will almost surely pass .
It ’s not a perfect bill , by a long shot , but it ’s a much stronger bill than almost anyone expected to emerge even a few weeks ago .
And it would lead to near - universal coverage .
As a result , everyone in the political class  by which I mean politicians , people in the news media , and so on , basically whoever is in a position to influence the final stage of this legislative marathon  now has to make a choice .
The seemingly impossible dream of fundamental health reform is just a few steps away from becoming reality , and each player has to decide whether he or she is going to help it across the finish line or stand in its way .
For conservatives , of course , it ’s an easy decision :
They do n’t want Americans to have universal coverage , and they do n’t want President Obama to succeed .
2 . Do n't ask for the bill at the restaurant .
Pay at the counter .
3 . With disposable chopsticks , fold the tail end of the paper packaging and slot in your chopsticks to signal that you 're done eating .
4 . Do n't wear swimsuits to DisneySea .
Streetwear or cosplay outfits do just fine .
5 . Return utensils to the counter or designated return area at a soba - ten , fast food joint or coffeeshop .
6 . Stand on the left and walk on the right when using the escalator .
WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation may have more than 1,000 pages in its files on the late Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina , but federal officials have n’t released a single document more than a year after a San Francisco blogger filed Freedom of Information Act requests .
San Francisco - based blogger and gay rights activist Michael Petrelis sent the FBI a Freedom of Information Act request for information on Helms shortly after the senator ’s July 4th , 2008 death .
The FBI restricts third - party access to information about individuals while they are still alive , but makes it possible for people to request copies of someone else ’s FBI files after they have passed away .

The FBI ’s records management division staff sent Petrelis a letter in October 2008 , informing him they ’d located 1,082 pages that may mention Helms , but that it could cost Petrelis $ 98.20 to get copies of all the documents .
The first 100 pages of FBI records requests are provided for free , but people are charged for copies beyond 100 pages .
Petrelis agreed to pay the fee , but nearly a year later has yet to receive a document .
“ We ’ve been waiting more than a year to get ANYTHING out of them and we know they ’ve got all those pages , ” Petrelis told Raw Story , adding that he was able to receive information about threats against former President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney –while both were still in office — less than seven months after requesting the information .
“ They ’re in office and they ’re alive and one is the sitting president and we ’re talking threats , and the FBI is able to find and release something , ” Petrelis said .
“ But with Jesse Helms , we ’re more than a year after our initial request and we still do n’t have anything . ” ‘
FBI spokesman Bill Carter told Raw Story “ it does take time to review documents and determine under the law what can or ca n’t be released . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There ’s no time frame you can really give , it all depends on the number of documents we are dealing with , ” Carter said .
Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , was not available for an interview Monday , but has said in prior interviews with Raw Story that the FBI often takes years to respond to requests .
“ Standard operating procedure there is to file a FOIA request and wait three to five years , ” Dalglish told Raw Story .

Petrelis said he was interested in the Helms case because he ’d been part of protests at the late senator ’s home and office .
“ There were six or seven of us that did a sit - in , a kiss - in , in his office , to call for gay rights and better AIDS treatment programs in the early ’ 90s , ” Petrelis said .
“ I ’d be curious to know if that event was in these files . ”

Helms himself once focused on getting the FBI to release files on a late icon : civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr .
The late senator claimed one reason he opposed giving Martin Luther King .
Jr. his own national holiday in 1983 was because the Senate rejected his amendment to unseal the FBI ’s files on King .
Helms said he believed King ’s advisers included communist sympathizers .
Correction : RAW STORY mistakenly identified the late Sen. Jesse Helms as a South Carolina Republican .
Helms was from North Carolina .
RAW STORY regrets the error .
WASHINGTON 
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer agreed to pay $ 2.3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed its painkiller Bextra , which has been withdrawn .
It was the largest health care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind ever .
Although the investigation began and largely ended during the Bush administration , top Obama administration officials held a news conference on Wednesday to celebrate the settlement , thank each other for resolving it and promise more crackdowns on health fraud .
“ It ’s another step in the administration ’s ongoing effort to prosecute any individual or organization that tries to rip off health care consumers and the federal government , ” said Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of health and human services .
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have accused the Obama administration of failing to crack down adequately on health care fraud , arguing that huge savings in government health programs could be found with better enforcement .
The settlement had been expected .
Pfizer , which is acquiring a rival , Wyeth , reported in January that it had taken a $ 2.3 billion charge to resolve claims involving Bextra and other drugs .
It was Pfizer ’s fourth settlement over illegal marketing activities since 2002 .
“ The Memory Card ” is a seasonal feature that dissects and honors some of the most artistic , innovative , and memorable videogame moments of all time .
For years , role - playing games have introduced numerous , colorful casts of playable characters that ban together to stop the world from some unforeseen , horribly evil force .
And , sadly , these casts are usually made up of some very interchangeable heroes .
Giant sword ?
Check .
Mysterious past ?
Check .
Crazy haircut ?
Check .
As these generic heroes travel through their respective , fictional RPG worlds , they come in contact with too many NPCs to count .
And sometimes these non-playable characters show signs of being even more interesting than the main protagonist you are controlling .
Have n’t you ever wondered what the story is surrounding that beautiful , red - haired bartender that works in the basement of that inn ?
Or what of the random girl who sits by the lake , spouting helpful advice about where to find a particular treasure ?
Dragon Quest IV for the Nintendo Entertainment System not only tackles these fascinating questions , the game dedicates a whole section to focus on one of the most unlikely heroes to ever set foot in an RPG .
Hit the jump to visit one of the most original , creative sequences in one of my favorite retro role - playing games of all time .
The Set - Up
Oh , America .
You are so wacky sometimes .
For some reason , you decided to change the perfectly acceptable Dragon Quest name to Dragon Warrior when you brought the game to the US .
And then with Dragon Quest VIII for the PlayStation 2 , you decided to change it back to its original , Japanese name .
What gives ?
I know there were some copyright fears with another role - playing game , but this kind of stuff is just confusing .
But I digress ( sorry ! ) .
For the benefit of consistency , I am going to refer to the game as Dragon Quest IV , even though I played Dragon Warrior IV for the NES .
It will just make things easier .
A lot of fans consider Dragon Quest IV a favorite of the series , and understandably so .
The game incorporates a rather clever chapter system , dividing the massive adventure into parts , each section introducing new characters and filling in important plot and story details .
It is brilliant concept and really makes playing through each new chapter an exciting experience .
The first four chapters of Dragon Quest IV introduce a different set of characters , each with different skills .
While this is a very creative idea , some people grew frustrated with the fact that each of the new characters starts off at level 1 at the beginning of each chapter .
For me , though , I enjoyed this as it made the first ten hours of the game feel endlessly fresh .
In the prologue of the first chapter , the main hero of the story is introduced as a child , but players actually do n’t get to completely use him until Chapter 5 , when all the game ’s characters from the first four chapters are reunited to embark on a final , lengthy quest to save the world .
But I am getting ahead of myself .
This week ’s Memory Card focuses on Chapter 3 and one of my favorite characters in the Dragon Quest series : Taloon the merchant .
The Moment
Chapter 3 of Dragon Quest IV begins in the small town of Lakanaba .
At the very start of the chapter , an overweight merchant named Torneko Taloon is woken up by his wife , Neta .
She shakes Taloon and warns him to hurry to work or his boss will scold him for being late again .
Agreeing , Taloon hops up , grabs his lunch from the loving Neta , and heads west to his job at the local weapons shop .
As soon as he gets to the shop , his boss puts him to work right away .
At this point in the game , the player must work behind the counter as the actual merchant of a weapons shop and buy and sell various weapons from people who come in the store .
Admittedly , it can become tedious after a while , but Taloon is offered a commission on everything he sells , so the more hours he spends behind the counter the better !
At any time , Taloon can call it quits , collect his money earned , and retire for the evening , free to come back at anytime the following day .
After repeating his job over and over again , Taloon will eventually earn enough money to start buying weapons , items , and armor of his own .
Once he is fully equipped , Taloon decides to say goodbye to his job and his family (! ) , venture into the world , and make enough money to open his own shop in the town of Endor .
Taloon is a merchant , so his fighting skills are very minimal .
In fact , in order to even survive for a few minutes , Taloon is almost required to equip as much armor on himself as possible .
As his journey to open his own shop moves forward , Taloon is tasked with completing many different quests that relate to being a merchant .
First , he is asked to find a magical safe that , once found , will protect money from being lost after death ( super helpful ! ) .
Another quest finds
Taloon forced to pay off a series of villagers to obtain special items and information to move forward .
To do this , Taloon must fight fearsome beasts ( something he is not used to ) , horde the items he finds after defeating them , and sell everything to make enough money to pay off his requests .
After making his way through many forests and dungeons , Taloon finally arrives at Endor , sells an expensive sacred statue he obtained on his journey , and uses his earnings to buy a vacant weapon shop .
Taloon ’s dream of being an arms merchant with his own store finally comes true !
Even cooler , once he sets up shop , Taloon ’s wife and child join him in Endor and help him run the new weapons store .
At this point , Taloon must spend a ridiculous amount of money to hire an excavator to build an undersea tunnel to a new continent , thus expanding the world the savvy merchant has to explore and discover new treasures .
To make the funds necessary for this expansion , Taloon must journey into the wilds , fight enemies for valuable items , and sell those items at his very own store .
Luckily , though , Taloon ’s wife decides to take over the job behind the counter , and marks up every item to ridiculous prices , making sure a huge profit is made off each sword and piece of armor sold .
Once enough money is collected , Taloon pays off the excavator , and watches as the undersea tunnel is built .
Saying a tearful goodbye to his wife once more , Taloon makes his way to the new continent as the chapter comes to a close .
You can watch the opening of Chapter 3 -- which follows Taloon as he works his first job as a merchant -- right here : ( Please ignore the comments of the person in the video .
He obviously hates this part of Dragon Quest IV which I strongly disagree with .
Boo , random YouTube guy ! )
The Impact
If I had a nickel for every gamer I have met that has hated Chapter 3 of Dragon Quest IV , I would have enough money to excavate an undersea tunnel of my own !
For some odd reason , the chapter starring lovable family man Taloon is met with such harsh criticism .
But I guess I kind of understand where people are coming from .
The entire chapter -- all multiple hours of it -- is mostly reserved to finding , managing , and selling items , something most people despise doing in an RPG .
But , for me , I absolutely adore how different the storyline with Taloon is .
Think about how many RPGs you have played .
Okay , narrow that down : think about how many good RPGs you have played .
Now think about how many NPC characters exist in each of those fictional RPG worlds .
The number reaches into the thousands , huh ?
In a good RPG with a fantastically realized world , each of these NPC characters should give the impression that they have a life they are living outside of your main character ’s adventure .
Each king may have a backstory of how he came into power ; each villager may have a family they go home to every night after pacing around town ; each merchant may have to obtain and manage every single item they sell in their shop .
This is why I absolutely love Chapter 3 of Dragon Quest IV :
For the first time in an RPG , I got to see what it was like to live the life of a character that was n’t a powerful , world - trotting hero .
I got to experience what the merchant in a store experiences when the generic hero is not around .
I got to find the actual items that I would sell .
I got to watch as a parade of would - be heroes bought my hard - earned weapons to use for God knows what .
Torneko Taloon is anything but the traditional hero .
He is a shockingly weak , clumsy merchant that has no aspirations aside from owning his own shop and taking care of his family .
What a breath of fresh air !
For years , I have been hoping and praying that any videogame in any genre would be more creative with the main character you are asked to play .
The limits are truly endless , but it seems designers are too afraid to take any big risks .
Choose any popular game and you can find a handful of characters I would have loved to play as !
Take Grand Theft Auto IV , for instance :
How interesting would it be to play as a teacher at a school in Liberty City rather than the obvious gangster that comes into the town .
Or in Earthbound , I would have loved to see what a game designed around a member of the Runaway Five would play like .
Sure , some of these experiments may not end up as entertaining as their current iterations -- who would want to participate in constant teaching minigames when you can leap off a helicopter with a Uzi in one hand and a grenade in another -- but if handed to a talented designer , any main character can become an interesting protagonist .
After all these years ( even more so after the DS remake ) , I have been endlessly fascinated by Taloon ’s chapter in Dragon Quest IV .
I will be the first to admit that it is hard to push through hours upon hours of nothing but working behind the counter of a weapons shop , but the amount of respect and admiration I have for the designers to try something completely unique always makes up for the ( tolerable ) tedium .
Add in the fact that the completely likable Taloon has a fully realized family that plays a big part in the gameplay of the chapter and I am completely sold .
The Dragon Quest games always seem to push the envelope just as much as they stick to tried and true RPG traditions .
It ’s a wonderful , interesting mix and one of the main reasons the series is one of my favorites of all time .
Now , every time I walk into a store during any RPG , I always want to know more about the seemingly random merchant behind the counter .
What ’s his story ?
Does he have a family ?
Is he living his dream ?

Global abortion rates are down — from an estimated 45.5 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003 , according to a report issued Tuesday by the Guttmacher Institute , a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights .
A key reason for that drop , the report said , was that the proportion of married women using contraception worldwide increased from 54 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 2003 as pregnancy prevention methods became more available and socially acceptable .
( HealthiNation )
That 's the good news .
The bad news is that unsafe abortions kill 70,000 women a year , mostly in poorer countries with strict antiabortion laws .
African countries , where only 28 percent of married women use contraception , have some of the highest rates of unsafe abortions .
Most of these are performed by women themselves or by untrained traditional healers .
The report included the story of a Nigerian woman who first tried to induce an abortion by drinking an herbal concoction , then consulted a healer who inserted leaves in her vagina , causing internal injuries .
It 's reminiscent of the wire - hanger attempts to terminate pregnancy in this country before abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973 .
The Guttmacher report also found that total abortions occurred at " roughly equal rates " in countries where they are legal and where they are highly restricted , which means that laws outlawing abortion are serving only to drive women to have the procedure in riskier places and with riskier methods .
But at a news conference in London , Guttmacher president Sharon Camp cited the Netherlands as an example for all other countries to follow .
It has the lowest abortion rate in the world : about 1 percent of women have had an abortion in the past year compared with a worldwide average of about 3 percent .
The Dutch ?
With their legalized prostitution and ultraliberal abortion laws ?
How can that be ?
I did a little research and found out that the Netherlands has not only the lowest abortion rate but the lowest rate of teen pregnancy .
In fact , the country has held this distinction for decades .
Researchers credit strategies like sex education in schools , discussion of sexuality in the mass media , and easy access to contraception .
One study pointed out that " acceptance of contraception preceded liberalization of abortion " and that Dutch citizens accept " abortion only as a last resort . "
Also a biggie : inclusion of family planning services as part of the Dutch medical system .
Hmm .
Full coverage for birth control pills , IUDs , and vasectomies ?
Sounds like a must in our healthcare reform bill .
In fact , I 'm wondering if all of the raging arguments concerning abortion coverage in health reform are n't a little misguided .
Perhaps pro-choice and antiabortion activists should unite to wage a push for comprehensive family planning services .
After all , both groups say they want to lower the rate of abortions , and research suggests those programs , rather than restrictive laws , are the way to achieve that goal .
This poll is now closed , but the debate continues in the comments section .
Do you think contraception coverage should be included in health reform ?
Yes No

Economists say that when the economy takes a dive , it is common for people to turn to their inner entrepreneur to try to make their own work .
But they say that it takes months for that mentality to sink in , and that this is about the time in the economic cycle when it really starts to happen – when the formerly employed realize that traditional job searches are not working , and that they are running out of time and money .
Mark V. Cannice , executive director of the entrepreneurship program at the University of San Francisco , calls the phenomenon " forced entrepreneurship . "
" If there is a silver lining , the large - scale downsizing from major companies will release a lot of new entrepreneurial talent and ideas – scientists , engineers , business folks now looking to do other things , " Mr. Cannice said .
" It 's a Darwinian unleashing of talent into the entrepreneurial ecosystem . "
That 's great .
Except for one thing , which the article completely misses :
You wo n't find too many people in their middle ages or older in this category .
Why ?
Because they can't get health insurance .
America 's health - care system makes it all but impossible for an older worker to try something new .
Even younger startup owners who are relatively healthy and have insurance are just a half - step from disaster .
The insurance industry is in the business of not paying claims whenever possible , after all , and health insurers are working hardest to find ways not to cover people who might get sick even as they deny as many claims as possible from people who 've been paying premiums .
The day we have national health care is the day that we unleash a wave of entrepreneurship the likes of which we 've never seen before .
That 's one of the best reasons for moving toward such a system .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- New
York public health workers will no longer be required to be vaccinated against both the seasonal and H1N1 flu virus , state officials announced Thursday , prompted by a vaccine shortage .
New York health workers will not receive mandatory flu shots due to a vaccine shortage .
A statement from Gov. David Paterson announced the policy change on behalf of State Health Commissioner Richard F. Daines .
Daines had originally said that public health workers must be vaccinated for the seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus , also known as swine flu , by November 30 or risk discipline .
The Public Employees Federation , New York 's second - largest state employees union , sued over the requirement and was awaiting a state Supreme Court hearing scheduled for October 30 .
The vaccine shortage has defused the conflict .
The federal government had told states that , by the end of October , an estimated 120 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine would be readily available , according to Paterson and Daines .
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have only about 27.7 million doses of the vaccine at month 's end .
Watch how current flu outbreak compares to years past »
" The CDC acknowledged that New York would only receive approximately 23 percent of its anticipated vaccine supply , " Paterson said .
" As a result , we need to be as resourceful as we can with the limited supplies of vaccine currently coming into the state . "
Watch how Obama administration plans to tackle swine flu »
Those particularly at risk , and who are at the forefront of receiving both the seasonal flu and the H1N1 vaccines , are pregnant women and people 6 months to 24 years old , the news release said .
The CDC has revised its H1N1 vaccine goal .
It had planned to have 200 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine by the end of November , but it now aims for 65.9 million doses nationwide .
The CDC also recently reported that increased demand has led to a shortage of the seasonal flu vaccine , according to Paterson 's statement .

Process networks in CHP do not have to be static .
In fact , some of the more interesting examples are dynamic .
To illustrate a dynamic process pipeline I will use the example task of generating prime numbers .
One way to find prime numbers is as follows .
Start with an empty list of primes , and the integer 2 .
Check if the integer is divisible by any of the numbers in the list of primes .
If yes , discard it .
If no , add it to the list .
Then try the next integer ( i.e. add one ) , and continue indefinitely .
A very simple , if inefficient algorithm .
( This is not the Sieve of Eratosthenes — see this paper . )
Let ’s see how we can turn this algorithm into a CHP program .
Every time we find a prime , we want to add it to our list of numbers to filter out in future .
We can implement this list as a concurrent process pipeline — each process in the pipeline will be responsible for filtering out numbers divisible by a single prime .
Such a process is quite straightforward :
filterDiv :: Integer -> Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) filterDiv n input output = forever $ do x <- readChannel input when ( x `mod` n /= 0 ) $ writeChannel output x
Every time we find a prime , we need to add a new filter Div process on to the end of our pipeline .
This may sound difficult , but can be easily expressed with some concurrent recursion :
end :: Chanin Integer -> Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) end input output = do x <- readChannel input writeChannel output x ( filterDiv x |->| end ) input output
This process sits at the end of our pipeline and reads in a single value .
Since our pipeline is filtering out all non-primes , any number that this “ end ” process receives must be prime .
In response to receiving a prime , it sends it on ( to whatever process is waiting beyond the prime pipeline to receive the primes ) .
It then becomes the parallel composition of a new filterDiv process , connected to a new end process ( the |->| operator expresses this composition ) .
Thus every time a new prime comes out of the end of the pipeline , the pipeline grows by one more process .
After the 100th prime , the pipeline will consist of 100 filterDiv processes executing concurrently , and one “ end ” process .
To complete our pipeline , we need a process at the beginning of the pipeline , supplying an ever - increasing stream of numbers on its output channel , starting at 2 :
genStream :: Chanout Integer -> CHP () genStream output = mapM_ ( writeChannel output ) [ 2.. ]
We can now write a primes process that generates a list of prime numbers .
Using another helpful operator from the CHP library , this is easy :
primes :: Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) primes = genStream ->|
end
Observe that there is no mention of filterDiv .
The pipeline starts out with the stream generator and an end process .
All the filterDiv processes are added once the primes start coming out of the pipeline , beginning with 2 , as shown in the diagram below :
Note also that the interface of primes is simply Chanout Integer -> CHP ( ) ; all the internal details of the expanding concurrent pipeline are hidden from the outside , leaving only an opaque box :
To make a complete program , we can compose this in parallel with a process responsible for printing the primes :
main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do c <- oneToOneChannel primes ( writer c ) < ||> ( forever $ readChannel ( reader c ) >>= ( liftIO . putStrLn . show ) )
The expanding pipeline is not restricted to conceptual examples such as generating the primes , and the powerful idea of a process becoming the parallel composition of sub - processes is not restricted to pipelines — two things that I hope to explore in future .
JUST wanted to throw in my two cents on this cash - for - clunkers business as I seem to be at odds with my fellow bloggers .
It 's a ludicrous waste of taxpayer money wrapped in offensively cynical packaging .
If you want to save the environment and / or reduce America 's dependence on foreign oil there are about a million things you can do before you resort to a $ 3 billion boondoggle .
You can sit around and fiddle with the numbers so it sounds like we 're going to eventually save petrol , but of course the proponents of the programme do n't try to puzzle out how much we 'd save if we just raised the petrol tax like a normal country .
Because of course the point is n't to help the environment , the point is to help the car dealers .
So why can't we just say that ?
Is our sense of entitlement so swollen that we not only think we deserve handouts at every turn but we need to be praised for taking them ?
I 'm with the cranky commenters who find the whole thing grotesque .
One of the regular D.J. ’s , Ipek Ipekcioglu , 35 , said she got her start rather suddenly , when one of the founders of SO36 walked up to her and said : “ You ’re Turkish , right ?
You ’re lesbian , right ?
Bring your cassettes and D.J. ”

Ms. Ipekcioglu spins everything from Turkish and Arabic music , to Greek , Balkan and Indian , a style she calls Eklektik BerlinIstan .
She has been a full - time professional D.J. for six years and performs all over the world .
The space is decorated with bright yellow wall hangings depicting elephants , camels and even a flying carpet , with an intentional degree of kitsch , Ms. Souad said , and an intentional distance from anything Islamic .
“ We take care that religion is not mixed in here , not in the music either . ”
Outside the boom of loud firecrackers can be heard , the first test rounds for the annual cacophony here that leaves New Year ’s revelers ears ’ ringing .
Kreuzberg has been home for decades to large populations of Turks and Kurds , many of whom have very conservative religious values .
Yet they have had to share the neighborhood that formerly abutted the Berlin Wall with many counterculture types , artists and anarchists and also gays and lesbians .
According to the city ’s Schwules Museum , partly devoted to the history of gay people in the city and the country , “ a lively homosexual subculture had developed in Berlin by the second half of the 18th century or perhaps earlier . ”
It was known as an oasis for gay men and lesbians in the Weimar period immortalized by the writer Christopher Isherwood and in the period when West Berlin was surrounded by the wall .
Today , the city has an openly gay and highly popular mayor , Klaus Wowereit .
But gay men and lesbians from Muslim families say they face extraordinary discrimination at home .
A survey of roughly 1,000 young men and women in Berlin , released in September and widely cited in the German press , found much higher levels of homophobia among Turkish youth .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senator Max Baucus unveiled his plan for a 10 - year , $ 856 billion healthcare overhaul on Wednesday that would revamp insurance rules but does not include a government - run option backed by liberal Democrats .
Baucus , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , made the bill public after months of negotiations that alienated some of his fellow Democrats and attracted no Republican supporters .
Many elements of the plan were released last week and closely mirror President Barack Obama ’s proposals to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system , his top domestic priority .
“ The cost of America ’s broken healthcare system has stretched families , businesses and the economy too far for too long .
For too many , quality , affordable healthcare is simply out of reach , ” Baucus said in an introduction to the bill , which the committee will vote on next week .
The Baucus proposal does not include a controversial government - run “ public ” insurance option but calls for the creation of non-profit cooperatives to create competition in the insurance market and reduce costs .
The plan requires all U.S. citizens and legal residents to obtain health insurance and provides subsidies on a sliding scale to help people purchase coverage .
Some 46 million people in the United States -- nearly a sixth of the population -- now have no health insurance .
Under the Baucus plan , insurance companies could no longer deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and would be barred from offering limited - benefit plans or placing lifetime limits on coverage .
The proposal also would create state - based exchanges where individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance .
The bill does not require employers to offer health insurance , but companies with 50 or more full - time workers would pay a fee for employees who obtain policies subsidized by federal tax credits .
FEE ON INSURERS
The proposal also requires that health insurance providers collectively pay an annual fee of $ 6 billion starting in 2010 , with other health companies making smaller collective payments to help fund the reforms in the bill .
Opinion polls show Americans are split over Obama ’s plans , which he says are designed to rein in costs , improve healthcare , regulate insurers to protect consumers and expand coverage to the uninsured .

Baucus led months of talks among the so - called “ Gang of Six ” negotiators -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- in hopes of winning Republican support .
But none of the three Republicans -- Charles Grassley , Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe -- has endorsed the proposals so far .
The panel will be the last of five congressional committees to take up a healthcare bill before each chamber takes its initial votes on the overhaul .
With congressional elections scheduled in 2010 , Obama has urged Congress to complete work on the plan by the end of this year .
Some Democrats have complained about the concessions made to Republicans , particularly reductions in the scope and elimination of the public option .
Critics of the option say it would hurt insurance companies and give government too big a role .
Despite his support for a government - run insurance option , Obama has signaled it is not an essential element of any ultimate healthcare overhaul .
Senate Finance Committee member John Rockefeller , a Democrat and a strong backer of a public option , says he will not support the panel ’s healthcare bill without significant changes .
Aliasing Artifacts
One day , while playing with a program to render Voronoi diagrams , I accidentally requested the Voronoi diagram of a black point and a white point , both at the origin .
Imagine my surprise when my program produced the image above .
Eventually I realized what was happening .
For every point in the plane , my program was computing the distance from that point to one of the generators at the origin .
This number was computed inside the FPU as an 80 - bit floating point number , and then rounded to a 64 - bit double precision number in order to store it in main memory .
This value was then transfered back into the FPU for comparison against the distance to the second generator , also stored as an 80 - bit float .
In other words , the choice of black or white in the image above is made based on the rounding behaviour of the low - order bits of the squared Euclidean magnitude of pixel centres .
The result is a strange , brittle view of the internal logic of the X86 FPU .
These pictures turn out to be closely related to aliasing patterns .
The image above is made up of concentric rings , each containing an approximate view of the function sin( x2 + y2 ) , sampled at different rates .
That function , sometimes called the zone plate function , is a standard test function for sampling and reconstruction algorithms , and has arisen many times in graphics and vision .
I first saw this behaviour on x86 machines around 2000 .
It 's very unpredictable , depending for example on GCC 's optimization settings .
There is a long - standing debate on whether this is a bug in GCC or merely an aspect of floating - point computation that programmers ought to be aware of .
The controversy tends to flow back to GCC bug 323 .
I dimly recall filing that bug , but perhaps my memory is faulty .
I 'm not listed as the reporter , so either I 'm wrong or someone else filed it on my behalf .
Images from the paper are presented here .
They are not offered in thumbnail form , since the process of resampling them to create thumbnails would destroy all the information in the images .

LOS ANGELES  The Walt Disney Company , with the help of Steven P. Jobs and his retailing team at Apple , intends to drastically overhaul its approach to the shopping mall .
At a time when many retailers are still cutting back or approaching strategic shifts with extreme caution , Disney is going the other way , getting more aggressive and putting into motion an expensive and ambitious floor - to - ceiling reboot of its 340 stores in the United States and Europe  as well as opening new ones , including a potential flagship in Times Square .
Disney Stores , which the media giant is considering rebranding Imagination Park , will become more akin to cozy entertainment hubs .
The chain ’s traditional approach of displaying row after row of toys and apparel geared to Disney franchises will be given a high - tech makeover and incorporated into a new array of recreational activities .
The goal is to make children clamor to visit the stores and stay longer , perhaps bolstering sales as a result .
Over the next five years , analysts estimate that Disney will spend about $ 1 million a store to redecorate , reorganize and install interactive technology .
“ The world does not need another place to sell Disney merchandise  this only works if it ’s an experience , ” said Jim Fielding , president of Disney Stores Worldwide .
The company plans to unveil the new look in May in Southern California , Long Island and Madrid , and is close to signing a lease for that Times Square flagship .

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Monday reassured the Chinese government that its huge holdings of dollar assets are safe and reaffirmed his faith in a strong U.S. currency .
A major goal of Geithner ’s maiden visit to China as Treasury chief is to allay concerns that Washington ’s bulging budget deficit and ultra-loose monetary policy will fan inflation , undermining both the dollar and U.S. bonds .
China is the biggest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury bonds .
U.S. data shows that it held $ 768 billion in Treasuries as of March , but some analysts believe China ’s total U.S. dollar - denominated investments could be twice as high .
“ Chinese assets are very safe , ” Geithner said in response to a question after a speech at Peking University , where he studied Chinese as a student in the 1980s .
His answer drew loud laughter from his student audience , reflecting skepticism in China about the wisdom of a developing country accumulating a vast stockpile of foreign reserves instead of spending the money to raise living standards at home . >>>

On 10 September Hungary 's foreign minister appeared on television to announce that from midnight , thousands of East Germans who had taken refuge in the country were free to leave for the West .
At one temporary camp in Budapest , people cheered and broke down in tears .
A few left immediately in cars for the Austrian border , blaring their horns .
Others departed for the train station .
The decision came in the face of stiff East German opposition .
It represented the first break with the convention among Warsaw Pact states of preventing each others ' citizens from reaching the West .
Many of the East Germans were ostensibly on holiday in Hungary , having arrived on tourist visas .
An estimated 7,000 refugees , including some who had taken refuge in the West German embassy in Budapest , had declared themselves ready to travel to the West .
Hungary 's decision was a momentous one .
For the first time , a Communist government declared that international covenants on human rights were more important than treaties with other Warsaw Pact nations .
Thomas Paine Reprimands Clergyman Mason
TO JOHN MASON , ONE OF THE MINISTERS OF THE SCOTCH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF NEW YORK , WITH REMARKS ON HIS ACCOUNT OF THE VISIT HE MADE TO THE LATE GENERAL HAMILTON
" Come now , let us REASON together saith the Lord . "
This is one of the passages you quoted from your Bible , in your conversation with General Hamilton [ 1 ] , as given in your letter , signed with your name , and published in the Commercial Advertiser , and other New York papers , and I requote the passage to show that your text and your religion contradict each other .
It is impossible to reason upon things not comprehensible by reason ; and therefore , if you keep to your text , which priests seldom do , ( for they are generally either above it , or below it , or forget it , ) you must admit a religion to which reason can apply , and this certainly is not the Christian religion .
There is not an article in the Christian religion that is cognizable by reason .
The Deistical article of your religion , the belief of a God , is no more a Christian article than it is a Mahometan article .
It is an universal article , common to all religions , and which is held in greater purity by Turks than by Christians ; but the Deistical church is the only one which holds it in real purity ; because that church acknowledges no co-partnership with God .
It believes in Him solely ; and knows nothing of sons , married virgins , nor ghosts .
It holds all these things to be the fables of priestcraft .
Why then do you talk of reason , or refer to it , since your religion has nothing to do with reason , nor reason with that ?
You tell people as you told Hamilton , that they must have faith !
Faith in what ?
You ought to know that before the mind can have faith in anything , it must either know it as a fact , or see cause to believe it on the probability of that kind of evidence that is cognizable by reason .
But your religion is not within either of these cases ; for , in the first place , you cannot prove it to be fact ; and in the second place , you cannot support it by reason , not only because it is not cognizable by reason , but because it is contrary to reason .
What reason can there be in supposing , or believing that God put Himself to death to satisfy Himself , and be revenged on the Devil on account of Adam ?
For , tell the story which way you will it comes to this at last .
As you can make no appeal to reason in support of an unreasonable religion , you then ( and others of your profession ) bring yourselves off by telling people they must not believe in reason but in revelation .
This is the artifice of habit without reflection .
It is putting words in the place of things ; for do you not see that when you tell people to believe in revelation , you must first prove that what you call revelation , is revelation ; and as you cannot do this , you put the word , which is easily spoken , in the place of the thing you cannot prove .
You have no more evidence that your Gospel is revelation than the Turks have that their Koran is revelation , and the only difference between them and you is , that they preach their delusion and you preach yours .
In your conversation with General Hamilton , you say to him , " The simple truths of the Gospel which require no abstruse investigation , but faith in the veracity of God who cannot lie , are best suited to your present condition . "
If those matters you call " simple truths " are what you call them , and require no abstruse investigation , they would be so obvious that reason would easily comprehend them ; yet the doctrine you preach at other times is , that the mysteries of the Gospel are beyond the reach of reason .
If your first position be true , that they are simple truths , priests are unnecessary , for we do not want preachers to tell us the sun shines ; and if your second be true , the case , as to effect , is the same , for it is waste of money to pay a man to explain unexplainable things , and loss of time to listen to him .
That God cannot lie , is no advantage to your argument , because it is no proof that priests cannot , or , that the Bible does not .
Did not Paul lie when he told the Thessalonians that the general resurrection of the dead would be in his life - time , and that he should go up alive along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ?
I Thes. iv. 17 .
You spoke of what you call , " the precious blood of Christ . "
This savage style of language belongs to the priests of the Christian religion .
The professors of this religion say they are shocked at the accounts of human sacrifices of which they read in the histories of some countries .
Do they not see that their own religion is founded on a human sacrifice , the blood of man , of which their priests talk like so many butchers ?
It is no wonder the Christian religion has been so bloody in its effects , for it began in blood , and many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on the altar of the Christian religion .
It is necessary to the character of a religion , as being true , and immutable as God Himself is , that the evidence of it be equally the same through all periods of time and circumstance .
This is not the case with the Christian religion , nor with that of the Jews that preceded it , ( for there was a time and that within the knowledge of history , when these religions did not exist , ) nor is it the case with any religion we know of but the religion of Deism .
In this the evidences are eternal and universal .
" The heavens declare the glory of God , and the firmament showeth His handiwork .
Day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto nigh showeth knowledge . " [ 2 ]
But all other religions are made to arise from some local circumstance , and are introduced by some temporary trifle which its partisans call a miracle , but of which there is no proof but the story of it .
The Jewish religion , according to the history of it , began in a wilderness , and the Christian religion in a stable .
The Jewish books tell us of wonders exhibited upon Mount Sinai .
It happened that nobody lived there to contradict the account .
The Christian books tell us of a star that hung over the stable at the birth of Jesus .
There is no star there now , nor any person living that saw it .
But all the stars in the heavens bear eternal evidence to the truth of Deism .
It did not begin in a stable , nor in a wilderness .
It began everywhere .
The theater of the universe is the place of its birth .
As adoration paid to any being but GOD Himself is idolatry : the Christian religion by paying adoration to a man , born of a woman called Mary , belongs to the idolatrous class of religions ; consequently the consolation drawn from it is delusion .
Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies , Dr. Moore of the Episcopal Church , you have , in order to make yourselves appear of some importance , reduced General Hamilton 's character to that of a feeble minded man , who in going out of the world wanted a passport from a priest .
Which of you was first or last applied to for this purpose is a matter of no consequence .
The man , Sir , who puts his trust and confidence in God , that leads a just and moral life , and endeavors to do good , does not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes , nor permit priests to trouble themselves about him .
They are in general mischievous beings where character is concerned ; a consultation of priests is worse than a consultation of physicians .

Why I will steal music
Dear Music Industry Executives ,
This is to explain why I will “ steal ” music using BitTorrent , eDonkey and any other easily available means .
I will not do it because I want to save money or because I ’m cheap .
Far from it .
My 600 - or - so CD collection packaged into boxes and stored in my basement should attest to it .
I ’ve been trying to pay for music online .
I really have .
I wanted to use the iTunes store , but it does n’t sell music or movies in my country .
I tried to register as a US customer , but a US - based credit card is required to do that .
I managed to buy several albums from Amazon MP3 right when it opened , before it told me my money was not welcome ( “ Please note that AmazonMP3.com is currently only available to US customers ” ) .
Hulu told me its video library can only be streamed from within the United States .
I own a Sonos system , so I tried to get a Rhapsody subscription .
But they did n’t want my money ( “ The Rhapsody MP3 Store is currently only available inside the United States ” ) .
Pandora did n’t want me either ( “ We are deeply , deeply sorry to say that due to licensing constraints , we can no longer allow access to Pandora for listeners located outside of the U.S. ” ) .
Spotify was a glimmer of hope ( it is n’t in the US ! ) , until it told me that “ Unfortunately , due to licensing restrictions we are not yet available in your country . ”
So , in spite of my best efforts over the past several years , I have been unable to pay for music online .
And frankly , I ’m tired of trying .
What difference does it make which country I ’m in ?
Is my credit card any different from any other one ?
Are my dollars / euros of lesser value ?
You have been playing your silly regional games and you think you can keep playing them forever .
Make these people wait .
Release the album here , see if it gets traction , then price it higher there .
Regionalize DVDs to control releases and pricing .
Well , the game is over .
From now on , I will have no qualms about downloading digital music .
I will continue to buy from sources that want my money ( Magnatune , artists like Ronald Jenkees ) .
For everything else , I will just download it .
It only takes a couple of minutes anyway .
So , next time you wonder about why your sales and profits are declining , remember — it ’s because you did n’t want my money .
And perhaps instead of complaining about P2P , hiring hordes of lawyers or buying expensive ad campaigns it is easier to simply start SELLING your stuff to people who want to pay for it .
Eight years after the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington , Americans believe that Muslims face more discrimination than any other religious group in the US .
Fifty - eight percent say Muslims face " a lot " of discrimination , according to an annual survey of religious attitudes by the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life and the Pew Center for People and the Press , released Wednesday .
The groups surveyed 4,013 adults nationwide in August .
This is the first year it asked about perceived discrimination of religious and social groups .
Sixty - four percent of respondents said gays and lesbians face discrimination ; 35 percent believe Jews do and 27 percent believe evangelical Christians face discrimination .
The survey sample composition means the majority of respondents – and of those who perceive discrimination against Muslims – are Christian .
It 's a finding that suggests Americans are tolerant pluralists , but Greg Smith , a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , says the full picture is more complicated .
In the same poll , he notes , two - thirds of people indicated that they see Islam and their own beliefs as quite different .
This bothers Kareem Shora , national executive director of the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee ( ADC ) .
" It tells me that there 's still that mentality out there ... [ an ] 'us versus them ' approach . "
Meanwhile , he says , " the religion itself is established on the Judeo - Christian tradition .
The Virgin Mary is actually mentioned more often in the Koran than she is in the New Testament . "
Negative perceptions persist
The Pew survey also showed that 38 percent of Americans believe Islam encourages violence more than other religions , compared with 45 percent who do n't .
That 's down from two years ago but still higher than it was in 2002 , when 25 percent of Americans held this view .
This data suggests what ADC research has also found :
That negative perceptions of Muslims did n't harden in the wake of September 11 , but some time after .
In fact , observers say , there was an outpouring of concern for Muslim - Americans in the months following the attacks .
" As ugly as some people got with hate crimes ... a lot of other people reached out to their neighbors and their friends and stood up for them , " says Alia Malek , author of the forthcoming " A Country Called Amreeka : Arab Stories , American Roots . "
Ms. Malek , who was an attorney with the Department of Justice on 9/11 , says the government initially reached out to Arab - Americans and Muslims .
" That soured pretty fast , " she says , with new policies including regulations requiring men from 25 Arab countries to register with the US government , regardless of immigration status , wiretapping telephone lines and ' voluntary ' interviews with Federal Bureau of Investigation officials at Arab - American homes .
Some of these came with the Patriot Act of 2002 , while others were implemented as early as November 2001 .
When views hardened
Public perception of Muslims turned negative as these policies grew , says Anny Balakian , author of " Backlash 9/11 : Middle Eastern and Muslim Americans Respond . "
The idea that Muslims " do n't belong here " pre-dates 9/11 , Ms. Balakian says .
" The problem is that the government initiatives were really lethal . "
Linda Sarsour , director of the Arab American Association of New York , agrees .
" If you have raids in your mosques and it 's located in a community that 's very diverse – these do n't help your neighbors who are non-Arab or non-Muslim see you as a community they can trust , feel safe around , or feel comfortable with . "
The image of violent Islam , in particular , is fed by current events in the media , says Ms. Sarsour .
" You have the war in Afghanistan , you have Pakistan , you have this war in Iraq and all these American soldiers are dying – and then you have the Palestinian - Israeli conflict , " she notes .
" These are what people think about think about when they think of the Muslim world . "
' Muslim ' and ' Arab ' may be interchangeable in the minds of many Americans – despite the fact that , as Malek points out , many Arabs in the US are Christian while the majority of Muslims here are African - Americans .
How Muslims feel
While Pew 's new study found nearly 6 in10 adults feel Muslims face discrimination in America , a 2007 poll of Muslims revealed that 1 in 4 Muslims has , in fact , experienced discrimination .
Even those who have n't may be affected by the stories of others ' discrimination .
" Depending on where you are in the US and what communities you 're trying to live with , you are being cautious and careful and trying to make sure you 're being a good citizen , " says Sarsour .
Talat Mangla , an accountant in Falls Church , Va. , denies feeling discriminated against as a Muslim , but her awareness of the possibility has , at times , influenced her thinking .
" I started wearing a head scarf in college , and I do n't think I 've ever felt discrimination overtly because of that , " says Ms. Mangla .
" More than anything , I felt more self - conscious about it . "
The recent Pew survey also found that Americans who know a Muslim , or who know the meaning of the words " Allah " or " Koran , " are less likely to hold unfavorable views .
Of course , says Mangla .
" You know how everyone loves their congressman but hates Congress ?
It 's almost the same for Muslims , " she says .
" People … might be afraid of Islam in totality , but when you think of Muslims you actually know and interact with , they do n't scare you .
They 're not radically different . "

Advertisement Peter Taylor should enjoy a place in history equal to that of his counterpart - so says the former Rams and Forest assistant manager 's family .
Two decades after Taylor 's death , his family says his name is almost always overshadowed by Brian Clough's .
Clough and Taylor made Derby County champions of England and Nottingham Forest champions of Europe in the '70s .
But despite numerous tributes to Clough there is yet to be any lasting monument to Taylor .
" I do feel that somehow my father 's contribution has been written out of the history - particularly of Nottingham Forest , " says Taylor 's daughter , Wendy Dickinson .
" He 's been taken out of the picture . "
Taylor started his career at Nottingham Forest where he was signed as a goalkeeper - though he never made a first team appearance .
Despite working briefly together as players at Middlesbrough , it was n't until 1965 that the Clough - Taylor managerial partnership was formed at Hartlepool , with Taylor becoming Clough 's assistant .
Wendy Dickinson says Forest 's recognition of her father is ' disgraceful '
Their success at the northern club led them to be offered the top jobs at the Baseball Ground and , in 1969 , the pair took the struggling Derby County to the top of Division Two .
While Clough was always acknowledged to be the inspiration and driving force behind the team , Taylor was famed for his scouting prowess - his ability to find the right man for the job on the field .
The cameras nearly always focussed on Clough but , at Derby , the pair were paid the same .
Taylor acknowledged that the attention would always fall on Clough : Clough always admitted he could n't operate without Taylor .
The signing of some of Derby 's greatest names came in the Clough - Taylor era : Roy McFarland , John O'Hare , Alan Hinton , John McGovern , Willie Carlin , Dave Mackay , Colin Todd , Archie Gemmill - and the partnership 's crowning glory at Derby was to lead the team to Division One champions in 1972 and to the European Cup semi-finals .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
A dispute with the Rams chairman Sam Longson forced the pair to resign early in the 1973 - 74 season and the partnership broke up .
The two re-united in 1976 at Nottingham Forest and their success was spectacular .
Within 12 months Forest were promoted to the First Division and went on to win the Championship in their first season there .
They also won both the League Cup and the European Cup twice .
But it is the lack of any tribute from Nottingham Forest that has upset the Taylor family most .
His daughter Wendy recalls : " Forest did n't have a minute 's silence for him and that was deeply , deeply wounding and , I think , for the fans as well .
Clough and Taylor won the league championship with Derby in 1972
Rams to honour Clough and Taylor " I think Brian deserved all the praise that he had and I do n't blame him for what has happened .
" The reason the name Nottingham Forest is known around the world in footballing circles is because of the very special six years that Brian and my dad worked together . "
But it is hoped that a statue of Taylor and Clough will be in place at Pride Park by the start of the 2010 - 11 season and at least the family can console themselves that the two will be recognised in equal measure :
" It is really nice that Derby County , both the fans and the club , have decided to recognise the contribution of both of them . "

“ Mr. Wilson is a brilliant attorney who works very hard for his clients .
He is informed , honest , and a very compassionate individual .
From my very first interview with Mr. Wilson
I knew he was an attorney who would indeed deliver .
Mr. Wilson always made sure I understood every aspect of my case , from the possible outcomes to the overall process .
From the very beginning , Mr. Wilson kept me informed of options to take as well as the possible consequences thereof .
His knowledge reaches far and is very diverse to say the least ; there was never a turn that he did not anticipate .
Mr. Wilson always answered all my questions knowledgeably and he always answered phone calls and emails immediately .
Mr. Wilson brought my lawsuit to a very satisfying end and he was a blessing to my case . ”
Ex -Nazi goes on trial in Germany
Heinrich Boere was 18 when he joined the notorious Waffen SS A former member of the Nazi SS has gone on trial in Germany charged with the wartime murder of three civilians in the Netherlands .
Heinrich Boere , 88 , has previously acknowledged shooting dead three people in 1944 , as reprisals for attacks by the Dutch resistance .
The trial went ahead after an appeal court ruled he was fit to be tried .
However , the hearing was adjourned when the five - judge panel said it needed time to consider more legal argument .
The trial is due to resume on Monday , court officials said .
Anti-Nazi protesters had gathered outside the court in Aachen as the trial opened .
Relatives of some of the victims were also in court .
Correspondents said Heinrich
Boere entered the courtroom in a wheelchair with a doctor by his side , but appeared alert and attentive as he answered questions .
The hearing was adjourned shortly afterwards .
The defendent is charged with killing three men : Fritz Bicknese , a chemist and father of 12 ; bicycle seller Teun de Groot , who helped Jews go into hiding ; and resistance member Frans Kusters .
He admitted the killings to Dutch authorities while in captivity after the war , but escaped before he could be brought to trial .
He later fled to Germany .
' Killing terrorists '
He has also confessed to his role in interviews with the media .
" Yes , I got rid of them , " he told Focus magazine .
" It was not difficult .
You just had to bend a finger . "
He told Spiegel magazine that he and his accomplices thought they were killing " terrorists " , adding : " We thought we were doing the right thing . "
Anti-Nazi protesters displayed banners outside the court A tribunal in Amsterdam sentenced him to death in absentia in 1949 , a sentence later reduced to life in prison .
A Dutch extradition request was turned down by Germany in the early 1980s .
He was eventually indicted in Germany last year , but a court in Aachen then said he was unfit to stand trial due to health problems .
That ruling was reversed in July by an appeals court in Cologne .
Boere , who is of Dutch - German origin , was 18 when he joined the SS in 1940 , shortly after the Germans overran his hometown of Maastricht .
After fighting on the Russian front , he went to Holland as part of an SS death squad codenamed Silbertanne ( Silver Pine ) .
His statements to Dutch authorities are expected to form the basis for the prosecution 's case , the Associated Press news agency reports .
Defence lawyers have declined to say how they will try to counter the confession .
But even if he is convicted there remains some doubt over whether he will actually go to jail .
A 90 - year - old former German infantry commander , Josef Scheungraber , was given a life sentence by a German court in August , but remains free while his appeal is heard .

SUPERMAN had X - ray vision , which was useful for looking through walls when rescuing heroines and collaring villains .
But beyond Hollywood , the best that engineers have been able to come up with to see inside buildings are devices that use radar .
Some are portable enough to be placed against an outside wall by , say , a police unit planning a raid — and sophisticated enough to show , with reasonable accuracy , the location of anyone inside .
But the best models cost more than $ 100,000 , so they are not widely deployed .
Now a team led by Neal Patwari and Joey Wilson of the University of Utah has come up with a way to peer through the walls of a building using a network of little radios that cost only a few dollars each .
Radar works by recording radio waves that have been reflected from the object under observation .
Dr Patwari's and Mr Wilson 's insight was to look not for reflections but for shadows .
Their device broadcasts a radio signal through a building and , when that signal comes out the other side , monitors variations in its strength .
The need for variation means the system cannot see things that are stationary .
When the signal is temporarily blocked by a moving object such as a person , however , it shows up loud and clear .
Using a network of small transmitters and receivers , the researchers have found it is possible to plot a person 's position quite accurately and display it on the screen of a laptop .
They call the process radio tomographic imaging , because constructing an image by measuring the strengths of radio signals along several pathways is similar to the computerised tomographic body - scanning used by hospitals — though medical machines employ X - rays , not radio waves , to do the scanning .
The radios used by Dr Patwari and Mr Wilson are low - cost types designed for use in what are known as ZigBee networks .
In that application they transmit data between devices such as thermostats , fire detectors and some automated factory equipment .
They are not even as powerful as the radios used in Wi-Fi networks to link computers together .
Small and inexpensive as these ZigBee radios are , though , there is strength in their numbers .
Each is in contact with all of the others .
A building under examination is thus penetrated by a dense web of links .
In one experiment , for example , a network of 34 radios was able to keep track of Mr Wilson 's position with an accuracy of less than a metre — a figure that Dr Patwari and Mr Wilson think could be improved greatly by using specially designed radios instead of off - the - shelf ones .
Moreover , putting radios on the roof of a building as well as around its walls should make it possible to produce three - dimensional views of what is going on inside .
The ability to “ see ” people moving around in a building with such a cheap system has many plausible applications , and Mr Wilson has set up a company called Xandem to commercialise the idea .
Besides military , police and private - security uses , radio networks might be employed to locate people trapped by fire or earthquake .
More commercially , they might be used to measure what retailers call “ footfall ” — recording how people use stores and shopping centres .
At the moment , this is done with cameras , or by triangulating the position of signals given off by mobile phones that customers are carrying .
Radio tomography could be simpler , more accurate and , some might feel , less intrusive .
Certainly less so than a man in tights with X - ray eyes .

The company thanked passengers for their patience
Passengers bound for Newcastle Airport were delayed in Spain while their plane was partially dismantled when a mobile phone fell into an air vent .
The Jet2 flight had just landed at Murcia when a traveller dropped the phone , which slid out of sight .
As it had been turned on , airline bosses refused to allow the plane to take off until it was located .
Holidaymakers were delayed for three hours while the cockpit area and front row of seats were taken apart .
A spokesman for Jet2.com thanked the passengers for their patience during the incident on Sunday .
He said : " We always operate to the highest standards of safety and care and whilst it was no doubt inconvenient that people had to wait for us to retrieve the phone , any mobile or similar communications device that is switched on would need to be removed from the aircraft in order to ensure maximum safety for our passengers .
" We would like to remind all those travelling by air not to switch their phones on until they reach the airport terminal . "
The government has just announced that there is a 48 hour extension on submissions to the copyright consultation .
While the discussion forum has closed , Canadians now have until Tuesday night to submit their views on copyright .
If you missed last night 's deadline , there is still time to craft your own submission , use a form letter , or send out a quick email .
There were many new submissions of note posted online over the weekend .
They include :
An op -ed in The Mark from Queen 's University Principal and Vice - Chancellor Daniel Woolf is also a must - read .
Woolf focuses on four key issues :
1. Digital locks , though they may be used to stop piracy , must not impede users ’ rights .
2 . Fair dealing ought to be clarified and amplified .
3 . Specialized exceptions ought to be used sparingly because they likely would n’t be able to keep up with technological change or accommodate a range of reasonable educational practices .
4. Licensing mechanisms must not be seen as a substitute for users ’ rights .
The absence of an educational exemption for the Internet – as advocated by the AUCC – suggests that more of the educational community is ( rightly ) shifting toward fair dealing and DRM as the critical issues .
As a gamer , I play a lot of video games .
In playing a lot of video games , I also die a lot .
I mean all the freaking time .
I think I " fell down " in Call of Duty : World at War at least 20 times last night before finally realizing that I should probably pick my shots better .
In most games , that 's what you do - you fall down and die .
In the spirit of Halloween , I 've compiled a short list of some of the most creative and memorable deaths that I 've experienced playing video games .
I 'm talking about your character dying , not the enemy .
I 've left out the gory and the insane , but I 'm pretty sure you 'll mention them in the comments .
Instead I 'd like to think this list will make us all realize that we are all in fact mortal , and we do n't have a restart button .
Though some of us may , and I 'll see all of you at " The Quickening . "
10 : Sub -Zero's Winter Wonderland .
I know this is the first one that popped in your little gamer heads .
Mortal Kombat featured a multitude of great finishing moves that could only be pulled off with extreme finger dexterity , the most popular being Sub - Zero 's ripping out of the spine .
However , my favorite was Sub - Zero simply making a snowman .
You had lost , and instead of brutally killing you , your opponent makes a snowman - adding insult to injury .
9 : Pac -Man is an Antacid .
One of the most classic video game deaths comes from the old standard , Pac - Man .
When touched by a ghost , our pizza pie shaped hero rolls onto his back , dislocates his giant jaw and dissolves into nothingness .
This was quite creative considering that most video game deaths at this time just appeared as if the character was frozen , then it would restart .
Do n't forget about the iconic sound he makes while dying .
If you had another quarter , you could easily summon him back from the black hole of video game death .
8 : Getting Your Lights Punched Out .
The best boxing game out there , Fight Night ( rounds 3 or 4 ) provides one of the most realistic beat downs ever in a video game .
When you get knocked down , the camera pans out a little and the screen emulates what your vision would be like if you just got punched in the face one too many times .
Sometimes you just stagger and fall , other times you go down hard .
It all depends on the type of punch you just took to put you down .
It hurts my jaw just to think about it .
7. Having a Bad Fur Day .
No one can deny that Conkers Bad Fur Day was a strange little game .
You are a binge drinking squirrel prone to violence , not to mention full of poop jokes .
In the multiplayer player vs. player mode if you play as the evil Tediz character and happen to get sliced in half by a samurai sword your body slides apart leaking ... stuffing .
No guts , no teddy blood , stuffing .
It 's the cutest death scene I 've ever seen in a game .
6 . It Sucks Being the Little Guy .
In the classic game Duke Nukem 3D , one of the many power - ups in the game was one that made you shrink so you could walk underneath an obstacle .
There was one side effect to being tiny though , you could get stepped on by enemy .
Or if you did n't make it all the way through the obstacle , you would re-size and find out what would have happened if R2 - D2 had n't turned off the trash compactor .
Squishy .
5. No Mercy Means Showing the Goods .
In the game Killer Instinct ( a clear Mortal Kombat clone ) you could play as some not so human characters .
Or you could play as B. Orchid .
The only female character in the game , one of her " No Mercy " finishing moves set the woman 's liberation movement back a couple steps .
Enter the right combo and she'd whip open her uniform to flash her breasts ( the breasts were not actually seen by the player ) and your character would have a heart attack at the sight and die .
Unless your character happened to be another B. Orchid , at which point you 'd stomp the ground in spite .
This was a great early example that video game programmers like boobs .
( See : Lara Croft & The Dead or Alive series for further proof . )
4. The Many Deaths of Dirk the Daring .
Dragon 's Lair , the only game I ever heard of that came out on Laserdisc featured the clumsy knight Dirk in his quest to save Princess Daphne from the lair of Singe the Dragon .
The damn game also cost $.50 at the arcade when all other games were $ .25 .
There were some really interesting ways to die in this game and is the first arcade game I remember that made dying in a video game and losing $.50 in a minute not that bad .
From falling ( a lot ) to drowing ( a lot ) to being burned ( a lot ) and electrocuted ( a lot ) Dirk found a way to muck up his quest and leave Daphne hanging .
Let us also not forget consumed by slime , beaten , stabbed and turned into stone .
3. Becoming Yoshi Excrement .
For years Yoshi was a slave to Mario 's whims .
Standing still when not needed and haplessly running off cliffs if not controlled .
With Super Smash Bros. , and specifically the Melee version , Yoshi took control .
His attacks were the strongest in the game and utilized all of his talents .
Like eating you and pooping out an egg .
While you would n't normally die from this move unless your health was way down , you would die if Yoshi ate you in mid-jump and pooped you off the side of a cliff .
Scrambled or sunny side up ?
2. Getting Tackled by the Ambulance .
While this death did n't happen to you , the player specifically , it still deserves mention because of the sheer hilarity .
In the 1992 release of Madden Football when a player was injured to the point of not being able to play , an ambulance would drive out onto the field - running over everyone in its path .
Not just running them over , but knocking them off their feet and off the screen as well as routinely running over the injured player .
To this day , it has n't been confirmed if this was a bug or an intentional joke by the programmers .
1 : Almost Every Death in Space Quest I - III
How could I not mention Space Quest ?
While there have been six iterations of this fantastic adventure game over the years , none have matched the creativity and spunk of the first three games .
With the death scenes being unexpected and full of sarcasm and criticism of our bumbling hero Roger Wilco , it was hard to pick just one .
So I did n't .
Here 's a list of some of my favorites of the many deaths of Roger Wilco in Space Quest .
Death by Duke Nukem Robots .
" Better hang out at the gym more often . "
( SQ III )
Death by Conveyor Belt .
" Shredded like an Iran - Contra document , your many independent parts flutter to the bottom of the hopper . "
( SQ III )
Death by Going Too Far South .
" Get eaten by a giant snake . " ( SQ III )
Death by Pole Vaulting w/ Detonator .
" Did n't mom always tell you not to play with firecrackers ? "
( SQ III )
Death by metal sheet .
" It 's obvious that the metal sheet was sharper than you " ( SQ III )
Death by Mushroom .
" Holy geez , boy !
That mushroom thing sucked you clean up !
You can't move a muscle nor see a speck of light . "
( SQ II )
Death by Root Monster .
" The giant root - looking thing is giving you a guided tour of its digestive system . "
( SQ II )
Death by Orat .
" Orat has transformed you into a new piece of recreational equipment .
Along with finding this treatment extremely rude , you do n't survive it . "
( SQ I )
Death by Smelling Acid .
" That 's right .
You have no head .
That darn pool must be filled with acid .
You obviously can't go on living that way . "
( SQ I )
Death by Tasting Acid .
" That 's right .
You have no head .
That darn pool must be filled with acid .
You obviously can't go on living that way . "
( SQ I )
Death by Touching Acid .
" Sure , you 've died a few deaths before , but this one really burns you .
Planets are depending on you .
Seeing you do stuff like this is definitely making them nervous . "
( SQ I )
To wit , video game death does n't always have to be blood and gore .
It also does n't have to just be your character falling down , and as shown by the Fight Night example , you do n't even have to die .
What are some of your favorite death scenes in video games ?
Traders at hedge funds and Wall Street trading desks are quaking over the news that the FBI tapped the phone lines of Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam .
The news that the government is ( finally ) employing techniques typically used against organized crime or international drug cartels is raising fears about who might be next .
We spoke to traders at two prominent hedge funds who both described the feeling at their firms as “ panicked . ”
“ Suddenly you are wondering about every conversation you ’ve had about a public company , wondering if the Feds were listening in , ” one trader said .
Traders spend a lot of time exchanging information with colleagues and reaching out to people in the industries they cover in hopes of gaining an edge .
Rumors , gossip and loose talk are their bread and butter .
Most of this is fair game .
But if the ultimate source is an insider or the news is about a major deal that has yet to be announced , the trader can step into dangerous legal territory .
Even when traders learn inside information , there is usually little chance of getting caught .
The SEC watches unusual trading activity but an active trader will usually get a pass if he ’s buying or selling stocks that he usually trades in anyway .
Even those cases that do come up are hard to prosecute , especially if no one confesses .
So occasional civil cases are brought but almost no criminal cases emerge involving traders .
This case shattered that pattern because the government used the tools it uses against hardcore drug criminals and terrorists to uncover the alleged insider trading .
Traders are now living in a very different world .
Legally speaking , trading is far more dangerous than anyone knew .
“ I am under no illusions that everyone out there is following the rules , ” said Mr. Duncan , who runs his own dispensary in West Hollywood .
“ But just because you accept money to reimburse collectives does not mean you ’re making profits . ”
For marijuana advocates , Los Angeles represents a critical juncture  a symbol of the movement ’s greatest success , but also its vulnerability .
More than 300,000 doctors ’ referrals for medical cannabis are on file , the bulk of them from Los Angeles , according to Americans for Safe Access .
The movement has had a string of successes in the Legislature and at the ballot box .
In the city of Garden Grove , marijuana advocates forced the Highway Patrol to return six grams of marijuana it had confiscated from an eligible user .
About 40 cities and counties have medical marijuana ordinances .
But there have also been setbacks .
In June , a federal judge sentenced Charles C. Lynch , a dispensary owner north of Santa Barbara , to one year in prison for selling marijuana to a 17 - year - old boy whose father had testified that they sought out medical marijuana for his son ’s chronic pain .
The mayor and the chief of police testified on behalf of Mr. Lynch , who was released on bail pending appeal .
And last month , San Diego police officers and sheriff ’s deputies , along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration , raided 14 marijuana dispensaries and arrested 31 people .
In an interview , Bonnie Dumanis , the district attorney for San Diego County , said that state laws governing medical marijuana were unclear and that the city had not yet instituted new regulations .
Ms. Dumanis said that she approved of medical marijuana clubs where patients grow and use their own marijuana , but that none of the 60 or so dispensaries in the county operated that way .

“ These guys are drug dealers , ” she said of the 14 that were raided .
“ I said publicly , if anyone thinks we ’re casting too big a net and we get a legitimate patient or a lawful collective , then show us your taxes , your business license , your incorporation papers , your filings with the Department of Corporations . ”
For $ 2^10 - 1 , you put me under the needle .

México tiene un dolor sin resolver guardado en la memoria .
En enero de 1993 , en Ciudad Juárez , apenas unos metros al sur de Estados Unidos , fue encontrado el cadáver de una niña llamada Alma Chavira .
Fue la primera de una larga lista de niñas y de mujeres torturadas , violadas , asesinadas .
Otras muchas siguen sin aparecer .
No hay cifras exactas de la magnitud de la tragedia , pero lo que sí existe es la convicción compartida de que las autoridades de entonces no hicieron lo necesario por investigar aquellos crímenes .
Las muertas de Juárez permanecían como un dolor sordo en la memoria hasta que el presidente de México , Felipe Calderón , pronunció el lunes el nombre del nuevo procurador general de la República ( fiscal general del Estado ) .
Arturo Chávez Chávez es señalado directamente por las organizaciones de Derechos Humanos como uno de los responsables de que aquellas muertes sigan siendo un misterio y una vergüenza .
El nuevo procurador general de México minimizó hasta 1998 los ' feminicidios '
Más información México sube impuestos para tapar un agujero de 23.000 millones
Chávez Chávez fue de 1992 a 1994 subprocurador de Justicia de Chihuahua ( el Estado del que Ciudad Juárez es la ciudad más poblada ) .
De 1994 a 1996 fue delegado de la Procuraduría General de la República ( la PGR , el equivalente , aunque con más funciones , de la española Fiscalía General del Estado ) .
Y de 1996 a 1998 , procurador del Estado .
El caso es que aquellos seis años coincidieron con el hallazgo de los primeros cadáveres de mujeres .
Lejos de situarse junto a las familias , las autoridades de entonces - entre ellos Chávez Chávez - fueron acusadas por las asociaciones de víctimas de minimizar el problema y hasta de obstaculizar las investigaciones .
De hecho , en 1998 , la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos pidió al gobernador de Chihuahua que investigara a Chávez Chávez por " omisión o negligencia " .
No hubo contestación .
Lo más llamativo es que el nombramiento del nuevo procurador general de la República se produce sólo cinco días después de que el presidente Felipe Calderón , en su tercer informe de Gobierno , admitiera sin tapujos el divorcio entre los mexicanos y sus políticos .
" Los ciudadanos no están satisfechos " , admitió , " y perciben una enorme brecha entre sus intereses y los de los gobernantes " .
Chávez Chávez - cuyo nombramiento aún tendrá que ser ratificado por el Senado - llega para sustituir a Eduardo Medina Mora , quien ayer recibió el respaldo del Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) .
Manlio Fabio Beltrones , coordinador del PRI en el Senado y uno de los políticos más poderosos de México , calificó ayer de " lamentable " la salida de Medina Mora , de quien dijo que " su honestidad está a toda prueba " .
No es desde luego éste un detalle menor , teniendo en cuenta que la sospecha hacia los políticos que combaten al narcotráfico es moneda común .
El caso es que Medina Mora ha caído víctima de su disparidad de criterios con el presidente y , sobre todo , con el secretario de Seguridad Pública , Genaro García Luna , quien sale claramente fortalecido de la crisis de Gobierno .
Medina Mora tenía el pleno apoyo de la DEA ( la agencia antidroga norteamericana ) , pero cada vez menos apoyos en su propia casa .
Calderón decidió finalmente sustituirlo por un hombre , Chávez Chávez , que desde el primer momento se pondrá a la orden de García Luna , lo que equivale a decir que a partir de ahora la Policía Federal tendrá un mayor protagonismo en la lucha contra el narcotráfico en perjuicio de la fiscalía .
En su despedida , el hasta ahora procurador admitió que se marcha con " tristeza y dolor " .
La salida de Medina Mora fue acompañada de la destitución del secretario de Agricultura y Pesca y del responsable de Pemex ( la empresa estatal que gestiona los recursos petrolíferos de México ) .
Además , el presidente de México anunció ayer una serie de medidas - entre ellas , la eliminación de algunas secretarías - para hacer frente a la crisis económica .
Calderón anunció que su acción inmediata estará encaminada a combatir la pobreza extrema .
" Hay que cambiar " , dijo ayer , " porque ya no nos queda otra posibilidad .
Los recursos petroleros se han empezado a agotar y por eso tenemos que reformar el modelo económico .
Son tiempos difíciles , y antes de pedir esfuerzos a los mexicanos , lo primero que tiene que hacer el Gobierno es dar ejemplo .
Y lo primero que vamos a hacer es suprimir tres secretarías [ ministerios ] " .
Embedding C in Ruby or Rails applications is a way to fix performance bottle necks .
RubyInline made this easy for C .
The Ruby community is also tightly linked with various functional programming communities : Erlang , Caml , and Haskell .
Bridges already exist for Erlang with Erlectricity , and for Objective Caml with rocaml .
Apache 's
Thrift is another way to let Ruby communicate with other languages via RPC and a serialization format .
Mark Wotton wrote Hubris , a bridge which makes it possible to call Haskell code from Ruby .
You 'll need to install ghc which comes up with Haskell platform in order to be able to compile jhc ( John 's Haskell Compiler ) .
You should notice that jhc will only work under Linux or Mac .
Once you have the requirements , you 'll firstly write an Haskell file with some extra ccall exports where you define your function , ie Test.hs :
fibonacci :: Int ->
Int fibonacci n = fibs !!
n where fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+ ) fibs ( tail fibs )
You 'll then need to call jhc_builder .sh Test.hs in order to create the dynamic library ( libdynhs .so ) .
After this you can write your Ruby code and take advantage of the exported function by loading the dynamic library with Ruby / DL :
require ' dl / import ' module HaskyPants extend DL :: Importable dlload " ./libdynhs.so " extern " int fibonacci_hs ( int ) " end puts HaskyPants.fibonacci_hs ( 12 )

How did a doctor get toilet graffiti artists to clean up their act ?
In 1992 a professor named T Steuart Watson discovered a completely effective way to prevent people writing on public toilet walls .
Watson published a report in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis , describing both his method and the relentless manner in which he tested it .
Watson , then at Mississippi State University , is now a professor at Miami University of Ohio .
He carried out the experiment in three men's toilets .
Each chamber had a history writ large , and small , in many different hands .
The study says that " during the preceding months , each of the walls had been repainted numerous times due to the proliferation of graffiti " .
Each day , Watson and his minions meticulously counted how many marks were on each wall .
They tallied each letter , number , or piece of punctuation .
Other shapes called for special assessment .
The study describes one typically difficult example : " A drawing of a happy face was counted as five marks ( one for each eye , one for the nose , one for the mouth , and one for the circle depicting the head ) . "
The investigators employed professional stealth .
" During observations , " the report stipulates , " only one observer entered the restroom at a time , and if another person entered to use the facilities , the observer discontinued counting and waited until the bathroom was empty before resuming counting . "
New graffiti popped up every day , in every one of the restrooms .
But " after treatment was implemented " , Watson reveals , " no marking occurred on any of the walls , and they remained free of graffiti at a three - month follow - up " .
No marking at all .
None .
Not a jot .
Cleanliness uninterrupted .
This was complete , utter success .
The treatment was simple : " Taping a sign on the wall that read , ' A local licensed doctor has agreed to donate a set amount of money to the local chapter of the United Way [ a heavily publicised American charity organisation ] for each day this wall remains free of any writing , drawing , or other markings ' . "
" The doctor , " reveals the study , " was the author , a licensed psychologist , and the amount of money donated was 5 cents per day per bathroom . "
The study lasted 50 days .
Thus , with three restrooms in play , the maximum total potential payoff for charity was $ 2.50 ( £ 2.30 ) per restroom – an aggregate $ 7.50 if no one ever made a mark on any wall in any of them .
Why was the treatment so very – nay , completely – effective ?
Watson speculates that " prior to posting the signs , bare walls appeared to function as discriminative stimuli for graffiti , perhaps because it was not apparent that anyone cared .
Posting the signs was evidence that a prominent citizen ( a doctor ) was prepared to pay for results . "
" An alternative explanation , " he says , " is that the presence of the observers prompted restroom users to refrain from writing on walls . "

Filmmaker Michael Moore told CNN ’s Larry King that it ’s time for President Barack Obama to wind down the war in Afghanistan .
“ It ’s unwinnable .
It ’s immoral .
It ’s illegal .
It ’s wrong , ” he said .
“ We need to leave . ”
Moore appeared on the program Thursday along with another war critic , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .

“ It is my sincere hope that he decides to wind down and end this war , at least our part of this war , in Afghanistan , ” Moore said .
“ Initially , the idea of going and trying to capture the criminals who committed a mass murder on 9/11 , that was a good idea .
But we never did that .
“ There is no middle ground , ” he stated emphatically .
“ You ’re either going to go all out and fight a big war that ca n’t be won , or you ’re going to bring the troops home and focus on the problems that we have right now — huge unemployment , global warming , a health care mess , all these things , our educational system , everything . ”
Moved by Obama ’s attendance at the transfer of bodies at Dover Air Force Base , something President George W. Bush infamously did n’t do , Moore offered hope that Obama might end the war in Afghanistan .
” I ’m going to trust in all my heart that he ’s going to make the right decision , ” he opined .
Yet earlier this month a senior administration official told the press , “ What is not on the table , in any sense , is leaving Afghanistan or so narrowly defining our mission as to be the equivalent of leaving Afghanistan . ”
( After Moore ’s appearance , Rep. Paul told King , “ I do n’t think he ’s quite willing to criticize Obama like Bush , but I am . ” )
And although King did n’t comment , Moore hammered on the scandal of CIA involvement with the opium trade there .
“ Yesterday , Larry , that story in The New York Times about how the brother of the president of Afghanistan , the brother of Karzai , is suspected of being involved in the opium trade , which funds the Taliban , and our CIA pays this man .
So we ’re paying the guy who ’s helping to create the money that ’s funding the Taliban that ’s killing our soldiers .
Are we , like , an insane country ?
When is this going to stop ?
I want this ended .
I want these troops home . ”

Commenters ( and circumcised Americans ) over at Free Republic struck on a revelation yesterday : if Barack Obama has not been circumcised , then he must not have been born in the United States .
Why ?
Because all of their boys were circumcised .
The exchange is amusing :
hoosiermama :
The only other thing that hit me was that [ Larry ] Sinclair said BO was not circumcised .
When my son was born in a hospital that was done as a matter of routine without even consulting us .
Would the same be for Hawaii ?
OTOH
People born at home or in some other cultures are not circumcised .
thecodont :
A relative of mine was born ( in a hospital ) a couple of years after BO 's alleged birth date .
He was circumcised also ( as a matter of routine , not according to any family request ) .
afraidfortherepublic :
My son was born in June of 1961 in a hospital in CA , and the nurses released us because of miscommunication in a day and a half before the circumcision was done .
We had to go back to the doctor 's office to have it done a week later , and the doctor was NOT HAPPY .
My second son was born in the same hospital 4 years later .
I do n't remember them asking me about it .
Routine procedure for little boys .
hoosiermama :
Wish we had someone to make a phone call to the hospitols in HI and ask if they routinely do circumcism [ sic ] and when that practice started .
MHGinTN :
You might want to make that call to a Canadian hospital ...
MHGinTN :
No ... it would have been in Kenya .... not Canada .

What is perhaps most disturbing about the birthers discussing Obama 's penis is a deeper obsession with black male sexuality .
In Nancy Tuana 's book , Revealing Male Bodies , she talks about the historic origins of white male obsession with black male genitalia .
The Black male penis became so important in the racist hysteria at the end of the [ 19th ] century because penises are instruments of power .
... [ W.E.B. ]
Du Bois was right about the intimate connection between
White male control over women and racism .
As Black men and women were threatening the established social , political , and economic arrangements and thus deprive the traditional White leadership of their power , that threat was translated into genital terms because men— then and now — see the penis first of all as an instrument of power .
It gives them power over women , and in their comparisons of sexual performance and penile size , it gives them power over other men .
That Black men were — for a while — more than they were during slavery is beyond question .
Obama is the ultimate threat to traditional white male power , a black man who has risen to the highest position in government .
He has gone through a number of racial stereotypes , from the " magic Negro " to Felix the Cat .
It seems like it was only a matter of time before the racial stereotypes surrounding black male sexuality would emerge .
The root of this movement is increasingly showing itself to be rooted in white insecurities .
The Freepers may have also been inspired by actual news .
U.S. officials are currently considering making circumcision routine as a potential means of preventing HIV / AIDS ( Medicaid does n't currently cover circumcision ) .
They have been examining studies in Africa that show circumcised heterosexual men have lower HIV infection rates , but these studies do n't cross over to men who have sex with men .
Gay men tend to be more than half of new HIV infections in the United States , so making circumcision mandatory may not actually result in lower infection rates .

Revealing Male Bodies
The Premier League is preparing to make Portsmouth the first club taken under control of the league 's executive body after the club 's chief executive , Peter Storrie , admitted yesterday that there was " no money left " .
A secret transfer embargo was implemented on the club during the summer by the Premier League 's chief executive , Richard Scudamore , as they struggled to stay afloat while selling off their biggest names .
The club 's failure to pay players and staff on time this month has put the league on standby if the situation deteriorates .
Now , under rules introduced this month which allow the league to seize control of a club 's finances , the Premier League is ready to take over at Portsmouth to stop them slipping into administration .
No club in the Premier League has yet gone into administration and the board at Portsmouth , who have lost their first seven games this season , still hopes the situation can be rescued .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The club's new owner Sulaiman al - Fahim is chasing £ 50 m of new investment which the club still hope will be forthcoming .
However , they are under pressure to pay debts to staff and externally as well .
Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are understood to be major creditors and there is believed to be a debt of at least £ 3 m owed to major football agents .
The developments at Fratton Park came as Notts County were forced to issue a denial yesterday that they failed to pay their players the full amount due last month .
The Professional Footballers ' Association was contacted when bonuses were not paid .
The club say they have addressed the problem .
With Fahim yet to announce the advent of new backers at Portsmouth , Storrie said yesterday that the club was running on empty .
" All the money from all the player transfers and the Sky TV money , all of the £ 35 m from January , has gone straight to the Standard Bank , " he said .
" There is no money left .
" Whatever we spend on a monthly basis comes channelled through from the new owner .
He has promised to re-finance , and he has shown me all the documentation , but I have no idea about the conditions of the £ 50 m he says will be arriving in a few weeks .
" We need to refinance , it is as simple as that .
As for the players ' wages for last month , I would imagine it 's a blip and they will be paid , but I have spent the last nine to 10 months fighting fires on a daily basis , I 'm not giving up . "
The club described the failure to pay the players as " very disappointing " .
A spokesman said : " It is through the joint efforts of the executive directors that we are in the final stages of securing funding that will allow the club to meet these contractual obligations .
" It is clear that , in order to ensure that the club is able to secure its longer - term future , a more permanent financing solution needs to be found quickly as the executive directors consider it an obligation to the club 's loyal employees and fans , who undoubtedly feel equally disappointed .
" In order to achieve this we will continue to work closely with the owner 's lawyers and associates in delivering the finance that is needed over the next 10 to 14 days .
Ultimately the responsibility to deliver this remains with the owner . "
At Meadow Lane , Notts County claimed last night that a new system of paying wages was the reason that their players ' salaries were not paid in full for last month .
Players at the club immediately contacted the PFA on Wednesday when their win bonuses were not included in September 's pay packet .
Last night the executive chairman of Notts County , Peter Trembling , said that bonuses had simply been paid a day late because a new payment system meant that bonuses and salaries were now paid separately .
" There is no issue .
They have been paid and their salaries and bonuses are up to date , " Trembling said .
" We have implemented an automated process that was n't here before .
The players have no issue with it . "
The edginess among players at Notts County exists because of doubts over the backers of Munto Finance , the investors who were given control of the club by a supporters ' trust this year .
Sol Campbell walked out on a £ 40,000 - a- week , five - year contract at Meadow Lane last month because of doubts over the future of the club .
The chief executive of the PFA , Gordon Taylor , was contacted by players at Notts County on Wednesday and the union then made representations to the club .
Taylor said : " This is the kind of job that the PFA does for all its members .
We have to make sure the players get the money due on their contracts and in time too .
That does happen at some clubs but you do not expect it , in Portsmouth 's case , in the Premier League . "
Pompey 's fall :
How financial troubles spiralled out of control
Summer 2007
Since rescuing a side seemingly destined for relegation when he returned to Fratton Park in December 2005 , the next stage of Harry Redknapp 's rebuilding kicks in with a vengeance .
Pompey buy midfielder Sulley Muntari for £ 7 m from Udinese , new England striker David Nugent from Preston for £ 6 m , Glen Johnson ( £ 4 m ) , winger John Utaka ( £ 7 m ) and defensive midfielder Papa Bouba Diop ( undisclosed ) .
The only significant sales are Gary O'Neil ( £5 m to Middlesbrough ) , while Redknapp adds further to the wage bill by snapping up Sylvain Distin and Herman Hreidarsson on free transfers .
Highlighting the sense of optimism at the club , plans for a new 36,000 - capacity stadium at Horsea Island designed by world - renowned architects Herzog and De Meuron are unveiled .
31 January 2008 With Pompey challenging for a top six place in the Premier League , Redknapp , who turns down the Newcastle vacancy after Sam Allardyce is sacked , buys big again – midfielder Lassana Diarra is spirited away from Arsenal for £ 5.5 m and Jermain Defoe arrives from Spurs on transfer - deadline day for £ 9 m .
Benjani ( £ 3.8 m , Man City ) and Matthew Taylor ( £5 m , Bolton ) go the other way .
17 May 2008 Redknapp 's spending earns a rich dividend as Portsmouth win the FA Cup , beating Cardiff 1 - 0 at Wembley thanks to Kanu 's goal .
However , that means preparing for a Uefa Cup campaign and a bigger squad – Redknapp brings back Peter Crouch ( £ 11 m , Liverpool ) to pair him up front with Defoe , while Younes Kaboul is brought in from Spurs ( £ 6 m ) as cover for Sol Campbell .
The sale of Muntari to Internazionale ( £ 12.7 m ) helps balance the books .
25 October 2008 Redknapp walks out on Pompey to take over at Spurs .
Assistant Tony Adams moves up to become manager and immediately has to deal with a new financial climate as debt levels at the club have risen dangerously high .
After months of rumours , owner Alexandre Gaydamak also announces that he is ready to sell Portsmouth .
In the winter transfer window the sale of Diarra ( £ 20 m , Real Madrid ) and Defoe ( £ 15 m , following Redknapp to Spurs ) brings in £ 35 m but that is deemed not enough .
Adams is allowed to buy Hayden Mullins for £ 1 m from West Ham .
9 February 2009 Adams is sacked as Pompey , without a win in the Premier League since November , slide towards the relegation zone .
Paul
Hart is installed as caretaker and manages to stabilise things , securing a 14th - place finish .
19 March 2009
The new stadium plans at Horsea Island are shelved and a project to redevelop Fratton Park as a 30,000 - capacity ground by 2011 is offered as an alternative .
Summer 2009 " For Sale " signs go up at Fratton Park , with the club and seemingly all the first - team squad on the market .
Out go Johnson ( £ 18 m , Liverpool ) , Crouch ( £9 m , Spurs ) , while Lauren , Campbell , Sean Davis and Djimi Traoré are allowed to leave .
With the transfer window days from closing and Sulaiman al - Fahim 's takeover dragging on , Hart is down to 14 first - team players .
Money is found to bring in a number of loans ( Jamie O'Hara , Anthony Vanden Borre , Aruna Dindane ) , Championship players ( Tommy Smith , Mike Williamson ) and Redknapp 's cast - offs at Spurs ( Kevin - Prince Boateng ) .

Meg Whitman adds a new line to her explanation of why she did not register to vote until 2002 .
| POLITICO Staff Whitman :
Too busy with family to vote
Meg Whitman has added a new line to her explanation of why she did not register to vote until 2002 , telling reporters that she was too preoccupied with “ raising a family . ”
Following a speech to a group of Yolo County Republican women on Tuesday , the Republican California gubernatorial hopeful said that she was “ focused on raising a family , on my husband 's career , and we moved many , many times ” in response to a reporter ’s question on her past voting record .

“ It is no excuse .
My voting record , my registration record , is unacceptable , ” she added .
Whitman further explained that she was not engaged in politics until she became CEO of eBay , where she saw “ inspired individuals who created business who got slapped down by taxation , by bureaucracy and regulation . ”
“ When I came to eBay , what I saw was the incredible difficulties that government created for small business , ” she said , according to press accounts of the event .
Whitman ’s campaign has been plagued by unrelenting questions about her voting record since the Sacramento
Bee revealed that she had not registered to vote until she was 46 - years - old .
Whitman has spoken to the issue in remarks and interviews with the media numerous times , but has yet to get past the story .
Earlier in the week , the Whitman ’s camp adopted a line from Rep. Mary Bono Mack ( R - Calif . ) , who noted over the weekend that her late husband , Sonny , did not register to vote until he ran for mayor of Palm Springs .
“ He went on to be a successful mayor and a successful member of Congress , ” Bono Mack said .
The fellow California Republican also said that Whitman ’s “ leadership issues ” and not her experience makes her “ an amazing candidate for governor . ”

If you could take a pill to make you temporarily smarter , would you ?
The use of brain - enhancing drugs in colleges continues to rise and a recent paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics has fueled the debate over if and how students ’ use of these drugs should be controlled .
Authored by Vince Cakic , Professor in the School of Psychology at the University of Sydney , the JME paper questions if doping tests could ever become a part of academic life the way they have become part of athletic life .
Should we test students for brain enhancing drugs ?
More importantly , how do we feel about chemical enhancement of the mind and is it something that we should avoid or embrace ?
In 1964 , a Romanian doctor , Cornelin E Giurgea coined the term nootropics to include those substances which enhance cognitive function in some way ( especially those with few side effects ) .
Research into nootropics is typically centered on correcting abnormal levels of cognizance ( as occurs with ADHD or Alzheimer ’s ) , not brain - enhancement for its own sake .
While there are literally thousands of chemicals which could be perceived to have nootropic effects , the most commonly used drugs in academic settings are methylphenidate ( aka Ritalin ) , modafinil , dextroamphetamine ( aka Adderall ) , and atomoxetine .
Commercially , you can find nootropics offered for sale online , especially those in the racetam family such as piracetam and oxiracetam .
Almost all stimulants have a nootropic effect at some level of dosage .
These substances are here , and their use is spreading , but outside of prescription drugs efficacy and side effects are rarely well known .
As with so many forms of technology that offer to provide a competitive edge , consumer demand has outstripped the slow process of scientific and government review .
The trouble with evaluating nootropics is that we have such trouble defining intelligence in the first place .
Many drugs that seek to mitigate the effects of diseases like Alzheimer ’s or Parkinson ’s have nootropic effects on healthy brains .
Yet in an Alzheimer ’s patient an increased ability to process short term memory is much clearer than it is with a person who is taking the drug for enhancement .
Is a student who takes ritalin before a test able to remember 5 % more ?
How do you know what they would have remembered in the first place ?
Cognizance , like many other complicated biological factors , is easy to identify in its extremes , but hard to quantify in small increments .
It is clear that the extralegal or recreational use of prescription drug nootropics can produce sensations of increased focus , energy , and creativity , but such results are not universal nor are they without risks .
Side effects for what many call nootropics are wide ranging .
Many of these drugs seem to function by changing the levels of neurotransmitters , enzymes , or hormones in the brain .
As a result , use can cause temporary or permanent shifts in the amount of those chemicals generated by the body .
For stimulant nootropics , users run the risk of heart failure .
Few nootropics have been studied for long term continuous use , raising concerns about liver and kidney disease .
The most widely reported , and again difficult to quantify , side effect of nootropics is mood alteration .
Some mood alteration is often part of the desired effect of these drugs , but excessive depression , thoughts of suicide , or unusual aggression can accompany chemical brain - enhancement .
With the dangers presented by nootropics , it would seem an easy choice to try to keep them out of the reach of students .
Yet keeping people from taking drugs they perceive as smart - pills is easier said than done .
A study in Nature found that an average of 7 % ( with a range up to 25 % ) of US college students have used a nootropic at some point in their careers .
The vast majority of these cases involved illegal use of a controlled substance .
A good portion of students thus seem willing to take substantial risks to achieve cognitive enhancement .
It would n’t be easy to overcome such determination .
I guess we could just make incoming freshmen read Flowers for Algernon and hope they become disillusioned with the idea of temporarily enhanced intelligence .
As the NY Times pointed out last year , many professors are themselves using nootropics to help them stay focused during important research .
The phenomenon is widespread enough to have inspired a doping - crackdown hoax we discussed earlier .
It would seem hypocritical to test students without also testing scientists , teachers , quiz show hosts … the list goes on .
Why should students be held to a higher standard than the professionals they are training to become ?
In his paper in JME , Cakic makes comparisons between controlling drug enhancement in academia and in athletics .
Competitive determination is always slightly ahead of testing capabilities .
Timing the use of steroids , choosing new and unknown versions of muscle enhancements , finding ways to falsify examinations … these methods have allowed many professional athletes to ‘ juice ’ themselves even with rigorous doping tests .
The same could easily happen if we tried to test students for brain - enhancing chemicals .
Yet even if creating effective doping tests for nootropics would be easy , that does n’t mean they should be performed .
Do we care about a ‘ level - playing field ’ when it comes to thinking ?
As Cakic again points out , there is already an alarming disparity in cognitive performance in our current system .
Some of the gap is a result of socio-economic opportunities .
Are private academies and the money for private tutoring sessions nootropic ?
We could also concern ourselves with stress levels , or expectations of performance , as these affect academic performance and can be traced to neurotransmitters , enzymes , and hormones in the brain .
For some , it ’s more than just a safety issue .
There is something they find onerous about mental augmentation .
Society seems to have already approved enhancements of mental performance through electronic devices .
Calculators and smart phones are ubiquitous .
As we learn more about neurochemistry , and build better models of the human brain , nootropics could become just as safe and understood as an iPhone .
Would it be ok to take cognitive enhancers then ?
Remember that at some point electronic devices will become small enough to enter the body like a prescription drug .
Even earlier we may see biological devices that are engineered just as much as a graphing calculator .
Whether it ’s pharmacological or electromechanical , there will be a brain - enhancing device some day , or many such technologies .
More people than just students will consider using them .
Unlike with athletics , mental acuity does n’t conform to the normal ideas of a competition .
Getting smarter is n’t a game .
Do we need rules for it ?
If a child is born with abnormal neurochemistry and we use nootropics or some other treatment to increase his intelligence can we then turn to an average person and deny them the same ?
Who is deciding what is abnormal and average in the first place ?
For now , concerns with taking nootropics are as much about getting what you paid for as they are about ethics .
Few retail brain - enhancers have rigorous laboratory evidence to support their claims .
Prescription medications like ritalin or adderall have a fairly successful track record , but these drugs do not work for everyone in the same way , and can expose users to side effects ( such as sleepiness ) that could counteract their effectiveness .
Simply stated I do n’t think there is currently a safe , well understood , and universally effective ‘ smart pill ’ .
There are just a bunch of reasonably risky , moderately researched , and fairly effective noticeably - more - focused - pills .
Yet if I return to my original question , and assume there was such thing as a 100 % reliable and powerful nootropic … honestly , I would take it .
Why not ?
If there were reasonable side effects , and long term toxicology was well understood , then yes definitely .
Every day we consume nicotine , caffeine , alcohol and many other chemicals which affect our minds and bodies , often by degrading performance .
Is wanting to go the other direction so wrong ?
I welcome the inevitable smart pill the same way I welcome smart phones .
Technology is supposed to help us achieve more with less effort .
That ’s the point .

Environmentalists fear oil is heading towards an area where whales breed Environmentalists have warned that an oil slick caused by an accident on a rig in the Timor Sea is threatening wildlife in Australian waters .
Oil has been flowing from the West Atlas platform for three weeks .
Safety authorities have been using chemicals to try to break up the spill but warn it could be at least two more weeks before the leak is plugged .
Up to 400 barrels of oil per day have been pouring into the Timor Sea to Australia 's north .
An emergency rig has arrived from Singapore to repair the damage and aircraft and boats have been dousing the slick with dispersants .
Fragile environment
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has said that this has helped to contain the spread of oil , the bulk of which remains around the drilling platform thanks , in part , to benign weather conditions .
Officials have stated that the slick is about 170 km ( 100 miles ) from the Australian coast .
Environmental groups believe the contamination poses a significant threat to wildlife and is heading towards land .
Piers Verstegen , from the Conservation Council of Western Australia , says the spill - off the north coast of the Kimberley region where whales congregate - is an ecological disaster .
" Humpback whales , an endangered species , go to that area and that region to calf and give birth and this oil spill is happening just off the Kimberley coast , " Mr Verstegen said .
" The oil , as far as we are aware , is travelling towards the Kimberley coastline but it is definitely affecting areas that are used by these whales and dolphins . "
Fishermen have reported seeing endangered flatback turtles covered in oil .
There have also been claims that fish and sea-snakes have been poisoned .
Conservationists believe that , in its rush to exploit abundant natural resources , Australia risks inflicting irreparable damage on its fragile environment .

There ’s no two ways about it , what I ’ve got to say this evening is likely to upset , annoy and even anger more than a few people who are notionally on ‘ our side ’ , but there are some thing that simply have to be said …
… so do n’t say that you have n’t been warned .
My starting point for this evening is Nick Davies ’ stunning exposé of the near abject failure of the Home Office ’s highly touted ‘ Operation Pentameter Two ’ investigation into sex trafficking in the UK .
Over the course of six months , hundreds of brothels / sex workers were raided , in the clear expectation of finding a thriving underground trade in trafficked sex workers , as part of campaign that involved government departments , specialist agencies and every single police force in the country …
… and turned up next to jack - shit – a total of five bona fide , honest - to - goodness trafficking convictions in total .
Nick ’s article has already sparked off a pretty lively and entertaining row on Newsnight between Denis McShane and Jeremy Paxman and drawn a response from Rahila Gupta of Southall Black Sisters ( which I ’d cheerfully fisk if I thought it would make the slightest bit of difference ) none of which , in any sense , detracts from the fact that neither of the Pentameter investigations has come anywhere near close to substantiating any of the claims that the Home Office or Home Affairs Select Committee interests have made about the alleged scale of sex trafficking to , and within , the UK .
To some that ’s clearly a controversial observation – it should n’t be .
The truth , such as it is , is that sex trafficking is a real enough phenomenon and one from which the UK is certainly not immune but , and its an important but , its a phenomenon for which we lack sufficient credible evidence to make any reasonable inferences about its prevalence in this country .
To a scientist this is unfortunate but not especially problematic .
It just tells us that we need more research and , in all likelihood , a better and more innovative range of research methodologies with which to attack the problem .
To certain politicians , however , it is problem because , not to put it too finely , it strongly suggests that the estimates they ’ve been relying on to swing public opinion behind their preferred prohibitionist agenda may easily have been concocted on the back of a fag packet for all that they ’re underpinned by anything other than bunch of numbers pulled at random out of their own arses …
… which , if you look at how some of these figures arose may conceivably not be that far from the truth .
Rahila ’s article mentions an estimate of 5,000 trafficked women and children referenced in a recent report of the Home Affairs Select Committee , which is allegedly ‘ based on an aggregation of the figures provided by those working in this field ’ .
The origins of that figure are set out in paragraph 28 of the full report as follows :
28 . Neither the NGOs nor government agencies were willing even to guess the total number of trafficking victims in the UK .
Chief Constable Maxwell , Programme Director of the UKHTC , one of whose main responsibilities is to obtain accurate information about the scale of the problem , admitted “ at the minute I do not think we have got a real handle on what the figures are ” .
The same few statistical studies in specific areas ( the Poppy Project ’s analysis of information provided by victims of sexual exploitation who had been referred to it , Kalayaan ’s analysis of responses from its migrant domestic worker clients , ECPAT UK ’s research on child victims in three UK regions ) were cited to us time and again .
The nearest we came to an overall total was when we added up the result of these studies and suggested to Anti-Slavery International that they implied that there were more than 5000 victims in the UK ; Anti-Slavery International concurred .
All of which puts us firmly into guesswork territory even before we refer to the oral evidence sessions on which this paragraph is directly based , where we find that what Chief Constable Grahame Maxwell , the programme director of the UK Human Trafficking Centre , actually said , in response to a question from Ann Cryer about the estimated scale of sex trafficking was :
Chief Constable Maxwell :
It is a very difficult to thing to estimate .
We had a report in 2003 that said there were 4,000 victims .
In P1 we looked at 10 % of all visible sex outlets and from that we rescued 88 people .
The best piece of research I have seen is from the South - West Regional Intelligence Unit , and what I want to do is try and use that methodology to give us a picture across the UK and try and get something which is a fairly firm figure around what we are dealing with , because at the minute I do not think we have got a real handle on what the figures are .
Pay careful attention here to the statement in bold text given above and now watch the birdie as we move on the evidence given by Klara Skrivankova of Anti-Slavery International ( but introduced to the committee as a representative of the UK Human Trafficking Centre Prevention sub - Group ) in an exchange with the committee ’s chairman , Keith Vaz …
Q2 Chairman :
Do we have numbers , for example , for the UK ?
Would you know how many people are currently in the UK who have been trafficked here ?
Ms Skrivankova :
There are some minimum estimates and they are very conservative estimates from the government .
You will be aware of the number of 4,000 women that are trafficked at any given time into the UK , which is the government estimate and is a very conservative estimate .
Q3 Chairman :
When you say “ at any given time ” at the moment you estimate — and we know that these are going to be estimates — you estimate that it is about 4,000 ?
Ms Skrivankova :
That is the government estimate and that is only on women trafficked for sexual exploitation .
So what is important to point out is that this number does not include people who are trafficked for labour exploitation .
Q4 Chairman :
Do you have a rough figure as to how many those are ?
Ms Skrivankova :
The only number on people who are trafficked for labour exploitation that we currently have comes from the statistics of an organisation called Kalyaan , and they provide assistance to migrant domestics that were in forced labour or were trafficked .
According to their data they have recorded within a year that over 300 people were trafficked in London — only in London — for the purposes of domestic work .
So that is quite a high number over a short period of time .
Q5 Chairman :
So roughly 300 for domestic workers and roughly 4,000 — and you are saying it is a conservative estimate —
Ms Skrivankova :
That is a very conservative estimate .
Q6 Chairman : … of women in the UK at the present time who are here in the sex industry ?
Ms Skrivankova :
The sex industry and domestic work ; the number does not include any other forms of labour exploitation .
We have discovered people who are trafficked into construction , processing , packaging and into agriculture and in the catering industry .
We now have information about people who are trafficked for committing illicit activities and we do not know that number .
Q7 Chairman :
But it is more than 5000 ?
Ms Skrivankova : I would say so , yes .
We have enough information to conclude that it is a significant problem , that it is in thousands .
If you look at the number of cases that were recovered in the recent police operation , Pentameter , that ran over a period of , I believe , four to six months , within that they have just in a small area recovered over 80 cases , and that was over a short period of time of a focused action .
If Vaz tried to pull that off in court he ’d quickly get pulled up for leading the witness but that aside what we actually have here is concrete evidence that the figure of 5,000 cited by the Home Affair ’s committee is a combined figure for sex trafficking , trafficked domestic labour in London and trafficking in children and , more importantly , that the 4,o00 estimate for sex trafficking alone is a ‘ government estimate ’ the actual source of which is disclosed in the Home Office ’s regulatory impact assessment of ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings :
The overall scale of human trafficking remains unclear although internal research conducted in 2003 suggests that at any one time there were approximately 4,000 victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the UK .
Everything I ’ve read while researching this article is entirely self - referential and lead back to this unpublished internal Home Office review from 2003 , the validity of which cannot be established , or even scrutinised , because despite it cropping up in just about everything published by the Home Office on the subject of sex trafficking in recent years , this research has never been placed into the public domain .
That said , this same document continues with this , now rather embarrassing observation :
More recent intelligence estimates from the police led Operation Pentameter 2 are consistent with the earlier research findings , suggesting that the scale of this form of trafficking has remained relatively stable over the past 5 years .
On that utterly flimsy basis , the government is putting down estimates of the costs and benefits of implementing this convention ; £ 1.8 million per year in prosecution costs and £ 2.1 - £ 3.4 million for a national referral system and specialist victim support services against £ 1.2 million a year recouped from projected seizures of traffickers ’ assets and from placing victims into legal employment during a 12 month temporary residence period that would follow on from their initial crisis and reflection / recovery support , all of which is based on this new system dealing with 500 trafficked adults and 360 trafficked children a year a figure that appears , like the estimated unit cost of providing these support services , to have been derived exclusively from information provided by the Poppy Project .
The new system from dealing with victims of trafficking , which would offer victims 5 days crisis support , 45 days reflection / recovery time and a full years temporary residency in the UK , including a work permit , is a considerable advance on the previous ‘ system ’ under which trafficked women were frequently at risk of short - order deportation .
As for whether the estimates attached to this system have any basis in reality , who knows for sure – certainly not the Home Office if the available evidence is anything to go by – and anyone who finds themselves feeling seriously vexed by Nick ’s article should perhaps consider that the absence of any credible estimates for the prevalence of sex trafficking might just as readily leave this new system woefully underfunded as produce the opposite outcome .
None of this .
however , detracts from the fact that there are some serious questions to be asked about the origins of the government estimate of the scale of sex trafficking and the unpublished internal Home Office Review from which it purports to have originated , particularly in light of Keith Vaz ’s overt and suspiciously enthusiastic efforts to place this estimate on the offical record and into the report of the Home Affairs Committee , where its referenced as having merely been cited in the
Government ’s Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking .
Nowhere in the final report , does the Committee disclose the fact that this figure is derived from an unpublished internal Home Office review .

1955
Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24th , 1955 .
He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs , where they lived on 45th avenue in San Francisco .
His father was of " imposing demeanor " and before he was a repo man , he was an engine room machinist in the Coast guard .
He 'd tinker with cars and sell them for a profit .
He was a hyperactive child .
Somewhere in his childhood , he ingested a bottle of ant poison and had to be brought to the emergency room .
Of being adopted , Steve would later say , " I think it 's a natural curiosity for people to want to understand where certain traits come from . "
" But mostly , I 'm an environmentalist .
I thin the way you are raised , your values , and most of your worldview come from the experiences you had growing up . "

" But mostly , I 'm an environmentalist .
I thin the way you are raised , your values , and most of your worldview come from the experiences you had growing up . "
1963
Steve would later say this about his early school years , with a hint of pride : " You should have seen us in third grade . "
" We basically destroyed the teacher . "
1965
Even at 10 , Steve 's attraction to electronics was becoming obvious to his parents .
At one point in his childhood he got a bad shock when jamming a bobby pin into a wall socket .
Paul moved with the family to Palo Alto , to handle the greater number of car reposessions that went with the greater of number of loans in the fast growing area known as Silicon Valley .
1970 - 1971
Steve Jobs discovers marijuana .
( Note : that there is what we call a photoshop . )
1970 - 1971 Part 2
Steve Jobs meets Steve Wozniac through a friend and they bonded quickly over electronics and pranks , Bob Dylan and the Beatles .
They attempted and failed one particular prank , where a rigged sheet with the acronym SWAB JOB ( The initals of the Steves ' and Allen Baum's ) was supossed to fall and cover a roof during graduation .
The lesson
Woz learned : never brag about your pranks .
Woz was the first person he'd ever met who knew more about electronics than he did ; Woz admired Steve 's confidence with people .
1970 - 1971 Part 3
After reading an article in Esquire about phone phreaking , they begin working on Blue Boxes used to crack codes on the public telephone systems for free calls .
Steve Jobs was still a senior in high school .
They sold these boxes for $ 150 on campus , spending $ 40 on parts .
Woz prank called the Pope as Henry Kissenger .
They met Captain Crunch , the subject of the article one night and when departing , their car shut down on the side of the road .
Some police found them trying to make free calls and got suspicious .
Woz and Jobs got out of trouble by telling the officers their Blue Box was a music synth .
1972
Jobs attends Reed college and drops out after one semester .
( He stated in his Stanford Commencement speech that he went because his birth parents insisted to the Jobs that he go to college . )
Jobs and Woz take $ 3 an hour jobs at the Westgate Mall in San Jose , dressing up as Alice in Wonderland Characters .
1973
Jobs remains in the Reed college area for 18 months dropping in random classes like caligraphy , which would later impact the typography on Macs .
1974
Returned to California and worked at Atari .
He just showed up and said he would n't leave until they hired him .
Steve goes on a spiritual trip to India with his friend Dan Kottke and paid for his ticket .
Upon wandering into a religious gathering , Jobs was taken away to the top of this mountain where the guru shaved his head .
In India , Steve experimented with LSD .
Dan shaved his head later , too , because he had lice .
Steve left for California and gave Dan the rest of his money so he could continue his journey in India .
Back at atari , Nolan Bushnell asked Jobs to work on a special project that would eventually become the game Break - out .
He made a deal to pay Jobs a certain amount if the machine had less than 40 chips .
Woz , who was an expert at such things , helped Jobs complete the design in 48 hours , and Jobs got the bonus .
The design was too complex to be manufactured .
In 1985 , Woz would later find out his friend shorted him his portion and is rumored to have been so hurt that he was moved to tears .
When confronted , Jobs at the time is said to have repeated that he did n't remember that happening .
If he'd found out earlier , Woz may have never joined up with Jobs to create Apple .
1975
In the Homebrew Computer Club , Woz was showing off two printed circuit boards that were built to drive output to a TV .
Jobs continued working at Atari while Woz continued at HP .
1976
Woz and Steve start Apple , naming it to differentiate the company from hobbyist boards .
Apple was n't a thrilling name , but it would work and reminded him of the time he spent on an apple farm in Oregon .
On April 1st , they signed papers for equal ownership .
To raise capital , Woz sold his HP 65 electronic calculator for $ 520 and Jobs sold his red and white VW bus for $ 1500 — only half of which was ever paid , because the engine blew out soon after the sale .
Their first order was for 50 Apple I computers , and Jobs made the sale barefoot .
He confused the order and delivered circuitboards instead of finished machines with cases , and so had to take partial payment .
By the end of the year , they shipped 150 computers .
1976 Part 2
Woz and Jobs decided the Apple II would lofdad their OS from the circuit board , instead of needing to be loaded manually .
It would also have a fanless power supply , something that needed to be designed from scratch using a switching model instead of a linear source .
Mike Markkula is their first investor .
Seeing their work , he thinks he can put Apple on the Fortune 500 in 5 years and he eventually does .
1977
Apple Computer becomes a corporation when Mike Markkula and Jobs and Woz sign papers at Mike 's house , on January 3rd .
Mike Scott , becomes Apple 's president , and offends Jobs in two ways :
First he awards
Woz the position of being employee number 1 because his design was instrumental in the company 's founding .

Booted from the Lisa team by management that disagreed with his tactics and doubted his leadership abilities beyond his vision , Jobs gets involved with the Jef Raskin 's Macintosh project , named after the Mcintosh apple , with a typo .
It was designed to be a $ 1000 appliance computer that would turn on and just work .
Eventually , Jobs would take the project away from Raskin .
At one meeting , Jobs threw a telephone book on the table and insisted it be no longer than that , and vertical standing .
He comissioned frogdesign and Hartmut Esslinger to come up with the design language for the Mac , called Snow White .
Unlike Woz's Apple II , it had no expansion cards .
While much of Apple was becoming more straight laced , some credit Burrell Smith , a wildly creative tech who 's talent was being wasted in the service department , for creating a brilliant digital board that the rest of the team could build around .
It was also notable , because unlike the Lisa project and others that were usually named after females ( wives , girlfriends , daughters ) the Mac was purposely named by Raskin to buck the sexist trend .
( The project was originally called Annie . )
Before much of this , in 1979 , Jobs asked Raskin to come up with the specs before the price .
And Raskin wrote a list of outrageous features meant to mock the idea .
The list would , years later , describe most of the machine , vidicating Jobs ' method .
The Mac team defines the reality distortion field as different from how we describe it today :
An engineer would mention an idea to Jobs , who would call it stupid , and weeks later he'd bring it up as his own , knowingly or not .
Jobs describes the case design of the Mac needing to be more like a Porsche than a VW ( he drove a Porsche 928 at the time ) .
He spoke design - ese and said this when judging a prototype coming from the car conversation : " It 's way too boxy , it 's got to be more curvaceous .
The radius of the first chamfer needs to be bigger , and I do n't like the size of the bezel .
But it 's a start . "

It had quotes by Woz claiming he did n't design much tech in the Apple II , and lots of snipes by anonymous sources .
Jobs cancelled his new years plans and thought about the article .
People could tell when Steve was in the office , because he parked in the handicapped spot out front in his blue Mercedes .
People think he did it because he was a dick , but David Bunnell , has been quoted as saying it was because disgruntled Lisa or Apple II employees would come by and scratch it with their keys .
" It 's better to be a pirate than to join the Navy , " said Steve .

Apple 's aging OS needs replacement .
Apple considers buying BeOS , or even licensing Windows NT from Microsoft .
But instead , they look to NeXT and the NeXTSTEP OS , which directly influenced Apple 's modern OS X UI , architecture and multitasking abilities , which is used in the iPhone and all Macs today .

Starburst Galaxy IC 10
Credit & Copyright : Mike Siniscalchi
Explanation : Lurking behind dust and stars near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy , IC 10 is a mere 2.3 million light - years distant .
Its light dimmed by the intervening dust , the irregular dwarf galaxy still shows off vigorous star - forming regions that shine with a telltale reddish glow in this colorful skyscape .
In fact , also a member of the Local Group of galaxies , IC 10 is the closest known starburst galaxy .
Compared to other Local Group galaxies , IC 10 has a large population of newly formed stars that are massive and intrinsically very bright , including a luminous X - ray binary star system thought to contain a black hole .
Located within the boundaries of the northern constellation Cassiopeia , IC 10 is about 5,000 light - years across .
The relationship between the FBI and the CIA has never been stronger or more productive .
While we concede that there were isolated failings in the information flow between the two agencies prior to 9/11 , we must not overlook the fact that a successful , systematic effort has been underway for years to develop and build upon our agencies ' relationship .

Testimony to the Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry , October 17 , 2002
The Intelligence Community provided the law enforcement community , especially the Department of Justice , FBI , and the Immigration and Naturalization Service , with actionable intelligence on terrorist groups , transnational organized crime groups , and their activities , such as narco - trafficking .
Policymakers expressed increasing need to be knowledgeable of the actions of these criminal figures as their influence on foreign governments grows .
IC agencies collaborate via unclassified e-mail systems and database sharing in supplying foreign intelligence to US policymakers and , within established guidelines , in a robust exchange of lead information with law enforcement agencies .
The IC has made valuable contributions , particularly in identifying and tracking terrorist funds , and has taken advantage of existing and new relationships with foreign governments .
Recognizing the need for a more formalized strategy to support law enforcement customers , the DCI had initiated the development of a Strategic Plan for IC Support to Law Enforcement prior to the attacks of 11 September .
The plan was developed as a collaborative effort among IC representatives and with full participation from law enforcement agencies .
The plan sets forth a coordinated IC strategy to address future federal law enforcement needs by specifying goals and specific IC actions to fulfill the strategy , while protecting those elements of existing support that are already working well .
The FBI 's Security Division supports state and local law enforcement by ensuring that those who require access to classified information have the proper security clearance and need - to - know .
It makes accurate and timely judgments of the trustworthiness of state and local officials who require access to classified information to support their counterterrorism efforts .
Over 1,000 clearances were granted to state and local law enforcement officers during FY2002 , a substantial increase over previous years .

CIA supported a reevaluation of US antidrug priorities by the President 's Office of National Drug Control Policy by publishing a paper that addressed the strategic vulnerabilities of the global drug trade .
The paper addressed the exploitable operational , logistical , financial , and geographic weakness of the many criminal enterprises that supply narcotics to the United States and other markets .
The paper was well received by the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , and he instructed the law enforcement community to use it as a template to craft a companion product addressing the vulnerabilities of the US domestic drug trade .
NSA provided US policymakers and law enforcement agencies , including the Office of National Drug Control Policy , Counter Drug Executive Secretariat , Coast Guard , FBI , Customs , and DEA , with foreign intelligence that contributed to the disruption or dismantlement of major foreign narco - trafficking organizations .
This was accomplished by full integration into the counternarcotics community under the leadership of the DCI 's Crime and Narcotics Center and was based on the robust exchange of lead information between the Intelligence Community and law enforcement agencies .
NSA also provided tailored briefings describing the threat to information systems and networks , focusing on issues of interest to the FBI .
NSA provided COMSEC monitoring for the Joint Interagency Task Force - East and the Joint Interagency Task Force - West .
NIMA provided focused intelligence support to USCS , FBI , and DEA on narcotics trafficking along the US / Mexico border port of entries .
NIMA also provided extensive information and analysis of suspected drug cartel facilities and airfields believed to be used for narcotics trafficking in Colombia .
CIA analysts wrote the first - ever analysis of drug flows and consumption in Brazil , the world 's second - largest consumer of cocaine after the United States .
The study entailed open - source field collection and an innovative methodology for calculating the prevalence of drug use .
The NIC provided policymakers with analysis on the damaging and corrupting influence that the illicit narcotics trafficking industry continues to exert on several of the young democracies in Latin America .

Countering International Organized Crime
A joint investigation with the AFOSI , the USCS , the DoS , the Department of Commerce , and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service led to the discovery and arrest of a subject who brokered sales of military aircraft parts from US companies and had them shipped to companies in Iran .
The subject was found guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in jail , 36 months probation , and $ 10,000 fine .
CIA , working with foreign governments , collected and reported intelligence to US law enforcement agencies conducting operations against members of Latin American and Middle Eastern terrorist groups and against smugglers of aliens into the United States .
CIA also provided the DoS with an expert on human smuggling and trafficking who oversaw the assessment , drafting , and coordination of the 2002 Trafficking in Persons report .
USCG Pacific Area Intelligence worked with Law Enforcement and Intelligence Community members to identify human smuggling activities .
Their analytical efforts allowed USCG forces to preposition scarce interdiction assets and interdict illegal migrants in the Eastern Pacific and off the coasts of California , Hawaii , and Guam .
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network actively participated in these joint Law Enforcement - Intelligence Community committees : Countering Organized Crime , Counter - Narcotics , and Counterterrorism .
Intelligence Community reporting was routinely used as lead information in tracking suspects .
CIA provided key research results to the Treasury Department in its efforts to apply the Patriot Act to a foreign bank involved in money laundering .
CIA analysts identified key players in the bank , their relationship to international organized crime , and the bank 's efforts to hide its accounts from US law enforcement .

Pinto : The FHA Needs a $ 54 Billion Bailout Tales from the new sub prime
If there is one thing I have learned in this mess it is this :
Do n't trust any CEO who swears that everything is just fine .
That 's because the current crisis has been full of these jokers and eventually everyone of them has needed a bail out .
So when I heard Commissioner David Stevens insist last month that " Under no circumstance will any taxpayer bailout be needed " for FHA , I took it with a 50 lb. bag of salt .
After all , sub prime borrowers had n't gone away — not by a long shot .
Instead , they had simply moved back into FHA loans .
Now their problems are your problems again .....
From Bloomberg by Jody Shenn entitled : FHA Shortfall Seen at $ 54 Billion May Lead to Bailout
" The Federal Housing Administration , which insures mortgages with low down payments , may require a U.S. bailout because of $ 54 billion more in losses than it can withstand , a former Fannie Mae executive said .
" It appears destined for a taxpayer bailout in the next 24 to 36 months , " consultant Edward Pinto said in testimony prepared for a House committee hearing in Washington today .
Pinto was the chief credit officer from 1987 to 1989 for Fannie Mae , the mortgage - finance company that is now government - run .
The FHA program 's volumes have quadrupled since 2006 as private lenders and insurers pulled back amid the U.S. housing slump , Pinto said .
The jump has left the agency backing risky loans and exposed to fraud in a " market where prices have yet to stabilize , " he said .
Official figures on FHA 's reserves as of Sept. 30 wo n't show a shortfall when released because " the assumptions used will be overly optimistic relative to loss mitigation resulting from both loan modifications and recent and expected underwriting changes , " Pinto said .
Pinto 's testimony says he based his FHA estimates on his performance projections for high loan - to - value ratio loans insured by Fannie Mae in 2006 , about 20 percent of which he expects to default costing 50 percent of balances .
( emphasis mine .. since this is a virtual repeat of the sub prime numbers !!!)
About 14.4 percent of FHA loans were delinquent as of June 30 and 2.98 percent were already being foreclosed upon , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association . "
Again , when this one blows up its not going to be pretty ...
By the way , in this case , the collapse of Taylor , Bean & Whitaker is just the tip of the iceberg .

Juan Barahona .
Photo : Telesur .
By Pedro Fuentes , Tegucigalpa
October 1 , 2009 --
“ We will not stop .
We will continue to be against the coup until the last day they are in power , ” Juan Barahona said in an interview at the headquarters of STYBIS , the beverage workers ’ trade union .
Barahona is the principal leader of the resistance , together with Carlos Reyes , president of the trade union , a close comrade of Barahona and an independent candidate for the next presidential election .
Reyes is injured and cannot participate , which makes Juan appear to be most visible face of the resistance .
Barahona is 55 years ’ old and began his activism in 1975 in the student movement .
In 1977 he joined the Communist Party of Honduras .
He was active in the party until it was dissolved .
It is worth recalling that the party dissolved itself following the fall of the Berlin Wall .
But this did not stop Barahona being active .
A large chunk of the cadres and activists of the Honduran CP were left without an organisation until they formed the Tendencia Revolucionaria ( Revolutionary Tendency , TR ) in 1995 .
TR formed following a meeting with El Salvadoran activists involved with the Tendencia Revolucionaria that was part of the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional ( Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , FMLN ) in El Salvador .
The Tendencia Revolucionaria later left the FMLN as [ TR claimed it ] began to shift towards electoralism and opportunism .
Juan Barahona never rests .
He was able to take time out for this interview in the offices of STYBIS , which is part of the Federation of Honduran Workers ( FUT ) .
Barahona is president of FUT and also president of SINTRAINA , the union organised in the National Agrarian Institute , which was occupied by its workers two days ago .
` What we lost in the 1990s , we regained in 2000 ’
Barahona began the interview talking about this history and that of the Bloque Popular ( Popular Bloc , BP ) , which was formed in 2000 and today is a decisive element in the resistance .
The Bloque Popular represented the coming together of peasant unions in the FUT , and left parties and organisations , including the TR .
The BP was the motor force behind the mobilisations that dominated the since 2000 .
“ In the 1990s , the struggle was extremely defensive .
In the case of our union , SINTRAINA , in charge of relations between the government and the peasants , we were fired in 1993 .
We held a hunger strike in front of the gringo [ US ] embassy for 10 days , which we halted after negotiations in which we were promised that we would be rehired .
But they fired us again , which forced us to return to our hunger strike 20 days later , and there we won , they were forced to rehire us .
“ Beginning in 2000 , the situation changed .
Since then the struggle has been against the neoliberal model and the system .
Beginning that year , the FUT organised the Bloque Popular , together with peasant organisations , teachers and community activists , and since then the Bloque has been on the streets . ”
These organisation was behind a number of big battles .
They held road blockades and strikes .
Last year they initiated a strike against corruption , “ an exemplary movement which ended with road blockades across the whole country and which basically paralysed the country ” .
There was another general strike in August and October 2009 , behind a 12 - point platform that was presented to the government and negotiated with Mel [ President Manuel Zelaya ] . ”
“ The National Resistance Front is a coalition between the Bloque Popular , UD ( Unificación Democrática , Democratic Unification ) , union confederations and the popular sector of the Liberal Party that defends Mel .
Here , we unite the majority of the people ” , Juan Barahona explained .
“ Honduras changed completely , and all of this will leave a very positive result ; an organisation and a great experience .
During these days of struggle [ since the June 28 , 2009 , coup ] , the level of consciousness has greatly risen , much more than would in 100 days of classes about class struggle .
There has been a parting of waters .
This is a struggle between classes : on one side the exploited people , and on the other the capitalists , the large capitalists that dominate this country .
Even the Liberal Party supporters that are part of the resistance understand it as such .
It is very easy to explain this as a struggle of the poor against the rich , to put them all into the same group . ”
The current situation
“ We are faced with a complicated scenario .
As the repression continues , now they are talking about negotiations .
We , as the resistance , are in favour of participation in negotiations ; we have not closed ourselves off to dialogue .
We see that there are fissures in the regime .
The visit by the deputies [ MPs ] from Brazil is important in supporting the presence of Zelaya in Brazil ’s embassy .
That the Organization of American States and the UN come as well is good .
Until now they have done nothing because they are on the side of imperialism .
We hope that they will now show some commitment .
We are in favour of participating in negotiations , but at the same time we say to the coup regime that we will not stop , we will continue to be against the coup until the last day they are in power .
“ Carlos Reyes is an independent [ presidential ] candidate of the resistance and the popular movement .
If we participate or not ( in the elections ) is a question of [ the coup regime ] accepting certain conditions and with Zelaya [ returned to ] power .
Depending on the situation we will study what we do .
The future is ours , nothing will ever be the same in Honduras , the dispute for power is posed now and will continue to be posed afterwards .
The resistance has the conditions to organise a political - social organisation to fight for power .
“ We just received good news from the US .
They have informed us that the dockers have decided to boycott the unloading of products from the maquiladoras [ sweat shops ] here .
This is a good blow to the business owners .
If it was n’t for the business owners and the right wing in Latin America , there would be no coup in Honduras .
“ We are continuing to organise the resistance and continuing on the streets .
Yesterday [ September 30 ] we were dispersed but today we were back on the streets again ; we marched to the US embassy , passing by the CORE [ regional headquarters of the police ] , where the peasants who were kicked out of the INA are being held and finished up in the centre of the city . ”

A screengrab from a video posted by Republicans on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee shows Democrats leaving a committee session last week .
Towns locks Republicans out , literally
Government Reform Chairman Ed Towns has figured out a novel way to lock Republicans out in a bitter dispute over a committee hearing .
He ’s locking them out .
Literally .

Towns ( D - N.Y. ) is seething mad that the top Republican on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) tried to force a subpoena vote in the committee regarding a Countrwide Financial investigation , without Towns ’ consent .
Towns got even angrier when Republicans posted a video of Democrats slipping out the side door to avoid that vote last week .
That left leave Republicans without the proper committee quorum , but the video did give the GOP fodder to portray Democrats as avoiding a tough vote on documents related Countrywide , which offered VIP mortgages to Democratic Sens.
Chris Dodd and Kent Conrad .
Asked why the Democrats changed the locks on committee doors , Towns fessed up .
“ Because they [ Republicans ] do n’t know how to behave , ” Towns said in a statement to POLITICO .
And was this retaliation for posting a video of Democrats scooting out the side door ?
“ Yes , ” Towns added .
Issa , who has fashioned himself as a good - government agitator on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , seems both amused and annoyed by Towns ’ antics .
“ It 's not surprising that they would choose to retaliate given the embarrassment we caused by catching them in a lie on tape , ” said Issa spokesman Kurt Bardella .
“ If only they would use their creative energy to do some actual oversight rather than resorting to immature tactics , but I guess we 're getting some insight into what lengths they 'll go to avoid addressing the Countrywide VIP issue . ”

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
An 11 - year - old boy faked his kidnapping Friday to avoid bringing home his bad report card , Huntsville police said .
The Ed White Middle School student claimed a man in a red , beat - up car grabbed him after school at the intersection of Trail Ridge and Grizzard roads and forced him into the vehicle .
" I 'm going to take you somewhere and kill you , " the boy claimed the man said .
The boy also said the man had a pistol .
The boy then claimed to have jumped from the vehicle - without his bookbag , which contained the report card - and ran to his grandparents ' house .
That 's when the boy confessed to making the whole thing up to cover for his bad grades .
His grandfather called police to apologize and report the boy 's story .
Sgt. Mark Roberts said police were suspicious of the boy when he was able to " escape " with his band instrument , but not his bookbag .
Police were notified of a possible kidnapping about 4:20 p.m. , but it is unclear who reported it .
Roberts said the boy faces no charges at this time .
The whereabouts of the bookbag and report card are unknown .
More than 10,000 Hotmail passwords have been hacked and posted online , a technology website reported today .
Microsoft , which owns the email service , said it had not yet been able to confirm the report , but it was " actively investigating the situation " .

Technology blog neowin.net reported that an anonymous user had posted the details of Windows Live Hotmail accounts on pastebin.com , a site used by developers to share code , on 1 October .
Neowin administrator Tom Warren wrote on the blog : " The details have since been removed but Neowin has seen part of the list posted and can confirm the accounts are genuine and most appear to be based in Europe .
" The list details over 10,000 accounts starting from A through to B , suggesting there could be additional lists .
" Currently it appears only accounts used to access Microsoft 's Windows Live Hotmail have been posted , this includes hotmail.com , msn.com and live.com accounts . "
The blog suggested the details were obtained through a hack or " phishing " scam , in which fake websites are used to trick people into revealing usernames , passwords and other information .
A Microsoft spokesman said : " Microsoft has been made aware of the claims that Windows Live IDs and passwords have been made available on the web .
" We 're actively investigating the situation and will take appropriate steps as rapidly as possible .
" Microsoft is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and believe they deserve to have their personal data used only in ways they have agreed to , and in ways that provide value to them . "
Neowin recommended Windows Live Hotmail users " change your password and security question immediately " .
Q : Did you resist at that time ?
A : A little bit , but not really because . . .
Q : Because what ?
A : Because I was afraid of him .

That ’s Roman Polanski ’s 13 - year - old victim testifying before a grand jury about how the famous director forced himself on her at Jack Nicholson ’s Mulholland Drive home in March of 1977 .
I ’m reading this in the district attorney ’s office at the Los Angeles County Criminal Courts Building , digging through the Polanski file to refresh my memory of the infamous case , and my blood pressure is rising .
Is it because I ’m the parent of a girl ?
Maybe that ’s part of it .
Advertisement
But I wish the renowned legal scholars Harvey Weinstein and Debra Winger , to name just two of Polanski ’s defenders , were here with me now .
I ’d like to invite Martin Scorsese , as well , along with David Lynch , who have put their names on a petition calling for Polanski to be freed immediately .
What , because he won an Oscar ?
Would they speak up for a sex offender who had n’t ?
To hear these people tell it , you ’d think Polanski was the victim rather than the teenager .
And then there ’s Woody Allen , who has signed the petition too .

Woody Allen ?
You ’d think that after marrying his longtime girlfriend ’s adopted daughter , he ’d have the good sense to remain silent .
But at least Soon - Yi Previn was a consenting adult .
I ’d like to show all these great luminaries the testimony from Polanski ’s underage victim , as well as Polanski ’s admission of guilt .
Then I ’d like to ask whether , if the victim were their daughter , they ’d be so cavalier about a crime that was originally charged as sodomy and rape before Polanski agreed to a plea bargain .
Would they still support Polanski’s wish to remain on the lam living the life of a king , despite the fact that he skipped the U.S. in 1977 before he was sentenced ?
The Zurich Film Festival has been “ unfairly exploited ” by Polanski ’s arrest , Winger said .
Thanks ,
Deb .
And so sorry the film festival was inconvenienced by the arrest of a man who left the United States to avoid sentencing for forcing himself on a child .

Weinstein , meanwhile , issued an open letter urging “ every U.S. filmmaker to lobby against any move to bring Polanski back to the U.S. , ” arguing that “ whatever you think of the so - called crime , Polanski has served his time . ”
So - called crime ?
Let ’s get back to the grand jury testimony .
Polanski has taken the girl to Nicholson ’s house to photograph her , ostensibly for a French magazine .
The girl ’s mother , it ’s clear to me , should have had her head examined for allowing this to happen , but that ’s another matter .
Advertisement
The girl says Polanski , who was in his 40s at the time , opened a bottle of champagne and shared it with her and with an adult woman who later left for work .
That ’s when Polanski allegedly began taking pictures of the 13 - year - old and suggested that she remove her blouse .
Quoting again from the grand jury transcript , with the girl being questioned by a prosecutor :
Q : Did you take your shirt off or did Mr. Polanski ?
A : No , I did .
Advertisement
Q : Was that at his request or did you volunteer to do that ?
A : That was at his request .
She said Polanski later went into the bathroom and took part of a Quaalude pill and offered her some , as well , and she accepted .
Q : Why did you take it ?
Advertisement
A : I do n’t know .
I think I must have been pretty drunk or else I would n’t have .
So here she is , at 13 , washing down a Quaalude with champagne , and then Polanski suggested they move out to the Jacuzzi .
Q : When you got in the Jacuzzi , what were you wearing ?
A : I was going to wear my underwear , but he said for me to take them off .
Advertisement
She says Polanski went back in the house and returned in the nude and got into the Jacuzzi with her .
When he told her to move closer to him , she resisted , saying , “ No . No , I got to get out . ”
He insisted , she testified , and so she moved closer and he put his hands around her waist .
She told him she had asthma and wanted to get out , and she did .
She said he followed her into the bathroom , where she told him , “ I have to go home now . ”
Q : What did Mr. Polanski say ?
A : He told me to go in the other room and lie down .
Advertisement
She testified that she was afraid and sat on the couch in the bedroom .
Q : What were you afraid of ?
A : Him .
She testified that Polanski sat down next to her and said she ’d feel better .
She repeated that she had to go home .
Advertisement
Q : What happened then ?
A : He reached over and he kissed me .
And I was telling him , “ No , ” you know , “ Keep away . ”
But I was kind of afraid of him because there was no one else there .
She testified that he put his mouth on her vagina .
“ I was ready to cry , ” she said .
“ I was kind of -- I was going , ‘ No . Come on .
Stop it . ’
But I was afraid . ”
Advertisement
She said he then pulled off her panties .
Q : What happened after that ?
A : He started to have intercourse with me .
At this point , she testified , Polanski became concerned about the consequences and asked if she was on the pill .
Advertisement
No , she told him .
Polanski had a solution , according to her .
“ He goes , ‘ Would you want me to go in through your back ? ’
And I went , ‘ No . ’ ”
According to her , that did n’t stop Polanski , who began having anal sex with her .
Advertisement
This was when the victim was asked by the prosecutor if she resisted and she said , “ Not really , ” because “ I was afraid of him . ”
She testified that when the ordeal had ended , Polanski told her , “ Oh , do n’t tell your mother about this . ”
He added : “ This is our secret . ”
But it was n’t a secret for long .
When the victim got home and told her story , her mother called the police .
Now granted , we only have the girl ’s side of things .
But an LAPD criminalist testified before the grand jury that tests of the girl ’s panties “ strongly indicate semen . ”
And a police officer who searched Polanski ’s hotel room found a Quaalude and photos of the girl .

Two weeks after the encounter on Mulholland Drive , Polanski was indicted for furnishing a controlled substance to a minor , committing a lewd or lascivious act upon a child under 14 , unlawful sexual intercourse , rape by use of drugs , perversion ( oral copulation ) and sodomy .
Three months later , a plea bargain was worked out .
Court records indicate that the victim and her family had asked the district attorney ’s office to spare the victim the trauma of testifying at a criminal trial .
“ A stigma would attach to her for a lifetime , ” the family ’s attorney argued .
So Polanski pleaded guilty to just one count -- unlawful sexual intercourse .
The other charges were dropped .
Advertisement
Polanski spent 42 days in prison for pre-sentencing diagnostic tests .
After his release , but before his sentencing in 1978 , he skipped , boarding a plane for Europe because he feared he would be ordered to serve more time in prison .
A warrant for his arrest has been in effect ever since , and Polanski was arrested this week in Switzerland .
He is fighting extradition , but I hope he loses that fight , gets hustled back to California and finally gets a sentence that fits his crime .
There ’s little question that this case was mishandled in many ways .
According to a recent documentary , the now - deceased judge inappropriately discussed sentencing with a prosecutor who was n’t working the case .
And Polanski ’s lawyers allege that the director fled only because he believed the judge would cave under public pressure and renege on a promise that he would serve no more time .
Regardless of whether there was such a deal , Polanski had not yet been sentenced , and under state law at the time , he could have been sent away for many years .
Does anyone really believe 42 days was an appropriate penalty given the nature of the case ?
Advertisement
Yes , Polanski has known great tragedy , having survived the Holocaust and having lost his wife , Sharon Tate and their unborn son , to the insanity of the Charles Manson cult .
But that has no bearing on the crime in question .
His victim , who settled a civil case against Polanski for an unspecified amount , said she does not want the man who forced himself on her to serve additional time .
That ’s big - hearted of her but also irrelevant , and so is the fact that the victim had admitted to having sex with a boyfriend before meeting Polanski .
Advertisement
Polanski stood in a Santa Monica courtroom on Aug. 8 , 1977 , admitted to having his way with a girl three decades his junior and told a judge that indeed , he knew she was only 13 .
There may well have been judicial misconduct .
But no misconduct was greater than allowing Polanski to cop a plea to the least of his charges .
His crime was graphic , manipulative and heinous , and he got a pass .
It ’s unbelievable , really , that his soft - headed apologists are rooting for him to get another one .

" We know the N - word is unacceptable , that 's not disputable -- but f*g ?
I 'm learning that there 's a segment of our society that finds it offensive and that it should not be used .
I did n't realize that , but I do know now ... "
Cω Overview
This section discusses the motivation behind Cω and provides a fairly detailed , yet high - level , account of the main features of the language .
Important : Cω is an experimental research language .
There are no plans to turn it into a commercial language supported by Microsoft .
It is not supported by either the C# or the Visual Studio teams .
There are no plans to integrate it into any product .
Introduction
In the last decade , strongly - typed , garbage collected object - oriented languages have left the laboratory and become mainstream industrial tools .
This has led to improvements in programmer productivity and software reliability , but some common tasks are still harder than they should be .
Two of the most critical for the development of the next generation of loosely - coupled , networked applications and web services are concurrent programming and the processing of relational and semi-structured data .
It is a truth universally acknowledged that concurrent programming is significantly more difficult than sequential programming .
It used to be the case that only highly skilled developers , working on such projects as operating system kernels or the core engines of databases , did non-trivial concurrent programming .
Over time , however , more developers have had to deal with more concurrency .
This began to happen with the arrival of multi-tasking GUIs and multi-user server - side applications , and the initial approach was to encapsulate the concurrency somewhere where the typical application programmer would n’t have to deal with it .
GUI frameworks are typically single - threaded despite the natural concurrency of graphical interfaces , whilst a common approach to concurrency control in server applications is to delegate it to the transactional mechanisms of a database .
However , we believe the arrival of network - centric computing has exposed these palliatives as inadequate .
Even the simplest application now has to simultaneously manage both a GUI and network communications , and locking up a single threaded user interface whilst performing a lengthy remote operation is unacceptable .
As applications perform more remote communications with more remote services , we are increasingly forced to replace synchronous RPC with asynchronous ( one - way ) messaging .
But asynchronous programming is also difficult — incoming messages arrive at unpredictable times and in unpredictable orders , and one naturally ends up needing multiple threads to handle them .
Unfortunately , support for concurrent programming , especially asynchrony , in current mainstream programming languages is weak .
Shared memory concurrency on a single machine , even in modern languages like C# and Java , is handled by 1970s threads and locks model which is implemented entirely in terms of library routines .
Distributed concurrency and asynchronous messaging are handled by different library routines with their own model ; the .NET libraries , for example , include a fairly complex delegate - based API for asynchronous messaging that still offers little support for the hard problem of handling incoming messages .
The current situation with regard to external data is just as bad .
Most web - based ( and many non -web - based ) applications are basically thin interface - generating layers over relational databases ( the `3 - tier ’ model ) .
Yet dealing with relational data from within current languages is messy , error - prone and dangerous .
APIs for database access typically construct SQL queries as strings and return results as untyped collection objects which are deconstructed imperatively .
This makes code lengthy and unreadable , negates much of the benefit of working in a language with strong static safety guarantees and loses much of the advantage of the underlying declarative query language .
Worse still , it is insecure : when query strings are derived from user input , preventing script - injection attacks requires very careful coding .
The other form of external data with which application increasingly have to deal is tree - shaped semistructured data , such as XML documents .
Here again , support for processing such data in current languages is weak .
One either uses an untyped DOM - like representation , giving up static guarantees about conformance to a particular DTD or Schema , or uses an external tool to produce a more strongly typed mapping into the language ’s type system , with an accompanying loss of fidelity , efficiency and genericity in queries .
Even in the DOM case , in which one can more easily support a reusable library of query methods , constructing queries is still significantly more complex than it is in a more domain - specific language such as XQuery .
On the other hand , interfaces from general purpose languages to external XML processing languages are often string - based , with all the same impedance mismatches and security holes as in the SQL case .
Methodology
The design of Cω is based on three principles :
Asynchronous concurrency and processing of relational and semistructured data are sufficiently important that they should be directly supported in a modern general purpose programming language .
The advantages of direct linguistic support include :
Stronger compile - time guarantees .
Intentions and invariants are more apparent in the code .
They become part of the interface rather than being buried in the dynamic flow of control into mysterious library routines .
The compiler has more information and so has the freedom to choose different implementation strategies ( e.g. performing query optimizations ) .
More natural syntax .
Better support from other tools such as editors and debuggers .
We should extend an already - popular language , rather than design a new one from scratch .
The extensions should be principled .
The aim is to take models and lessons learnt from the design of more academic , special purpose languages and try to incorporate them within the mainstream object - oriented framework .
In the case of concurrency , we took ideas from a theoretical model called the join calculus and a join - based concurrent functional language called JoCaml .
In the case of our data extensions , many of the underlying ideas come from functional programming .
Cω Concurrency – The basic idea
In Cω , methods can be defined as either synchronous or asynchronous .
When a synchronous method is called , the caller is blocked until the method returns , as is normal in C# .
However , when an asynchronous method is called , there is no result and the caller proceeds immediately without being blocked .
Thus from the caller ’s point of view , an asynchronous method is like a void one , but with the useful extra guarantee of returning immediately .
We often refer to asynchronous methods as messages , as they are a one - way communication from caller to receiver ( think of posting a letter rather as opposed to asking a question and waiting for an answer during a face - to - face conversation ) .
By themselves , asynchronous method declarations are not particularly novel .
Indeed , .NET already has a widely - used set of library classes which allow any method to be invoked asynchronously ( though note that in this standard pattern it is the caller who decides to invoke a method asynchronously , whereas in Cω it is the callee ( defining ) side which declares a particular method to be asynchronous ) .
The significant innovation in Cω is the way in which method bodies are defined .
In most languages , including C# , methods in the signature of a class are in bijective correspondence with the code of their implementations — for each method which is declared , there is a single , distinct definition of what happens when that method is called .
In Cω , however , a body may be associated with a set of ( synchronous and / or asynchronous ) methods .
We call such a definition a chord , and a particular method may appear in the header of several chords .
The body of a chord can only execute once all the methods in its header have been called .
Thus , when a method is called there may be zero , one , or more chords which are enabled :
If no chord is enabled then the method invocation is queued up .
If the method is asynchronous , then this simply involves adding the arguments ( the contents of the message ) to a queue .
If the method is synchronous , then the calling thread is blocked .
If there is a single enabled chord , then the arguments of the calls involved in the match are de-queued , any blocked thread involved in the match is awakened , and the body runs .
When a chord which involves only asynchronous methods runs , then it does so in a new thread .
If there are several chords which are enabled then an unspecified one of them is chosen to run .
Similarly , if there are multiple calls to a particular method queued up , we do not specify which call will be de-queued when there is a match .
Conclusion
Cω is an experimental programming language intended to make it easier to write the data - intensive distributed applications being written today .
To do so we need to provide application writers with better support for data and control .
Cω contains elegant primitives for asynchronous communication , and offers a strongly - typed integration of the object , relational and semi-structured data models .
A unique event takes place today in a movie theater in the north of Norway .
Using the Swarmplayer software developed by the EU - funded P2P - Next project , for the first time ever a live concert will be broadcasted on the Internet utilizing BitTorrent technology .
The Far North Living Lab was started by the Northern Research Institute ( Norut ) and aims to create a platform for digital creativity .
Earlier this year the lab kicked off with a spectacular experiment in which they used the Tribler BitTorrent client to stream a 2 K resolution film onto the big screen .
For that experiment the stream was only broadcasted to a select group of people and not the entire Internet .
Today , however , the lab ’s researchers will launch their second BitTorrent streaming experiment on a much bigger scale , as they will broadcast a live stream of a live music performance for all the world to see .
“ The setup is very simple at the cinema – we have a standard computer connected to audio and video mixers , which then feeds the P2P network , ” Dr. Njål Borch , a senior researcher involved in the project told TorrentFreak .
The software they use to stream the performance is from the EU - funded P2P - Next project and several of the partners are also donating bandwidth for the experiment to make sure that everything runs smoothly .
The performance will take place at Aurora Kino in Tromsø as a part of the Insomnia electronic music festival .
To spice things up , the lab is also sending a live feed to the Notch festival in Beijing , which is running in parallel with Insomnia , and to Skjervøy kulturhus in the far north of Norway .
However , since the broadcast is public this time , everyone with an Internet connection can tune in .
The only thing required to watch the stream is the Swarmplayer software , or a browser plugin ( Windows only ) .
Both are linked on the project ’s website .
According to Borch , this BitTorrent live streaming experiment is not just a proof of concept , it might eventually play a significant role in the future of live streaming on the Internet .
“ If the scalability is good for live streaming , this can increase the amount of viewers without massive bandwidth bills .
Another effect , which I am currently very much a fan of , is that adding more bandwidth is very easy – put up a seedbox and hand it the torrent .
No administration otherwise necessary , ” he told TorrentFreak .
Anyone who would like to be part of this world premiere can tune in at 5 pm CET when the broadcast will start .
If all goes well you ’ll be able to see a live performance of a new soundtrack to Pudovkin ’s 1926 film , “ Mother ” .
Update :
The broadcast ended and it ’s replaced by a 5 minute clip of the concert so people can still test the streaming technology .
It was a great success with visitors from all over the world .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Earlier this year , the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit think tank , put out a report on how to get traffic moving faster .
They considered lots of the standard solutions — improving signal timing , clearing accidents quickly , encouraging telecommuting , and so forth — and found that many of them could , in fact , provide some temporary congestion relief .
But here ’s the rub : RAND found that over the long haul , these kinds of solutions simply do n’t have much effect on congestion .
They can briefly get traffic moving faster , but just about every improvement in travel time results in … more people taking to the road !
Over the long haul , apparently , most congestion relief efforts sow the seeds of their own destruction .
Says RAND :
[ W ] hen traffic conditions on a roadway are improved during peak hours , additional travelers will tend to converge on that newly freed capacity from ( 1 ) other times of travel , ( 2 ) other routes of travel , or ( 3 ) other modes of travel , slowly eroding the initial peak - hour congestion - reduction benefits in the busiest travel corridors .
Longer term increases in the demand for automotive travel resulting from population growth and economic expansion can further undermine a strategy ’s effectiveness .
This is why we often see , for instance , that flow improves for a short while when new lanes are added to a freeway but usually returns to former levels of congestion within just a few years .
In the end , RAND found that only a few strategies had any significant potential to curb congestion .
The thing these strategies had in common was that they raised the cost of trips on congested routes .
RAND singled out two basic tactics : charging tolls for driving where congestion is heaviest ; and making it more expensive for drivers to park .
See the chart after the jump :
That red oval highlights the only solutions that the study ’s authors believe have any significant potential to fight congestion over the long term .
Sadly , RAND also found that the road pricing solutions — the top two — face huge political and practical obstacles .
Which leaves parking pricing in the sweet spot .
Variable parking rates and parking " cashout " ( more about that ) are relatively easy to implement , and have great long - term benefits for congestion .
Parking cash - out — where employers give workers the option to take a cash payment in lieu of free parking — has real financial benefits as well .
But for all the other congestion - busting ideas out there — well , they might help a bit , at least for awhile .
Over the long run , though , as long as we give road and parking space away for free , we ’ll still be struck in traffic .
PITTSBURGH --
Ben Roethlisberger can get sacked even during an off week .
A scoring change has given the Minnesota Vikings an additional sack of Roethlisberger during Pittsburgh 's 27 - 17 victory on Sunday .
Roethlisberger was sacked four times , giving him 20 for the season .
A play in which Roethlisberger was initially given a 1 - yard loss on a run has been changed to a sack by Minnesota 's Kevin Williams .
Roethlisberger is on pace to be sacked 46 times , as many times as he was dropped last season .
Roethlisberger has been sacked a league - high 212 times since beginning his career in 2004 , 12 times more during that period than the Rams ' Marc Bulger .
No other quarterback has been sacked more than 174 times .

View a timeline of the history of the Tohono O'odham Nation .
Emblems of U.S. , Mexican and Native American life hold equal sway over the members of the Tohono O’odham Nation .
All are carefree this bright September Sunday ; children oblivious and adults content to momentarily forget that their 2.8 million acre reservation , 60 miles west of Tucson and nearly the size of Connecticut , is more than a cultural crossroads .
Five hundred feet away stands the U.S. - Mexico border , which stretches across 75 miles of the reservation .
These borderlands have become a battle zone as illegal immigrants and drug runners push forth into America and the U.S. Government pushes back .
Caught in the middle is the Tohono O’odham , a reluctant participant in a complex political struggle .
As Tristan Reader , director of non-profit tribal organization Tohono O’odham Community Action , said , “ It ’s kind of like living on top of the Berlin Wall . ”
A nation divided
A muddy white truck , cab and bed full of young male tribal members , pulls up to the San Miguel Gate from Mexico .
A Border Patrol gatekeeper asks them for identification .
They do n’t have any so are denied entry .
They turn around slowly , then suddenly accelerate kicking up a cloud of dust and exhaust .
One rider yells back over his shoulder : “ Pigs ! ”
Tension between the O’odham and Border Patrol is commonplace here , said Raymond Valenzuela , a tribal member who lives in one of the nine O’odham settlements south of the reservation in Mexico .
“ See , now they ’re probably just going to go around and jump over the fence , ” he points out .
The San Miguel Gate is an unassuming assembly of barbed wire , wooden pillars and steel poles driven into a bumpy dirt road in a roughly 15 - mile valley between Horse Peak and the jutting Baboquivari Mountains , home of Kitt Peak National Observatory .
Originally a cattle guard , it ’s now one of seven heavily patrolled openings in the fence between Mexico and the reservation .
They ’re not official ports of entry but with a tribal identity card , O’odham can cross anytime , avoiding an hours - long detour to distant entries .
But Valenzuela said he resents having to show ID to traverse his ancestral land .
“ When I was a kid , when I was going to school , we never had this problem , ” Valenzuela said .
“ We came through and the buses dropped us off on the road and we ’d walk home . ”
“ See , now they ’re probably just going to
go around and jump over the fence . ”
The border was bare until the 1970s when a five - strand barbed - wire fence was raised to contain a Mexican mad cow disease outbreak .
Throughout the 20th century , the U.S. moderately patrolled the border there .
But in the 1990s , ramped - up border protection in outlying urban areas — first San Diego and El Paso , Texas , and eventually closer Arizona communities like Nogales , Lukeville and Sasabe — tapered the immigration corridor , funneling illegal activity into the reservation .
Since June 2006 , a series of staggered bollards , barbed wire and Normandy - style vehicular barriers have been under construction to contain the crime .
But the $ 22 million border barrier has been criticized for physically bisecting the tribe , separating the nearly 25,000 O’odham living in the U.S. from some 2000 relatives still living in small Mexican communities .
The O’odham inhabited the vast arid landscape from Sonora to Phoenix for thousands of years until the 1853 Gadsden Purchase scrawled an international borderline across their ancestral lands .
The axiom many O’odham use is “ The border crossed us , we did n’t cross the border . ”
The purchase initially allowed free cross - border movement for the tribal members but today , those traveling by vehicle must stop at the gates .
The government also wanted pedestrian walls .
This was not the intention , though , said Marla Henry , chairwoman of the Chukuk Kuk District , which includes most of the reservation ’s borderline .
“ The vehicle barrier was not meant to stop pedestrians , ” she said “ It was meant to stop vehicles that are transporting humans or drugs . ”
The U.S. Government first approached the tribe with ideas for pedestrian wall , she said — large metal slabs like ones in outlying towns .
But because of the unique nature of their Himdag , the O’odham word for their customs , values and way of life , the idea was shot down and continues to be taboo .
But Valenzuela said it ’s not part of the Himdag to put up fences , at all .
“ It impedes us from coming back and forth freely , ” said Valenzuela , who crosses every day to work as a janitor at a reservation high school and on his days off sells white cheese and tortillas for extra money .
Valenzuela is a wiry , middle - aged man with torn clothing , a dirty mustache and few remaining teeth .
He served in the U.S. Navy for nearly a decade , but moved back to Mexico after he was discharged .
“ When I left and I came back , my grandmother got mad at me and said , ‘ Well why did you join ?
Why did you go in there ?
The white man ’s not going to do anything for you , ’” he said .
“ And here it is , nothing going on for me . ”
Recently , the 2007 U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People again tried for the right to free association across tribal lands .
The U.S. , however , did not adopt the measure .
Despite years of promises to the contrary , it ’s been getting increasingly harder to cross , said Joseph Garcia , Lt. Governor of the tribe ’s Mexican residents .
He has come to believe that the borderline itself , not just the physical barrier , is the problem .
“ Valenzuela is a wiry , middle - aged man with
torn clothing , a dirty mustache and few remaining teeth . ”
“ We say we are one tribe , but essentially the line did create a division , ” Garcia said .
“ It officially endorses that the O’odham are two tribes . ”
Valenzuela added that this outlook generates xenophobia .
Though the tribal Constitution defines O’odham membership by blood not residency , he said his own people often alienate him .
“ O’odham in Arizona are saying , ‘ You guys do n’t belong here … because you ’re O’odham in Mexico .
You ’re Mexican , ’ ” he said .
The two regions have separate governments — a chairman and council for the reservation and a governor on the other side .
But Garcia said the two try to work closely .
Henry said she is adamant about maintaining that relationship , too .
Still , Valenzuela and other O’odham in Mexico live in abject poverty .
Tohono O’odham Community Action , or TOCA , figures show 41.7 percent of all reservation households live below the poverty level but in Mexico , many do n’t have running water , electricity , adequate health care or Social Security like reservation dwellers .
“ And yet I am a U.S. citizen and I have every right ( to these amenities ) , but I ca n’t because of that border , ” Valenzuela said .
If he moved onto the reservation , these problems would be amended , but Mexico is his traditional land and when he dies he believes his spirit will remain there with his ancestors .
“ I want people to see and to know that there still is some O’odham left over here , ” he said .
“ I want my kids to learn that they ’re from here and keep on fighting for the land . ”
There have been some efforts to help .
In 2003 , U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva , D - Ariz. , introduced the Tohono O'odham Citizenship Act into Congress .
If passed it would have granted citizenship to the O’odham in Mexico .
The bill never became law and no similar attempts have been made since .
Next year , cross - border travel may become impossible for those who lack U.S. citizenship .
In June 2009 , the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will mandate that to cross , a U.S. Passport be presented .
“ I ’m worried , ” said Garcia , “ Come 2009 , will the people be able to get passports ? ”
deanna dent
The Department of Homeland Security is working with the tribe to find a solution , said spokeswoman Lisa Reed .
But for now O’odham in Mexico face being decisively cut off from their kin .
Meanwhile , even with the fence , drug and human trafficking continue to devastate the community , endangering some tribal members ’ lives while ensnaring others ’ with easy albeit dirty money .
An ever - present problem
A half - hour drive into the reservation lies a dilapidated , boarded up house and an accompanying shed .
A thin plank of plywood meant to secure the shed ’s entrance has been forced off and shabbily propped back up , held taut by a tattered , flowery loveseat to cover the doorway .
“ KNOCK ! KNOCK ! KNOCK ! ” Andy Pasqual bangs on the timber .
“ Housing !
Come out ! ” he shouts .
No answer .
“ This house is notorious for being used for a drug and illegal ( immigrant ) pick - up , ” says Pasqual , who manages legal services for the reservation ’s Housing Authority .
“ Vacant homes are usually primarily the target for illegal activity . ”
He tosses the couch aside to reveal the shed ’s roughly 8 - foot - by - 8 - foot beat - up interior , littered with remnants of its former squatters —
Mexican - brand products , soiled clothes , empty water bottles and several concrete mix bags that Pasqual said smugglers use to give their cars a weighed - down appearance .
Once they pick up their load , they ’ll leave the bags so savvy Border Patrol agents notice no obvious weight increases to the vehicles .
Pasqual said the ex-residents of the house were found harboring immigrants and drugs .
As a division of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , the tribal Housing Authority is obligated to act .
“ If one of our residents is caught engaging in illegal activity it ’s pretty much an automatic termination of their lease agreement and an eviction from their home , ” he said .
Scores of similarly vacant houses dot the landscape .
The lure of smuggling is ever - present on a reservation with a 2008 per capita income of $ 6,998 , compared with $ 21,994 nationally — the lowest of all U.S. reservations , according to Tohono O’odham Community Action , or TOCA .
The 2008 unemployment rate is close to 70 percent , according to the group .
And O’odham in Mexico who live in even poorer conditions are not above the snare of smuggling , either , said Garcia .
He ’s come across acquaintances with bundles of marijuana .
“ When you do n’t have work and you have your bills to pay and knowing that there are people recruiting , ” he said .
“ It ’s very tempting to people .
It ’s easy money . ”
Border Patrol supervisor for the Casa Grande station , Jose Gonzalez , said it ’s an unfortunate reality that he encounters almost daily .
“ We arrest a lot of tribal members smuggling both immigrants and narcotics , ” he said .
And drug cartels are unrelenting in recruitment and objective , said Tribal Vice Chairman Isidro Lopez .
“ When the drug runners run , they do n’t have but one goal in mind and that ’s to get their drugs across , ” he said .
While it ’s a near impossibility to drive through the vehicular barrier , smugglers have been found dropping their load across to counterparts on foot .
Sometimes , traffickers erect metal ramps and simply drive over .
Although U.S. government figures specific to the reservation are not kept Gonzalez said nearly half of all marijuana seizures nationwide happen in the Border Patrol designated Tucson Sector , of which the reservation comprises nearly a third .
“ When the drug runners run , they do n’t have but one
goal in mind and that ’s to get their drugs across . ”
“ The Tucson Sector has been ground zero for the Border Patrol for the issue of securing our nation ’s borders , ” he said .
In 2007 more than 230,000 illegal immigrants were caught there , he said .
The dry , sandy riverbeds along the borderline are littered with footprints .
Border towns have it worst , said Lopez , because immigrants break into houses — even with residents present — and take clothes , food , water and other essentials .
Years ago , he said , he ’d willingly feed them and give water , but the sheer numbers made that eventually impractical .
“ I ’ve been hostage in my own home , not leaving it because there were about 50 [ illegal immigrants ] right in the area , ” he said .
“ And if I leave , my car leaves , they know nobody ’s home . ”
At one time , Henry said , it was not uncommon to see 100 illegal immigrants cross daily .
Now , they ’ll see maybe 20 a day , but without the border protection , she said it would surely balloon .
“ We ’d be the corridor and we ’d probably see 300 coming through every day , ” she said .
Gonzalez said he ’s been working up to three shifts a week for four years on the reservation .
“ There are some days when you might encounter a group of 20 to 30 and other days when you catch two or three , ” he said , adding that numbers aside , immigration arrests are made every day .
Tribal health services incur immense costs treating ailing immigrants found in the desert .
On a reservation where , according to TOCA , half of all adults have Type 2 diabetes , every penny towards health care is needed .
The reservation is riddled with gang violence , too , and has a homicide rate three times the national average , according to TOCA , yet patrolling the reservation for immigrants and smugglers has cost the Tohono O’odham Police Department over $ 3 million per year since 2001 , said Lopez , who thinks the tribe should be paid back .
“ We have a running tab that the federal government needs to reimburse us , ” he added .
Still , Pasqual said while immigrants may be an expensive nuisance , they generally pose no physical threat to tribe members .
“ They ’re trying to get in quietly .
They do n’t really bother the people , ” he said .
“ The drug traffickers , those are the ones that bother the people . ”
They have made the reservation an even more dangerous place , said Aaron Brown , a Tohono O’odham Police Department detective for more than a decade .
“ When I first came out here … weapons was n’t a major issue , ” he said .
“ Now it ’s normal to find a group with weapons . ”
In October , tribal walkers en route to the Church of St. Francis in Magdalena , Mexico on an annual pilgrimage — an amalgamation of Catholic ritual and native custom — were forced to turn back for fear of their lives .
Sara Williams , a resident of Sells , Ariz. , the reservation ’s capitol , was one of about 160 pilgrims .
She said they made it halfway when they got word from the tribal government that something was wrong .
“ They were saying that walkers were getting shot by the Mexican Mafia , so they advised us to turn around , ” Williams said .

— By Chrystall Kanyuck
The Tohono O’odham government issued an official warning of heightened violence in the area discouraging people from traveling and offering to send vans to pick up those already there .
“ A lot of people were going crazy on the Nation , ” Williams said .
“ They were just worried about the walkers . ”
She and some companions , including a 5 - year - old child , holed up in a small church , she said , cowering from the sounds of gunshots until they could find a ride .
No O’odham ended up injured , but the fear was palpable enough to make them apprehensive about whether to continue the tradition that has endured for more than a century , said Williams .
For her , it ’s not a choice :
She ’s walking for her mother who died without being able to complete her last pilgrimage .
“ Most of us are walking for someone who has passed on , ” she said .
For this reason , Williams said , the pilgrimage will not stop and O’odham persist in their traditions despite dangerous circumstances .
“ Unfortunately it ’s nothing new to the Tohono O’odham Nation , ” she said .
“ A lot of drugs are on our borders .
We understand that . ”
But as the border barrier nears completion , questions of its effectiveness linger .
“ That ’s forthcoming , ” said Brown .
“ Once they complete the fence , in the next few months , to see if that ’s actually going to stop vehicles from coming across …
We ’ll see if it will work . ”
And though the Border Patrol aims to protect the tribe from these threats , many residents complain that agents routinely overstep their bounds .
Culture clash
Angelita Ramon , along with her husband and five children , lives in a sparsely furnished , run-down four - room shanty on a nameless Sells , Ariz . , dirt road unofficially called Poltergeist .
The road ’s namesake is a cemetery adjacent to Ramon ’s house — the same cemetery where within the last decade she has buried her two sons .
The younger committed suicide at age 16 and her oldest , 18 - year - old Bennett Patricio , Jr. , was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle in the early morning hours of April 9 , 2002 .
“ His body was fully crushed from his skull to his feet , ” Ramon said , choking back tears .
They had to put him in a body cast just to bury him , she added .
Ramon is a quiet , stout woman with sad eyes .
She ’s been wearied by years of litigation with the U.S. Government over her son ’s death and has gone broke trying to win the case , selling furniture , clothes and the family car to pay for a trip to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco .
She suspects foul play in the death , but the case was thrown out for lack of evidence .
She plans to appeal again .
“ They had to put him in a body cast just to bury him . ”
Lisa Reed from the Department of Homeland Security said she could n’t comment on ongoing cases , but Ramon said the agent who was driving the truck claimed in court that Patricio had been passed out in the middle of the road and the vehicle could n’t stop in time .
The truth about what happened that night might never be known , but the ordeal has fostered deep distrust of all Border Patrol among the Ramon family .
So paranoid are they , that they carry a police scanner on family outings .
The Ramons are not the only O’odham cynical of agents ' intentions .
Conflict between Border Patrol and tribe members is regular — everything from violence to racism to verbal threats has been alleged .
As planes zoom around the airspace over the reservation and massive patrol SUVs traverse its roads , many tribal members , like former Gu Vo District Chairman Michael Flores , believe the tribe is losing its autonomy .
“ We ’re under military occupation here , ” said Flores , who left his government post over disagreements about allowing Border Patrol on the reservation .
“ We ’re losing our tribal sovereignty on a daily basis . ”
Though the U.S. Government recognizes tribal sovereignty , the reservation is federal trust land , meaning while O’odham can use the land , its ultimate control remains with the federal government .
Agents operate out of two outposts shared with tribal police on the territory , but checkpoints rest at all corners of the reservation .
Cars driving between the U.S. and tribal land are stopped and searched .
Despite his own efforts to curb drug trafficking , Pasqual of the Housing Authority feels at times he gets treated as a suspected smuggler there .

“ Even if I work closely with them , I get harassed by the Border Patrol at the checkpoints because I have a nice car , ” he said .
“ In one aspect we look to the Border Patrol … to protect us , but it seems that in turn , the Border Patrol more or less harasses us . ”
Flores , too , said he has been detained while he was a district chairman — even on the way to tribal government functions .
“ Everybody ’s a suspect over here , ” he said .
“ There ’s a lot of profiling . ”
But Border Patrol supervisor Gonzalez said though they do arrest many tribal members , he knows not all O’odham are criminals .
Tribal Detective Brown admitted there are certain characteristics police and Border Patrol look for .
In such a tight knit community , flashy cars , Hispanics and Caucasians tend to stick out .
“ In some ways you have to profile , ” he said .
He feels the agents are an asset to a community so overrun with smugglers .
“ We do n’t have the manpower to always have somebody there on the border , ” he said .
“ They ’re here to basically assist us with what we need to do , but also keep our borders safe . ”
But it ’s no comfort for Irvin Ramon , Angelita ’s husband , who said family picnics and camping trips get mistaken for illegal immigrant encampments .
“ I remember you could sleep peacefully and not even worry about a thing , ” he said .
“ But now , you go out to camp near a saguaro cactus and you have a whole SWAT team surrounding you . ”
Pasqual said being taken for Hispanic is extremely aggravating .
“ Sometimes , if I ’m in the worst mood , I ’ll look at them and say , ‘ How can you not tell I ’m Native ?
I have every right to be out here , more than the miliga : n’ ” he said , using the O’odham word for Americans .
It ’s this lack of knowledge of O’odham culture that leads to the misunderstandings , said Gonzalez .
When agents first started patrolling the reservation , they knew little , he said .
Now they know , for instance , not to drive off - road , because it desecrates the land and can damage the sacred cacti .
Reed said they now hold regular meetings to address ongoing issues .
To deter further misunderstandings , agents new to the reservation must watch a video about the O’odham culture and Vice Chairman Lopez teaches cultural sensitivity classes .
“ Because the Border Patrol changes its shifts or people that are on the nation every three months , we have to reeducate them on culture sensitivity , and we do that , ” Lopez said .
“ But unfortunately you ’re always going to have bad apples in the bunch . ”
As Pasqual put it , “ A lot of them come into those positions gung ho thinking that this is the Wild West or something . ”
In this case , Reed encouraged any tribal members to voice their grievances .
Formal tribal complaints are directed to the Homeland Security Joint Intake Center in Washington , D.C. , where they are investigated by Internal Affairs , said Reed .
But the problem is that if the officer is reprimanded , privacy laws forbid it from being made public .
Consequently , many tribal members are skeptical that any action is actually taken , said Lopez .
Gonzalez said no terminations stemming from tribal complaints have occurred during the time he ’s worked on the reservation .
He said whereas things used to be much worse , the Border Patrol and the tribe have the best working relationship now that they ’ve ever had .
But tribal members and government alike want the Border Patrol to stay on the border rather than on reservation highways and in villages , said Lopez .

Officials report total tribal enrollment as 28,083 , with 13,469 living on reservation land .
“ There are a couple of legislative council members who say , ‘ Put the Border Patrol on the border , not running around our area or desecrating our lands , ’ ” he said .
Pasqual said the fence could use the added protection considering trafficking persists .
“ If they ’re intent is using that fence as a means of protection for the U.S. , ” he said , “ They need to be guarding the damn thing . ”
And while some amends can be made , other grievances are unforgivable , Flores said .
Early construction of the border fence dug up tribal burial sites .
“ This is causing our way of life to be unbalanced , especially when we have to go rebury our dead , ” he said .
“ It disturbs our minds as well as our hearts and spirits . ”
Irvin Ramon and others now work to shepherd the construction , overseeing the border barrier project to make sure it does n’t happen again .
Yet tribe members like Flores accuse tribal government officials of pandering to U.S. needs instead of challenging American interests detrimental to the tribe .
“ The tribal government is complicit with the ( federal ) government in the way they ’re unbalancing tribal life here , ” he said .
But Chairwoman
Henry said given the history of U.S. - tribal relations , she ’s as distrustful of the U.S. Government as anybody on the reservation .
They ’ll say one thing , but do another , she said .
Though they promise no pedestrian wall for the time being , she ’s unsure that will hold years from now .
And as far as yielding to the U.S. , Lopez said it ’s nothing new .
“ I know the tribal government has given limited waivers of sovereignty , but we ’ll do what we can to protect our sovereignty , ” he said .
“ If you really look at it , the whole United States imposed on our lands a long , long , long time ago . ”
“ Have we conceded to that ? ” he added .
“ We had to unfortunately . ”

Economic historian Niall Ferguson warns that China 's love affair with the dollar is fading faster than anyone realizes .
TechTicker : " The idea they do n't have anywhere else to go or would shoot themselves in the foot if there were a steep decline in the dollar or appreciation of their currency reassures many people in Washington ‘ we can relax ' , " he says .
" An appreciation of the renminbi may reduce value of their international reserves but increases the value of every other asset the Chinese own , " most notably the commodity assets they have been buying all over the world .
China 's " current strategy is to diversify out of dollars and into commodities , " Ferguson says .
Furthermore , China 's recent pact with Brazil to conduct trade in their local currencies is a " sign of the times . "
Perhaps most importantly , China 's massive stimulus program is helping to generate internal consumption in the People 's Republic , meaning local manufacturers are less dependent on exports .
Because of the " rapid growth " of Chinese domestic consumption , Ferguson predicts China 's international trade surplus could be gone by next year .
Welcome to Part 2 of our 4 - Part Series : A Rookie ’s Guide to Buying a Muscle Car !
This series is designed for the person new to the muscle car world .
You know you ’d like to own one , but you have no idea where to start .
We ’ll assume that you want to really like the car as well – even if you are purchasing it as an investment .
Our series will deal with the following topics ( and by the end you ’ll be ready to wheel your new ride down the road ) :
1 ) Determine the make and model you want
2 ) Determine how you want to use the car ( drive often , show car only , etc . )
3 ) Determine your price range and payment method
4 ) Evaluate the car , set up insurance , and purchase
Since we ’ve already deal with Topic # 1 ( Deciding which make and model car to choose ) we can now move on to the next step .
Today ’s topic : Determine how you want to use the car
This portion of your muscle - car - to - be process is a critical one , as when it ’s all said and done ….. what you end up doing with the car is almost the entire reason to purchase one !
Below are the six most common uses of muscle cars today :
Weekend Funmobile
Car Show Winner
Pro-Touring Car ( i.e. – a muscle car that can go , stop , and turn )
Drag Racer
Investment
Drive Anywhere , Anytime
Now that we know what the common uses are , let ’s break those down a bit – and see which one if a fit for you !
Weekend Funmobile :
A car that fits this category is one that you purchase simply for the please of driving it on nice days .
It ’s never going to see snow , and will only see rain if you ca n’t beat the storm clouds home .
It need not have it ’s original engine , transmission , etc. , nor does it need not have a $ 20 K paint job .
It ’s only real goal is to be a reliably running , comfortable driving car that is likely in stock condition with the addition of a set of nice sounding mufflers .
Hop in and take the friends and family over to the Dairy Queen !
Car Show Winner :
A car that fits this category on a consistent basis will either be an all original numbers - matching car ( meaning it has it ’s original engine and transmission ) that is in meticulous condition , or is a modified car – also in meticulous condition .
As a general rule of thumb , the popular models ( Camaro ’s , Charger ’s , etc. ) are a good fit here .
If they are a modified car , the modification will need to be unique and really well done ( it needs to look expensive ) .
This is a car that wo n’t be driven all that much – perhaps only a few times a year .
It ’s main goal is to sit , look pretty , and win you some trophy ’s !
Pro-Touring Car :
A Pro-Touring car is a muscle car modified with some of the latest “ go fast ” suspension , wheels / tires , and braking components required to make a world - class handling cars .
It will likely have some engine mods done as well .
( View products from Heidts , Detroit Speed , Hotchkis , and Griggs to get a general idea of what I am referring to . )
You can purchase an existing car and bolt on the fun parts , or purchase a car that is already modified .
A numbers - matching car in this category is not overly important .
This is a car that you will take autocrossing or to open track events at road courses .
It ’s main goal is to give you the driving experience of a new Corvette with the classic lines of American muscle .
Gas - brake - gas - shift - go !
Drag Racer :
A drag racing car is one …… that you will take drag racing !
This category is fairly straight forward , but is specific to cars that have been purposely modified to run the 1/4 mile .
( As a side note , you can take any car you own to the strip and run it , but a purpose built car will beat you ever time ! )
This car will run free flowing exhaust , a hopped up engine and transmission , will have a sparse interior , and will ( likely ) have a roll cage .
It ’s not one for the faint of heart and DOES need a mechanically inclined owner .
Investment :
An investment car is one that you purchase strictly for it ’s potential growth in value .
You ’re buying it now to sell it later ( hopefully ) at a higher price .
We ’ll still assume that you want to like the car , but truthfully , an investment car simply needs to hit a few ( or most ) of these criteria : be a popular make / model , be a rare model , be all original , be meticulously kept , be well documented , and be in as close to original condition as possible ( it should look like it just rolled off of the assembly line ) .
These are the reaaaaaly high dollar cars you may find at a Barrett - Jackson auction .
Think of cars like original COPO Camaro ’s , Plymouth Superbirds , and BOSS Mustangs .
Drive Anywhere , Anytime :
A drive anywhere , anytime car is one that you would ( almost ) treat just like a regular car , and is essentially a mix - match of the other 5 categories mentioned .
Want to run it to Wal Mart ?
No problem .
Taking a road trip to New York ?
Top off the tank and let ’s go .
Cars that fit this category need not be numbers matching , nor do they necessarily need to have terrific paint and body work .
On the flip side , if money is no object , it can have flawless paint work , a hot engine , great suspension , and still fit this category .
It may or may not be a car that goes to car shows , but it does need to run well , be reliable , and ( above all else ) be incredibly fun and enjoyable to drive .
Which category fits you best ?
Put your thinking cap on .
The next section of our series will help whittle things down even further : “ Determine your price range and payment method . ”
Take your time through this process and give it a lot of thought .
Know this though – somewhere out there a muscle car , which is a perfect fit for you , is waiting on you !

The choice to remove a healthy breast in order to avoid breast cancer is a deeply personal decision -- one that appears to be on the upswing in a specific segment of cancer patients , although there ’s little evidence to suggest it improves survival .
A study published Monday in the journal Cancer found that among women who had cancer in one breast , the number who opted to have the other breast removed , called contralateral prophylactic mastectomy , more than doubled from 1995 through 2005 in New York state .
The number of healthy women who chose to have a prophylactic mastectomy of both breasts because of a higher - than - average risk of developing cancer held steady during that time period .
The practice of removing breasts to avoid cancer is most common among women with a strong family history of the disease and who test positive for the BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2 gene mutation .
The new research is among the first to examine the choice of prophylactic mastectomy among women who actually did have cancer .

Lead author Dr. Stephen B. Edge , a professor of surgery and oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo , N.Y. , says there are no data to demonstrate that having prophylactic mastectomy actually improves survival .
Yet the study found almost 5,000 New York women chose a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy during the 11 - year period , with the number more than doubling from 1995 through 2005 .
“ It really increased dramatically , ” Edge said .
“ We are not making a value judgment that it is good or bad .
But it ’s an important trend .
. . .
The concern is that we have women doing this out of a gut reaction .
No one is really counseling women in detail about their risk .
They have a 10 % to 15 % chance of developing cancer in the other breast in 20 years .
Most likely that cancer would be detected at a very early age .
So does it warrant having the breast removed ? ”
Said Dr. Todd M. Tuttle , chief of the surgical oncology division at the University of Minnesota and the author of a similar 2007 study : “ We ’re not exactly certain why we ’re seeing this trend . ”

One reason is that there is increased awareness of genetic risk and of gene testing , he said .
There has also been a marked improvement in mastectomy and breast reconstruction techniques .
But the trend also coincides with an increase in women who are choosing mastectomy instead of having a less - invasive lumpectomy to remove a breast tumor , Tuttle said .
“ Throughout surgery , there is such a huge push to do procedures that have less scarring , the shortest surgery , the shortest recovery , ” he said .
“ That is true for everything except breast cancer . ”

Can the arts and humanities ' save us ' ?
Clockwise from top left : Gordon Chang , Stephen Hinton , Paula Moya , Jeffrey Schnapp , Harry Elam , Bryan Wolf , Russell Berman , Andrea Lunsford , John Bender , Rush Rehm .
In his New York Times blog " Think Again , " Stanley Fish , a legal scholar and literary critic , recently discussed the purpose of the humanities , concluding : " It is not the business of the humanities to save us , no more than it is their business to bring revenue to a state or a university .
What then can they do ?
They do n't do anything , if by ' do ' is meant bring about effects in the world .
And if they do n't bring effects in the world they cannot be justified except in relation to the pleasure they give to those who enjoy them . "
Stanford Report writer Cynthia Haven recently asked a number of faculty if they agreed .
She also asked them :
What future do you see for the arts and humanities ?
How might the arts and the humanities — in the university setting — retool themselves for the 21st century ?
Stephen Hinton
Professor of Music and Senior Associate Dean for the Humanities
Stanley Fish , who made his scholarly reputation as a deconstructionist literary critic , is well known for painting a picture of the humanities in his own image .
As a public intellectual he performs the role of gadfly : his narrowly circumscribed views of the humanities are valuable to the extent that they provoke people into responding with a more adequate , complete , and satisfying understanding than his own .
( This page is further evidence that the irritation factor of his articles is considerable . )
According to Fish ’s limited understanding , studying literature has little social function beyond vocational training and aesthetic pleasure .
Granted , these pursuits are not without value , but they ’re hardly all the humanities have to offer .
History , religious studies and philosophy , for example , are disciplines that Fish rarely mentions in his columns , if ever .
His stance derives from worldview that was de rigueur during the Cold War period ; its anti-utilitarian underpinnings applied then no less to the theoretical sciences than they did to the humanities .
Looking beyond the confines of mid-20th - century academia , however , it is not hard to see how the humanities , which at Stanford include the arts , have shaped our lives and our history and hence can be justified in countless ways .
The humanities on their own may not be able to save us , as Fish asserts , but we ’d be lost without them .
John Bender
Jean G. and Morris M. Doyle Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies , Professor of English and Professor of Comparative Literature
Stanley Fish ’s notion of the humanities as useless is a product of the era of high modernism during the 1950s and 1960s when he was educated and came to prominence .
This was the moment of the New Criticism in literature and of Abstract Expressionism in painting — both versions of art for art ’s sake .
For Fish , the humanities are about pleasure — the detached pleasure of aesthetic experience for the viewer or reader and , by extension , the pleasure of self - expression by the artist .
The humanities do confer pleasure .
More so than the beauty of mathematics , the symmetry of DNA , or the perfection of nano - writing ?
Fish uses the excuse of pleasure to deny the ways in which philosophy , literature , history and the arts stretch our perceptions and our ideas into realms outside daily experience and thereby enable us to understand everyday life from multiple perspectives .
In short , to make informed judgments .
Why devalue the outcome of training that enables us to present a tightly conceived , crisply written legal brief , a persuasive report , an intricate critical essay or novel — or , for that matter , compellingly designed advertising ?
Not too long ago , the New York Times reported interviews with a number of CEOs who connected their ability as managers to their long - term engagement with books of all kinds , including fiction and poetry .
In the Renaissance , when the term " humanities " originated , literary training ( in Latin ) emerged as necessary not only to the swelling ranks of officers who ran the new modern state but as signs of the wisdom required of kings .
Neither they nor the modern CEOs considered the humanities useless .
Andrea Lunsford
Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor of English , Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric and Louise and Claude Rosenberg Jr. University Fellow in Undergraduate Education
Stanley Fish offers two possibilities :
Either the humanities are meant to " save us " — a position he attributes to Anthony Kronman — or they are " of no use whatsoever . "
Fish takes the latter position , arguing that , rather than being good for something , the humanities " are their own good . "
This dichotomous choice does n't seem necessary , or wise , to me :
The humanities can be " their own good " while also bringing about " effects in the world . "
Fish himself mentions one of these effects — the sheer pleasure that comes from engaging with great beauty , for instance .
But the humanities also bring about other effects :
Through engagement with them , students learn to inhabit multiple worlds and viewpoints ; to analyze with precision ; to communicate with grace and eloquence — indeed , to produce new knowledge of their own , just as they can learn to do through the sciences .
So to Fish 's either / or , I reply rather both / and . "
Russell Berman
Walter A. Haas Professor in the Humanities , Professor of Comparative Literature , Christensen Professor for the Director of the Introduction to the Humanities Program and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
As Fish reminds us , the humanities do not " save us , " but what does , after all , short of faith ?
The humanities can however provide an education to a set of intellectual capacities of great value in life : the ability to understand and interpret , to judge and appreciate , to argue and agree , to speak and write well , and , yes , to find pleasure in thinking .
Our curricula in the humanities can build these abilities in students ; this is hardly a negligible effect in the world .
Of course Fish knows quite well that the humanities provide instruction in , for example , composition and languages .
His genuine target however is research , not teaching , and the case for basic research in the humanities is indeed a tougher one to make than in the sciences or medicine ( although surely not tougher than in the social sciences or law ) .
That he overlooks students is symptomatic of our problem in the research university .
The primary challenge for higher education today — especially in the context of the economic turn — is to reassert the teaching mission , and not only in the humanities .
This means rethinking curricular structures and faculty responsibilities , as well as breaking down the deleterious barrier between graduate education and K - 12 teacher preparation .
Bryan Wolf
Jeanette and William Hayden Jones Professor in American Art and Culture and Co-Director of the Stanford Institute for Creativity in the Arts and the Arts Initiative
Fish is trying to save the humanities from instrumentalization — to justify their existence by having to show measurable results in the world .
In this way , he ’s insisting on the difference between the kind of work the humanities do and the sort of work and results you get in the sciences .
In that way , I applaud his intentions .
But I profoundly disagree with the results of his thinking , which is then to deprive the humanities of all power except pleasure .
In this way , he deeply undersells and underestimates the value that the humanities have .
The humanities encourage ways of thinking that are not defined by hard - and - fast rules , they encourage thinking out of the box , they encourage intuition , they encourage creativity , they place their deepest value on the imagination , and in this way what the humanities offer is not a practical result in the world .
It 's a way of thinking about the world .
And this is at the very core of a first - rate university education .
The arts and the humanities encourage critical thinking , self - awareness , sensitivity to cultures different from our own .
Harry J. Elam Jr
Olive H. Palmer Professor in Humanities , Faculty Director of the Institute for Diversity in the Arts , Robert and Ruth Halperin University Fellow for Undergraduate Education and Senior Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
The problem with Stanley Fish 's quote is that he ignores the histories — ironically even his own — in which art and literature have functioned not as entertainment but as social forces capable of affecting and effecting change .
Through time and across the globe , communities and nations have banned and burned books , imprisoned novelists and executed actors not simply because they questioned a particular work 's " pleasurable " qualities but because they feared the substantive potential of art and literature to influence minds and threaten their social order .
Invariably , in times of social need , one of the most immediate ways that people have employed to address their cause is through art .
Within the legacy of African American experiences with the Unites States and the oppressive conditions that Africans in America confronted on their arrival , art and literature have consistently functioned as forms of resistance .
From the Negro Spirituals that operated as coded messages of escape in times of slavery , to the poems and prose of the Harlem Renaissance to the black revolutionary plays of the turbulent 1960s , black arts have served as important tools within the struggle for liberation .
In the 1980s the culture wars , waged principally around humanities , university campuses from coast to coast reverberated with tension as both Stanford and Stanley Fish , then at Duke , figured prominently .
These events testified to the fact that literature matters and that one of the many things that the humanities can " do " is energize social change and have social consequence .
One need not look any further than the recent presidential campaign in which YouTube videos , songs and artwork galvanized a generation and spread a message of hope .
Jeffrey Schnapp
Much as I welcome Stanley Fish 's refreshing call to free the humanities from the shackles of salvific or spiritualizing rhetoric , I find his polarity of disciplines that do or do n't bring about " effects in the world " cartoon - like .
Even if the humanities had for centuries performed " only " a central role in the development of imagination , taste , critical reasoning and the ability to communicate — consolidated traditional claims — their effect upon society would have to be described as comparable to other disciplinary clusters .
All the more so in an era like our own in which the unparalleled growth of local and global cultural markets has upset the applecart that once rendered " art " and " literature " normative concepts restricted to a small universe of objects .
In such a setting , it 's not that the arts and humanities need to retool themselves .
Rather , they have an opportunity to transcend the " pleasure " paradigm and reassert themselves in a reconfigured public sphere : to communicate expert knowledge outside the boundaries of conventional print - based networks ; to embrace multimediality ; to integrate design thinking , quantitative methods , and project - based learning within the laboratory for the study of the human .
In short , the opportunity to once again do things in public ( not unlike Fish from his digital pulpit ) .
Rush Rehm
Fish 's argument has a distinguished pedigree : Archibald McCleish 's poem " Ars Poetica , " ending " A poem should not mean / But be " ; Kant 's definition of art as " purposefulness without a purpose " in his third Critique ; the Latin phrase " ars gratia artis " ( " art for art 's sake " ) , or in Fish 's version " pleasure [ from art and humanities ] for pleasure 's sake . "
Who has a problem with pleasure ?
If sex must be useful , then I ( as a non-parent ) have failed at that most pleasurable activity .
But recall that " Ars gratia artis " sits arched above the roaring lion in the MGM films .
We read " art for profit 's sake , " and willy - nilly , we find ourselves in the marketplace .
Our pleasures frequently generate someone else 's profit or serve someone else 's interests : the " culture industry , " show business , the university ( not for profit , but increasingly dependent on commercial and political sponsorship ) .
Exxon Mobil offers you Masterpiece Theater ; the Department of Homeland Security sponsors the NewsHour on PBS ; the Department of Defense , Lockheed - Martin and tobacco companies bring you " the research university . "
Many of our pleasures take their toll on other people , whom we may not see or know ( if the system works properly , we wo n't ) .
It can cost them a fortune , assuming that their lives have value .
As we drink our humanities and bathe in our art , we might ask whether our pleasures are so innocently gained .
Fortunately , a lot of great art and the humanities ask the same question , offering pleasures that unsettle and challenge , pleasures ( pace Professor Fish ) worth acting on .
Gordon Chang
The humanities cannot be reduced to something utilitarian or approached for their capacity to affect the world directly as we see and understand it .
The humanities have always been about something more and grander , if less immediately tangible .
The humanities and art are about human conditions and experiences beyond numbers and policies .
We all know this to be unassailably , if not always obviously , true :
The presidential inaugural has prayer , poetry and music .
Our contemporary world is changing more quickly than we can comprehend and even fully appreciate .
Old categories , boundaries , rubrics and disciplines cannot contain as they once could .
They cannot even contain the past — so much historical study today is about challenging , transcending , erasing and crossing boundaries .
In our current circumstances , the supposed luxury of the humanities and the creative arts is pretty " cost - effective " stuff .
Asking the humanities to " re-tool " themselves , to improve their instrumentality , then , is simply the wrong question .
Those in the humanities and arts certainly need to think about what it is they do , but more importantly , the question that should be asked is , Why and how is it that the humanities and arts need to justify themselves today ?
Asking the question this way might beg the answer .
Paula Moya
The business of the humanities — if one wants to put it that way — is the study of art , music , literature , religion , history and philosophical thought .
Whether this " business " has a future in the 21st century is a question that begs several others :
Is history less relevant to our understanding of the contemporary situation than it ever was ?
Have music and art lost their power to inspire , provoke , and express humankind 's deepest yearnings ?
Have our concepts and myths become unmoored from those of past civilizations ?
Has human imagination lost its generative capacity with respect to the development of new technologies ?
The answer to all these questions , I suggest , is no .
The humanities are no more and no less than the study of human meaning over time , even into the future .
By contrast , to ask the humanities to " do " something — in the sense that a particular action will produce a predictable result — is to fundamentally misunderstand both the purpose of the humanities and the complexity of human meaning .
The humanities do not " do " anything that one can easily measure and quantify .
But to suggest that they therefore have no significant effects in the world is to be provocative without reason or validation .
After watching an event like this it is hard to remember all the different floats and participants .
Looking back on these photos I felt like I had seen the event twice .

Vid US - based arms 'n' airliners globocorp Boeing has released video of its aircraft - mounted ray cannon , the Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) in operation .
The company does n't say how far the carrying Hercules transport plane was from the target vehicle in the vid , but there 's no audible engine noise on the soundtrack , suggesting that it was some distance off .
In the offered clip the laser beam does n't seem to penetrate the vehicle 's bonnet , but Boeing have previously announced that the ATL has " defeated " a stationary vehicle in tests , so it could be assumed that the blaster - gun is capable of doing so .
The ATL is the smaller of Boeing 's two airborne deathray projects : the larger , the jumbo - jet mounted Airborne Laser ( ABL ) is said to be in the megawatt range and is intended to destroy intercontinental missiles boosting up through the atmosphere , beaming them out of existence from hundreds of kilometres away .
The ATL has no such clearly - defined purpose , but it has been speculated that it could be used as a silent , invisible , traceless sniper .
The carrying aircraft might be hidden by distance or darkness , and selected enemies of America - or cars , buildings , cell towers etc - would appear to suddenly and inexplicably burst into flame .
Or at any rate suffer a nasty burn , going by the vid above .
Lending credence to such ideas is the fact that the ATL has been developed under the auspices of the Special Operations Command , the USA 's secret , deniable military elite .
Ray - weapons probably wo n't be a tool for every day , however .
The current lasers run on dangerous chemical fuels , and hints dropped by Pentagon scientists suggest that the length of time the beam can be kept burning without costly and troublesome replenishment is distinctly limited .
In most situations a conventional AC - 130 gunship or a helicopter sniper would be more useful .
And a lot cheaper . ®

I do n’t often read Sydney ’s Sunday Telegraph .
But this week ’s headline – Bosses ’ salary bonanza – caught my eye .
So I shelled out $ 1.80 to read what this was about .
And sure enough they were right .
At the time of the greatest downturn since the Great Depression , the bosses have been increasing their pay .
The Sunday Telegraph put it this way :
Of the 32 top 100 Australian companies to have reported from the last financial year , 18 CEOs have taken pay rises averaging 10 percent .
Just to put this in perspective , over the same financial year the Australian share market fell 25 per cent .
Company profits fell 18 percent .
But the real obscenity is that while our bosses were paying themselves even more for the failures of their system , that same system froze the pay of low paid workers .
Ten percent for the filthy rich bosses , nothing for the low paid .
That really does sum up the obscenity that is capitalism .
On top of that , for those who do keep their job , reduced hours means a cut in real take home pay .
While we are going backwards the bosses are racing ahead .
The sums involved are mind boggling .
The average salary of the top 32 companies that have reported so far is $ 1.8 million , and that ’s before bonuses and benefits .
These extras can increase remuneration five fold .
The Sunday Telegraph did mention in the ensuing article , Crisis - proof pay packets , that its owner , Rupert Murdoch , had kept his base salary steady at $ 9 million .
News Limited has plummeted in value over the last year .
Clearly remuneration for Rupert is n’t linked to results .
Rod Quinn retired last financial year as CEO of Qantas .
He received nearly S11 m for 5 months work .
Qantas has sacked 1750 workers and is outsourcing more work .
Its profit fell 88 percent .
Quinn made $ 100,000 a day .
As Alan Kohler quipped on ABC TV , Quinn ‘ earned ’ the average wage before lunch .
Not bad for a morning ’s work .
The Telegraph article also mentioned Marius Kloppers , the head of BHP Billiton .
His salary is $ 2.4 million .
The average wage is $ 60,000 .
How is anyone worth 40 times more than the average worker in their company ?
But it gets worse .
Klopper ’s ‘ total remuneration package ’ went from $ US6,873,642 in the previous year to $ US 10,399,589 last year .
This is a 51 percent increase .
Marius is worth 200 times more than the average worker in BHP Billiton .
Really .
Ad what did this super genius preside over ?
A drop in profit of 61 percent .
So for Marius it is a 50 percent increase in remuneration .
And for his low paid workers ?
Nothing .
Zilch .
Sweet fuck all .
That ’s for those who Marius kept on .
This parasite also sacked 3000 workers .
This bloodsucker and his draculean mates are being rewarded for sacking people .
Do n’t tell me class is dead .
There is no regulation of these obscene salaries , sorry , remuneration packages .
Evidently we have to attract the best people to oversee a 25 percent fall in value .
Imagine what might have happened if these vultures on our labour had n’t been in charge .
Compare the lack of regulation of the bosses ’ pay with the plethora of laws workers have to abide by to get a pittance , or in the case of low paid workers , nothing .
Howard ’s Workchoices legislation was over 600 pages long – all of it designed to prevent workers and their unions winning better pay and conditions .
Labor ’s Fair Work Australia is another marathon of dribble .
It has the same goal as Workchoices , namely to stop workers fighting for and winning real wage increases and better conditions , but with an element of agreement and negotiation thrown in .
Evidently it is OK to attack wages and conditions as long as our trade union leaders agree to it .
Maybe we should turn the world upside down .
Let unions and their members have a free hand to win whatever wage increases they can above guaranteed consumer price index increases .
Instead of screwing the low paid let the ‘ Fair ’ Pay Commission determine what level of remuneration the profit bludgers should get .
The average wage seems about right to me .
Think about that for a moment : even if we eliminate 100 % of all carbon emissions today , worldwide ... the existing CO2 in the air will still take us all to a planet where no human being has ever lived .
Determining long - ago levels of CO2 in the air is tricky business .
The most straightforward way to do it is with ice cores .
As snow falls , it traps little pockets of air that get squeezed down into tiny bubbles within what eventually becomes ice .
If that ice is very old -- like in Greenland or Antarctica -- you can open up those bubbles and measure the gases within them directly , from the time when the snow originally fell .
The problem is that even the deepest ice cores in Antarctica only go back 800,000 years .
Beyond that , you need to use a proxy of some kind .
And up till now , those proxy indicators have been pretty fuzzy .
Author Tripati and her colleagues used the ratio between boron and calcium in fossil shells of formanifera ( a type microscopic marine life ) as their new proxy .
They were able to validate this proxy using the existing well known ice cores during the past 800,000 years , and showed that their technique had an error of only 14 ppm , vastly superior to any previous proxy method .
Then they were able to reconstruct the CO2 levels much farther back using the same proxy .
This confirms what most have long suspected : the current CO2 levels are higher than at any time in many millions of years -- long before the evolution of human beings , or of most of the species we rely upon for food .
The good news is , it takes a while for the oceans to warm up .
The bad news is , we 're not doing anything -- or not nearly enough -- to prevent it .
Abstract from Science Express :
Here .
New research from Northumbria University claims that homicide rates are closely linked to the form of political economy that runs a nation .
Senior Lecturers , Dr Steve Hall and Dr Craig McLean , state in the latest Theoretical Criminology that homicide rates are significantly higher in nations with neo-liberal policies and where free market forces are dominant , such as the USA , but are significantly lower in nations governed by social - democratic policies which still characterize most Western European nations .
Yes , it 's science data mapped to a socialist agenda topology - except even in the USA the government controls 50 % of the wealth so it can hardly be considered a capitalist free - for - all .
Historically , says
Hall , homicide rates are at their lowest when social - democratic policies govern nations .
He says the US homicide rate was halved in the decades following the Depression , when the social democratic policies of the New Deal replaced free - market policies - ignoring the fact that millions of young people were also at war .
The nation experienced an initial rise in the mid-60s , when the nation ’s second generation social democratic project , The Great Society , came into being which created a welfare component of society and then gave way sharp increases during the ‘ crime explosion ’ of the mid-80s and early 90s which followed Reagan ’s abrupt introduction of more free - market economic policies with a more liberal approach to criminals and rehabilitation .
Rates were eventually brought down in the late 90s .
Some credit imprisoning large numbers of violent offenders while others say liberal abortion policies led to fewer single mothers , who were implicated as more likely to raise criminal children .
In Britain , hall says the homicide rate has almost tripled since its historical low point in 1956 , despite strict gun control for law - abiding people .
These figures are even worse in areas blighted by job losses in the 1980s which have stayed in permanent recession .
Hall claims that some of these areas have become breeding grounds for alternative forms of criminal ‘ employment ’– prostitution , loan - sharking , drug - dealing and distributing stolen goods .
Those results do not show up on either the Police nor British Crime Survey statistics , Hall concedes , but chooses to include such ' soft ' statistics as part of the conclusions .
In some of the former industrial areas and inner cities - the authors blame Margaret Thatcher along with Reagan , of course - homicide rates are six times higher than the national average .
They contrast this with Western European cities where the homicide rate is much closer to their national averages .
In the current recession , they say property crime is already on the increase and the authors predict there will be a rise in career criminality , particularly as the UK has the highest number of young people not in work , education or training in Europe .
Hall lays most of the responsibility for higher crime rates at the door of ' neo- liberals ' who claim competitive individualism and greed can be stimulated and harnessed to create wealth , in contrast to full - on Marxism or socialism .
That might be true , he argues , but it also corrodes our ability to empathize with others .
Hall said , " Britain and the US have the worst violent crime rates of the industrialised west – far worse than Western continental Europe – because we have the most competitive , individualist culture and the least developed sense of solidarity and common fate .
In addition , consumer culture instils in so many individuals from an early age that their identities are incomplete without the status symbols carried by consumer goods , which of course makes crimes an attractive option for those who simply cannot afford to buy these goods . "
His statistics are skewed by his politics .
England , Wales and Scotland are 1,2 and 3 in violent crime among all western nations and gun control opponents argue it is because law - abiding people are no longer allowed to protect themselves from criminals , not a result of Margaret Thatcher 's economics .
Hall and McLean have conducted their research as part of a long - term study of the criminal community in the North East of England .

In an article entitled Dark Minds :
When does incredulity become paranoia , Psychology Today writer John Gartner attempts to make the case that the concerns of “ conspiracy theorists ” are not based in reality but are a product of mental instability , while himself fulfilling every criteria for what he claims classifies such people as psychotics – ignoring evidence that contradicts his preconceptions while embracing the ludicrous “ conspiracy theory ” that powerful men and governments do not conspire to advance their power .
Probably somewhat upset about how our coverage of the dangers associated with the swine flu vaccine has contributed to a global revolt against mass vaccination programs being readied , Psychology Today ’s gravy train of big pharma advertisers will no doubt be pleased to see the publication wastes no time in savagely attacking radio host and film maker Alex Jones , dispensing with any notion of fairness and zealously going after him as early as the second paragraph .
The nature of this vicious hit piece ( PDF link ) is confirmed when Gartner laments that Jones refused to provide him with phone numbers for friends he grew up with , presumably frustrated that he could n’t dig up some dirt from an old girlfriend to throw into the mix of what is nothing more than a personal attack on Jones ’ character , and a complete departure from any debate about the issues Jones covers on his radio show , which is the phony pretext that Gartner used in order to secure the interview in the first place .
Gartner has trouble believing that eugenicists occupy powerful positions , even in the aftermath of the John P. Holdren story when Obama ’s top science advisor was exposed as having advocated forced abortion , sterilization and mass drugging of the public .
Despite the fact that we sent Gartner dozens of pieces of evidence for his article , he cites a single national security memorandum and dismisses it as “ a bland policy report ” .
Mr. Gartner was obviously too lazy to read the entire document and / or too stupid to comprehend it .
The document to which he refers is National Security Study Memorandum 200 , a 1974 geopolitical strategy document prepared by Rockefeller ’s intimate friend and fellow Bilderberg member Henry Kissinger , which targeted thirteen countries for massive population reduction by means of creating food scarcity , sterilization and war .
The document , declassified in 1989 , identified 13 countries that were of special interest to U.S. geopolitical objectives and outlined why population growth , and particularly that of young people who were seen as a revolutionary threat to U.S. corporations , was a potential roadblock to achieving these objectives .
The countries named were India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Nigeria , Mexico , Indonesia , Brazil , the Philippines , Thailand , Egypt , Turkey , Ethiopia and Colombia .
The study outlined how civil disturbances affecting the “ smooth flow of needed materials ” would be less likely to occur “ under conditions of slow or zero population growth . ”
“ Development of a worldwide political and popular commitment to population stabilization is fundamental to any effective strategy .
This requires the support and commitment of key LDC leaders .
This will only take place if they clearly see the negative impact of unrestricted population growth and believe it is possible to deal with this question through governmental action , ” states the document .
The document called for integrating “ family planning ” ( otherwise known as abortion ) with routine health services for the purposes of “ curbing the numbers of LDC people , ” ( lesser - developed countries ) .
The report shockingly outlines how withholding food could be used as a means of punishment for lesser - developed countries who do not act to reduce their population , essentially using food as a weapon for a political agenda by creating mass starvation in under - developed countries .
“ The allocation of scarce PL480 ( food ) resources should take account of what steps a country is taking in population control as well as food production , ” states the document .
Later in the document , the idea of enforcing “ mandatory programs ” by using food as “ an instrument of national power ” is presented .
This is the quintessential example of powerful men conspiring to use eugenicist policies in order to advance their power .
Gartner ’s lazy claim that the document is just a “ bland policy report ” is manifestly absurd .
[ efoods ]
This is n’t a conspiracy theory , this is n’t a “ connection ” that we invented out of fresh air to make our brains release dopamine , as Gartner ’s bizarre hit piece goes on to claim , it ’s there in black and white , but Gartner has either failed to read the whole document or has performed his own act of psychological gymnastics and summarily dismissed the evidence because it does not fit with his preconceptions – the very charge he levels at “ conspiracy theorists ” in his hit piece .
Gartner says conspiracy theorists are “ immune to evidence ” and yet he displays that very trait in this instance .
It is n’t long before Gartner regurgitates the tired old cliche about people needing to create conspiracy theories and some semblance of order to make themselves feel better in a chaotic world .
He even claims that “ finding meaning in sometimes insignificant events ” creates dopamine , an overproduction of which can lead to schizophrenia .
Of course , none of this has any relation whatsoever to powerful people planning the future of the planet that they rule ( a ridiculous “ conspiracy theory ” in Gartner ’s mind ) , but Gartner ’s objective is n’t to disprove the claims of Alex Jones in a logical manner , it ’s to denounce the messenger using convoluted and ham - fisted psychological rhetoric that is n’t even applicable .
But what ’s good for the goose is good for the gander .
The greatest purveyors of myths and “ conspiracy theories ” about political events have and always will be authorities and governments .
Scientists who recently investigated why so many people believed the falsehood that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 found that Americans wanted to believe that Iraq was connected to 9/11 because it helped them make sense of current reality .
How is that any different from the claim that conspiracy theorists invent connections to help them better comprehend current events ?
Beyond the accusations of who invents what to justify their worldview – conspiracists and debunkers alike – are the facts .
History is littered with political conspiracies that actually happened and were not the manifestation of unstable minds .
Indeed , history tells us that the bigger the lie , the bigger the conspiracy , the more likely the masses are to believe it , and governments throughout the ages have harnessed this trick to pursue their agendas since time began .
In such an environment , those who aggressively question the official authodoxy , or “ conspiracy theorists ” as Gartner labels them , should be welcomed as a key bulwark against the kind of tyranny and oppression that has blighted the world at numerous intervals in the past , aided in no small part by the quack psychologists in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany that classified skepticism of the state as a mental illness , an implication Gartner regurgitates in his hit piece .
It was not deception on behalf of “ conspiracy theorists ” that convinced Germans to follow Adolf Hitler , the lies that built the Nazi tyranny came directly from the state .
It was not the beliefs of “ conspiracy theorists ” that hoodwinked Americans into thinking Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , that particular “ big lie ” came directly from the lips of the President of the United States .
“ We ’re all conspiracy theorists to some degree , ” writes Gartner and never has a truer word been spoken .
Gartner has to be the biggest conspiracy theorist of all because he seems to hold the ludicrous belief that powerful men do not get together and plan things , which in Gartner ’s mind is a viewpoint indicative of a psychotic mind .
As is always the case , the debunker , in this case Gartner , completely fails to grasp that his stance is completely out of touch with modern day sentiment .
He poses as some kind of authority figure casting down his disdain upon the bedraggled minority of “ conspiracy theorists ” below , yet he is in the minority .
It is Gartner ’s twilight zone world of angelic governments who commit no sin except within the twisted minds of dangerous psychotics , in light of admitted conspiracies that continue to be exposed on an almost daily basis – the phony terror alerts , the cronyism of the banker bailout , the torture scandal , that represents a genuine display of psychotic thinking .
Gartner is really scraping the barrel when he unearths a 7 - year - old incident about a disturbed man attempting to enter Bohemian Grove carrying guns in an effort to portray conspiracy theorists , an in particular Alex Jones , as a physical danger to society .
In reality , the kind of warped thinking that Gartner embraces , that skepticism of government is a form of mental illness , is one of the most dangerous threats to a free society that ever existed .
As we have seen before in history , the designation of political opinions deemed to be antagonistic towards or even merely skeptical of the state as a psychological illness is a hallmark of tyranny .
In the former Soviet Union , psikhushkas — mental hospitals — were used by the state as prisons in order to isolate political prisoners , discredit their ideas , and break them physically and mentally .
The Soviet state began using mental hospitals to punish dissidents in 1939 under Stalin .
According to official Soviet psychiatry and the Moscow Serbsky Institute at the time , “ ideas about a struggle for truth and justice are formed by personalities with a paranoid structure . ”
Treatment for this special political schizophrenia included various forms of restraint , electric shocks , electromagnetic torture , radiation torture , lumbar punctures , various drugs — such as narcotics , tranquilizers , and insulin — and beatings .
Anne Applebaum , author of Gulag : A History , indicates that at least 365 sane people were treated for “ politically defined madness , ” although she surmises there were many more .
These kind of “ treatments ” for the “ mental illness ” of being a conspiracy theorist or merely being skeptical of government were brutally enforced by quack psychologists in both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany , a fact that Gartner , trapped in his bubble of delusion and ignorance of any evidence that contradicts with his preconceptions , claimed to be completely unaware of when we confronted him with it .
Quack psychologists like Gartner who define distrust of authorities and alternative explanations for the “ official story ” put out by governments who have repeatedly proven themselves to be liars as a form of psychosis are themselves as mentally unstable as their much vaunted peers – people like the insane cocaine addict Sigmund Freud and the Nazi child abuser Alfred Kinsey – and represent a far greater danger to society than the “ conspiracy theorists ” that they so readily seek to denigrate .

8. Enter Ed Murrow , an Innately Elegant Man in an Innately Inelegant Profession
In 1937 a job opened up for a head of CBS European division .
It was , in effect , a business job , involving scheduling prominent Europeans for CBS broadcasts .
It was not a journalistic job at the start .
For a time it appeared likely to go to a young man named Fred Willis , who was charming , sociable , and graceful .
A colleague asked Willis about the rumor , since the job was considered something of a plum .
No , answered Willis , he had thought it over , but he wanted a real future at the company , and the one thing he was sure of was that you should never be that far from headquarters .
So the job went instead to Edward R. Murrow .
Murrow .
The right man in the right place in the right era .
An innately elegant man in an innately inelegant profession .
A rare figure , as good as his legend .
His presence was so strong that it still lives .
In many ways , because he was what he was , CBS News is today what it is .
He was shy and often withdrawn in personal conversation , but totally controlled and brilliant as a communicator .
His voice was steeped in civility , intelligence , and compassion .
He was a man who , much as Lindberg did , spanned the oceans and shortened distance and heightened time .
He helped make radio respectable as a serious journalistic profession , and more than a decade later , simply by going over to television , had a good deal to do with making that journalistically legitimate too .
He was , in a way , more an educator than a journalist .
His own career and the technological revolution he was part of helped mark America 's transformation from a post -Depression isolationist nation to a major international superpower .
His very voice bridged the ocean , brought Europe ( and thus potentially threatening alien powers ) closer , and made its presence more immediate and more complicated .
He helped educate the nation in the process of entering the larger world .
He also helped inaugurate an era in which the very speed of communication became a form of power .
His was a unique coming .
No other broadcast journalist has ever accumulated the prestige that Murrow enjoyed both inside and outside the company .
There were many reasons for this .
For one thing , radio broadcasting was so embryonic that while Murrow was proving to be so good and the story proving to be so important , his employers had not yet developed the sort of complicated internal checks that might keep him down or limit him .
Quite the reverse .
As his comet ascended , so did that of CBS .
The network was the direct beneficiary of his excellence , so there was little desire to restrain him , or to set narrow limits of objectivity .
He was reporting on the survival of the English - speaking peoples , on the democracies versus the Nazis .
Britain 's finest hour also became his and American radio's finest hour .
In less heroic and more dubious wars ( Korea and Vietnam come to mind ) , where American survival was not at stake , no American commentator made a similar reputation .
And , in Vietnam , those correspondents who did make considerable reputations also became controversial , respected by some of the elite and by their peers , but loathed by the government , and often something of an embarrassment to their own companies .
Murrow was an ornament to management .
His role and the nature of the war allowed him to accumulate enormous capital both within the company and within the profession .
His subsequent and hardly hasty decision to expend some of that capital and to be a comparably tough - minded correspondent on the domestic scene created tension and quickly marked the parameters of freedom within broadcasting in the 1950s .
He was the same Murrow with the same high standards , but year after year he became less and less of a corporate asset .
Murrow was not a trained journalist , and this was an advantage , because there is a great difference between the words and rhythms of print journalism and the words and rhythms of spoken English .
That being the case , he had nothing to unlearn .
The spoken word is colloquial ; print journalism , when read aloud , is stilted and forced , deprived of its natural balance .
Murrow was descended from southerners who had moved to Far West , and his family retained a sense of fashioned High English , an almost poetic language which is fast disappearing from the land .
Words were important by themselves .
As a young man he had worked as a logger among tough lumbermen of the Northwest , and this rough company not only expedited the changing of his name from Egbert to Edward , but gave him an appreciation the intelligence and shrewdness of ordinary people and how to talk to them .
Later he studied drama and voice with some excellent teachers at Washington State University , and this honed his sense of timing and rhythm .
One speech teacher in particular , Ida Lou Anderson , had sensed his potential , later , when Murrow was in London , she suggested the pause in his " This .
. .is London " trademark .
Unlike most correspondents , he knew that pauses and the absence of words could be as important as the words themselves .
He had just the right touch , enough drama in his voice to make what he was saying unusually effective , but not so much as to sound like a phony or a ham .
His was a natural sense of the drama of his medium .
Once , during the Blitz , Murrow held a microphone on the sidewalk during severe German bombing in order to convey the sound of what he was describing — the order and calm with which the British walked to their bomb shelters .
He was not an intellectual ; many of the men hired —
Sevareid , Kendrick , Smith , Schoenbrun — were far more cerebral than he .
But he was an excellent communicator ; he had the ability to take something that was happening in one part of the world and make it comprehensible and significant to people living thousands of miles away .
His talents were special but were not necessarily those of a brilliant man , for brilliant men often end up talking only to themselves .
Rooted as he was the middle class , Murrow could understand the complicated pressures of a shrinking world .
Again and again he taught younger reporters at CBS to try to envision their friends back home , try to picture themselves standing at the bar or some other local hangout and , over one or two drinks , explaining what they had seen that day .
His passion was not for the scoop but for intelligence , for the audience to understand what was going on in the world .
That was the educator in him .
A changing map of Europe and Asia had to he explained to the average citizen .
His first job at the network was running its educational service , a job in which , among other things , he helped bring European intellectuals to America .
To Murrow , education was a paramount purpose of news reporting .
In 1945 , after the war was over , he had been impressed with the knowledgeability of a bright young interpreter at Eisenhower 's headquarters named David Schoenbrun .
Murrow asked Schoenbrun
What he planned to do when the war was over .
Schoenbrun said he hoped to go back to teaching high school French .
Murrow paused for a moment .
" Kid , " he asked , ' how would you like the biggest classroom in the world ? "
Murrow went to Europe as CBS European director in 1937 .
Early in 1938 came Hitler 's Anschluss , the take - over of Austria .
CBS sent Murrow as a businessman , not as a broadcaster , but he was quickly caught up in events .
The best American journalists were then in Europe — John Gunther , Bill Shirer .
H. R. Knickerbocker , Jimmy Shecan , Dorothy Thompson .
Murrow was inevitably drawn into their company .
When Hitler moved into Austria , Murrow became a journalist overnight .
Life itself was speeding up .
The speed and totality with which Hitler came to power had been accelerated by science and technology and radio .
Even the word for the kind of war Hitler employed , Blitzkrieg , implied an awesome swiftness against which the French Maginot Line could not stand .
A man with radio at his disposal could report back with special immediacy to his own country , thousands of miles away : and he could reach a mass audience .
In 1938 America watched and waited on events in Europe , and millions of Americans watched and waited with Ed Murrow .
In the first major magazine piece written about Murrow , a perceptive article in Scribners magazine in December , 1938 , a young writer named Robert Landsy sensed the coming of a new journalistic order .
He [ Murrow ] has more influence upon America 's reaction to foreign news than a shipful of newspapermen .
This influence has not been generally recognized for the reason that newspaper correspondents have tradition on their side , and partly because the networks have played up their commentators rather than their correspondents [ like Murrow ] .
But the influence is there , great and growing — and obvious to anyone who knows both radio and the press .
Murrow has three advantages over correspondents for the greatest America newspapers : 1 . He beats the newspapers by hours .
2 . He reaches millions who otherwise have to depend on provincial newspapers for their foreign news .
3 . He writes his own headlines .
That is to say he emphasizes what he wishes — whereas the newspaper correspondent writes in cablese — then has his copy edited , maybe rewritten and then published under a bank of headlines in which he has no say .
9 . The Murrow Boys at War : What Price Glory ?
Murrow set out to hire what quickly became a first - rank team of American foreign correspondents .
William L. Shirer had been covering Germany since the rise of Hitler .
He was exactly the kind of informed , intelligent journalist that Murrow was seeking .
Shirer wrote of their meeting in his diary for August 20 , 1937 .
“ I have a job .
I am to go to work for the Columbia Broadcasting System .
That is , if ...
I have a job if my voice is all right … who ever heard of an adult with no pretense to being a singer or any other kind of artist being dependent for a good interesting job on his voice .
And mine is terrible . "
Shirer was absolutely right about his voice ; it was terrible , and he had no sense of timing in his radio writing .
CBS headquarters was much taken with Murrow 's first correspondent , and finally Murrow had to cable Klauber asking whether CBS wanted a pretty voice or a great journalist .
Murrow carried the day ; substance triumphed over style .
The CBS men hired by Murrow became what one colleague , not entirely admiringly , called a special kind of philosopher - king - intellectual - statesman - journalist .
Other stars soon : followed — Sevareid and Smith and Collingwood — but Shirer was the first .
He and Murrow covered the Anschluss together in 1938 .
As the importance of events mounted , as more points on the map needed coverage and more reporters were hired , the CBS World News Roundup was born .
Night after night , as the tension increased and Hitler threatened the peace of the world , the story came to America as Kaltenborn in New York , anchoring the show , came on and began : " Calling Ed Murrow , calling Ed Murrow … ”
After Hitler took Poland in 1939 , and swept across France in 1940 , Murrow moved to London .
There his voice became the link between England and America .
Most politicians of the generation ( with the exception of Hitler and Roosevelt , and later , Churchill ) scorned or were slow to understand radio ; like most of the intelligentsia , they still thought print the important medium .
But the British at every level were acutely aware of ' Murrow ’s power and influence .
Their necks were on the chopping block and they knew exactly what he was saying , for many of his broadcasts were re-played for the British Armed Forces .
It was a source of encouragement to the British to know that this was what America was hearing .
Murrow was perfectly cast for the role and for the moment .
It was a dark and somber time , and he had a dark and somber vision of mankind and of himself .
He had warned his wife , Janet , before their marriage to beware of his depressions and his despair , his black periods .
" Ed , " Janet Murrow said of him , " is a sufferer . "
He sometimes seemed anxious to bear all of mankind 's burdens .
Once , during World War II , Paul White in the CBS office in New York called the London BBC office to locate Murrow .
Was he there ?
" Oh , yes , " said the Englishman , " he 's somewhere around here wearing his customary crown of thorns . "
He was the Puritan who was never at ease with his own success .
He put himself under terrible pressure .
Once , during World War II , his colleague Bill Downs heard so much noise in a French farmhouse where they were staying overnight that he thought German troops were downstairs .
It was simply Murrow grinding his teeth .
He was always gracious , but always private .
Despite impeccable manners , he kept everyone at a distance .
He might reveal , to close friends , his thoughts , but never , if possible , himself .
He came from the kind of semi-Calvinist home , said his friend Sevareid , " where there were too many rules and not enough love . ”
He was always just short of being formal , in tone and dress .
The clothes were expensive , the cuff links very fancy .
Any other journalist dressing like Murrow would have seemed a fop .
He had , Charles Collingwood later learned , almost decided against hiring the young Collingwood because the first time they met , Collingwood , who fancied himself a young man about town , was sporting a pair of very loud argyle socks .
Murrow was not entirely sure a man in socks that loud was proper for CBS , Rhodes scholarship or no .
He was acutely aware of his dignity and appearance .
He was a fine wing shot and quite willing and eager to hunt with the British on their great estates .
But , like many boys of that era who had grown up poor , he could not swim and no one could get him in a bathing suit or near the water .
Once , at the height of Murrow 's fame , he and Sevareid were about to board a plane at LaGuardia and Sevareid was rather sloppily eating a bag of popcorn .
For Murrow it seemed beneath their respective dignities , and he deliberately walked several yards ahead , to be dissociated from popcornism .
The British , of course , loved him for what he could do for them , but also for what he was ; he was taken up by the very elite of British society .
In a country where , under normal conditions , upper - class doors are opened to few , all doors were open to Murrow .
He consciously avoided British mannerisms , British words , a British accent .
And his voice in a social , setting was the same as it was on the air , rich and tempered , making what he said sound somehow more serious , more profound .
Part of it was his calmness , his assurance , his civility — British qualities .
The very manner of his reporting , as well as his words , seemed to embody what was at stake in the war , the values being fought for .
As the best of English society ' was open to Murrow , so was it open to his boss , Colonel William S. Paley .
Paley took a leave from CBS and went to London in 1943 to serve on Eisenhower 's psychological warfare staff .
A friendship with Murrow , whom he had barely known before , was immediately forged .
They were often joined by Charles Collingwood , and the three strikingly handsome young men were seen at the best places , often with the best - looking women .
Paley was close to his young correspondents then .
They were heroes , and he was impressed with their intelligence , courage , the risks those boys took in reporting from wartime Europe .
And , in no matter what city , they seemed to know just the right people .
Those who know Paley believe that during the war in England he sensed for the first time the true social possibilities that his power might generate .
By the time he returned to America , after the war , his first marriage was on the rocks .
The women he was seeing now were usually from the Social Register .
Not that he was frivolous — he was still the relentless , driving businessman — but he was less open , less accessible .
His friends were changing , they were more social , more from the upper reaches of the business world .
There was a gradually diminishing number of his peers , a gradually diminishing number of people who might argue with him or dispute him .
The Paley - Murrow friendship survived their return home .
Paley still liked having Murrow around him , and why not ?
In the afterglow of the great war , Murrow was the most prestigious journalist in the country .
At Paley 's urging , Murrow became a vice president of CBS .
This was a mistake , since he had neither the talent nor the inclination for administration , and he soon found himself speaking for the company , and having to defend CBS policies with which he did not necessarily agree .
But that did not bother either man at the start ; Paley offered Murrow a house in Manhasset , Long Island , next to his own ( the offer was not accepted ) .
If the relationship was nice for Paley , it was also good for Murrow and the news department .
Easy access to the Chairman meant access to air time .
It was a built - in protection for correspondents .
It seemed to symbolize the strength and importance of the news division within the company , the invulnerability to the pressures outside .
Anyone doubting Murrow 's power and influence , or misjudging the priority Paley seemed to place on news , had only to know about the guest list for Paley 's second wedding , in 1947 , his marriage to Barbara Cushing Mortimer .
The wedding was very small and select : her family , not his ; her world , not his .
Just before the wedding , Paley went to an associate at CBS to ask for camera film and to explain that despite their close professional relationship , no business colleagues or friends of his were being invited .
A very small party , jut family , Paley emphasized .
The friend understood , and did not mind until after the wedding , when Paley dropped off the film to be developed .
The associate looked at some of the shots , and saw , yes , it was small , Bill and Babe , and the family , and Jock Whitney , and there was … Edward R. Murrow .
Since the associate who lent the cameras and film , Dr. Frank Stanton , had become the president of CBS a year earlier , and since he had come to resent both Murrow 's fame and his personal closeness to Paley , the incident did not soon leave Stanton 's mind .
Nearly fifteen years later , asked by mutual friends why he could not close the terrible breach with Murrow , since both of them were then ostensibly working toward the same essential goals , Stanton would mention this incident as part of the problem — Murrow was a guest at Bill and Babe Paley 's wedding ; Stanton was not .
The nerve was still that raw .
10 . The Importance of Being First
Bill Paley always hated being number two .
In 1948 , after two decades of rule at CBS , and despite his remarkable success , it bothered Paley that NBC , with its early head start and vast resources , was still number one .
He always wanted to be the best .
( Once , Mike Dann had arranged for a CBS special on Picasso which required months of delicate negotiations .
Dann was justifiably pleased with himself — it was a quality idea , and made better by the fact that Picasso spoke English .
Picasso , Dann thought , Paley , prestige .
And Paley was somewhat pleased , though he dampened Dann 's pleasure by saying yes , Picasso was good , " but I ’d rather go after Matisse .
Ca n't we go after Matisse , Mike ?
You know , on today 's market , a Matisse is much more than a Picasso . ” )
A certain condescension crept into his voice when he talked about General Sarnoff ; he felt that Sarnoff had no serious interest in broadcasting , not as Bill Paley envisioned broadcasting .
Murrow and the CBS News team had given Paley vast prestige , but the network was nonetheless second to NBC in programming , advertising revenues , and profit , as it always had been .
It was a reality that Paley had never accepted , and in 1948 he was ready to move .
He knew that the era of television was fast approaching , and he had a strong private belief that only the very best in radio would survive .
He also sensed that a dominance in radio might lead to dominance in television .
Quietly , through intermediaries , he started sounding out some of NBC 's star radio comedians about switching networks .
The struggle soon centered around Jack Benny .
The NBC stars were restless , not so much with the network as with the U.S. government , which was taxing many of them at about 90 percent .
CBS consulted with MCA , the talent agency , and determined that stars like Benny could be taxed as companies rather than as individuals , and could thus sharply reduce the portion of their salary handed over to the government .
Radio was then at its zenith and Benny was its biggest star , the 7 P.M. centerpiece of a star - studded NBC Sunday team .
His contract was soon to end , and he was in a position to set a pattern which his colleagues might follow .
Here the difference between Paley and Sarnoff was crucial : Paley loved entertainment .
When a star came to CBS for lunch , Paley was at his best — flowers , charm , style .
Sarnoff , on the other hand , convinced that the key to NBC 's success was its engineering superiority , its clear - channel stations .
His was the greatest theater in the world , as he saw it , and could put on whatever he wanted because the sound system was so good and the seats so comfortable that people would keep coming .
General Sarnoff was , in his life - style at least , a modest man , a Russian - Jewish immigrant who made a very great fortune from his position ( indeed , the disparity between his and Paley ’s wealth was something that always grated on him .
Paley owned CBS , but Sarnoff was a salaried executive at RCA . )
He was a proper man , sensitive about his own simple background and the need to be worthy of his position in America .
Dignity was important to him and stars rarely , to his mind , had dignity .
A system which built up stars with huge , vulgar salaries was distasteful to him .
( Once , at the height of television 's success , he found out how much money Jackie Gleason was making .
" That 's more money than I make , " he complained .
" But , General , " said his aide Pat Weaver , referring to a patented Gleason trademark , a pratfall , “ you ca n’t do the fall . " )
Not surprisingly , even by 1948 Sarnoff had never met Jack Benny , his number one star .
Moreover , he had no intention of competing with Bill Paley in wildcat offers for comedians , ventriloquists , and people of that ilk .
Some of his aides told him not to worry , that television was coming , and radio stars like Benny would soon be passé .
So while Paley turned on the full charm , letting Jack Benny know how much he cared about talent , and that the key to CBS was going to be entertainers , Sarnoft did relatively little .
Benny switched .
The American Tobacco Company was nervous about the change , since NBC 's audience for these stars was so huge , so Paley promised to pay them $ 3000 for every Hooper rating point that Benny lost in the move .
The moment Benny left , Sarnoff aaid , All right , we 'll put Horace Heidt in his slot at 7 o'clock .
Horace Heidt .
It was a disaster .
Benny had a Hooper rating of 27 , 3 points higher than he had had at NBC .
Sarnoff , tied into a bad policy , valuing machinery above talent , could not hold his other stars .
Benny helped persuade them , and across the DMZ they came : Edgar Bergen , Burns and Allen .
Red Skelton ;
At the last minute Sarnoff switched his policy and paid a small ransom to hold Bob Hope .
By the time it was over , Bill Paley had stolen NBC's Sunday night .
Benny was bigger than ever .
More important , the raid strengthened CBS radio and gave CBS precisely the lead over NBC that Paley had wanted for the move into television .
A few days after the raid an irate David Sarnoff called Bill Paley to ask how he could do it :
How could he violate their long - standing unwritten agreement not to steal each other 's stars ?
How could he do it ?
There was a long pause , and then Paley said ( it was , said someone who was sitting in the room with him , the first time he had ever heard Bill Paley sound sheepish ) : " Because I needed them . "
Indeed he did .
Within a year CBS was first in programming , revenues , and profits , and was moving headlong into television .
Some CBS newsmen began to sense that Bill Paley 's need for Jack Benny and Amos and Andy presaged a diminishing need for reporters .
The correspondents became a little less important , secondary to the other operations of CBS , as David Schoenbrun soon found out .
Schoenbrun , CBS 's man in Paris , once received a phone call from Bill Paley .
Jack Benny and Mary Livingstone would soon be traveling through France on their vacation and Bill would like David to keep an eye on them .
Paley knew how influential David was in Paris .
The message was that it was important to the company that David show Jack Benny a good time .
Sensitive negotiations with Benny were about to start again , and he needed to be reminded what a great organization CBS was , how much influence it had , even in France .
Bill Paley did not have to underscore how important Jack was to the company .
Besides , David would just love Jack and Mary .
The last , at least , was not true .
Very quickly David Schoenbrun came to dislike both Jack and Mary .
Jack Benny had been portrayed all those years on radio as a stingy man , and he did not seem eager to dispel his own reputation .
Nor did Schoenbrun come to like Mary , who nagged at him constantly .
A week passed , and finally Schoenbrun thought the visit was over .
But on the night of Friday , July 13 , Mary called Schoenbrun to say that she wanted some perfume , the kind that Babe Paley used , which was , of course , the best .
They were , she added , leaving Paris early on Monday the sixteenth .
" I need two quarts , " she said .
" What kind is it ? " asked Schoenbrun .
" I do n't know , but it 's the best ; Babe uses it . '
So Schoenbrun listed all the various great perfumes and finally got to Vent Vert .
" That 's the one ! " said Mary .
When do you need it ?
he asked .
By Sunday night , she said .
" Then you 've got troubles , because tomorrow is the fourteenth , which is like the Fourth of July , and this town locks up . "
" Well , " she said , " Bill Paley said you owned this town and you could do anything you wanted and that when Jack saw what you could do we'd be glad to stay at CBS and not go to another network .
So do it . "
And she hung up .
" Resign , " said Mrs. Schoenbrun to her husband .
But Schoenbrun 's journalistic pride was challenged , and off he went .
He raced to Pierre Balmain 's store , for Balmain , who made Vent Vert , was a friend , and perhaps things could be arranged .
But all he found was a security guard .
Eventually the security guard confided that Balmain was at his horse farm in Normandy , and after more wrangling Schoenbrun got the private number there and reached Balmain .
Balmain assured Schoenbrun that he was crazy , that the store was closed , locked up for the holiday weekend .
" But it 's for Jack Benny , " pleaded Schoenbrun .
" Who is Jack Benny ? " asked Balmain .
After several more calls , Balmain surrendered , called the security guard , and told him the perfume was in the vault with the mink coats .
The vault was opened and Schoenbrun stuffed a briefcase full of Vent Vert .
Immensely pleased with himself , he called Mary Livingstone to tell her his accomplishment .
" Bill Paley said you could do it , " she said by way of thanks .
Schoenbrun wrote Paley relating his triumph .
He never received an answer .
He suspected that if it had been the other way around , Jack Benny would have received an answer .
Sunday - night comedians , it seemed , were more important than journalists , even those who owned France and personally knew Charles de Gaulle .
11 . Murrow Discovers the Profit Center : " Dr. Stanton , I Presume ? "
The success of the raid on Sarnoff ’s comedians , coming as it did right before the move to television , tipped the balance in favor of CBS .
It was now bigger than ever in radio , and was soon to be equally big in television .
For the television revolution was outstripping even the predictions of broadcast executives .
Americans had never bought any new device so quickly , and nothing had ever become in so short a time a major part of the culture .
Before 1948 the CBS television network was virtually nonexistent .
By 1951 it comprised 62 stations , and 16 million American homes had television sets .
By 1952 , CBS had 74 stations broadcasting to 21 million homes , and in 1954 , the year CBS became the largest advertising medium in the world , its programs were broadcast over 202 stations to 32.5 million homes , or to roughly two thirds of the families in America .
The quality of American social life had changed , all sorts of habits were now tailored to television programs .
The commercial possibilities were immense ; it was like coining money , and by l958 CBS promotion advertisements suggested precisely that : a full - page ad showed a cigarette vending machine with a television set placed in the glass mirror and labeled " the greatest cigarette sales machine ever invented . "
The ad ran in the New York Herald Tribune and was supposed to run in the Times , but some of the senior people in the news division prevaiIed upon Frank Stanton to cancel the ad .
When the possibilities for financial success expanded , so did the drive for profit .
What might have seemed impossible years earlier had now become possible .
There were new norms for profit and for success .
At meetings with key officials , Paley kept pushing for that 15 percent annual increase in profits , along with reduced budgets .
And the company was diversifying .
Stanton began to talk about company " profit centers . "
CBS was not a profit center .
These vast new profits meant a rise in the visibility of Frank Stanton , and a change in the role of Bill Paley .
When both CBS and Paley were young , the Chairman had been fresh , open , innovative , available to everyone , a great salesman .
But in postwar years , as CBS became more and successful , he changed , he was less accessible e outside world .
In the earlier years he had needed access to others ; now they needed access to him .
Before the war his prime effort had gone into selling the company ; now , particularly after the raid on NBC , more and more effort went into protecting the company .
Now , increasingly , people wanted things from him , and he became less and less available to them .
He designated Stanton as his representative , asked him to run the errands he disliked , deal with the pressures and lobbyists he wanted to avoid , and be loyal enough to make an unpleasant decision sound like a Stanton decision , rather than , as was often the case , a Paley decision .
( “ I ’ve always had a guy like Stanton for jobs like that , ” Paley once told a friend about a particularly disagreeable assignment . )
Frank Stanton was a loyalist , a man who discharged decisions faithfully whether he agreed with them or not .
By the time of his retirement in 1973 he was one of the profession 's foremost spokesmen for the integrity of the news department , genuinely esteemed by senior working journalists .
But in the crucial early years of his career he was the man who set standards and norms of profit which systematically diminished the strength , standing , and influence of the news division .
Murrow , whose position in the company was declining precisely as that of programming was rising , blamed Stanton for the changing balance .
He detested Stanton ; to him , Stanton was " the bookkeeper . "
Murrow , almost to his death , believed that the force of darkness at CBS was Stanton rather than Paley , that the key to revitalizing the network was to get back to the good old days of World War II , when Bill Paley was one of the boys and his sense of public service was self - evident .
Paley did little to dicourage the natural rivalry between Stanton and Murrow , two young , attractive WASPs who had joined the company the same year , and Stanton was not about to contradict the Chairman , for to split openly on any issue with Paley would have meant an end to his career .
Frank Stanton 's loyalty was to the greater good of the company .
He was the impersonal man for an impersonal job , a man of systems and management , and a lobbyist in the most sophisticated sense .
In the great boardrooms of New York , no one looked better than Frank Stanton ; he was probably offered more jobs , good jobs — head of corporations , universities , foundations — than anyone else in America .
He turned them all down because he preferred the one job he thought he had been promised , that of operating head of CBS .
Stanton was the one man in all those years whom Paley had never ground down .
The two of them , different in style , taste , manner , and values , were like two strong people locked in a terrible marriage , two people who need each other , dislike each other , and yet can not divorce each other .
The tensions grew greater as the calendar moved toward 1966 , the year that Paley was supposed to retire and let Stanton , seven years his junior , take control of the company .
As that happened , Stanton cast a larger and larger shadow , the shadow of Paley 's mortality .
In the mid-sixties Paley irritably turned to one close friend : " What the hell does Frank really want ? " he asked .
The friend answered that Stanton wanted to be the chief executive officer of CBS , as he had been promised .
" Why does he want that ? "
Paley complained .
" Why should he want that ?
Look at all I 've done for him !
I 've made him a millionaire , I 've made him a big man in broadcasting — the statesman of broadcasting .
Why does be want to be the head of the company ? "
In February 1966 , all the arrangements for Stanton 's succession had been made .
But Paley could not go through with it .
He could not give up his company and become , overnight , an old man .
In retrospect , it seems the most predictable of Paley 's decisions , but Stanton was shattered .
He told friends he learned of Paley 's turnabout only five minutes before the promotion was to become official .
Later in the day another CBS executive ran into Stanton and was surprised to find him almost in tears .
" This is the worst day of my life , " Stanton said .
Why ?
the friend asked .
" Because the Chairman has a resolution which someone else will offer asking that his term be extended .
I 've been promised that I would run the company , and now it 's all gone .
This is the worst day of my life . "
Well , said the friend , who knew the CBS profits and knew Stanton 's financial position , if you feel that strongly , why do n't you quit ?
" Because I just bought fifty acres on the Big Sur and I 'm damned if I 'm going to take my stock options to pay for it , " he answered .
Except for remarks like these , he remained publicly silent .
He told one close friend , a journalist , " I 'm never giving a real interview , or writing a book — it violates my contract . "
But he got a revenge of sorts : he asked Paley for a cost - of - living clause in his retirement pay .
Paley , knowing the precise amount of Stanton 's wealth , was enraged .
Some thought that Paley had an additional reason for his unwillingness to turn the company over to Stanton .
In his heart , they felt , Paley did not think that Stanton was tough enough .
He believed that Stanton was too concerned with image , that over the years he had begun to believe his own speeches , that his essential views of broadcasting were too much like those of the critics who wrote all those lofty newspaper and magazine articles but did not understand the real world of broadcasting .
By the mid-sixties , Stanton 's role was so identified with moral and professional purity that he talked as though a network could be run on ideals .
His role had been to convey respectability ; now he had in some ways become too respectable , too concerned with images .
To Stanton , the way things looked was often as important as what they were .
Stanton felt that a news program should never be called a show .
Always a " program . "
He had a doctorate in psychology from Ohio State , and he took it more seriously than do many Ph.D.'s ; he liked being called Dr. Stanton .
He was a clean man , almost surgically so , the man who arranged for all CBS stationery to have a dot in just the right place so that all CBS letters typed by all CBS secretaries would have the right balance .
He had started out with the hucksters in the company , but he was always a little ill at ease with the advertising and manipulative aspects of broadcasting , as if he feared he might be tainted by them , and he could not return to academe .
His career seemed to parallel the growth of the company .
First he sought order so as to control the swiftness of corporate growth .
Then came corporate expansion , as cash flow generated a need to expand : the acquisition of a television set manufacturing company , an amusement park , a music publishing company , a guitar factory , finally a baseball team ( the New York Yankees ) and a publishing company ( Holt , Rinehart '& Winston ) .
He helped to develop the corporate norm , which was profitability .
Then , the third and most important role : Stanton the lobbyist and statesman .
As the company became successful and powerful , the immensity of its profits staggering , good relations with Washington became crucial .
Stanton would testify before congressional committees , and when he spoke , the facts about violence and mindlessness in programming , and the profits derived therefrom , seemed very distant .
He had become by the sixties , the major spokesman for the broadcasting industry — as Murrow had been in an earlier era— but with this crucial difference : Murrow had criticized not just the society at large , but broadcasting as well .
Stanton spoke the same lofty thoughts and envisioned the same wondrous future , but he did not speak ill of the corporation .
He stood for all the best things in the best of all possible ways — and when it was all over he had made well over $ 20 million at CBS .
12 . So , Who Controls the News ?
The possibilities of nationwide advertising on television transformed the nature of American communications .
Afternoon newspapers began to atrophy and die .
Large - circulation magazines , which up until then had been the main conduit of mass advertising — for razor blades , beer , tires , cars , main household goods — could not compete with television for advertising or audiences .
Within a few years many of them were dead .
A new mass audience was eager for mass entertainment : along with it came new dimensions in hard - sell mass advertising .
It was all bigger , and reached more and more people , and the quality was pitched just a few notches lower .
Dramatic changes in the relationship of programs to sponsors marked the trend .
Having raided Sarnoff of his talent , Paley moved to make sure that something like this would never happen again , in particular that it would not happen to him , and that the stars or people representing stars would have less leverage against a network .
He moved now to take control of programming .
In the past in radio , and even in the early days of television , the networks had not produced their own shows , but rather had bought them from the advertising agencies .
At first there was some resistance to Paley 's initiative .
Gradually it began to change .
In the old days one company had sponsored a show completely , but now it was all too expensive .
No single company could afford a show , given soaring production costs on television .
No one could sponsor Cronkite news , as for example Pall Mall had by itself sponsored Douglas Edwards .
( It now costs about $ 18 million a year to sponsor the Cronkite news . )
First companies alternated sponsorship on different weeks ; then gradually they began to share given programs .
It was a tense moment .
Would the American people accept a program brought to them by both an auto company and a floor wax ?
Then there were a number of commercials on the same program .
And then the cruelest blow of all , back - to - back commercials .
All of this because the costs were always going up .
CBS was no longer a pipeline for the work of others ; now it was producing and scheduling as it chose .
Bill Paley loved programming .
He had no wild , adventurous policy ; he was not a great innovator .
He was content to let others experiment and make mistakes while he studied how to improve it .
The ratings were the ultimate measure of success , not taste , nor any sense of balance between commercial harvest and public accountability .
That one way no one was responsible .
The advertisers wanted the highest ratings because they wanted the biggest numbers .
So the networks had to give advertisers what they wanted , which was ( they could say to themselves ) the same as giving the people what they wanted .
A kind of golden prison .
The early CBS reporters loved the simplicity and the freedom of radio .
Journalism at its best is a highly personal art , and radio encouraged individualism .
The technology of radio was not complicated or expensive ; if a correspondent had a story , he simply went on the air .
Very little was required of producers or technicians .
And there was little bureaucratic interference from the home office .
Murrow did not want his radio men to mimic the wire services ; he wanted more reflective reporting .
He wanted thoughts and ideas , a sense of the issues at play .
He also warned against tricks and against hamming it up on the radio .
" I want personalities , " he said .
" If you 're a reporter you 'll become a personality .
Just be intelligent and informed . "
In the postwar era it was a point of pride with the CBS foreign staff that the CIA 's chief intelligence experts began their day with the New York Times and a transcript of the CBS Morning News Roundup .
Murrow returned to America after the war with some misgivings .
He told his wife that they were going home " to fight the same kind of things we 've been fighting here , " an odd and dark remark .
Paley 's attempt to make Murrow an executive was ill - fated , and he lasted little more than a year .
Rather than give Murrow the power to make the news section better , the company used Murrow 's name to make decisions , not necessarily his , appear more palatable .
The most delicate problem turned out to be Murrow 's old friend Bill Shirer .
Shirer was doing a Sunday afternoon radio news show and his sponsor decided to drop him and hire another broadcaster .
Murrow reassigned Shirer to another time slot , though without a sponsor and thus at a considerable reduction in income .
Shirer was bitter .
He had sixteen months to go on his contract .
Murrow tried to make him stay , but Shirer was hurt and felt he had been gagged .
Since Shirer was the furthest left of the major commentators at the time — he opposed the Truman Doctrine and in general was less of what would come to be known as a Cold Warrior than his colleagues — many thought that CBS , Murrow included , was buckling under to political pressure .
( Among those who felt that way was Shirer himself , who later wrote a novel , entitled Stranger Come Home , dealing with the McCarthy Era and singularly unflattering to a character seemingly modeled on Murrow . )
The incident underlined the question of who controlled the news , the network or the sponsors .
Did the sponsors for example , have the right to control the tone of the news by deciding whose voice should be heard ?
Murrow said that a sponsor could select a broadcaster , though it could not control content .
It was , he knew , an unsatisfactory answer because a newscaster defined the tone and style of a show ; there was no such thing as pure content .
In addition , it meant that sponsors , rather than CBS News , had the right to advance or thwart a broadcaster 's career , and that very quickly the least offensive journalist , rather than the most talented , might rise and be rewarded .
The corporate role was not one that Murrow relished ; the voice he spoke with was not necessarily his own .
By 1947 , he was back to broadcasting , awaiting the arrival of television , which he regarded with suspicion and ambivalence .
But he was a communicator ; and whatever else television was , it was clearly a powerful forum for communication .
Murrow was not sure that television was a good conduit for the transmission or translation of ideas , and he was ill at ease with its sheer force .
He saw in it a tendency toward overdramatization and away from appreciation of subtleties .
In particular he was wary of doing any kind of hard - news broadcasting for television .
He had never really been a hard - news man ; he was always more interested in interpretation .
Some who knew him well thought that Murrow was keenly aware of being Murrow , of being a little different from the rest of the pack .
He was by no means eager , they suspected , to let the impersonal mechanics of being a television anchorman dilute that impact .
So his moves toward television were slow .
When he returned to broadcasting , it was to radio , an evening news show .
He did some reporting and commentary for television at the 1948 presidential nominating conventions .
But he was wary .
Television required so much contrivance .
It was a team art , involving producers , cameramen , sound men , levels and levels of technicians , all of whom might distort the effect of the individual journalist .
13 . The Dynamic Duo : Murrow and Friendly
If Murrow was to go to television , he needed a producer .
He found him while still doing radio .
His name was Fred Friendly , and they were brought together by a talent agent named Jap Gude .
Their partnership began with a series of albums of radio documentaries , I Can Hear It Now , a collection of memorable broadcasting moments from the past .
Murrow 's narration and Friendly 's technical ability made them successful beyond anyone 's expectations .
( Collectors of Friendlyisms noticed that as the series of albums progressed , the size of Friendly 's byline on the album cover gradually grew larger and finally equaled that of Murrow's ) .
Then they tried some radio documentaries , Hear It Now .
In 1951 they turned to sight and sound .
Hear it Now became TV's See It Now .
Their alliance was an odd one .
It brought together Murrow 's broadcasting skills , considerable shyness , and enviable reputation and Friendly ’s enormous aspirations and superb technical expertise .
Friendly was ambitious , creative , and restless , at once a builder of his own legend and a destroyer of it .
( He managed to destroy it for one talented reporter for the Times named Charles Mohr by offering him a job and then , when Mohr turned it down , suggesting that Mohr keep in touch because there would be a time when his wife would want a fur coat . )
In the words of one friend , he always came equipped with his own precipice from which to jump .
He had a weakness for beginning a sentence by saying that he was just a simple country boy and ending it by implying that he had as a matter of fact invented Edward R. Murrow .
Talented , insecure ( the name Friendly is an Americanization of the name Freundlich , which was mother 's name ; his real name was Ferdinand Wachenheimer , a name not likely to help his career take off .
Murrow , by contrast , was a name which would help it a great deal ) , he took strength from Murrow 's reputation .
He was not in the basic sense a journalist , but rather a talented dramatist ( " Watch out for Friendly , " Murrow would tell journalistic initiates , “ he does n't know a fact . " )
He wanted to do a Life magazine of the air , and this fitted nicely with Murrow 's conception of television .
Knowing he was going into television , and knowing nothing about film , Friendly set out to master the art , to retool himself .
He went to the Museum of Modern Art and studied just about every technically ambitious film in its extensive archives .
Then he went to Pathé News , demanding to know who was good in documentary film , and asking the professionals to explain what worked and what did not work .
Then he set out to find the best technicians available for his CBS film team , using Murrow 's name as the come-on .
He was aware of the unique asset of Murrow 's prestige that the name could open doors , and he became expert at using it .
Ed wants ,
Ed says , Ed feels — and whether indeed Ed wanted or Ed said or Ed felt was another thing , but it brought marvelous results of which Murrow was as much the beneficiary as Fred Friendly .
Friendly was physically huge , with a powerful and formidable presence .
Restless , domineering , excessive , he was not a man to be harnessed in a lesser figure .
Part of Friendly 's strength was his exuberance .
If Fred was interested in the problems of water , then the whole world had to be interested in water .
He was excited , not frightened , by big challenges .
The bigger the show , the more difficult the assignment , the more he responded , and this quality set him off from most people in broadcasting .
Later in his career , when he was at a higher level in the corporation , the smell of corporate success occasionally got him into trouble .
But his restlessness was also a positive force .
In 1954 he was at least as determined as Murrow to do a show on Joe McCarthy .
When they were preparing the film for that program , an incident occurred which others who were present forgot .
The team was watching a BBC broadcast , an announcer reading the Canterbury Tales in Middle English :
All very simple .
And suddenly Friendly exploded : " That 's it , that 's it , that 's what this fight is all about ! "
Someone else asked , “ What the hell do you mean , Fred ?
What do Middle English and Chaucer have to do with it ? "
“ Damn it , for the right to do what you want , poetry , art , and freedom of speech , the freedom to put on whatever you want without fear . "
Yet he had a show - biz side that preferred effect to substance .
Once , years later , when he was running CBS News and he was told he should hire a reporter who had done very well in a difficult assignment , he answered , " Yes , yes , he 's good , I know he 's good , but is he a star ?
I only want stars . ”
Murrow could control Friendly 's excesses , and Friendly could dramatize what Murrow wanted to say and do it with professionalism .
He took staid Ed Murrow into the hustling world of television and made the combination , work .
Television for better or worse did require a show - biz component , and Friendly provided that , tailoring it to Murrow .
The result was that See It Now became a great show — too great , finally , for its own good .
By the late 1940s , what was to become known as McCarthyism had already come to broadcasting ( and to Hollywood ) in the form of " blacklisting . "
Actors , announcers , and correspondents were singled out by right - wing critics for having been associated with organizations now considered far left , communist , or communist - oriented , and became the targets of a variety of political and economic pressures .
CBS , which had been the most liberal of the networks , became the most sensitive to pressure from the Right .
As early as 1948 , Murrow was becoming depressed by political reaction at home and the inhibitions on free debate that Cold War tension was producing .
He was hardly a figure of the Left .
If anything , he was a freedom - of - speech and First Amendment man , a classic political centrist with a certain sympathy for the underdog .
But he was becoming uneasy with the increasing timidity of his own profession and his own company .
Loyalty was now a political issue and he did not think that broadcasting was doing the job it should in defining freedoms for those accused of disloyalty .
In 1948 he encouraged his old friend David Lilienthal , the head of the Atomic Energy Commission , to make a speech attacking the broadcasting industry for not using its influence to create understanding of the new and complicated Nuclear Age .
When Lilienthal showed Murrow his projected speech , he was surprised that Murrow urged him to make it even tougher .
Murrow , with all his influence in his profession , felt so concerned about the climate and trends within broadcasting , and felt such limits on his own ability to do anything about them , that he had to turn to an outrider to get his own views aired .
Later that same year , when Lilienthal was under attack for his political views and under heavy congressional pressure to resign , he met with Murrow again , and Murrow seemed in an unusually dark mood , talking about subtle , growing pressures against him in broadcasting .
He told Liljenthaj that he did not think he could continue to broadcast much longer unless he injected more and more anticommunism in his commentaries .
Though his contract at CBS was binding for several years to come , he was already talking to Lilienthal about what he was going to do next .
That television arrived simultaneously with the height of McCarthyism probably helped to narrow the parameters of journalistic freedom , but it was bound to happen anyway .
Politically , television was simply too powerful a force , too fast , too immediate , with too large an audience , for the kind of easy journalistic freedom that radio and print reporters had enjoyed .
Newspapers competed with each other for power and influence , but television was a virtual rival of the government .
It was as if an unwritten law of American journalism had evolved , stating that the greater the institutional platform , and the more power it has to influence public opinion , the more carefully it must be used and the less it must wander from the accepted norms of American society .
It is better to be a little wrong and a little late on a major sensitive story than it is to be too right too far ahead of the rest of the country .
There were two reasons for this sensitivity .
The first was timidity , a desire not to offend the audience 's sensibilities , not to get too far ahead of the parade , plus an awareness of political pressures that grew in direct proportion to the success and influence of television .
The second was more honorable , the perception that the medium was so powerful that personal journalism of any sort bordered on being dangerous , that no one journalist should be too powerful .
So television journalism , far more than print or radio journalism , contemplated the political implications of every story it broadcast , considered what the reaction might be .
A political figure could be damaged by a piece in a major newspaper , but a television report might destroy him .
Television 's important figures became prisoners of their power .
" If Walter Cronkite would say on television what he says on the radio , " Lyndon Johnson , an inveterate radio listener , once said , " he would be the most powerful man in America . "
But for precisely that reason , by the time that Cronkite was Cronkite he could not say those things .
Television was simply too powerful a force to permit him to do so .
It moved people as radio never could , and reached a whole new mass of citizens who had never been readers .
Even among those who had been readers it often had an unprecedented emotional impact .
The people who controlled the networks knew this and were uneasy , and in some cases , terrified .
Television came into its own when government was just beginning to pressure broadcasting , and when the networks were beginning to sense the problems their news divisions could cause , For reporters , lowly men in a corporate structure , could nonetheless bring the entire network into unwanted confrontation with Washington .
So the networks decided , consciously or unconsciously , to limit the autonomy of the network news show .
The kind of freedom radio news had enjoyed would now have to be curtailed .
A corporation with so much at stake would have to exert greater controls over its parts .
At first Murrow escaped that problem because of his unique position within the company ; but eventually even he , with his reserves of special status , found out one day that he had expended it and had become a liability to the corporation .
How that happened , how the single greatest broadcaster of an age exhausted his welcome while still doing first - rate work , is a parable of the profession .
14 . Murrow vs. McCarthy : Fear and Trembling on the 20th Floor
Reporting the war from London was a magnificent time for Murrow .
But the war was a story of such drama and urgency that it virtually told itself .
Now , in 1951 , doing his weekly See It Now documentaries , making people see what they did not necessarily want to see , bringing complicated questions into millions of homes , work was even more challenging .
He was at his best , and in some ways the audience sensed that he was special , that he had more than good looks and a rich voice , that this was a man who could not let go , who experienced the pain he projected into their living rooms .
He was at the peak of his powers , and if he was not exactly politically touchable , he was certainly less touchable than other mortals .
But even Murrow was aware that he had to hold to the center , that he had to limit the number of controversial shows he could do , that he had to ration his powder in order to protect his influence , and that he had to work to make himself palatable to his public .
See It Now exemplified the best of television , restless and adventurous , probing into complicated social and political problems .
But soon there appeared another face of Murrow , called Person to Person .
His new show was more a part of the world of show business than of news and pubic affairs .
It was less a question of technique than of substance , or rather lack of substance .
" Higher Murrow " and " Lower Murrow , " the critic John Lardner called the two shows .
Person to Person was a celebrity hunt into the homes of the famous ( and often fatuous ; some interviewees were Rose Lee , the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , Jayne Mansfield , Liberace , Lawrence Welk , Eddie Fisher and .
Debbie Reynolds ) .
Murrow , who was not necessarily a good interviewer , was matched with people who often had remarkably little to say .
Celebrityhood , that status of being well known for being well known , did not always imply intelligence .
The See It Now people began referring to the Person to Person people as " the buttonhole makers . "
Joe Wershba , one of the most talented men on the See It Now team , remembered how incongruous it all seemed , the same Marrow who did these marvelous documentaries and who was broadcasting 's best voice doing silly patter with instant stars .
The first time Wershba heard of the new show seemed symbolic : Murrow was doing a show on Berlin and he was standing at the remains of the Reichstag with Howard K. Smith , and Smith was interviewing Ernst Reuter , the mayor of West Berlin .
Murrow mentioned casually to Wershba that he was starting a new show with celebrities and that one of the first guests would be Lucille Ball … Wershba , who revered Murrow , looked and thought , the Reichstag , Ernst Keuter , Ed Murrow , Lucille Ball … Murrow was clearly embarrassed at it .
His ambivalence never went away .
At one point he wanted to put Andrew Heiskell , then the publisher of Life , on Person to Person .
Some delicate negotiation ensued , because Heiskell was less than anxious to appear .
Finally the public relations people were sure that they had Heiskell aboard , only to find at the last minute that Heiskell was adamant in his refusal .
Why had Heiskell changed his mind ?
Well , it seems he had run into Murrow that night on the street and he had asked how Person to Person was going and Murrow had said , " I hate that damn show — it 's so damn demeaning , but it really makes a lot of money . "
He would mutter periodic excuses , such as that he had originally intended to bring a wide variety of uncelebrated Americans — blacks , Indians , laborers — to the show , but it had not quite worked out way .
From time to time he said that he did it as a way of picking up a little change for Johnny and Jesse ( Johnny Aron and Jesse Zousrner , his two writers ) .
The truth was that he picked up a little change of his own .
Paley bought the show from him for an estimated $ 1 million , a gesture that was generous but not entirely altruistic , since it gave Paley an extra hold on Murrow .
" I gave Ed the only money he ever made , " Paley said later .
But Murrow 's reason for doing Person to Person was more tactical than financial : it was a deliberate and conscious decision to broaden his base .
Before Person to Person he was a political commentator , increasingly controversial , frequently hitting raw nerves .
This made him vulnerable to criticism , for his real constituency was increasingly among the elite at a time when his instrument was a mass instrument .
Murrow was now on the defensive .
Person to Person gave Murrow a " good guy " incarnation : it was noncontroversial , it built him up as a star and a celebrity , a celebrity who had a lot of friends , none of whom was controversial .
Later he told friends that he had been able to withstand the storm that followed his Joe McCarthy broadcast in part because he had enjoyed so much popularity as a result of Person to Person .
Naturally the two programs ' staffs , bitter in their rivalries , were acutely aware of the contradictory nature of Murrow 's broadcasting roles .
The See It Now people hated the idea of their great man indulging in something as frivolous as Person to Person , and the Person staff worried about the risks their star took with the controversial See It Now shows .
One morning , after the McCarthy show , when the Senator began to pressure Murrow , Johnny Aron charged into Joe Wershba 's office and yelled , " See — you get in with shit , and you get shit on your hands . "
The Murrow - McCarthy show was significant first because it took so long in coming , second because it loomed so large over what was clearly so low a landscape , and third because it caused such a storm .
It would have been unforgivable for television and for a team with the reputation of the Murrow - Friendly group to fail to do a major documentary on McCarthy .
It would have rendered television in general , and CBS and Murrow in particular , a joke .
From the start , the real question raised by Joe McCarthy was not what he was — that was self - evident — but rather which journalists and networks would have the courage to say what he was .
From the start he was reckless and shallow ; the only thing real about him was the fear he generated .
For he came on the scene at a volatile time , America blown overnight to great power status , the Soviets with atomic weapons .
His was an essential challenge to freedom of speech , and an astonishing number of people were cowed , to a greater or lesser extent , into retreating before the demagogic challenge .
This was true of print journalism and it was even more true of electronic journalism .
If the center did not fold , it did not exactly hold , either .
Murrow was a man of the center ; he was the best of broadcasting .
So it was natural that in 1952 and 1953 friends began to ask Murrow and Friendly when they were going to take on McCarthy .
When ?
It was a very good question .
For a year before the McCarthy broadcast , the See It Now team had been told to start collecting film .
No date for broadcasting the show had been set .
Murrow 's own failure to act was becoming an issue among journalistic colleagues .
Yes , he had done some shows which touched on civil liberties , on people being pressured by forms of McCarthyism .
But he had not gone after McCarthy himself .
When the subject came up he answered yes , the show would be done , but he was searching for the right vehicle .
When colleagues and friends were , as they often were , somewhat more insistent , and demanded that he go on and take the extraordinary forum of television and make an attack upon McCarthy , Murrow pulled back .
No , he could n't do that .
It would n't do any good .
He was aware of the problem , he said , and aware of the force of television , but it would n't do any good for him to simply go on television and make a speech against McCarthy .
His friends were often not satisfied with his answer , and for that matter , neither was he .
For he knew , better than most , that what a journalist chooses not to see is often as important as what he chooses to see .
In late February of 1954 , Murrow and Friendly began to move ahead on the show .
Those who knew him well believe that Murrow knew the Army was also going to attack McCarthy : he realized that he could delay no longer .
Reports were circulating that McCarthy might go after Murrow ; the Senator was already telling people that he had documents proving that Murrow was a communist .
Murrow warned everyone on the staff what might lie ahead and asked if they had anything to hide , anything which might come out later and embarrass them .
At the same time CBS 's lawyers began to go through every aspect of Murrow 's own past , in preparation for McCarthy 's expected counterchallenge .
Murrow was uneasy about using television in what would inevitably be so personal a fashion .
McCarthy had broken the rules of civilized political behavior ; this meant that any journalist portraying him accurately would similarly have to break his own rules and built - in restrictions .
When he finally decided on the vehicle for taking on McCarthy , it was a simple one .
He would let McCarthy destroy McCarthy ; " the terror , " Murrow said , after screening some footage of the Senator " is in this room . "
Murrow and Friendly kept the idea of their show a secret inside CBS as long as possible , on the assumption that the less the twentieth floor knew , the better .
That was fine with the twentieth floor .
Paley was not about to order Murrow not to do a McCarthy show , nor was he likely to order him to do one .
But he was not eager to be associated with it , and he kept as much institutional distance as possible between the show and CBS .
No , CBS would not advertise the program or allow the CBS logo " eye " to be used .
So Murrow and Friendly bought their own ad and paid for it of their own pockets and signed it with their own names .
No , Paley , when asked , did not want screen the show before it ran .
Both Murrow and Paley knew what his reaction would be : Ed do we really have to do this ?
Paley did suggest that Murrow offer McCarthy equal time .
Murrow had been thinking of that too , that it had the advantage when McCarthy demanded equal time , of not looking as if they were backing down .
They also asked Sig Mickelson , nominal head of CBS News ( in fact Murrow and Friendly were practically running a separate shop , which was known as Tobruck ) , if he wanted to look at it , but Mickelson declined .
He had screened nothing else of theirs .
So the most potent and sensitive television show of the decade went on the air without any screening by CBS superiors .
A decade later it would be very different .
Just before the McCarthy show was to be broadcast , at 10:30 p.m. , March 9 , 1954 , a call came through to Murrow from Paley : " Ed , I 'm with you today , and I 'll be with you tomorrow . "
A nice call .
The show was very good .
Long overdue and very good .
Murrow examined McCarthy in the piercing light of the American tradition of civil liberties : " We will not walk in fear , one of another , we will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason .
If we dig deep , deep in our history and our doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men , not from men who feared to write , to speak , to associate with , and to defend causes which were for the moment unpopular .
. . "
It was a good show .
On its most important test it passed without a blemish — it caught McCarthy for what he was , not for what he said he was .
Twenty years later , in an era when civil liberties were far stronger and there was far greater willingness to defend them , the McCarthy show could be aired without any apology or explanation .
15 . The Profit Center vs Murrow : Bad News for the Department
After the show there was a nice phone call from Paley — Babe Paley , that is .
She was Bill 's proxy .
Deniability had to be maintained in case the show or Murrow had to be sacrificed .
Viewer reaction was intense , but McCarthy was already overstepping himself , not just against Murrow but against the Army , and finally against fellow Republicans .
The tide was turning , and the Murrow show was part of the turning .
Not everyone at CBS thought so .
Some members of the board were furious , and put pressure on Paley to bring Murrow under control — was he an independent entity , some sovereign state , who could do what he wanted ?
The next day Friendly ran into Jack Van Volkenburg , president of the television network , and rode up in the elevator with him .
He was the first member of management that Friendly had seen since the show , and as they rode up , they talked about the weather and their families , but they did not talk about Joseph R. McCarthy .
A few days later Stanton called Friendly into his office , a rare occurrence in the best of circumstances .
Stanton said nothing about the quality of the show , just about the problems and pressures it had created .
“ A lot of people think you may have cost us the network , ” Stanton began .
He meant lawyers and people in Washington .
Friendly countered by mentioning the avalanche — about 100,000 — of supportive telegrams .
Stanton took a sheaf of papers and showed them to Friendly : a special Roper Poll , which he had commissioned on the subject of Murrow and McCarthy .
Not surprisingly , it showed that more people believed in McCarthy than in Murrow , and 33 percent of the population felt that Murrow a communist or a communist sympathizer .
The parts of the poll which reflected anti-Murrow sentiments were all circled in orange crayon .
Stanton asked Friendly what he thought of these statistics .
All the more reason to have done the show , Friendly said .
Which ended the conversation .
Friendly went away as many others had , wondering whose voice he had just listened to .
Was it Stanton speaking for Stanton ?
Or was it Stanton speaking for Paley , somehow passing the word , as it is often passed in broadcasting , to let Friendly know that there were limits to his power ?
Both before and after the McCarthy show , Bill Paley stayed as far away from Murrow as possible .
Those working on the programs had a sense of his distance .
But years later Bill Paley liked to recall those days , and as they were recreated in his mind .
He saw one big trench , and standing alone in it were Bill Paley and Ed Murrow , shoulder to shoulder .
Biting the same bullet .
As he reminisced like this , he often wondered why people did not give him more credit for his part in the show .
“ I ’m with you today , and I 'll be with you tomorrow . "
A nice line .
A lovely ring of abiding loyalty and sustenance and faith .
But the McCarthy show , and several other incidents , proved to Paley that See It Now and Murrow were a potential liability ( if not already a liability ) to the network .
CBS could not grant so much autonomy to so reckless a journalist .
( Years later Paley spoke to this reporter about Murrow and journalists .
Oh yes , Murrow was a great fellow , a great journalist .
No , it was not true that it had ended badly between them .
He had letters to prove what good friends they were .
Though of course Murrow had a brooding sense of life .
Very difficult , dark fellow .
Always taking too many risks in the war .
Then confronted with evidence of growing separation between the two of them , Paley offered a small lecture on journalists : they were all alike .
They claimed to be objective , but none of them really were .
They all wanted to make personal comments .
He had to fight with even the best of them , like Murrow . )
For the amount of prestige Murrow brought CBS was less important now .
CBS was established , there was too much to risk , and there were too many complaints about Murrow and his colleagues from Paley 's peers .
Paley was an out - and - out Republican now , an avowed Eisenhower man .
( Sig Mickelson had heard from friends how close Paley was to the Eisenhower entourage , but the first tangible evidence came in 1952 , when Ike returned home to Abilene to make his presidential announcement .
Paley had suggested rather casually to Mickelson that this was something CBS News might want to cover live on television .
In those days television facilities were primitive , and a live feed from Abilene would have required running a cable out of Chicago at a cost of thousands of dollars .
Mickelson explained to the Chairman that it was much too expensive , but Paley waved aside his doubts —
Michelson was to take care of the arrangements , Paley would have AT&T take care of the cable .
Cost was never again mentioned , and for the first time Michelson realized how close Paley was to Eisenhower . )
His best friends were people like Walter Thayer and Jock Whitney ; he badly wanted to become Ambassador to the Court of St. James's ; and when his reporters made the Administration angry they were making his closest friends angry .
The problem was not that Murrow 's autonomy was growing ; indeed , if anything , it was the same or less than it had been .
The problem was that television was richer and more powerful , influencing more and more minds .
In January , 1950 , only 3.2 million Americans owned television sets .
A decade later the figure was 50 million .
In .
January , 1952 , for the first time , according to Nielsen , more television sets than radios were being turned on between 9 P.M. and midnight ; and in 1954 , the same year that Murrow took on McCarthy , television 's gross billings , jumped 50 percent over the previous year 's , making CBS - TV the biggest single advertising medium in the world .
Net income , which for two decades had averaged about $ 4 or $ 5 million a year , suddenly was increasingly by 25 and 30 percent to a total of $ 11.4 million in 1954 .
The candy store was becoming bigger and bigger .
In exercising his prerogatives , Murrow guaranteed that neither he nor anyone else would ever again have that much freedom or autonomy , that never again would there be a broadcasting personality with a following so great that he could , by walking out , damage the network .
The network would henceforth control its reporters , writers , and producers , their shows , programming hours , and , to a considerable degree , their subjects .
Systematically , CBS began to bring Ed Murrow under control .
First they limited the number of his shows ; then they switched the hour when the shows were aired ; then they changed the name of the program ; and finally , they took it away from Murrow and separated him from his producer , Fred Friendly .
This was all done deftly , perhaps not even consciously .
The intrusions were small , never enough to force Murrow to stomp out with a resignation .
Within four years of its moment of triumph , See It Now was dead , and in six years Murrow himself was gone from CBS .
In the wake of the McCarthy program Murrow had sponsor problems , and this made him more vulnerable to the corporation .
He had long been sponsored by Alcoa , a company at some distance from conventional marketplace pressure .
Alcoa had remained loyal , despite grumbling by some of its board members .
It had given Murrow complete editorial freedom , which meant that he was not dependent upon the network for license to do as be wished .
But the McCarthy show and a program sympathetic to nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer had caused the rumbling to mount become more direct .
At the end of the 1955 spring schedule , Alcoa decided not to renew .
At almost the same time , TV quiz shows were rising to popularity .
Not the " $ 64 question " of the old radio days ; no , in superrich America in its supercentury , it was time for The $ 64,000 Question .
Murrow , watching the first run of The $ 64,000 Question , was disturbed .
The hucksterism of the network had always frightened him .
At the end of the first run , he turned to Friendly and asked " Any bets on how much longer we 'll keep this time period ? "
Not very long .
Soon after the final See It Now show of 1954 - 1955 , Murrow and Friendly were summoned to Paley 's office .
The Chairman admired their work and was generous in praise of it .
He wondered , however , if it was n't too confining : coming up every week ( in a regular segment prime time , something he neglected to mention ) .
Would n't eight one - hour shows a year be better ?
Would n't this be more satisfying ?
Murrow , wise to these games , asked at what hour they would be shown .
Paley said at eight .
Murrow asked if he could n't continue the half - hour show .
Paley , who has a particular talent for saying no without using the actual word , made it clear that no more regular half hours were available .
The schedule was tightening at the expense of public affairs .
More important and more profitable programs had to be shown .
The loss of the time slot was not the only setback for Murrow .
To go to a full hour would change the balance of the show and would cost Murrow and Friendly heavily in terms spontaneity , and , in subtle ways , of autonomy .
For , with an hour - long slot and perhaps without a regular sponsor , Murrow 's shows would have to be scheduled far in advance , and decided upon in consultation with others in the company .
No more could they just do whatever they wanted and broadcast it at their hour .
Management was taking over the show .
The problems mounted .
General Motors offered to sponser six of the eight , then reneged when they were told that one of the shows was to be on the vice presidency .
GM suspected that this would end up as an attack on then Vice President Richard Nixon .
One of the documentaries focused on the farm problem , and it starred the Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson .
The Republicans decided that damage had been done to him , and asked for equal time ( hardly expecting to be granted it ) .
Murrow protested , but CBS gave the Republicans the time anyway .
Murrow came very close to resigning .
The 1956 - 1957 schedule accommodated another eight See It Now shows , but they had been moved to Sunday at 5 o'clock , no longer in good , if fluctuating , evening hours .
Shows which Murrow considered important , programs on Tito and Chou En-lai , were followed by panel discussions , an attempt to dilute the effect of what had just been presented .
Murrow felt humiliations mounting , his influence waning .
The final indignity for Murrow involved a program which he considered one of the least important of 1958 , a minor , presumably noncontroversial show on statehood for Alaska and Hawaii .
It was what is known in the business as a " soft show . "
It balanced spokesman , some for and some against statehood .
One of the proponents of statehood , the leader Harry Bridges , was asked about a statement by a congressman from upstate New York , named John Pillion , that Bridges would control the Hawaiian delegation .
Bridges answered that Pillion was crazy .
Pillion , not that crazy , demanded equal time .
CBS caved , in .
( One weakness in the whole format of television programming was a lack of flexibility .
Television had no equivalent newspaper 's Letters to the Editor column , where minor disputes could be aired and then forgotten .
The networks were in the position of having to grant a full hour or nothing . )
The decision was straight Paley ; Sig Mickelson had argued against it and had mentioned the implication : that it might drive Murrow from the network .
Paley was unmoved .
The only possible explanation for Paley 's adamancy was that he was to see Murrow go .
Murrow was shocked .
The equal time decision had been made without any consultation with him , and it was clearly a surrender to the most petty kind of political pressure , and would only bring on more political pressure .
Murrow wrote a strong letter to Paley , saying that the decision to put Pillion on without consulting him had undermined his relationship with the company and put the future of See It Now in doubt .
It was precisely the letter Paley wanted and expected .
A few days later Paley met with Murrow and Friendly .
Murrow said that the situation had become untenable and that he or Friendly had to share in the decisions on who was to get equal time to respond to See It Now .
" But , " said Paley , " I thought you and Fred did n't want to do See It Now anymore . "
Murrow argued that he wanted to talk about the equal time regulations — of course he wanted the program to continue .
" I thought we had already decided about See It Now , " said Paley .
With that both Friendly and Murrow knew : See It Now had closed for the duration .
For Murrow it was his most painful moment at CBS : the end of the TV program about which he cared most deeply .
“ Are you really going to destroy all this ? " he asked Paley .
It was , he pointed out , the most remarkable achievement in electronic journalism .
Paley said yes , he was , he could not stand the constant stomach ache it was giving him ; the pain was killing him .
" It goes with the job , " Murrow answered .
And that was it .
16 . The Murrow Era is Being Canceled In Order to Bring You …
For Murrow , this latest in a series of concessions to politicians , was a dark omen , and he became obsessed by the trend .
The more CBS gave in to politicians , he told both his superiors and his friends , the more the politicians would demand and the more the pressures against the network would build , at the price of the internal integrity of the news department .
Eventually , he predicted , two things would happen : the network would treat fewer and fewer controversial subjects , anticipating in advance the complaints against them ; and second , it would gradually deal with public affairs in a way that would not disturb existing authority .
In both instincts he was prophetic .
What particularly disturbed him was how little say the news department now had in making decisions .
Instead of traditional definitions of journalistic fairness being the test , the norms were being set by people sensitive to both the government and the marketplace .
The company wanted to keep peace even if in journalistic terms this meant backing down ; it was now more sensitive to outside pressures than to its own people .
The only hope for survival of television news at its best , he insisted , was a rigid adherence to policies of journalistic fairness and excellence which would , in the long run , build genuine public support , and thus scare off marauding politicians .
The days when Paley might have listened to him , however , were past .
Now Murrow watched himself slowly being shunted aside at CBS .
He was too proud to complain outright , but gradually he began to change , to become more depressed .
Once , around 1958 , Charles Collingwood , who was closer to him than anyone else at CBS , told Murrow that he was caught in a dilemma , a choice between doing a show or going on a much needed vacation .
" I 'd go on the vacation , " Murrow said .
Collingwood mentioned that he rather wanted to do this particular program .
" It does n't make any difference , " Murrow answered .
" You 're only important around here as long as you 're useful to them , and you will be for a time .
When they 're finished they 'll throw you out without another thought . "
It was a side of him Collingwood had never seen before .
At the 1960 Democratic convention , CBS programmers had reduced Murrow 's role to a pitiful degree .
At one point during the convention he had a story which they kept scheduling and then canceling ; he became more and more morose .
Finally he came back to a room which the correspondents used as a base and grabbed two of his colleagues .
" Let 's go get a drink , " he said .
" Things have come to a pretty damn point when you can't even get on the air at a convention . "
In October , 1958 , Murrow went before a meeting of radio and television news directors in Chicago and said : " . . . and if there are any historians a hundred years from now , and there should be preserved the kinescopes for one week of all three networks , they will find recorded , in black and white or color , evidence of decadence , escapism , and insulation from realities of the world in which we live . . . .
If we go on as we are , then history will take its revenge and retribution will [ catch ] up with us . "
Paley was furious : Murrow had betrayed him , had fouled his own nest .
Ed Murrow had betrayed the man who , in Bill Paley 's view at least , had made him rich and famous .
The corporation would pay him back .
Stanton addressing the same convention a year later , promised , in the wake of the quiz show scandals , tight restrictions on all shows .
No more rigging .
No newspaper picked up the story .
So CBS gave a friendly hint .
A PR man called Jack Gould at the Times and deliberately tipped him , all shows .
That means Murrow and Person to Person too .
So , if Murrow could attack the corporation , then the corporation could slap down Murrow , deliberately diminishing his reputation .
Murrow , of course , was furious ; he issued a statement to the Times saying that Stanton had finally revealed his ignorance of all news matters .
It was quite a day for CBS and its image — two of the foremost figures of the company arguing their disputes out on the front page of the Times .
Ralph Cohn went to Murrow with orders from Paley to make Murrow apologize or resign .
He would do neither .
The quiz scandals provoked one of those periodic bursts of network good intentions to do more in the public interest .
In March 1959 , Stanton promised that CBS would sponsor regular one - hour documentaries in prime time once a month .
Then biweekly .
Then perhaps once a week .
He was describing a documentary series suspiciously like See It Now .
But without Murrow .
Then the corporate genius showed .
In the Murrow - Friendly team it was Murrow ’s name that was special , Murrow whom they feared .
CBS knew that Friendly was ambitious , delighted to be associated with Murrow but eager for a reputation of his own .
Paley and Stanton knew that with everyone in CBS News desperate for air time , it would be impossible for either Murrow or Friendly to say no to any major offer of time .
So Paley and Stanton made Friendly an offer he could not refuse .
He was called into Sig Mickelson ’s office and asked to do a monthly documentary .
Friendly was surprised .
He wondered whether it had been cleared with the twentieth floor .
Mickelson made clear that it had been , that this was what the twentieth floor wanted .
Was the offer made to the Murrow - Friendly team ?
Friendly wondered .
No , answered Mickelson , but Murrow was going on sabbatical anyway .
Murrow certainly would be the reporter on some shows , but other correspondents would be used .
So the predictable happened .
Murrow encouraged Friendly to take the job — the offer was simply too good , the time too precious .
Friendly had been the best documentary producer at CBS .
If someone else took the assignment and failed , it might be bad for television journalism .
See It Now became CBS Reports .
( Once Stanton and Paley were searching for a name for the show and asked Murrow what to call it .
" How about See It Now With Ed Murrow , " he answered sardonically . )
With remarkable ease Murrow was split from Friendly , the air time went to Friendly , who seemed in no way a corporate threat , and Murrow was separated from any regular or direct access to television air time .
Murrow was now an honored name , but a name without a voice .
That was exactly what the corporation wanted .
Murrow returned from his sabbatical with his future at CBS very much in doubt .
If he was an ornament to his profession , his superiors deemed him increasingly too risky a one .
Sig Mickelson negotiated renewal of his contract , and came up with a figure acceptable to both himself and Murrow , but after months and months of querying , he could never get a response from management .
The situation was ominous .
Murrow himself had little taste for this fight .
He was tired now , eroded physically and spiritually , and depressed about his own profession .
He saw it becoming more and more a vehicle for manipulation rather than a vehicle for strengthening the parameters of vision .
All those years of smoking , all that nervous energy and tension had taken their toll .
Those cigarettes and those late - night drinks were depressants , not stimulants , and now he was worn out .
Fortunately for Murrow , whose contract was still unsettled in 1960 , John Kennedy was elected President and Ed Murrow was offered the job of running the USIA .
The job offer by Kennedy , said Murrow 's wife , Janet , years later , “ was a brilliant and timely gift . "
When the Kennedy offer finally came through , Murrow was ready .
A man who just twelve years earlier had been supreme in his profession , who had received an under - the - table offer from NBC asking him to write out whatever figure he wanted , just name the price , was now almost unemployable in broadcasting .
The day the news came from Washington , he was taping a radio show called Background .
Now Murrow wanted out , totally out , and as quickly as possible .
He turned to his colleague Blair Clark and asked if Clark would fill in and anchor the program .
Clark said he would , and asked Murrow what he should tell their listeners to explain Murrow 's absence .
Murrow answered , with cold suppressed fury , " Tell them I 've gone to serve my country . "
On April 27 , 1965 , Ed Murrow died of lung cancer .
He had suffered a long and painful and exhausting illness .
That night CBS , under the direction of the man who was now head of news , Fred Friendly , broadcast a memorial program " to the most distinguished commentator in our history . "
It was made up of tapes from his television broadcasts , and voice - over from his radio days , accompanied by still photos .
It was powerful and moving , not least because those friends of his who happened to narrate it — Sevareid and Collingwood — had the best voices in broadcasting .
The afternoon before it was aired , Friendly received a phone call from one of Paley 's PR people .
Is anyone going to speak for the company ?
the PR man inquired .
Friendly answered that he did n't know what that meant .
This was a show , he said , about Ed Murrow , who had worked for CBS .
Are you going to be on ?
the PR man asked .
No , said Friendly , it was going to be very simple .
Murrow and some of his boys .
What do you think , said the PR man , of the idea of the Chairman going on for two minutes ?
Oh , said Friendly , slightly taken aback , do you think he really wants to ?
Yes , said the PR man , I 'm very sure he'd like to .
So on the occasion of the death of Edward R. Murrow , William S. Paley , who had done so much to make him and almost as much to break him , and who wanted to be sure that the company got credit for Murrow , went on the air to say that Ed Murrow had symbolized the golden age of broadcasting , and that there would soon be another golden age .
In 1973 , as the Watergate scandals unfolded , Janet Murrow watched television news regularly .
She often felt frustrated by the lack of commentary .
Of the varying commentators , she thought that Bill Moyers most resembled Ed .
But he was not on the networks ; he was on public television .
Her son , Casey Murrow , lived in Vermont and taught school .
He did not own a television set .
See the second installment of this article from the February 1976 issue .
*A BBD&O study for a typical year .
1970 - 1971 .
NBC in the same study was listed at 2 percent for information and news , and ABC at nothing at all .
Much of what government does is based on the premise that people can't do things for themselves .
So government must do it for them .
More often than not , the result is a ham - handed , bumbling , one - size - fits - all approach that leaves the intended beneficiaries worse off .
Of course , this resulting failure is never blamed on the political approach — on the contrary , failure is taken to mean the government solution was not extravagant enough .
We who have confidence in what free people can achieve have long believed that government should not venture beyond its narrow sphere of providing physical security .
It should not attempt to cure every social ill .
So it 's good to learn that serious scholars have demonstrated that our intuitions are right .
Free people , given the chance , solve what many " experts " think are problems that require state intervention .
For that reason , Elinor Ostrom 's winning of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ought to kindle a new interest in freedom .
( See my earlier column here . )
Ostrom made her mark through field studies that show people solving one of the more vexing problems : efficient management of a common - pool resource ( CPR ) , such as a pasture or fishery .
With an unowned " commons , " each individual has an incentive to get the most out of it without putting anything back .
If I take fish from a common fishing area , I benefit completely from those fish .
But if I make an investment to increase the future number of fish , others benefit , too .
So why should I risk making the investment ?
I 'll wait for others to do it .
But everyone else faces the same free - rider incentive .
So we end up with a depleted resource and what Garrett Harden called " the tragedy of the commons . "
Except , says Ostrom , we often do n't .
There is also an " opportunity of the commons . "
While most politicians conclude that , depending on the resource , efficient management requires either privatization or government ownership , Ostrom finds examples of a third way : " self - organizing forms of collective action , " as she put it in an interview a few years ago .
Her message is to be wary of government promises .
" Field studies in all parts of the world have found that local groups of resource users , sometimes by themselves and sometimes with the assistance of external actors , have created a wide diversity of institutional arrangements for cooperating with common - pool resources . "
She has studied , for example , self - governing irrigation systems in Nepal and found successes never anticipated in the textbooks .
" Irrigation systems built and governed by the farmers themselves are on average in better repair , deliver more water , and have higher agricultural productivity than those provided and managed by a government agency .
…
( F ) armers craft their own rules , which frequently offset the perverse incentives they face in their particular physical and cultural settings .
These rules may be almost invisible to outsiders . … "
In Governing the Commons , she writes about self - governed commons in Switzerland , Japan , the Philippines , and elsewhere that date back hundreds of years .
For example , in the alpine village of Tobel , Switzerland , herdsmen " tend village cattle on communally owned alpine meadows " under rules of an association created in 1483 .
The rules govern who has access to the grazing lands and how many cows a herdsman can place there , preventing overgrazing .
The cattle owners themselves run the association and handle the monitoring .
Sanctions are imposed for violation of the rules , but compliance is high .
Do n't mistake the association for government .
Rather , it is a private co-op designed for a narrow purpose .
" All of the Swiss institutions used to govern commonly owned alpine meadows have one obvious similarity — the appropriators themselves make all the major decisions about the use of the CPR . "
She found something similar in Japanese villages , where residents use private property for some agricultural purposes and self - managed common forests for others .
Solutions imposed by external authority were not necessary — and usually self - defeating : " Academics , aid donors , international nongovernmental organizations , central governments , and local citizens need to learn and relearn that no government can develop the full array of knowledge , institutions and social capital needed to govern development efficiently and sustainably . … "
How about that ?

BAGHDAD  Bombs exploded near five Shiite mosques around Baghdad within 45 minutes on Friday as worshipers attended prayer services , killing at least 29 people in what appeared to be a coordinated attack against followers of the anti-American cleric Moktada al - Sadr .
The attacks , while less deadly than others in recent weeks , placed new scrutiny on the readiness of Iraqi security forces , a month after American troops pulled out of cities here .
Some Sadrist leaders asked angrily why they were not protected , while others went so far as to accuse the government of actively making them targets now that American forces are less involved in daily operations .
Leaders of a community of Iranian dissidents in Iraq , engaged in a bloody confrontation days ago with Iraqi soldiers , are making the same allegation .
“ There is an organized campaign to liquidate Sadrists in which security forces are involved , ” said Tariq al - Kenani , a Sadrist leader .
The Iraqi government quickly denied any involvement , and the United States Embassy here released a statement deploring the “ barbaric attacks , ” suggesting they were carried out by extremist groups .
Roswell and the Horten Brothers
It was nighttime on the Rio Grande , 29 May 1947 , and Army scientists , engineers , and technicians at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico were anxiously putting the final touches on their own American secret weapon , called ' Hermes ' .
The twenty - five - foot - long , three - thousand - pound rocket had originally been named V - 2 , or Vergeltungswaffe 2 , which means " vengeance " in German .
But ' Hermes ' sounded less spiteful ; Hermes being the ancient Greek messenger of the gods .
The actual rocket that now stood on Test Stand 33 had belonged to Adolf Hitler just a little more than two years before .
It had come off the same German slave - labor production lines as the rockets that the Third Reich had used to terrorize the people of London , Antwerp , and Paris during the war .
The U.S. Army had confiscated nearly two hundred V - 2s from inside Peenemünde , Germany 's rocket manufacturing plant , and shipped them to White Sands beginning the first month after the war .
Under a parallel , even more secret project called " Operation Paperclip " the complete details of which remain classified as of 2011 , 118 captured German rocket scientists were given new lives and careers and brought to the missile range .
Hundreds of others would follow .
Two of these German scientists were now readying ' Hermes ' for its test launch .
One , Wernher Von Braun , had invented this rocket , which was the world 's first ballistic missile , or flying bomb .
And the second scientist , Dr. Ernst Steinhoff , had designed the V - 2 rocket 's brain .
That spring night in 1947 , the V - 2 lifted up off the pad , rising slowly at first , with von Braun and Steinhoff watching intently .
' Hermes ' consumed more than a thousand pounds of rocket fuel in its first 2.5 seconds as it elevated to fifty feet .
The next fifty feet were much easier , as were the hundred feet after that .
The rocket gained speed , and the laws of physics kicked in : Aything can fly if you make it move fast enough .
' Hermes ' was now fully aloft , climbing quickly into the night sky and headed for the upper atmosphere .
At least that was the plan .
Just a few moments later , the winged missile suddenly and unexpectedly reversed course .
Instead of heading north to the uninhabited terrain inside the two - million - square - acre White Sands Proving Ground , the rocket began heading south toward downtown El Paso , Texas .
Dr. Steinhoff was watching the missile 's trajectory through a telescope from an observation post one mile south of the launchpad , and having personally designed the V - 2 rocket - guidance controls back when he worked for Adolf Hitler , Dr. Steinhoff was the one best equipped to recognize errors in the test .
In the event that Steinhoff detected an errant launch , he would notify Army engineers , who would immediately cut the fuel to the rocket 's motors via remote control , allowing it to crash safely inside the missile range .
But Dr. Steinhoff said nothing as the misguided V - 2 arced over El Paso and headed for Mexico .
Minutes later , the rocket crash - landed into the Tepeyac Cemetery , three miles south of Juarez , a heavily populated city of 120,000 .
The violent blast shook virtually every building in El Paso and Juarez , terrifying citizens of both cities , who swamped newspaper offices , police headquarters and radio stations with anxious telephone inquiries .
The missile left a crater that was fifty feet wide and twenty - four feet deep .
It was a miracle no one was killed .
Army officials rushed to Juarez to smooth over the event while Mexican soldiers were dispatched to guard the crater 's rim .
The mission , the men , and the rocket were all classified top secret ; no one could know specific details about any of this .
Investigators silenced Mexican officials by cleaning up the large , bowl - shaped cavity and paying for damages .
But back at White Sands , reparations were not so easily made .
Allegations of sabotage by the German scientists who were in charge of the top secret project overwhelmed the workload of the Intelligence officers at White Sands .
Attitudes toward the former Third Reich scientists who were now working for the United States tended to fall into two distinct categories at the time .
There was the let - bygones - be - bygones approach , an attitude summed up by the Army officer in charge of ' Operation Paperclip ' , Bosquet Wev , who stated that to preoccupy oneself with " picayune details " about German scientists ' past actions was " beating a dead Nazi horse " .
The logic behind this thinking was that a disbanded Third Reich presented no future harm to America but a burgeoning Soviet military certainly did and if the Germans were working for us , they could n't be working for them .
Others disagreed , including Albert Einstein .
Five months before the Juarez crash , Einstein and the newly formed Federation of American Scientists appealed to President Truman : " We hold these individuals to be potentially dangerous¡­
Their former eminence as Nazi party members and supporters raises the issue of their fitness to become American citizens and hold key positions in American industrial , scientific and educational institutions " .
For Einstein , making deals with war criminals was undemocratic as well as dangerous .
While the public debate went on , internal investigations began .
And the rocket work at White Sands continued .
The German scientists had been testing V - 2s there for fourteen months , and while investigations of the Juarez rocket crash were under way , three more missiles fired from Test Stand 33 crash - landed outside the restricted facility : one near Alamogordo , New Mexico , and another near Las Cruces , New Mexico .
A third went down outside Juarez , Mexico , again .
The German scientists blamed the near tragedies on old V - 2 components .
Seawater had corroded some of the parts during the original boat trip from Germany .
But in top secret written reports , Army Intelligence officers were building a case that would lay blame on the German scientists .
The War Department Intelligence unit that kept tabs on the German scientists had designated some of the Germans at the base as " under suspicion of being potential security risks " .
When not working , the men were confined to a six - acre section of the base .
The officers ' club was off - limits to all the Germans , including the rocket team 's leaders , Steinhoff and von Braun .
It was in this atmosphere of failed tests and mistrust that an extra- ordinary event happened , one that , at first glance , seemed totally unrelated to the missile launches .
During the first week of July 1947 , U.S. Signal Corps engineers began tracking two objects with remarkable flying capabilities moving across the southwestern United States .
What made the aircraft extra-ordinary was that , although they flew in a traditional , forward - moving motion , the craft , whatever they were , began to hover sporadically before continuing to fly on .
This kind of technology was beyond any aerodynamic capabilities the U.S. Air Force had in development in the summer of 1947 .
When multiple sources began reporting the same data , it became clear that the radar was n't showing phantom returns , or electronic ghosts , but something real .
Kirtland Army Air Force Base , just north of the White Sands Proving Ground , tracked the flying craft into its near vicinity .
The commanding officer there ordered a decorated World War II pilot named Kenny Chandler into a fighter jet to locate and chase the unidentified flying craft .
This fact has never before been disclosed .
Chandler never visually spotted what he'd been sent to look for .
But within hours of Chandler 's sweep of the skies , one of the flying objects crashed near Roswell , New Mexico .
Immediately , the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , or JCS , took command and control and recovered the airframe and some propulsion equipment , including the crashed craft 's power plant , or energy source .
The recovered craft looked nothing like a conventional aircraft .
The vehicle had no tail and it had no wings .
The fuselage was round , and there was a dome mounted on the top .
In secret Army intelligence memos declassified in 1994 , it would be referred to as a " flying disc " .
Most alarming was a fact kept secret until now , inside the disc , there was a very earthly hallmark : Russian writing .
Block letters from the Cyrillic alphabet had been stamped , or embossed , in a ring running around the inside of the craft .
In a critical moment , the American military had its worst fears realized .
The Russian army must have gotten its hands on German aerospace engineers more capable than Ernst Steinhoff and Wernher von Braun , engineers who must have developed this flying craft years before for the German air force , or Luftwaffe .
The Russians simply could not have developed this kind of advanced technology on their own .
Russia 's stockpile of weapons and its body of scientists had been decimated during the war ; the nation had lost more than twenty million people .
Most Russian scientists still alive had spent the war in the Gulag .
But the Russians , like the Americans , the British , and the French , had pillaged Hitler 's best and brightest scientists as war booty , each country taking advantage of them to move forward in the new world .
And now , in July of 1947 , shockingly , the Soviet supreme leader had somehow managed not only to penetrate U.S. airspace near the Alaskan border , but to fly over several of the most sensitive military installations in the western United States .
Stalin had done this with foreign technology that the U.S. Army Air Forces knew nothing about .
It was an incursion so brazen , so antithetical to the perception of America 's strong national security , which included the military 's ability to defend itself against air attack , that upper - echelon Army Intelligence officers swept in and took control of the entire situation .
The first thing they did was initiate the withdrawal of the original Roswell Army Air Field press release , the one that stated that a " flying disc " ­ landed on a ranch near Roswell , and then they replaced it with the second press release , the one that said that a weather balloon had crashed , nothing more .
The weather balloon story has remained the official cover story ever since .
Of all the historically significant political / military events of the 20th Century , none have had more official explanations than the so called " Roswell Incident " .
In fact , as of 2011 , the United States government has issued four sanctioned explanations : 1 ) The crash of a flying saucer , 2 ) the remains of a weather balloon , 3 ) the remains of a " Project Mogul " balloon , 4 ) Crash test dummies .
Logic alone would dictate that if the government lied about the last three explanations , why should the general public believe the first one ?
The fears were legitimate : fears that the Russians had hover - and fly technology , that their flying craft could outfox U.S. radar , and that it could deliver to America a devastating blow .
The single most worrisome question facing the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time was :
What if atomic energy propelled the Russian craft ?
Or worse , what if it dispersed radioactive particles , like a modern - day dirty bomb ?
In 1947 , the United States believed it still had a monopoly on the atomic bomb as a deliverable weapon .
But as early as June 1942 , Hermann Göring , commander in chief of the Luftwaffe , had been overseeing the Third Reich 's research council on nuclear physics as a weapon in its development of an airplane called the " Amerika Bomber " , designed to drop a dirty bomb on New York City .
Any number of those scientists could be working for the Russians .
The Central Intelligence Group , the CIA 's institutional predecessor , did not yet know that a spy at Los Alamos National Laboratory , a man named Klaus Fuchs , had stolen bomb blueprints and given them to Stalin .
Or that Russia was two years away from testing its own atomic bomb .
In the immediate aftermath of the crash , all the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to go on from the Central Intelligence Group was speculation about what atomic technology Russia might have .
For the military , the very fact that New Mexico 's airspace had been violated was shocking .
This region of the country was the single most sensitive weapons - related domain in all of America .
The White Sands Missile Range was home to the nation 's classified weapons - delivery systems .
The nuclear laboratory up the road , the Los Alamos Laboratory , was where scientists had developed the atomic bomb and where they were now working on nuclear packages with a thousand times the yield .
Outside Albuquerque , at a production facility called Sandia Base , assembly - line workers were forging Los Alamos nuclear packages into smaller and smaller bombs .
Forty - five miles to the southwest , at the Roswell Army Air Field , the 509th Bomb Wing was the only wing of long - range bombers equipped to carry and drop nuclear bombs .
Things went from complicated to critical at the revelation that there was a second crash site .
Paperclip scientists Wernher von Braun and Ernst Steinhoff , still under review over the Juarez rocket crash , were called on for their expertise .
Several other Paperclip scientists specializing in aviation medicine were brought in .
The evidence of whatever had crashed at and around Roswell , New Mexico , in the first week of July in 1947 was gathered together by a Joint Chiefs of Staff technical services unit and secreted away in a manner so clandestine , it followed security protocols established for transporting uranium in the early days of the Manhattan Project .
The first order of business was to determine where the technology had come from .
The Joint Chiefs of Staff tasked an elite group working under the direct orders of G - 2 Army intelligence to initiate a top secret project called " Operation Harass " .
Based on the testimony of America 's Paperclip scientists , Army intelligence officers believed that the flying disc was the brainchild of two former Third Reich airplane engineers , named Walter and Reimar Horten , now working for the Russian military .
Orders were drawn up .
The manhunt was on .
Walter and Reimar Horten were two aerospace engineers whose importance in seminal aircraft projects had somehow been overlooked when America and the Soviet Union were fighting over scientists at the end of the war .
The brothers were the inventors of several of Hitler 's flying - wing aircraft , including one called the Horten 229 or Horten IX , a wing - shaped , tailless airplane that had been developed at a secret facility in Baden - Baden during the war .
From the Paperclip scientists at Wright Field , the Army Intelligence investigators learned that Hitler was rumored to have been developing a faster - flying aircraft that had been designed by the brothers and was shaped like a saucer .
Maybe , the Paperclips said , there had been a later - model Horten in the works before Germany surrendered , meaning that even if Stalin did n't have the Horten brothers themselves , he could very likely have gotten control of their blueprints and plans .
The flying disc that crashed at Roswell had technology more advanced than anything the U.S. Army Air Forces had ever seen .
Its propulsion techniques were particularly confounding .
What made the craft go so fast ?
How was it so stealthy and how did it trick radar ?
The disc had appeared on Army radar screens briefly and then suddenly disappeared .
The incident at Roswell happened just weeks before the National Security Act , which meant there was no true Central Intelligence Agency to handle the investigation .
Instead , hundreds of Counter Intelligence Corps [ CIC ] officers from the U.S. Army 's European command were dispatched across Germany in search of anyone who knew anything about Walter and Reimar Horten .
Officers tracked down and interviewed the brothers ' relatives , colleagues , professors , and acquaintances with an urgency not seen since Operation ALSOS , in which Allied Forces sought information about Hitler 's atomic scientists and nuclear programs during the war .
A records group of more than three hundred pages of Army Intelligence documents reveals many of the details of " Operation Harass " .
They were declassified in 1994 , after a researcher named Timothy Cooper filed a request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act .
One memo , called ' Air Intelligence Guide for Alleged Flying Saucer Type Aircraft ' , detailed for CIC officers the parameters of the flying saucer technology the military was looking for , features which were evidenced in the craft that crashed at Roswell .
Extreme maneuverability and apparent ability to almost hover ; a plan form approximating that of an oval or disc with dome shape on the surface ; the ability to quickly disappear by high speed or by complete disintegration ; the ability to group together very quickly in a tight formation when more than one aircraft are together ; evasive motion ability indicating possibility of being manually operated , or possibly , by electronic or remote control .
The Counter Intelligence Corps ' official 1947 C1948 manhunt for the Horten brothers reads at times like a spy novel and at times like a wild goose chase .
The first real lead in the hunt came from Dr. Adolf Smekal of Frankfurt , who provided CIC with a list of possible informants ' names .
Agents were told a dizzying array of alleged facts : Reimar was living in secret in East Prussia ; Reimar was living in Göttingen , in what had been the British zone ; Reimar had been kidnapped " presumably by the Russians " in the latter part of 1946 .
If you want to know where Reimar is , one informant said , you must first locate Hannah Reitsch , the famous aviatrix who was living in Bad Hauheim .
As for Walter , he was working as a consultant for the French ; he was last seen in Frankfurt trying to find work with a university there ; he was in Dessau ; actually , he was in Russia ; he was in Luxembourg , or maybe it was France .
One German scientist turned informant chided CIC agents .
If they really wanted to know where the Horten brothers were , he said , and what they were capable of , then go ask the American Paperclip scientists living at Wright Field .
Neatly typed and intricately detailed summaries of hundreds of interviews with the Horten brothers ' colleagues and relatives flooded the CIC .
Army Intelligence officers spent months chasing leads , but most information led them back to square one .
In the fall of 1947 , prospects of locating the brothers seemed grim until November , when CIC agents caught a break .
A former Messerschmitt test pilot named Fritz Wendel offered up some firsthand testimony that seemed real .
The Horten brothers had indeed been working on a flying saucer - like craft in Heiligenbeil , East Prussia , right after the war , Wendel said .
The airplane was ten meters long and shaped like a half - moon .
It had no tail .
The prototype was designed to be flown by one man lying down flat on his stomach .
It reached a ceiling of twelve thousand feet .
Wendel drew diagrams of this saucerlike aircraft , as did a second German informant named Professor George , who described a later model Horten as being " very much like a round cake with a large sector cut out " and that had been developed to carry more than one crew member .
The later - model Horten could travel higher and faster , up to 1,200 mph .
because it was propelled by rockets rather than jet engines .
Its cabin was allegedly pressurized for high - altitude flights .
The Americans pressed Fritz Wendel for more .
Could it hover ?
Not that Wendel knew .
Did he know if groups could fly tightly together ?
Wendel said he had no idea .
Were " high speed escapement methods " designed into the craft ?
Wendel was n't sure .
Could the flying disc be remotely controlled ?
Yes , Wendel said he knew of radio - control experiments being conducted by Siemens and Halske at their electrical factory in Berlin .
Army officers asked Wendel if he had heard of any hovering or near - hovering technologies .
No. Did Wendel have any idea about the tactical purposes for such an aircraft ?
Wendel said he had no idea .
The next batch of solid information came from a rocket engineer named Walter Ziegler .
During the war , Ziegler had worked at the car manufacturer Bayerische Motoren Werke , or BMW , which served as a front for advanced rocket - science research .
There , Ziegler had been on a team tasked with developing advanced fighter jets powered by rockets .
Ziegler relayed a chilling tale that gave investigators an important clue .
One night , about a year after the war , in September of 1946 , four hundred men from his former rocket group at BMW had been invited by Russian military officers to a fancy dinner .
The rocket scientists were wined and dined and , after a few hours , taken home .
Most were drunk .
Several hours later , all four hundred of the men were woken up in the middle of the night by their Russian hosts and told they were going to be taking a trip .
Why Ziegler was n't among them was not made clear .
The Germans were told to bring their wives , their children , and whatever else they needed for a long trip .
Mistresses and livestock were also fine .
This was not a situation to which you could say no , Ziegler explained .
The scientists and their families were transported by rail to a small town outside Moscow where they had remained ever since , forced to work on secret military projects in terrible conditions .
According to Ziegler , it was at this top secret Russian facility , exact whereabouts unknown , that the German scientists were developing rockets and other advanced technologies under Russian supervision .
These were Russia 's version of the American Paperclip scientists .
It was very possible , Ziegler said , that the Horten brothers had been working for the Russians at the secret facility there .
For nine long months , CIC agents typed up memo after memo relating various theories about where the Horten brothers were , what their flying saucers might have been designed for , and what leads should or should not be pursued .
And then , six months into the investigation , on 12 March 1948 , along came abrupt news .
The Horten brothers had been found .
In a memo to the European command of the 970th CIC , Major Earl S. Browning Jr. explained .
" The Horten Brothers have been located and interrogated by American Agencies " , Browning said .
The Russians had likely found the blueprints of the flying wing after all .
" It is Walter Horten 's opinion that the blueprints of the Horten IX may have been found by Russian troops at the Gotha Railroad Car Factory " , the memo read .
But a second memo , entitled ' Extracts on Horten ' , Walter , explained a little more .
Former Messerschmitt test pilot Fritz Wendel 's information about the Horten brothers ' wingless , tailless , saucerlike craft that had room for more than one crew member was confirmed .
" Walter Horten 's opinion is that sufficient German types of flying wings existed in the developing or designing stages when the Russians occupied Germany , and these types may have enabled the Russians to produce the flying saucer " .
There is no mention of Reimar Horten , the second brother , in any of the hundreds of pages of documents released to Timothy Cooper as part of his Freedom of Information
Act request , despite the fact that both brothers had been confirmed as located and interrogated .
Nor is there any mention of what Reimar Horten did or did not say about the later - model Horten flying discs .
But one memo mentioned " the Horten X "
Due to the rapidly deteriorating war conditions in Germany in the last months of WWII , the RLM [ Reichs Luftfahrt Ministerium , or German Air Ministry ] issued a specification for a fighter project that would use a minimum of strategic materials , be suitable for rapid mass production and have a performance equal to the best piston engined fighters of the time .
The ' Volksjäger ' [ People 's Fighter ] project , as it became known , was issued on 8 September 1944 to Arado , Blohm & Voss , Fiesler , Focke - Wulf , Junkers , Heinkel , Messerschmitt and Siebel .
The new fighter also needed to weigh no more than 2000 kg [ 4410 lbs ] , have a maximum speed of 750 km/h [ 457 mph ] , a minimum endurance of 30 minutes , a takeoff distance of 500 m [ 1604 ft ] , an endurance of at least 30 minutes and it was to use the BMW 003 turbojet .
Although not chosen to submit a design , the Horten Brothers came up with the Ho X [ 10 ] that met the specifications laid out by the RLM .
Using a similar concept that they had been working on with their Horten IX [ Ho 229 ] flying wing fighter , the Ho X was to be constructed of steel pipes covered with plywood panels in the center section , with the outer sections constructed from two - ply wood beams covered in plywood .
The wing featured two sweepbacks , approximately 60 degrees at the nose , tapering into a 43 degree sweepback out to the wingtips .
Control was to be provided by combined ailerons and elevators at the wingtips , along with drag surfaces at the wingtips for lateral control .
A single BMW 003E jet engine with 900 kp of thrust was housed in the rear of the aircraft , which was fed by two air intakes on either side of the cockpit .
One advantage to this design was that different jet engines could be accommodated , such as the Heinkel - Hirth He S 011 with 1300 kp of thrust , which was to be added later after its development was complete .
The landing gear was to be of a tricycle arrangement and the pilot sat in a pressurized cockpit in front of the engine compartment .
Armament consisted of a single MK 108 30 mm cannon [ or a single MK 213 30 mm cannon ] in the nose and two MG 131 13 mm machine guns , one in each wing root .
In order to determine the center of gravity on various sweepback angles , scale models with a 3.05 meter [ 10 feet ] wingspan were built .
A full - sized glider was also under construction but was not completed before the war 's end .
Due to the ending of hostilities in 1945 , the Horten Ho X was not completed .
Of the competing firms the Heinkel He 162 Volksjäger a single - engine , jet - powered fighter aircraft , designed and built quickly , and made primarily of wood as metals were in very short supply and prioritised for other aircraft , was the winner .
The He 162 was the fastest of the first generation of Axis and Allied jets .
Other names given to the plane include ' Salamander ' , which was the codename of its construction program , and ' Spatz ' [ Sparrow ] , which was the name given to the plane by Heinkel . and another referred to " the Horten XIII " .
No further details have been provided , and a 2011 Freedom of Information
Act request by the author met a dead end .
The Horten Ho XIII B supersonic flying wing fighter was developed from the Ho XIII A glider , which had 60 degree swept - back wings and an underslung nacelle for the pilot .
The XIII B was to be powered by a single BMW 003R turbojet / rocket engine .
The cockpit was located in the base of a large , sharply swept vertical fin .
Like the research XIII A glider , the XIII B also had swept back wings at a 60 degree angle .
Projected armament were two MG 213 20 mm cannon , and the Ho XIII B was projected to be flying by mid-1946 .
Span : 12 m [ 39 ' 4.8 " ]
Length : 12 m [ 39 ' 4.8 " ]
Max .
Speed : 1800 km/h [ 1118 mph ]
On 12 May 1948 , the headquarters of European command sent the director of Intelligence at the United States Forces in Austria a puzzling memo .
" Walter Horten has admitted his contacts with the Russians " , it said .
That was the last mention of the Horten brothers in the Army Intelligence 's declassified record for " Operation Harass " .
Whatever else officially exists on the Horten brothers and their advanced flying saucer continues to be classified as of 2011 , and the crash remains from Roswell quickly fell into the blackest regions of government .
They would stay at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base for approximately four years .
From there , they would quietly be shipped out west to become intertwined with a secret facility out in the middle of the Nevada desert .
No one but a handful of people would have any idea they were there .

Roswell and the Horten Flying Wing Lt Col Walker , at the Air Material Command , asked his operatives in the field to discretely track down the Horten brothers and ascertain whether their radical " Flying Wing " designs - developed during WWII - might be responsible for the rash of Flying Saucer sightings in 1947 .

1 . The Horten brothers , Reimar and Walter , are residing in Göttingen at present .
However , both of them are traveling a great deal throughout the Bi-Zone .
Walter at present is traveling in Bavaria in search of a suitable place of employment .
It is believed that he may have contacted USAFE Head - quarters in Wiesbaden for possible evacuation to the United States under " Paper Clip " .
Reimer is presently studying advanced mathematics at the university of Bonn , and is about to obtain his doctor 's degree .
It is believed that when his studies are completed he intends to accept a teaching position at the Institute for Technology [ Techniscbe Hochschule ] in Braunschweig sometime in February or March 1948 .
2 . Both brothers are exceedingly peculiar and can be easily classified as eccentric and individualistic .
Especially is this so of Reimar .
He is the one who developed the theory of the flying wing and subsequently of all the models and aircrafts built by the brothers .
Walter , on the other hand is the engineer who tried to put into practice the several somewhat fantastic ideas of his brother .
The clash of personalities resulted in a continuous quarrel and friction between the two brothers .
Reimar was always developing new ideas which would increase the speed of the aircraft or improve its manoeuvrability ;
Walter on the other hand was tearing down the fantastic ideas of his brother by practical calculations and considerations .
3 . The two men worked together up to and including the " Horten VIII " a flying wing intended to be a fighter plane powered with two Hirt engines [ HM - 60 - R ] with a performance of approximately 650 horsepower each .
After the " Horten VIII " was finished , one of the usual and frequent quarrels separated the two brothers temporarily .
Walter went to work alone on the " Horten IX " , which is a fighter plane of the flying wing design , with practically no changes from the model VIII except for the engines .
Walter substituted the Hirt engines with BMW Jets of the type TL - 004 .
The plane was made completely of plywood and was furnished with a Messerschmidt ME - 109 Landing gear .
The model of this aircraft ( Horten IX ) was tested extensively in the supersonic wind tunnel [ Mach No. 1.0 ] of the aero- dynamic testing institute [ Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt , located in Göttingen .
The tests were conducted in the late summer of 1944 under the personal supervision of Professor Betz , chief of the institute .
Betz at that time was approximately sixty years old and next to Prandtel [ then seventy - eight years old ] , was considered to be the best man on aerodynamics in Germany .
Betz 's attitude toward the flying wing is very conservative to say the least .
Basically he is against the design of any flying wing .
According to the official reports about the tests , air disturbances were created on the wing tips , resulting in air vacuums , which in turn would prevent the steering mechanism from functioning properly .
This seems logical as , of course , neither the ailerons nor the rudders could properly accomplish their function in a partial vacuum created by air disturbances and whirls .
In spite of that , two Horten IX 's were built and tried out by a test pilot , Eugen [ now living in Gottingen ] at Rechlin in the fall of 1944 .
One of the two planes , piloted by another test pilot , developed trouble with one of the jet engines while the pilot was trying to ascertain the maximum rate of climb .
The right jet stopped suddenly , causing the aircraft to go into an immediate spin and subsequent crash in which the pilot was killed .
Eugen , however , was more fortunate in putting the other ship through all the necessary paces without the least trouble .
He maintains that the maximum speed attained was around 950 km per hour , and that there were no steering difficulties whatsoever , and that the danger of both head and tail spins was no greater that any other conventional aircraft .
After extensive tests , the Horten IX was accepted by the German Air Force as represented by Göring , who ordered immediate mass production .
The first order went to Gothaer Waggon Fabrik , located in Gotha [ Thuringia ] in January 1945 .
Göring requested that ten planes be built immediately and that the entire factory was to concentrate and be converted to the production of the Horten IX .
The firm in question received all the plans and designs of the ship .
In spite of this explicit order , production of the Horten IX was never started .
The technical manager of the firm , Berthold , immediately upon receipt of the plans , submitted a number of suggestions to improve the aircraft .
It is believed that his intention was to eliminate the Horten brothers as inventors and to modify the ship to such an extent that it would be more his brain child than anybody else 's .
Numerous letters were exchanged from High Command of the German Air Force and Dr. Berthold , which finally were interrupted by the armistice in May 1945 .
When US troops occupied the town of Gotha , the designs of the Horten IX were kept in hiding and not handed over to American Military authorities .
The original designs in possession of the Horten brothers were hidden in a salt mine in Salzdettfurt , but the model tested by Eugen was destroyed in April 1945 .
The original designs were recovered from Salzdettfurt by British authorities in the summer of 1945 .
The Horten brothers , together with Dr. Betz , Eugen and Dr. Stüper [ the test pilot of the aerodynamic institute in Gottingen ] , were invited to go to England in the late summer of 1945 where they remained for approximately ninety days .
They were interrogated and questioned about their ideas and were given several problems to work on .
However Reimar was very unwilling to cooperate to any extent whatsoever , unless an immediate contract was offered to him and his brother .
Walter , on the other hand , not being a theoretician , was unable to comply and Reimar was sufficiently stubborn not to move a finger .
Upon their return to Göttingen Walter remained in contact with British authorities and was actually paid a salary by the British between October 1945 and April 1946 , as the British contemplated but never did offer him employment .
Walter subsequently had a final argument with his brother and the two decided to part .
Reimar then went to the university of Bonn to obtain his degree , and Walter organized an engineering office in Göttingen which served as a cover firm to keep him out of trouble with the labor authorities .
Walter married Fräulein von der Gröben , an extremely intelligent woman , former chief secretary to Air Force General Udet .
In the spring of 1947 Walter Horten heard about the flying wing design in the United States by Northrop and decided to write Northrop for employment .
He was answered in the summer of 1947 by a letter in which Northrop pointed out that he , himself , could not do anything to get him over to the States , but that he would welcome it very much if he could come to the United States and take up employment with the firm .
He recommended that Walter should get in touch with USAFE Headquarters in Wiesbaden in order to obtain necessary clearance .
4 . As can be seen from the above , most of the Hortens ' work took place in Western Germany .
According to our source , neither of the brothers ever had any contact with any representative of the Soviet Air Force or any other foreign power .
In spite of the fact that Reimar is rather disgusted with the British for not offering him a contract , it is believed very unlikely that he has approached the Soviet authorities in order to sell out to them .
The only possible link between the Horten brothers and the Soviet authorities is the fact that a complete set of plans and designs were hidden at the Gothaer Waggon Fabrik and the knowledge of this is known by Dr. Berthold and a number of other engineers .
It is possible and likely that either Berthold or any of the others having knowledge of the Horten IX would have sold out to the Soviet authorities for one of a number of reasons .
However , this will be checked upon in the future , and it is hoped that contact with the the Gothaer Waggon Fabrik can be established .
5 . As far as the " flying saucer " is concerned , a number of people were contacted in order to verify whether or not any such design at any time was contemplated or existed in the files of any German air research institute .
The people contacted included the following :
Walter Horten
Fräulein von der Gröben , former Secretary to Air Force General Udet
Günter Heinrich , former office for research of the High Command of the Air Force in Berlin
Professor Betz , former chief of Aerodynamic Institute in Göttingen
Eugen , former test pilot
All the above mentioned people contacted independently and at different times are very insistent on the fact that to their knowledge and belief no such design ever existed nor was projected by any of the German air research institutions .
While they agree that such a design would be highly practical and desirable , they do not know anything about its possible realization now or in the past .
A few items do n't make sense
First , some excerpts from : " The Horten Flying Wing in World War II : The History & Development of the Ho 229 " , by H. P. Dabrowski , translated from the German by David Johnson [ Schiffer Military History Vol. 47 ] .
" In February 1945 Heinz Scheidhauer flew the Ho VII to Göttingen .
Hydraulic failure prevented him from extending the aircraft 's undercarriage , and he was forced to make a belly landing .
The resulting damage had not been repaired when , on 7 April 1945 , US troops occupied the airfield .
The aircraft presumably suffered the same fate as the Ho V and was burned .
" The [ Ho IX V1 , RLM - Number 8 - 229 ] machine was sent to Brandis , where it was to be tested by the military and used for training purposes .
It was found there by soldiers of the US 9th Armored Division at the end of the war and was later burned in a ' clearing action ' .
" Construction of the Ho IX V3 was nearly complete when the Gotha Works at Friederichsroda were overrun by troops of the American 3rd Army 's VII Corps on 14 April 1945 .
The aircraft was assigned the number T2-490 by the Americans .
The aircraft 's official RLM designation is uncertain , as it was referred to as the Ho 229 as well as the Go 229 .
Also found in the destroyed and abandoned works were several other prototypes in various stages of construction , including a two - seat version The V3 was sent to the United States by ship , along with other captured aircraft , and finally ended up in the H.H. " Hap " Arnold collection of the Air Force Technical Museum .
The wing aircraft was to have been brought to flying status at Park Ridge , Illinois , but budget cuts in the late forties and early fifties brought these plans to an end .
The V3 was handed over to the present - day National Air and Space Museum [ NASM ] in Washington D.C. "
From these excerpts we see that certainly by late April or early May , 1945 , the US had not just knowledge but at least semi-functional examples of the Horten flying wing .
Ii can be assumed that the US would have wanted these craft back home for study as soon as was practical .
Lieutenant General Twining 's [ Commander of the Army Materiel Command ] 23 September 1947 letter to Brig .
General Schulgen [ Commanding General Army Air Forces ] states :
" It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge - provided extensive detailed development is undertaken - to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph ( e ) above which would be capable of an approximate range of 700 miles at subsonic speeds " .
Why only possible ?
The Horten flying wing (s ) had already been in US possession for two years .
Twining continues :
" Any developments in this country along the lines indicated would be extremely expensive , time consuming and at the considerable expense of current projects and therefore , if directed , should be set up independently of existing projects " .
Why expensive ?
The design , prototype and development work had already been completed .
Is this a dodge for more money ?
Twining points out :
" Due consideration must be given the following :
The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the product of some high security project not known to AC / AS - 2 or this command " .
How likely is it that the AMC was unaware of the captured Horten flying wing (s ) ?
Twining states that :
" This opinion was arrived at in a conference between personnel from the Air Institute of Technology , Intelligence T - 2 , Office , Chief of Engineering Division , and the Aircraft , Power Plant and Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T - 3 " .
How likely is it that these groups were unaware of the captured Horten flying wing (s ) ?
Phil Klass [ SUN # 26 , March 1994 ] quotes Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79 , 10 December 1948 :
" The origin of the devices [ UFOs ] is not ascertainable .
There are two reasonable possibilities : ( 1 ) The objects are domestic [ U.S. ] devices .
( 2 ) Objects are foreign , and if so , it would seem most logical to consider that they are from a Soviet source .
" The Soviets possess information on a number of German flying - wing type aircraft , such as the Gotha P60A , Junkers EF - 130 long - range jet bomber and the Horten 229 twin - jet fighter , which particularly resembles some of the descriptions of unidentified flying objects " .
This report was prepared by the US Air Force 's Directorate of Intelligence and the Office of Naval Intelligence and more than a year has passed since Twining 's letter .
How is it that these agencies believe that it is the Soviets who have the captured Horten flying wing (s ) or just information when , by this time , the US has had them for at least three years ?
What value would there be in pointing the finger at the Soviets and suggesting that they have aircraft far in advance of our own ?
Klass contends that the USAF Directorate of Intelligence and the Office of Naval Intelligence demonstrate no knowledge of a Roswell - related crashed object / disk because there was n't such an incident .
Yet , three years after the fact , these same offices demonstrate no knowledge of the US possession of the Horten flying wing (s ) .
Klass can't have it both ways - and neither can the rest of us .
If these offices were not aware of the US possession of the Horten flying wing (s ) then the so - called UFO cover - up exceeded their need - to - know and began before the Roswell incident .
If these offices were aware of the US possession of the Horten flying wing (s ) then why would they not acknowledge such [ in a Top Secret document that took 37 years to declassify ] ?
Roswell Saucer ?
Reports of an alien spacecraft being struck by lightning and crashing late at night in early July 1947 , near Roswell , New Mexico , were the beginnings of the most compelling event in all UFO lore .
Originally reported in the " Fort Worth Star - Telegram " and confirmed by military officials as authentic , the report was later refuted by the military and the crash remains were claimed to be nothing more than a weather balloon .
Renowned aviation artist Tony Weddel has depicted the moments before the crash by capturing the object as an alien spacecraft in the initial stages of its death throes .
In freefall , moments after being hit by a lightning upstroke , debris can already be seen in the slipstream .
Seconds later it would careen off the desert floor on the way to its final resting place .
Shedding debris from a fatal wound , its struggle for survival and the lives of seven aliens purportedly ended 40 miles later when it slammed into the wall of an arroyo .
The unusual appearance of the UFO is based on various eyewitness accounts and other sources

Nazis were close to building stealth bomber that could have changed course of history
Nazi engineers were dangerously close to building a stealth warplane shielded from radar that could have changed the outcome of World War II
The Telegraph
8 July 2009 A prototype of the Horten Ho 229 made a successful test flight just before Christmas 1944 , but by then time was running out for the Nazis and they were never able to perfect the design or produce more than a handful of prototype planes .
However , an engineering team has reconstructed the bomber –albeit one that cannot fly– from blueprints .
It was designed with a greater range and speed than any plane previously built and was the first aircraft to use the stealth technology now deployed by the US in its B - 2 bombers .
It has been recognised that Germany 's technological expertise during the war was years ahead of the Allies , from the Panzer tanks through to the V - 2 rocket .
But , by 1943 , the Nazis were keen to develop new weapons as they felt the war was turning against them .
Nazi bombers were suffering badly when faced with the speed and manoeuvrability of the Spitfire .
In 1943 Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring demanded that designers come up with a bomber that would meet his " 1,000 , 1,000 , 1,000 " requirements – one that could carry 1,000kg over 1,000 km flying at 1,000 km /h .
Two pilot brothers in their thirties , Reimar and Walter Horten , suggested a " flying wing " design which they were sure would meet Göring 's specifications .
The centre pod was made from a welded steel tube , and was designed to be powered by a BMW 003 engine .
But the most significant innovation was Reimar Horten 's idea to coat it in a mix of charcoal dust and wood glue which he believed would absorb the electromagnetic waves of radar .
They hoped that that , in conjunction with the aircraft 's sculpted surfaces , would render it almost invisible to radar detectors .
This was the same method eventually used by the U.S. in its first stealth aircraft in the early 1980s , the F - 117A ' Nighthawk ' .
Until now , experts had always doubted claims that the Horten could actually function as a stealth aircraft .
But , using the blueprints and the only remaining prototype craft , Northrop - Grumman defence firm built a fullsize replica of a Horten Ho 229 , which cost £ 154,000 and took 2,500 man-hours to construct .
The aircraft is not completely invisible to the type of radar used in the war , but it would have been stealthy enough and fast enough to reach London before Spitfires could be scrambled .
" If the Germans had had time to develop these aircraft , they could well have had an impact , " Peter Murton , aviation expert from the Imperial War Museum at Duxford , in Cambridgeshire told the " Daily Mail " .
" In theory the flying wing was a very efficient aircraft design which minimised drag .
" It is one of the reasons that it could reach very high speeds in dive and glide and had such an incredibly long range " .
The research was filmed for a documentary on the " National Geographic Channel " .
The National Geographic Channel describes it as one of the best - kept secrets of Adolf Hitler 's Third Reich
Toward the end of World War II , a mysterious , futuristic - looking aircraft was discovered by American troops in a top - secret German facility .
The prototype jet , which resembled a massive bat wing , and other advanced German aircraft were brought to the United States in the military project “ Operation Seahorse . ”
In the early 1960s , the prototype jet was transferred to a Smithsonian facility in Maryland that is off - limits to the public .
It remains there today .
“ There have been no documents released on it , and the public has no access to it , ” said Michael Jorgensen , a documentary filmmaker who secured National Geographic Channel backing to assemble a team of Northrop Grumman aeronautical engineers to study the craft and build a full - size replica from original plans .
The completed model , which has a 55 - foot wingspan , was quietly trucked to San Diego to join the San Diego Air & Space Museum 's permanent collection .
The big mystery : Was this a stealth aircraft created more than three decades before modern stealth technology debuted ?
Could the wedge - shaped jet — almost completely formed of wood — actually evade radar detection ?
If so , military analysts wonder if the outcome of the war might have been different had the Germans had time to deploy the technology .
The prototype craft was successfully tested by the Germans in late 1944 .
The reconstruction process was filmed over three months last fall by Jorgensen 's Flying Wing Films production company .
Film crews followed the model to Northrop Grumman 's restricted test site in the Mojave Desert in January , where the craft was mounted five stories high on a rotating pole .
Radar was aimed at it from every direction and aerial attacks were simulated .
" It was a chance to be involved in solving a mystery that has baffled aviation historians for a long time , " said Jim Hart , a spokesman for Northrop Grumman , which created the B - 2 stealth bomber .

「 ニセ科学 」 入 門
大阪大学サイバーメディアセンター
菊池誠
この論文は大阪大学大学院文学研究科文化形態論専攻広域文化形態論講座文化基礎学専門分野共同研究「科学と社会」(代表者 : 溝 口宏平 ) 報告書(平成16年2月発行)に掲載されたものです。基本的には大阪大学の全学共通教育科目として毎年開講しているオムニバス講義「科学と人間」の中で私が担当している「科学とニセ科学の間」の回のレジュメを拡大したものです。
マイナスイオンの項に追記しました。でも、まだよくわからない(2006/2/23 )
はじめに
論文にしてはケッタイなタイトルなの で、面食らっておられるかたも多かろう。現代市民社会の特に日常生活と科学とのか
かわりを考えるとき、私個人は「ニセ科学」の問題は極めて重要であると考えるのだ
が、恐らくはこの問題に注目していない研究者（自然科学者・科学論者・社会科学者
を問わず）がほとんどだろうし、それどころか問題の存在にすら気づいていないかた
がたも多いと思うので、それでなくてもケッタイな「ニセ科学」という言葉に敢えて
「入門」という言葉をつけさせていただいた。
１．ニセ科学とは
世間には奇怪な情報が飛び交っている。年末のテレビで「アポロは月に
行かなかった」という説をキッシンジャー等ニクソン政権時の政治家へのインタビュ
ーを通して実証するという外国の番組が紹介された。実はエイプリルフール用に作ら
れた冗談番組だったというのがオチなのだが、オチの部分を聞かずに信じてしまった
視聴者も少なからずいたらしい。「アポロは月に行かなかった」というのは陰謀論と
してポピュラーなもので、反証はいくつでも挙げられる。オチを聞かなくても冗談だ
とわかりそうなものだが、信じたいことだけを信じる人間は常識から目をそむけてし
まうものらしい。これはいわゆる” 陰謀論 ” である。広い意味では 「 ニセ科学」かも しれないが、本稿では対象としない。
一方、 「 ニセ科学 」という言葉で超 能力やオカルト、心霊現象、あるいは星占いのたぐいを思い起こす向きもあろう。こ
の中で超能力（テレパシーや予知、念力など）については「 超心理学」という学問分 野まで存在するので 「ニセ科学」と呼べるだろうが、オカルト・心霊などはそもそも
「科学的」な外観を持たないので、ニセ科学とは呼ばない。オカルト信者自身、オカ ルトを「科学」とは考えていないだろう。
つまり、ここでは 「 ニセ科学 」 という言葉 を ” 見かけは科学のようでも、実は科学ではないもの” に限定して使うこ とにする 。
「見かけ」という以上、誰から見てのものかが重要だが、ここでは科学の
専門家ではない人たちを念頭に置いている。普通程度の科学的知識を持つ「一般市
民」（こういう言葉がいいのか悪いのかはわからないが）には科学と区別がつかない
が、専門家から見れば荒唐無稽なものという程度の意味である。
そんなも のを論じる価値があるのか。それが大ありなのだ。端的にはルイセンコ事件を思い出 せばよい。そこには、ニセ科学が一国の社会・経済・政治を揺るがす大事件になった 例を見ることができる。イデオロギー的に都合がよいかどうかで学説の正否を決めて しまうなら、それはまさ に
「ニセ科学」である。残念ながらルイセンコ事件の教訓が
世間に行き渡っているとはいいがたく、日本でもルイセンコ事件の縮小再生産のよう
な事件は幾度となく起きている。市民運動の側でそれが起きた身近な例が『買っては
いけない』であろう（まだ終わっていないが）。
なお、同様の文脈ではむ しろ 「疑似科学」という言葉のほうが広く使われている。敢えてその言葉を避けて
「ニセ科学」と呼ぶのは、文脈によっては「疑似科学」という言葉が褒め言葉になる からである。具体的にはSF小説やファンタジー小説の批評などで” よくできた疑似科 学的説明 ” などという表現が使われる。「疑似」という言葉には価値判断が含まれな
いということであろう。「ニセ」という言葉は否定的な意味合いを強く含むので、こ
ちらを採用する。私自身、「疑似科学」と呼んでいた時期もあるのだが、上述の理由
で違和感がつきまとうため、最近は「ニセ」で統一している。この用法はマイクル・
シャーマーの著書の邦題に倣ったものである。「似非」「エセ」のほうをお好みのか たはそれでもかまわないだろう。「トンデモ」という言葉を使う例も見かけるが、特
にカタカナで書かれた「トンデモ」という言葉には「ニセ科学」とは少々違ったニュ
アンスがこめられており、ニュアンスを理解したうえでなければ使用をお勧めしな い。
本稿では最近の事例をいくつか取り上げて「ニセ科学」とはどういう
ものであるかを考えてゆく。具体的にはフリーエネルギー、マイナスイオン、波動、
ドーマン法などであるが、その前に練習問題として血液型性格判断を議論しておこう
２．練習問題：血液型性格判断
世界中で日本人ほど他人の血液型 を気にする国民はいないらしい。飲み屋で血液型と性格の関連を話題にするのは日本
人くらいだろう。血液型性格判断のニセ科学性については語り尽くされているといっ
ていいのだが、わかりやすい例なので、簡単にまとめておく。
血液型性格 判断の歴史は古く、１９２７年に古川竹二が出した学説まで遡る。もっとも古川学説
は現在の血液型隆盛とは基本的に関係ない。現在の血液型性格判断に直接つながるの
は１９７１年に出版された能見正比古の著書である。能見は学者ではなく、血液型に
関する学術論文を書いたわけでもなさそうだ。その代わり、能見と息子の俊賢は血液
型に関する多くの一般書を出版している。
さて、現在の位置づけを簡単に 述べよう。心理学の問題としては解決済みで、「血液型と性格が関連するという積極
的な証拠はない」ということでよいだろう。つまり、能見説にせよ古川説にせよ、間
違っていたわけである。では、古川学説は「ニセ科学」だったのか。いや、学説が出
された段階では「ニセ科学」ではなかったはずである。それどころか、「性格が遺伝
するなら、同様に遺伝する血液型と関係するのではないか」という推測は、むしろ目
のつけどころとしてはよかったといってもいいだろう。
問題は能見説以 降、特に心理学の問題としては 「 関係があるとは言えない 」という結論が出てしまっ
たあとの ” 民間信仰 ” 的ブームである。能見は独自にデータを収集した上で結論を出
しているので、科学的に研究しようとしたのだとは思う。しかし、実際には「科学 」
として通用するものではなかった。”血液型と性格は関連があるはずだ” という前提 で議論を続けるのはニセ科学である。
では、なぜ血液型性格判断は広く信 じられているのだろうか。以下に二つの要因を挙げておく。いずれも仮説である。
( 1)４分類という思い切った割り切り：２分類では恐らく誰も信じないし、１０分類
では多すぎておぼえる気になれない。おぼえやすいことは重要で、血液型性格判断が
学校から飲み屋まであらゆる状況で話題にされるのは、手許に参考文献がなくても議
論できるからである。４という数は適当にもっともらしく、しかも使いやすいものな のだろう。 ( 2)血液型は遺伝現象の典型と認識されており、メンデル型の遺伝法則に
従うことが一般常識として広く知れ渡っている。また、性格のかなりの部分が遺伝的
に決まっていると信じている人は多そうである。いかにも遺伝しそうな「性格」が、
もっともよく知られた遺伝現象である「血液型」と関連すると主張されれば、多くの
人がなるほどそれは「科学的」でもっともらしいと納得するのも不思議ではない。こ
の場合、信じる側はあくまでも「科学」として信じるわけである。
さて、 血液型性格判断も単なる遊びのうちはたいした問題ではないが、これが実害をもたら す可能性がある。たとえば、ある企業がインターネット上に公開している就職活動の ためのエントリーシートには、氏名・住所・電話番号・電子メール・性別に続いて
「 血液型」の記入が求められている。ほかの項目は出身大学や帰省先、職種の希望な
ど常識的なものばかりであるから、血液型の項目は目を引く。もちろん、なぜそれが
必要とされているのかはわからないが、採用上なんらかの参考にしているのではとい
う疑念はわく。また、以前、電機メーカーがAB型の社員だけを集めて新製品開発プロ
ジェクトチームを作ったという実例がある。特に成果は出なかったようだが。要する
に、血液型が就職や配属面で考慮されていると思われる事例があるのだ。これは無 論、差別である。
ところで、血液型に関して 「 心理学の調査では性格との 関連が見つからなくても、実は微かな関係がある可能性は否定できないのではない か」という質問をされることがある。それはもちろんその通りで、よくよく研究して みると弱い関係があるということになるかもしれない。研究する価値もあるだろう。 しかし、一般に言われる血液型性格判断はそのような微妙な関係ではなく、「あなた
は A型でしょう 」 とコンパの席で指摘できるほどにはっきりした関係を主張している
ことに注意するべきである。したがって、上の質問は血液型性格判断とはなんの関係 もない。
３．フリーエネルギー
フリーエネルギー装置とは無から エネルギーを生み出す装置、すなわち第１種永久機関（エネルギー保存則を破る機
関）である。もちろん、永久機関については昔から多くの提案があったのだが、ここ
では今現在も開発が続けられているNマシンやエーテル・エンジンといった装置を問
題にする。ちなみに、日本では第１種・第２種を問わず、永久機関に対して特許はお
りない。自然法則、具体的には熱力学法則に反するからである。
しかし、 フリーエネルギー開発者はエネルギー保存則を承知の上で、それを回避できる論理を 構築しようとしている。つまり、ここでもフリーエネルギーは反科学でもオカルトで もなく、あくまで も
「科学」らしい体裁をもったものとして提案されているのである （ただし、「ニューサイエンス」との接点もあり、「科学らしさ」の意味も微妙では
あるが）。ここではふたつの論法を紹介しよう。
( 1 ) 「エネルギー保存則は証明され ていないので、反してもよい」この言説の前半はある意味で正しい。たしかにエネル
ギー保存則は「数学的」に証明されたものではない。しかし、物理法則とはそもそも
そういうものである。エネルギー保存則は経験の集積であって、膨大な傍証に裏付け
られている。仮にこの法則が破れるなら、その影響は科学のあらゆる分野におよぶ。
( 2) 「未知のエネルギー源があるのであって、それも含めてエネルギー保存則は成立
している」これは巧妙な論理で、実際、まじめな研究としても新しいエネルギ源ーが
話題になることがある。ただし、それが「エネルギー」であるためには、かなり厳し
い条件を満足しなくてはならない。その条件がクリアできることが示されれば、物理
学者も新エネルギーを認めるはずである。残念ながら、フリーエネルギー装置がそれ
をクリアしたことはない。
問題はなぜフリー・エネルギーを研究するのか
である。どうやら、フリー・エネルギー研究者の多くは、装置ができればエネルギー
問題が解決すると思い込んでいる善意の研究者のようだ。しかし、「フリー・エネル
ギーがあれば、どんどんエネルギーを使っても大丈夫」と考えるのは基本的に誤って
いる。エネルギー問題と環境問題は分かちがたく結びついており、エネルギー消費が
増えればそれだけ環境負荷は増す。もっとも、この問題は他の原子力発電や核融合な
どでも同じことだが。そういう意味では、エネルギーさえ作ればエネルギー問題は解
決するという考え方自体が「ニセ科学」の要素を持っていることは頭にいれておくべ きである。
もちろんフリー・エネルギー研究者がいるというだけであれ
ば、笑って済ませてもかまわない。ところが、これを政権与党である公明党の国会議
員団が視察に行った（公明党の広報資料に出ている）とか、市民派を謳う雑誌である
『週刊金曜日』の連載小説で肯定的に取り上げられているなどという事例を前にする
と、必ずしも笑って済ませているわけにはいかないのかもしれないという気がしてく る。
４．マイナスイオンの教訓
マイナスイオンはニセ科学である にもかかわらず、どういうわけか大手家電メーカーがこぞって参入して一大ブームと
なった。現在は終息に向かいつつあるようだが、ニセ科学に参入した家電メーカー は ” 大手” なりの責任をきちんととる気があるのだろうか。
なぜニセ科学 なのかからはじめよう。マイナスイオン発生装置と呼ばれるものは大きく三種類にわ けられる 。( 1) 水を細かく粉砕して噴霧するもの( 2) 放電によるもの( 3 ) トルマリンを 用いたもの。方法が違えば生成されるものも違う。実際、「 マイナスイオン」と称さ れるものは(1) では帯電した細かな水滴(2)では空気中の何かが帯電したもの( 3)は何
も出ない、ということになる。これらをまとめて「
マイナスイオン」と称してもしょ
うがないことは明らかだし、もちろん、それらすべてが身体にいいなどということは

マイナスイオンが身体にいいとされる根拠は『医学領域 空気イオンの理 論と実際』（木村・谷口）という文献に求められる。ところが、これがなんと第二次

ろめたいところがあるのに違いない。
さて、マイナスイオンブームは堀口 昇・山野井昇・菅原明子という三人の ” 権威者 ” によって牽引されてきた。この三人 が揃いも揃って普通の意味での研究者ではなかったこともこのブームの面白いところ である。たとえば、テレビなどで東京大学医学研究科所属・工学博士と紹介される一 人は、たしかに東大所属だが東大の研究者総覧には記載されていない。テレビ局は本 当の身分を知った上でやっているはずなので、マスコミも共犯という事例である。
結局、マイナスイオンはニセ科学の中でも悪質な部類に属する確信犯的な
ものだったわけである。まきこまれた大手家電メーカー（特に掃除機の吸い込み口に
トルマリンを練りこんだ某メーカーなど）の開発者には同情を禁じえない。
しかし、ここでは ” なぜ一般に受け入れられたか ” に注目したい。もちろ ん、マスコミが大きくとりあげたことは大きいが、それだけではなさそうだ。ひとつ にはイオンという 言葉から受ける 「科学っぽい」印象である。おそらく、マイナスイ

追 記( 2006/2/23 ) : マイナスイオンの歴史については未だによくわからないのだが、欧米(米のみ?)ではかつてコロナ放電式のイオン発生器が流行ったらしい。コロナ放電で発生するのは大気イオン(空気イオン)で、コロナ放電に限れば、日本でいうマイナスイオンは negative air ion に相当する。negative air ionが動物の行動に影響するという論文は、それなりの数見つけることができるのだが、マイナスイオン商品を正当化できるほどのものは見あたらない。しかし、上に書いた「現代では省みられることのない」は言い過ぎで、ときどき省みられてはいるようだ。文献リストに挙げてある『ハインズ博士「超科学」をきる』に取り上げられているイオン製造器もコロナ放電と思われる。ハインズ博士の見解をまとめると、空気イオンはたしかに人間の行動に影響するようだが、その効果は微妙で、イオン製造器を買うだけの価値はないということ。この状況はマイナスイオンブームを経た今でもたいして変わらないと思われる。堀口昇が書いた「マイナスイオンの医療応用」という解説文献があるのだが、引用文献中で生理作用に関する英語文献はひとつだけしかないようだ。なお、天羽さんの「水商売ウォッチング」に文献がいろいろ掲載されている。では、これは「ニセ科学」ではなく「未科学」なのかということになるのだが、残念ながらそうはいかない。効果がはっきりしないものをあたかも効果についての科学的な証明があるかのようにいうのはやはり「ニセ科学」である。「よく調べれば、マイナスイオンの効果が明らかになるのではないか」という反論を受けることがあるのだが、それは本末転倒で、「よく調べてマイナスイオンの効果が明らかになったから、商品化する」でなくてはならないことは誰が考えても当然の話。ところで、水破砕式のルーツはやっぱりわからない
５．波動
ニセ科学の世界に 「 波動 」 という言葉が現れて久しい。「波動」と聞くといかにも物理学の専門用語のように思
えるが、実はここでいう「波動」は物理学的な概念ではない。では、「波動」とはな
にか。おそらくもっとも正確な答は”波動測定器で測られるもの”である。
波動測定器は、一見非常に複雑で精巧な装置らしい外観を持っている。こ
れで何をどのように測るのか。まず測定したい対象（健康器具のようなものや食品で あることが多い）を用意し、測定したい項目を入力する。項目は主として身体に関す るもので、たとえば腎臓や肝臓などの臓器名やさまざまな病名、あるいは” 免疫 ” な どである。すると波動測定器は 「 この食品の波動は腎臓について+21」などと結果を
一個の数値として出力する。数値の流儀はいろいろあるが、代表的な装置では数値は
-21から+21までの整数で、-21が最低、+21が最高というものである。つまり、上に挙
げた例では問題の食品は腎臓に対して最高の効果を持つと判定されたことになる。
波動測定器の仕組みはほぼ解明されていて、どうやら測定者自身の電気抵
抗を測っているらしい。要するに、嘘発見器である。実際、熟練した測定者でないと
正しい数値が出ないと言われており、測定対象の性質を客観的に表わすものでないこ とは明らかである。
この 「波動測定器」というアイデアの秀逸さは特筆に
値する。たとえば、普通の検査機関に食品の成分分析を依頼したとしよう。結果は、
1g中に何が何mg、何が何mgというデータが延々と並んだものになるだろう。それでは
わかりにくいので、”結局、身体にいいのか悪いのか”と質問したとしても、明らか
に毒性の物質が含まれるのでもない限りは、曖昧な答しか返ってこないだろう。”身
体にいいか悪いか ” はひと言で答えられるようなものではないからだ。
と ころが、波動測定器は違う。+21なら最高、-21なら最低なのである。+10程度なら
「 そこそこにいいのだな」と判断されるのだろう。自前の検査機関を持たない中小企
業にとっては福音と言ってよい。「波動測定器の数値が+21だったので、この食品は
＊＊によいことが示されました」などと言えるからである。実際、波動測定器の測定
結果を添付した商品を数多く見かける。
どうやら、数値があることによっ て、見る者に科学的で客観的という印象を与えているようである。波動という言葉の
「科学っぽさ」もさることながら、数値で表わすというアイデアによって、科学らし
さがより強調され、一般の人にも受け入れやすくなったのだろう。もちろん、科学者
の目から見れば、複雑な問題に対して単位のない数値を一個だけ出力する測定器など
奇怪な代物としか言えないのだが。
こ の「波動」ブームを牽引する江本勝 もまた科学者ではない。実は波動には「サトルエネルギー学会」という専門学会が存
在する。しかし、これは波動が存在することを前提とした学会なので、波動そのもの
に対する批判能力はまったく期待できない。ニセ科学学会というわけだ。
しかし、笑ってばかりもいられない。江本の著書「水からの伝言」に端を発したある
ブームが深刻な問題を引き起こしているからである。「水からの伝言」は江本らが独
自の手法で作った水の結晶の写真を集めたもので、本を開くと美しい結晶の写真が次
々と目にはいってくる。ところが、美しいだけならいいのだが、ここには驚くべき話
が書かれている。たとえば、水に「ありがとう」という言葉を見せたのち（水をいれ
たビンに文字を印刷した紙を貼って、文字通り” 見せる ” ）、その水で結晶を作ると 水はきれいな結晶を作り、一方、
「死ね」などの言葉を見せた水はきれいな結晶を作
らないというのである。もちろん「平和」は美しい結晶を作り、「戦争」は作らない など、言葉と結晶のあいだには一定の（実にわかりやすい）関係がある。
この話などはもはや科学を装ってすらいないと思うし、ちょっとでも常識があれば笑
い飛ばす程度の話だったはずである。その意味では、これまでに述べてきた「ニセ科
学」よりもオカルトに近い。ところが、これが” 実験結果” として本に掲載されてい るというだけで科学的事実と思い込む人たちもいるのである。しかも、仰天すること に、これを小学校の道徳の教材として使っている先生たちが少なからずいる。「言葉 は水の性質を変える。人間の身体は多くの水分を含むのだから、言葉は人間の身体に も影響する。美しい言葉を使いましょう」というわけだ。
この授業 がＴＯ ＳＳ（教育技術法則化運動）と呼ばれる運動に参加する小学校の先生のあいだで広ま
っている。事実、私の友人の娘さんは授業参観の機会にこの授業を受けたらしい。
これは憂慮すべき事態である。問題点は大きくふたつ挙げられる。まず、
明白に非科学的であるものを「事実」であるかのように教えていること。小学校も高
学年ともなれば、中には批判力のある子どももいるはずで、生徒が「そんなことはあ
りえない」と発言したらどうするつもりなのだろうか。また、水の結晶と道徳の関連
性がまったく示されないまま、アドホックに”きれいな結晶ができるのはよいこと ”
として教えてしまうというのは思考停止であろう。特に” 道徳” としては問題が大き い。
ニセ科学がこのような形で 「 理科」ではなく「 道徳 」 や「 総合的学 習 の時間」に侵入しつつあることは我々もよく認識しておくべきである。
６．ド ーマン法と 「 奇跡の詩人 」
最後の実例として 、NHK テレビで放映されて 大論争になった 「奇跡の詩人」問題をとりあげよう。新生児期に脳障害となり、事実

そのための具体的な手法としては、 ” 正常 な ” 動作を無理やり行なわせることによって正しい” パターン” を学習させる「パタ

を無理やりに動作させるということが行なわれる。
理論があると書いた が、むろんこの理論は学問的には全く認められていない。それどころか、アメリカで はいくつかの学会が否定的声明を出している。また、当然のことだがFascilitated communication では介助者の意図が反映することが明らかになっている。さらにパタ ーニングのやりかたから推測できるように、ドーマン法は親だけではできず、何人も のボランティアを必要とする。事実、インターネットで検索すると、ドーマン法のた めにボランティアを募集しているという記述をいくつも見つけることができる。
少なくとも知的障害のリハビリ法としては明らかにニセ科学である。ドー

７．間違った科学とニセ科学
ニセ科学を敢えて分類する と、大きく(1)最初からニセ科学だったもの(2)初めは科学だったがニセ科学に変質し
たもの、の二つになるだろう。これまでに見てきた最近の事例はほとんどが( 1 )に属
するものだった。血液型の古川説あたりが辛うじて(2)だろう。どうも日常生活に近
いところで見られるニセ科学には(1)が多そうである。(2)も含めて議論するために、
ここでニセ科学と「間違った科学」の違いを考えてみよう。
科学の発展は 仮説と実証の積み重ねであるから、もちろん中には「 間違った仮説」もあれば「正し
くなかった実験」も膨大にあったし、現在も膨大に生産されている。しかし、それら は決して「ニセ科学」ではない。単に間違っただけである。
常温核融合は 少々微妙だが、それでも最初に発表した２グループのうち、ジョーンズのグループの
ものは普通の意味での「科学」だった。実際、常温核融合騒動が終わったのちも、ジ
ョーンズは特に批判されていない。常温核融合は一時多くの科学者の興味をひいた
し、実際に追試を試みた学者も多かった。問題は、そういった追試がことごとく失敗
したあとの対応である。常温核融合が否定されてからも、「あるはずだ」という思い
込みで研究を続行したひと握りの学者はやはりニセ科学にはまったと言うべきだろ
う。普通の科学がニセ科学に変質したのである。
ただし、常温核融合関連 の研究を続けていれば即ニセ科学だというわけでもない。科学であるかないかは結局
は科学者側の態度や姿勢によるのであって、同じテーマが科学にもニセ科学にもなり うるからである。
歴史的に有名な 「 間違った科学」の例としてはポリウォ
ーターが挙げられる。この時には、関係した科学者たちが最終的にポリウォーター仮
説が誤りであることに合意して終結した。つまり、常温核融合とは違い、研究者たち
は科学から足を踏み外すことなかった。間違いでは合ったが、科学として正しく終わ ったわけである。
当然、科学とニセ科学のあいだには広大なグレイゾーン
があり、科学ともニセ科学ともつかないケースはいくつでも見つけることができる。
それはそれでしょうがない。グレーゾーンがあるからといって科学とニセ科学は区別
できないとなどと考えるのは短絡思考である。世の中にはグレーゾーンから遠くはな
れて、誰がどう見てもニセ科学だというものがあふれている。つまり、ニセ科学はニ セ科学である。
８．ニセ科学はなぜ受け入れられる
いくつかの実 例を議論した中で 、 「 ニセ科学 」 は” 科学に見え る ” ということを強調した。いや、 それどころか、実は本物の科学よりも科学らしく見えてしまい、だからこそ受け入れ られているのではないだろうか。つまり、ニセ科学の信奉者は決して科学が嫌いなわ けではなく、本物の科学よりもニセ科学のほうを 「 より科学的」と感じているのでは ないだろうか 。
その理由となるのが、科学の実像とパブリックイメージと
のギャップである。推測だが、科学に対しては「さまざまな問題に対して、曖昧さな
く白黒はっきりつけるもの」というイメージを抱いている人が多そうである。もちろ
ん、現実にはそうではない。科学は本来曖昧なものである。科学者に質問したとして
も、いろいろな留保条件をつけたりいくつもの言い訳をした上で、しかも往々にして
歯切れ悪く曖昧な結論しか出せない。科学者の態度としてはこれが普通なのだが、パ
ブリックイメージからすればこれはあまり科学らしくない。
一方、ニセ科 学はどうか。プラスは悪く、マイナスはよいだとか、A型は几帳面だとか、+21は腎臓 に最高だとか、とにかく小気味よくものごとに白黒をつけてくれる。この思い切りの
よさは、決して本当の科学には期待できないものであるが、しかしそれこそが科学に
期待されるものなのに違いない。 「 科学らしさ」に加えて、ニセ科学が受け入れら
れるもうひとつの理由として、「願望充足」を挙げておく。ニセ科学は、信じたいと
願っていることを提示してくれる。一部の人にとっては「信じたい」と「信じる」が
ほぼイコールなのだろう。それは一種のニューエイジ思想だが、そこから市民運動と
ニセ科学の結びつきが生じる。市民運動家には、原発の悪い点、大企業の悪い点、大
規模開発の悪い点、そういうものを提示してくれる説は信じて、そうでない説は信じ
ないという傾向がどうしても見られるのだが、イデオロギーに合う説だけを受け入れ
るなら冒頭にも書いたようにルイセンコ事件の縮小再生産版みたいなものである。
９．科学者の役割
ニセ科学は決して 「 科学離れ 」 や「 反科学 」 の 結果として信じられているのではなく、むしろ「科学的」だからこそ信じられている
のではないかというのが、本稿全体を通じての仮説だった。ニセ科学のほうが科学よ
りも科学らしく見えるとしたら問題である。いくつかの実例で述べたように、ある種
のニセ科学は笑って済ませられない問題を抱えている。それに対しては科学者からの
批判が重要である。しかし、ニセ科学を批判しても「業績」にならないという現状が
あり、発言する科学者はあまり多くない。業績にならないとしても、長い目で見ると
ニセ科学を放置することは自分の首を絞めることにつながるはずである。科学者はも
っと「ニセ科学」について勉強するべきだろう。
