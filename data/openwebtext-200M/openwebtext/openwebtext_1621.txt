On a high plateau where burros and jackrabbits wander an hour ’s drive southwest of Las Vegas , a 400 - foot - deep chasm hewn from volcanic rock sits at the center of an international policy debate .
The chasm , in Mountain Pass , Calif. , used to be the world ’s main mine for rare earth elements — minerals crucial to military hardware and the latest wind turbines and hybrid gasoline - electric cars .
Molycorp Minerals , which owns the mine , announced on Monday that it had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering to help raise the nearly $ 500 million needed to reopen and expand the mine .
Molycorp is making a big bet that its mine — once the world leader in production of rare earth elements , but now a rusting relic — can be made competitive again .
Global demand is surging for the minerals .
And customers , particularly the American military , are seeking alternatives to China , which now mines 97 percent of the world ’s rare earth elements .
As part of reopening the mine , Molycorp plans to increase its capacity to mine and refine neodymium for rare earth magnets , which are extremely lightweight and are used in many high - tech applications .
It will also resume bulk production of lower - value rare earth elements like cerium , used in industrial processes like polishing glass and water filtration .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks plunged 9 percent in the last two hours of trading on Thursday before clawing back some of the losses as a suspected trading glitch and fears of a new credit crunch in Europe threw markets into disarray .

The Dow suffered its biggest ever intraday point drop -- 998.5 points .
The market ’s fall may have been exacerbated by an erroneous trades that showed some shares briefly fell to nearly zero .
The situation remained unclear long after the closing bell as the Nasdaq Stock Market and others said they would cancel multiple erroneous trades .
Other exchanges scrambled to examine orders .
“ We did not know what a stock was worth today , and that is a serious problem , ” Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading in New Jersey told Reuters Insider .
Indexes recovered some of their losses heading into the close to end down about 3 percent , the biggest fall since April 2009 .
Equities erased much of their gains for the year .
The sell - off comes at a tense time for investors and Wall Street , with fraud charges against Goldman Sachs , fears of a wave of debt defaults in Europe and increasing clamor for financial regulation .
Volume soared to twice its daily average for this year and was at its highest since October 2008 when financial markets seized up after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
Some traders around the world were shaken from their beds and told to start trading amid the plunge as investors sought to stem losses in the rapid sell - off .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 347.80 points , or 3.20 percent , to 10,520.32 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index fell 37.75 points , or 3.24 percent , to 1,128.15 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 82.65 points , or 3.44 percent , to 2,319.64 .
At 2:47 p.m. the selling peaked and indexes plummeted across the board with several falling to nearly zero .
They included Boston Beer , Radian Group , Exelon Corp. and Centerpoint .
The CBOE Volatility Index , known as Wall Street ’s fear gauge , closed up more than 30 percent at its highest level since May 2009 .
The sell - off was broad and deep with all 10 of the S&P 500 sectors falling from 2 percent to 4 percent .
The financial sector index was the worst hit , tumbling 4.1 percent .
Selling hit major stocks including Bank of America , the biggest percentage loser on the Dow with a 7.1 percent drop to $ 16.28 .
All 30 components of the Dow closed lower .
Nasdaq and NYSE ’s ARCA trading unit said they will cancel trades executed between 2:40 p.m. and 3 p.m. where a stock price rose or fell more than 60 percent from the last trade in that security at 2:40 p.m .
Investors had been on edge throughout the trading day after the European Central Bank did not discuss the outright purchase of European sovereign debt as some had hoped they would to calm markets .
The ECB gave verbal support to Greece ’s savings plan instead , disappointing some investors .
With markets seriously shaken and still fearful of Europe ’s mounting debt crisis , thoughts turned to Friday ’s release of U.S. non-farm payrolls for April by the Labor Department .
The report is one the most important on the economic calendar as investors try to judge the strength of the U.S. recovery .

Rick Campagna , portfolio manager at 300 North Capital LLC in Pasadena , said stocks may bounce off their lows but said the lift would likely be short - lived .
“ You ’ll probably see some sort of bounce .
I do n’t think it ’s going to be long lasting or all that strong , but that ’s probably what you ’ll see , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think the correction is over . ”
S&P 500 index futures were volatile and pointed to a nearly 1 percent drop at the open on Friday , falling 8.3 points three hours after the close .

Image caption Jordan Romero said it was the hardest climb he had ever undertaken
The youngest person to climb Mount Everest says he hopes his achievement will inspire young people around the world to get out and exercise .
American teenager Jordan Romero , 13 , has just returned from the north side of the mountain .
He said he hoped other children would follow his example .
The teenager successfully made it to the top of the mountain on Saturday , accompanied by his father , stepmother and three Sherpa guides .
Looking sunburnt but healthy , Jordan Romero said it was a feeling like no other to stand on the summit of Mount Everest .
He said it was the hardest climb he had ever undertaken .
' An inspiration '
His team had faced winds of over 100 km as they made their final 14 - hour push from camp two on the north side of the mountain to the summit .
Age really does n't matter .
If I could do it at 13 then anybody else could Jordan Romero , Youngest Everest climber
Jordan said he decided to conquer Mount Everest after seeing a mural of the world 's seven highest summits in his school hallway .
Although he has been criticised for being too young to cope with the high altitude , Jordan said he hoped his climb would be an inspiration to young people around the world .
" Age really does n't matter .
If I could do it at 13 then anybody else could , you know , as long as other people just put their hard work and effort into it … and other kids my age , I 'm doing this to set an example for them . "
Jordan 's father Paul Romero also rebutted criticism that he had forced his son into climbing the mountain , saying that he had merely enabled him to accomplish his dream .
He said his team had spent over a year preparing for the climb and researching every scenario .
Mr Romero said when he was close to the summit of Mount Everest he began to cry when he realised his son was going to make it .
JORDAN'S SUMMITS Africa - Kilimanjaro : 2006
Europe - Elbrus : 2007
South America - Aconcagua : 2007
North America - Denali : 2008
Oceania - Carstensz Pyramid : 2009
Everest - Asia : 2010
He said he hoped Jordan 's achievement would encourage other parents to exercise with their children .
" We live a life in the US where childhood obesity is at epidemic level .
It 's from people who are patting their kids and sticking the remote control in their hands and completely overfeeding them .
" Now I 'm not saying everyone should take their kids to Mount Everest , that 's for sure , but I think kids should be enabled to pursue giant goals . "
Jordan said he now planned to spend the summer climbing the highest peaks in 50 American states .
He then intends to return to Nepal to climb the mountain Cho Oyu , before skiing back down it .
Animated Engines
Wankel Engine
The Wankel rotary engine is a fascinating beast that features a very clever rearrangement of the four elements of the Otto cycle .
It was developed by Felix Wankel in the 1950s .
1
In the Wankel , a triangular rotor incorporating a central ring gear is driven around a fixed pinion within an oblong chamber .
Intake
The fuel / air mixture is drawn in the intake port during this phase of the rotation .
Compression
The mixture is compressed here .
Power
The mixture burns here , driving the rotor around .
Exhaust
And the exhaust is expelled here .
The rotary motion is transferred to the drive shaft by an eccentric wheel ( illustrated in blue ) that rides in a matching bearing in the rotor .
The drive shaft rotates once during every power stroke instead of twice as in the Otto cycle .
The Wankel promised higher power output with fewer moving parts than the Otto cycle engine ; however , technical difficulties interfered with widespread adoption .
In spite of valiant efforts by Mazda , the four stroke engine remains much more popular .
When Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed the controversial immigration law last week , for some it conjured images of “ Nazism ” and the Jim Crow South .
I believe the more apt image of this law can be found in rapper MIA ’s new video , “ Born Free ” ( warning : nudity , graphic violence , NSFW ) .
In an uncanny coincidence , the video , directed by filmmaker Romain Gavaras , depicts redheaded men — “ gingers ” — being rounded up in an ICE - style sting in Los Angeles , transported out into the desert by bus , and forced to run for their lives .
The intent was to show the brutality of the American occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan , though it ’s being read by some as a prescient trope about the perils of Arizona ’s new immigration law whose opponents claim that its vagueness will result in racial profiling .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt about that , ” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told David Gregory on Meet the Press Sunday morning .
How religious groups will ( or will not ) organize for or against the Arizona law remains to be seen , but if the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference ( NHCLC ) , Rev. Samuel Rodriguez , and others are any indication , this could spoil the nascent coalition between the Republican Party and the Tea Party Movement or throw a wrench into the religious right ’s outreach to ethnic communities .
The confluence of race , religion , and nation — familiar territory for Americans — may divide religious groups into irreparable factions and provide another fracture in the GOP ’s strategy for the 2010 and 2012 elections .
It ’s ironic , then , that state officials in Arizona have not learned from their own recent history that unjust immigration laws tend to mobilize individuals and religious groups .
The Sanctuary movement , started in Arizona in the early 1980s by Jim Fife and John Corbett , sought to help political refugees from Central America who were fleeing human and civil rights violations .
Churches and synagogues engaged in civil disobedience by providing shelter as well as financial and social assistance to the refugees .
Based on principles of liberation theology , the movement provided a place for “ illegal ” immigrants to be housed while re-starting their lives in the United States .
The federal government ( which had at first left the movement alone ) began to infiltrate churches , taping meetings and arresting participants .
In several cases the government was able to prosecute and imprison members of the Sanctuary movement , though they continued to have success helping immigrants well into the 1990s .
In 2006 , Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles refused to abide by a proposed bill to criminalize assistance without first checking the immigration status of an individual .
Out of that refusal the New Sanctuary Movement was founded “ to respond to the needs of immigrant workers and their families and to support coalitions working on comprehensive immigration reform . ”
The NSM now has several active chapters across the United States — including Arizona .
When the movement first formed back in the 1980s the situation was different .
The political landscape and religious fault lines have changed , but most notable is the unlikely coalition - building taking place both for immigration reform and against it .
While some assume that most conservative Christians support tougher immigration laws , figures like the aforementioned Rev. Samuel Rodriguez , an Assemblies of God minister , have been vocal proponents of more humane immigration reform .
Rodriguez , courted by many as a power broker for Latino voters , does not possess the traditional religious right profile .
His partnership with the National Association of Evangelicals , Jim Wallis , and others will form a formidable juggernaut against supporters of the immigration law who claim “ Christian principles . ”
In the ranks of the United States Catholic Church , immigration proponents like Cardinal Roger Mahony will find themselves pitted against conservatives ; though the high - profile sexual abuse scandal may also make it a less formidable adversary to the movement for immigration reform .
The only Hispanic to vote for SB 1070 is Arizona State Representative Rev. Steve B. Montenegro , a minster in the Apostolic Assembly church — a Oneness Pentecostal denomination with a large Mexican and Mexican - American population .
Montenegro , an El Salvadorian immigrant , fled to America with his parents and was granted religious asylum status enabling him to become a citizen .
His parents were assisted in that process by obtaining papers from Apostolic Assembly .
Ironically , Montenegro ’s position as a right - wing Republican and ardent Tea Party supporter places him in the hypocritical position of shutting the doors to many Apostolic Assembly members who have supported him in the ministry , yet are in the country without “ proper documentation . ”
His pro-SB 1070 vote has aroused considerable ire in Hispanic circles .
It remains to be seen how Hispanic leaders like Rodriguez will deal with him , but I suspect it will not be pleasant .
Is there something in the air in Arizona that breeds racial division ?
Given the current situation and the notable struggle to establish Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday ( enshrined in the Public Enemy song “ By the Time I get to Arizona ” ) , it ’s no wonder that the current immigration law is being called the “ Hispanic Civil Rights Movement . ”
As Antonio Gonzalez head of the Southwest Voter ’s Education Project stated , drawing parallels to the black civil rights protests of the 1960s : “ For Hispanics , Arizona is Alabama and Maricopa County is Selma . ”
And much like the civil rights movement , Arizona ’s draconian immigration law promises to divide religious groups into factions that wo n’t easily be repaired .
The violence portrayed in MIA ’s “ Born Free ” and Public Enemy ’s “ By the Time I get to Arizona ” is n’t likely to break out anytime soon , but the tensions they depict are present in the fight for the recognition of undocumented immigrants — the vast majority of whom are honest people trying to make a better life for their families .

As each player went through the 100 allotted clicks , he could switch rooms to search for higher payoffs , but each switch used up a click to open the new door .
The best strategy was to quickly check out the three rooms and settle in the one with the highest rewards .
Even after students got the hang of the game by practicing it , they were flummoxed when a new visual feature was introduced .
If they stayed out of any room , its door would start shrinking and eventually disappear .
They should have ignored those disappearing doors , but the students could n’t .
They wasted so many clicks rushing back to reopen doors that their earnings dropped 15 percent .
Even when the penalties for switching grew stiffer  besides losing a click , the players had to pay a cash fee  the students kept losing money by frantically keeping all their doors open .
Why were they so attached to those doors ?
The players , like the parents of that overscheduled piano student , would probably say they were just trying to keep future options open .
But that ’s not the real reason , according to Dr. Ariely and his collaborator in the experiments , Jiwoong Shin , an economist who is now at Yale .
They plumbed the players ’ motivations by introducing yet another twist .
This time , even if a door vanished from the screen , players could make it reappear whenever they wanted .
But even when they knew it would not cost anything to make the door reappear , they still kept frantically trying to prevent doors from vanishing .
Apparently they did not care so much about maintaining flexibility in the future .
What really motivated them was the desire to avoid the immediate pain of watching a door close .
“ Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss , and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss , ” Dr. Ariely says .
In the experiment , the price was easy to measure in lost cash .
In life , the costs are less obvious  wasted time , missed opportunities .
If you are afraid to drop any project at the office , you pay for it at home .
Tribespeople in parts of West Bengal support the rebels
Friday 's train crash in India has been blamed on " sabotage " by Maoist rebels .
It was the latest in a series of rebel attacks after the government launched an offensive against them .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas asks whether the rebels are gaining the upper hand .
It is not surprising that Maoist rebels are being blamed for the derailment of an express train in India 's West Bengal state , in which 148 passengers were killed .
The police claim they have found posters signed by a local Maoist militia claiming responsibility for removing part of the track , which led to the train skidding off and colliding with a freight train coming in the opposite direction .
West Midnapore district , where the incident happened , is the hotbed of Maoist rebellion in West Bengal , one of the states where the rebels have a presence .
Tribespeople dominate the district , especially the forested Junglemahal region bordering Jharkhand state .
They feel ignored and deprived by the Communist government which has been ruling the state since 1977 .
Most live in abject poverty .
The only visible signs of " development " I spotted during a trip to the area some years ago were cheap liquor shops .
Strong support
Fed up with the state of affairs , Junglemahal 's tribespeople even agitated for a separate state .
When neighbouring Jharkhand was carved out as a separate state , their alienation grew and they were quick to welcome the Maoists , who wield most influence in areas which are poor and dominated by tribespeople .
The security forces are on the backfoot after a spree of rebel attacks The Lalgarh area in Junglemahal is the rebels ' most formidable stronghold .
In February , they stormed a police camp in Lalgarh , killing 24 policemen .
Rebels love to describe Lalgarh as a " liberated zone " where the state has withered away - schools and medical centres have closed down because teachers and doctors are afraid to attend , and policemen are confined to the police stations fearing reprisals .
Friday 's incident in West Midnapore demonstrates how the rebels are taking the battle to their enemies ever since the federal government launched an offensive in what is known as India 's " red corridor " earlier this year .
This comprises 223 of India 's 636 districts in 20 states which the government says are " Maoist affected " , up from 55 districts in nine states six years ago .
Ninety of these affected districts , the government says , are experiencing " consistent violence . "
The rebels have been carrying out attacks with impunity in recent months - two major attacks Dantewada in Chhattisgarh state left more than 100 people dead , including 75 paramilitary troops .
But there are also theories that in this case the Maoist script went slightly awry .
Maoists frequently tamper with railway lines and often these lead to minor derailments ; a number of such attempts have been caught well in time .
There have been hijackings but no major attacks on civilian transport with such a death toll .
In the past year , Maoists have carried out 32 attacks on railways , mainly in Jharkhand , West Bengal , Orissa , Chhattisgarh - but no major casualties have been reported .
Support for the Maoist cause across India generally will be dented by such an attack , just as it was after the assault on troops in Dantewada .
Following the twin Dantewada attacks , the government said it was reviewing its strategy for fighting the rebels , who have refused to respond to repeated government offers for talks .
Analysts say that the strategy of " clearing , holding and developing " rebel - affected areas evidently inspired by the US strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan is not working .
' Visible retreat '
One reason , they say , is that the surge of security forces and resources on the ground are not sufficient enough to take on the rebels who are spread over a vast swathe of remote mineral - rich forest lands .
Maoists call Lalgarh a " liberated zone "
The government is now in a " visible retreat " after a spree of rebel attacks , says security analyst Ajai Sahni .
He believes that a lack of adequate forces , training and intelligence is leading to these " disasters " .
" Unless local capacities for intelligence and operations are enormously augmented , this [ offensive ] can go nowhere , and lot of lives are going to be lost for no useful purpose , " Mr Sahni says .
But the under - equipped local police and intelligence - gathering networks remain Indian security ' s weakest link , and there no visible efforts to bolster them .
The government appears to be confused over how the rebels should be tackled - there are differences in the ruling Congress party itself on whether the state should strike hard against it 's own people .
Recently federal home minister P Chidambaram requested wider powers to deal with the rebels , saying that he had been given a " limited mandate . "
He said the chief ministers of some of the worst affected states have asked for air power to be used against the rebels - a measure that the government has refused to sanction .
Analysts believe that many states are not doing enough to take on the rebels , leading to a " centralisation " of the problem .
The train ' " sabotage " was one of the biggest attacks launched by the rebels " The principal responsibility for dealing with the Maoists remain that of the states ; the first responders , the local police stations , have to be strengthened and equipped to deal with the task on their own , " says Ajai Sahni .
Till that happens , the rebels will be seen to have an upper hand in what promises to be long drawn out and bloody conflict , the like of which India has never seen .

Although the question of what makes humans different from other animals does n't have a single obvious answer , one seemingly conspicuous human trait is morality .
Darwin , in his book The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex , published in 1871 , singled out " the moral sense or conscience " as by far the most important difference between humans and other animals .
Darwins argument was , of course , strongly based on the concepts of biological evolution and natural selection .
Now , upon further investigating the origins of morality , Francisco Ayala , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California , Irvine , has proposed a Darwin - inspired explanation of how human morality might have evolved .
Ayala defines moral or ethical behavior as  the actions of a person who takes into account in a sympathetic way the impact the actions have on others . 
While philosophers and biologists have long debated whether the origins of morality are cultural or biological , respectively , Ayala argues that its actually a combination of both .
He sees morality as consisting of two parts : the capacity for ethics and the specific moral codes that we follow .
He proposes that , while ethical capacity is a product of biological evolution , moral codes are products of cultural evolution .
This more complex theory of moralitys origins is very similar to Darwins perspective .
 Many biologists , including sociobiologists , argue that morality is a biologically determined trait ,  Ayala told PhysOrg.com .
 Most philosophers and theologians see morality as a product of cultural evolution and / or religious faith .
I distinguish between the capacity for ethics ,  which is biologically determined as a result of biological evolution ; and the moral codes or ethical norms , which are largely outcomes of cultural evolution , including religious beliefs . 
Ayala further explains that the capacity for moral behavior is not adaptive in itself , but it is a consequence of a higher intellectual ability that is adaptive , being directly promoted through natural selection due to its ability to improve survival rates ( such as by allowing us to construct tools , develop hunting strategies , etc. ) .
Ayala identifies three necessary conditions for moral behavior that could have evolved with intelligence : the ability to anticipate the consequences of our actions , to evaluate such consequences , and to choose accordingly how to act .
While overall intellectual capacities evolved gradually , he speculates that the three necessary conditions for moral behavior only came about after crossing an evolutionary threshold , as they require abilities such as the formation of abstract concepts .
And only after humans possessed all three abilities could we possess a moral capacity .
In this line of thinking , morality is not an adaptation but an exaptation , which is when a trait evolves because it served one particular function , but later comes to serve another function , which was not originally the target of natural selection .
Ayala proposes that , once morality evolved as a byproduct of higher intelligence , it influenced individuals to behave in ways that increased cooperation , benefitting the social group and providing an evolutionary advantage , so that it eventually became an adaptation in and of itself .
Although a kind of natural selection , called group selection , is generally not considered an evolutionary stable strategy , Ayala points out Darwins argument that , unlike other animals , humans can understand the benefits of morality , cooperation , and altruistic behavior .
This understanding has inspired humans to create laws that enforce the moral codes that benefit their society .
The cultural evolution that drives these moral codes is , as Ayala explains , a more effective and faster form of evolution compared with biological evolution , and also explains the diversity of moral codes in different cultures .
If human morality originated both biologically and culturally , in the way that Ayala suggests , then it seems that it would be very unlikely for other animals to have evolved the same degree of morality in the same way , if at all .
Because morality relies on several evolutionary prerequisites that themselves seem unique to humans , it might even be considered one of the human traits that is furthest from the other animals , in accordance with Darwins original suggestion .
Perhaps , this distinctively human trait could even provide a solution to a distinctively human problem , as Ayala quotes the prominent psychologist Steven Pinker when he writes that  Morality is not just any old topic in psychology , but close to our connection of the meaning of life .
Moral goodness is what gives each of us the sense that we are worthy human beings . 
 Morality is a unique human trait , one of the most important and most distinctive traits that characterize humanity ,  Ayala said .
 Obviously , it is also overwhelmingly important in determining the welfare of human societies .
The distinction I use in characterizing morality ( behavior versus norms ) can be largely extended to other distinctive human attributes , like religion .
We are concerned about the meaning and purpose of life , as a consequence of our exalted intelligence , which came about by biological evolution and allows us to anticipate the future and to know that we will die .
But the diversity of religions comes about as the result of cultural -- not biological -- evolution . 

Mexico is the number one foreign supplier of marijuana abused in the United States .
In fact , according to a 2008 inter-agency report , marijuana is the top revenue generator for Mexican DTOs — a cash crop that finances corruption and the carnage of violence year after year .
The profits derived from marijuana trafficking — an industry with minimal overhead costs , controlled entirely by the traffickers — are used not only to finance other drug enterprises by Mexico ’s poly - drug cartels , but also to pay recurring “ business ” expenses , purchase weapons , and bribe corrupt officials .
Our friends at LEAP noticed this remarkable DEA testimony at a Senate hearing : What a mess .
Who'd have guessed that a drug known for producing feeling of pleasant relaxation would end up financing massive international networks of murderous gangsters .
Well , let 's get one thing straight : this is n't happening because the Mexican drug lords grow the best weed .
In fact , their product utterly sucks and they would n't be able to sell a single dime - bag of their seedy bloodstained schwag if it were n't for American law enforcement destroying as much domestic cannabis as possible .
It really is that simple .
Every plant we uproot , every stash we " take off the streets , " every cent we spend in our mindless war on marijuana is another dollar poured into the pockets of the pot mafia .
They get to sell this stuff only because we help them dominate the market , and if we let responsible Americans do it instead , the cartels ' marijuana profits would shrink to zero by the end of the next harvest season .
If you do n't believe me , just give us one year to prove you wrong .

TRENTON
— It took about two minutes from the time Senate President Steve Sweeney certified the passage of the millionaires tax package for Gov. Chris Christie to veto the bills at his desk .
" While I have little doubt that the sponsors and supporters of this bill sincerely believe that the state can tax its way out of this financial crisis , I believe that this bill does nothing more than repeat the failed , irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal policies of the past , " wrote Christie in his veto statement .
" Now is not the time for more of the same .
Ultimately , another tax increase will punish the state ’s struggling small businesses and set our economy further back from recovery . "
After the state Senate passed the bill , which had already passed the Assembly , Sweeney walked the bills down the hallways of the Statehouse , from the state Senate chambers to the governor 's office .
Once inside , he handed the bills to Christie , who was waiting .
" What took you so long ? " asked Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak .
Christie sat at a wooden desk emblazoned with the seal of the state of New Jersey and swiftly signed vetoes .
" We 'll be back , governor , " said Sweeney .
" Alright , we 'll see , " said Christie .
Democrats would need two - thirds majority in both houses of the Legislature to override the veto .
" This is something we 're not going away on , " said Sweeney .
" This is n't theater , this is n't a gimmick . "

The giant steel and concrete box which is seen as the best chance of stopping the BP oil spill arrived at the disaster scene in the Gulf of Mexico today , as authorities struggled to control oil breaching an island wildlife preserve .
Over the next few days cranes will attempt to lower the 100 - tonne contraption around 5,000 ft ( 1,500 metres ) to the sea floor and position it over a leaking pipe that has been gushing 210,000 gallons of crude a day into the Gulf .
If all goes accord to plan , the four - storey box will serve as a giant funnel , collecting the oil and piping it to a ship .
BP officials have said repeatedly that the plan for capturing and redirecting the oil is exceedingly complex , and has never before been tried at such depths .
" You have 100 tonnes of steel .
You have to stop , reposition , and stabilise these sorts of things .
I do n't think it 's a fast process , " said John Curry , a BP spokesman .
He said the system had been successfully deployed at depths of 365 metres after hurricane Katrina , but not by a BP crew .
In a best - case scenario , the contraption should be operational by Monday .
One bookmaker rated the chances of shutting off the leak completely at 1,000 - 1 .
The US coastguard confirmed for the first time that oil had made its way past protective booms and was surrounding Freemason Island .
The area is part of a chain of uninhabited barrier islands in the Breton national wildlife refuge .
Meanwhile , the Obama Administration suspended planned lease sales for drilling off the coast of Virginia .
Environmentalists who have visited the area described a thin band of orange - coloured oil lapping at the shore .
" The expanse itself is made up of three to four different kinds of oil ranging in thickness , including bright orange ribbons of weathered oil on the surface , " said Rick Steiner , a conservation professor at the University of Alaska , who flew over the region for Greenpeace .
" There were no visible research vessels , and the only visible relief effort in this area was about 30 shrimp boats off the shore of Little Gozier island pulling booms , with no skimmers taking the oil off the surface . "
Efforts to hold back the oil by repositioning booms were undermined by BP 's decision to break up the spill with dispersants .
The resulting thinner oil was proving much harder to contain .
" The oil just scoots right under the boom .
There is as much oil behind the booms as in the booms , " he said .
" It 's an exercise in futility . "
The breach deepened fears for brown pelicans and other endangered birds .
" This is an important nesting season , " said David Ringer , of the Audubon Society .
Heavier concentrations of crude remained further offshore , and the coastguard said weather forecasts suggested it would remain so until the weekend .
BP said it was relying on cameras from submersible robots to help guide the containment box into place and avoid further damage to the pipe .
In addition to the dark , frigid temperatures and extreme high pressures at such depths , crews will be worried about triggering another explosion because of the volatile mix of oil , gas and water .
BP faces an equally daunting challenge to contain the political and financial fallout .
The Obama administration has kept up the pressure on the oil giant , a move seen in part as a tactic to divert criticism of its own role in the disaster .
Recent news reports have suggested the interior department exercised lax oversight in approving BP 's operations in the Gulf , accepting too readily its claims there was little risk of an accident .
The department was further embarrassed by an ABC television report disclosing that Tom Strickland , who is in charge of fish and wildlife , went on a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon with his wife and other officials five days after the spill .
Director David Lynch is famous for his visionary , hallucinatory films–and this week , he ’s dipping his hand in product design .
Lynch has designed a pair of speakers covered in paint , tar , and lacquer .
And when they ’re exhibited , they ’ll be playing an eerie score he composed himself .
Those pictures are an exclusive sneak peak sent to FastCompany.com , of an upcoming exhibit .
Lynch is just one of nine designers / artists contributing to “ Sounds Like , ” which opens Monday at the DDC Lab .
The show was curated by Joey Roth , whom we ’ve covered before :
He ’s best known for these ceramic speakers , which recently became an instant hit ( and served as a base for Lynch ’s speaker design ) :
Those speakers caught fire because of the way they incorporated hand - made materials and high - tech components .
So Roth thought to ask other designers to try the same , and ask them to collaborate with musicians they know to score their creations in the exhibition .

There is simply no shortage of death declarations when it comes to Detroit – in fact , there seems to be almost a business around it .
You 've probably seen what I 'm talking about : the headline on the latest article or blog post declaring Detroit to be either dead or in the process of dying .
During the auto crisis last year , every media organisation from Time to major blogs and documentaries ( Requiem for Detroit ? , a documentary about the decline of the city , was recently aired in the UK to great critical acclaim ) .
Countless others articles , TV shows and blog entries have been detailing exactly how Detroit is dying and why we should n't care .
The belief ( or perhaps the hope ? ) that Detroit is well on it's way to extinction is not new .
Even people on the other side of the state have little use for Detroit , as KellenUSA informed us with her comment in the thread following my piece about worker solidarity in Michigan :
Please do n't think that the Detroit Metro area represents all of the great state of Michigan .
Those of us in the western part of the state know better .
Michigan is a state that is as nearly as large as some European countries , we make no claim to that part of the state …
The left - led government of Detroit has made it a failed city .
They have nobody to blame but themselves .
Nobody I know in Detroit is happy about such headlines .
I mentioned Requiem for Detroit ? to several different groups of people I work , organise and am friends with , and got universal disgust .
But the thing is , most of the news stories about Detroit struggling are n't wrong .
Things are bad in Detroit .
Schools are being shut down left and right .
Corrupt city officials have been charged with everything from stealing money from school lunches to bribery .
And , of course , all the jobs are gone .
So if all the facts are true , if Detroit really is struggling under the weight of such economic devastation , why on earth are Detroiters mad at the negative international attention ?
The answer is complicated .
Contrary to popular belief , there is no shortage of organising for change in Detroit .
Even Requiem recognised this by pointing to the urban gardening system that Detroit is growing famous for .
These gardens came about as a community - driven response to the lack of grocery stores in Detroit ( there is not one major grocery chain , although a regional grocery chain recently announced that it would begin construction soon ) and an overwhelming number of burned - out , abandoned lots in the city .
After the city refused to clean up or maintain them , local people took them over and built garden plots on them .
More and more , however , these garden systems are no longer being built by local community members out of necessity , but by middle - class white folks that are actively gentrifying the city , going on record claiming not to understand why their working - class black neighbours are n't helping .
What started as a community - driven response to a very basic need is fast becoming an ideology that is in many places being imposed on a city population that just does n't have the time or resources to help implement it .
Sure , gardens may look nice and bring a neighbourhood together – they may even feed people .
But do they pay the bills ?
Similarly , the barter economy speaks of a daily problem for many small businesses in Detroit .
Businesses have had no choice but to create barter arrangements .
I work at a small community - driven acupuncture clinic that offers affordable treatments in an attempt to specifically reach working - class communities .
For a huge portion of people in Detroit , this clinic is their only source of healthcare services , since they have no insurance and cannot afford the fees of a doctor 's office .
What started out as a paying job for me soon had to transition to a services barter – I help around the clinic and with media promotion , and the owner gives me free acupuncture .
How do other businesses fare ?
It 's a question even the gardening system has to reckon with .
More of the working - class community could work the gardens if they were paid in cash , but the gardens work through barter : you contribute labour , we give you food .
What does a small - business owner do when 40 % of the working - class people surrounding her business are out of work ?
How does the owner pay back the loans given by the government to start a small business ?
And what about school loans , or rent ?
These are the questions Detroiters are struggling to answer daily .
They focus on the " right " problems – ones that can ultimately lead to very productive answers .
Unfortunately , those questions are patently ignored by media in favour of the more glamorous story of death and destruction .
What Detroiters do not need is yet another story about how their city is dying – or even another story declaring there may be hope after all .
What they need is what every community needs : resources , support and the space to work through their problems in their own way .
They need you to spread the word about the Detroit - based Allied Media Conference and the United States Social Forum .
They need you to understand that what is wrong with Detroit is an indicator of industrialisation and capitalism , not a " liberal government " or gangs .
But more than anything else , Detroiters need and deserve a new type of headline .
New York Times To Charge For Online Access Beginning January 2011
Doug Mataconis · · 10 comments
Starting in January 2011 , you will have to pay to read an article on the New Times website :
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) — New York Times Co. will begin charging for online access to its articles early next year , said Bill Keller , the newspaper ’s executive editor , according to a Wall Street Journal report .
Keller broke the news at a Foreign Press Association dinner late Thursday , the newspaper reported .
The fees will go into effect in January .
The company had laid out a user - pay strategy earlier this year , but the exact timing had been an open question .
The Times tried something like this several years ago , of course , with Times Select , but quickly discovered that people were n’t all that interested in paying extra for the “ privilege ” of reading Frank Rich and Maureen Dowd .
So , now , they want to put the whole site behind a pay wall .
It ’s still unclear how this will work , or how much the Times is contemplating charging for a subscription , or access to an individual article .
However , I ca n’t see how this will have any result other than a decline in overall traffic .
Rather than paying to access NYTimes.com , it be much easier for people to just go to one of the many other news outlets that are n’t charging .
Online news providers obviously need to find a way to make money at what they ’re doing , but I do n’t see the subscription model as the answer to their problems .
Egypt ’s Musician Union has barred Elton John from performing at a private May 18 concert , citing John ’s controversial decisions to be both homosexual and believe that homosexuals should be allowed to live in the Middle East .
In the same interview with Parade magazine where John said he believed Jesus was a compassionate , intelligent gay man , the singer was also quoted as saying , “ I do n't know what makes people so cruel .
Try being a gay woman in the Middle East — you 're as good as dead . ”
These incredibly inflammatory remarks upset union head Mounir al Wasami , who asked a German press agency , “ How do we allow a gay , who wants to ban religions , claimed that the prophet Eissa ( Jesus ) was gay and calls for Middle Eastern countries to allow gays to have sexual freedom ? ”
( Ha ha , he called him “ a gay . ”
When did sixth - grade boys start running the Egyptian Musician Union ? )
It ’s not clear yet whether promoters will push forward with the performance despite the ban , but al Waisimi did warn that his was the only organization “ authorized to allow performances by foreign singers , " so any appearance would apparently be considered a violation .
Given its history of dealing with any person it deems to be " a gay " — including raiding a supposed " gay disco " in Cairo and imprisoning 20 people — here 's hoping John skips the concert and stays home , where he can seek cold comfort in his millions and millions of dollars and fans .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Nearly a month after a deadly explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , the damaged well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico continued to spill oil .
In the weeks since the accident occurred , the oil slick has periodically drifted northeast toward the Mississippi Delta and reached the Chandeleur Islands .
On May 17 , 2010 , when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite acquired this natural - color image , a large patch of oil was visible near the site of the accident , and a long ribbon of oil stretched far to the southeast .
Oil slicks are not always visible in natural - color satellite images .
A thin sheen of oil on an already dark background may be impossible to detect .
On this day , however , the slick was located in the sunglint part of the image , which makes the slick stand out .
Sunglint is the mirror - like reflection of the Sun off the water .
If the ocean surface were as smooth and calm as a mirror , a series of perfect reflections of the Sun would appear in a line along the path of the satellite ’s northeast - to - southwest orbit .
Instead , waves blur the reflection , creating a wide , washed - out strip through the ocean .
A coating of oil smoothes the sea surface relative to the oil - free water , causing it to reflect light differently .
Depending on where in the sunglint area it occurs , the slick may look brighter or darker than adjacent clean water .
In this image , the slick appears as an uneven shape of varying shades of bright gray - beige .

You Will Never See A More Disgusting Goring Than This !
I have never fully understood the concept behind bullfighting , and this is exactly why .
This afternoon in the arena of Las Ventas in Madrid , Spanish bullfighter Julio Aparicio was the victim of one of the most gruesome gorings I have ever seen .
The perpetrator was a bull by the name of Opíparo , and when the Seville bullfighter began to tumble , the giant beast attacked , driving his horn into Aparicio ’s chin and out through his mouth .
Aparicio was taken to a hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to repair the damages he had suffered .
I have seen some nasty things in the bullfighting ring before , but nothing like this !

The Obama administration warned BP in a strongly worded letter Saturday that the federal government expects the oil giant -- and not taxpayers -- to pay all damages associated with the ongoing Gulf of Mexico oil leak , even if they exceed the $ 75 - million liability cap under federal law .
Two Cabinet secretaries , Ken Salazar of Interior and Janet Napolitano of Homeland Security , wrote to BP chief executive Tony Hayward to reiterate the administration 's position that " BP is accountable to the American public for the full clean up of this spill and all the economic loss caused by the spill and related events . "
The secretaries noted that BP has promptly paid damages claims thus far , and that company officials have repeatedly said they 'll pay all " legitimate claims " stemming from the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent , ongoing leak of thousands of barrels a day .
In light of those statements , Salazar and Napolitano wrote , " we understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $ 75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill , even if more than $ 75 million is required to provide full compensation to all claimants , and BP will not seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers , the United States Government , or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount .
" The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill .
Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions . "
An Interior spokeswoman said that the letter was not in response to any specific action from BP .
[ Update 3:04 p.m. : New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez , whose effort to speed up a bill raising the $ 75 million limit was thwarted by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski , praised the Obama letter .
" BP has been careful to use qualifying words when discussing its financial responsibility for the damage it is causing , which raises concerns that the corporation will evade paying for it in full , " he said .
" Regardless of what BP ends up committing to pay for this disaster , there is no such thing as a ' Too Safe To Spill ' oil rig , and there should be no legal wiggle room for oil companies that devastate coastal businesses and communities -- now or in the future . " ]

Misshandlungsvorwürfe Mixa will für Ex - Heimkinder beten
Sie werfen ihm Misshandlung vor - er will für sie beten : Der Augsburger Bischof Walter Mixa streitet die Vorwürfe mehrerer ehemaliger Heimkinder weiter ab , er habe sie geschlagen .
Gleichzeitig behauptet der Geistliche , er könne sich gar nicht mehr an die Personen erinnern .
The widely used chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) is an estrogen - mimicker .
Some 200 animal studies have suggested that the substance is very harmful .
Over 90 percent of Americans show some BPA in their “ body burden ” .
It is especially hard to avoid BPA since it is used in plastic containers and food liners and is even used to make the coating on the receipts we get at stores .
For most urban residents , the handling of these receipts is thought to be the number one source of BPA in the body .
About 2 billion pounds of BPA are produced in the United States each year .
Last year ANH - USA filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration warning of the widespread use of BPA in dental sealants for children ( these sealants are literally painted on the teeth ) , composite fillings , and orthodontery .
The FDA has responded to the petition with dismissive silence .
Fortunately , Senator Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) is taking the fight to the Food Safety Bill by trying to offer an amendment banning the substance in food containers .
This has stirred up a hornet ’s nest among industry associations .
The Grocery Manufacturers Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have threatened to withdraw support for the bill if an anti-BPA amendment is added .
If you are curious about how much BPA would be reduced in our bodies if the use of the chemical was banned from the lining of food containers , it is significant .
In the late 1990s Japanese companies removed the chemical from any direct contact with food .
The efforts resulted in a 50 percent reduction in BPA levels in Japanese citizens who were tested .
We strongly support Senator Feinstein ’s proposed amendment to the Food Safety Modernization Action ( S. 510 ) to ban BPA from food containers and hope it will be added to the bill .
If the amendment is offered and time permits , we will notify our readers and ask that you support the amendment .
We have also been in communication with the senator ’s office about the importance of removing BPA from children ’s dental sealants and fillings and from orthodontery .
We do not support the Senate Food Safety Bill , but it will almost certainly pass and this amendment would make it better .
We are especially opposed to the House version of the Food Safety bill which has already passed .
We intend to work as hard as possible to keep the noxious house provisions from being adopted in the final version of the bill that must pass both House and Senate .

British Columbia 's University of Victoria is awash in thousands of feral bunnies , and no one knows what to do about it :
As the university struggles with the question of what to do with between 1,500 and 2,000 feral rabbits — which are chewing and digging their way through the campus grounds — emotions are running high , fuelled by accusations of misinformation from both sides .
Leaders of the protect - the - bunnies movement claim the university is secretly killing rabbits at night and that there are " poison boxes " on the grounds .
Bunny supporters claim that officials have only paid lip - service to trap and sterilize programs as they always regarded a massive slaughter as the final solution .
" The University of Victoria has been for years conducting a misinformation campaign in order to justify their killing of abandoned domestic rabbits on campus , " said animal rights activist Roslyn Cassells .
" Betrayal is the order of the day at the University of Victoria , where a large - scale nighttime shooting of over 1,000 abandoned pet rabbits is imminent , " Cassells said in a recent e-mail to the media .
The 22 Best Class of 2010 Senior Portraits
Graduation is just around the corner , and our nation 's high school seniors are going out with style .
This is the next generation .
This is what we have to look forward to .
Serious fuel shortages are spreading across Greece as customs officers decide to extend their strike against austerity measures until Tuesday .
Long lines of cars are to be seen in petrol stations across greece as fuel is running out after an extension of customs officers industrial action against the neoliberal austerity measures imposed by the government on the pretext of the national credit crisis .
Initially the strike which began last Tuesday 16 February was to end on Friday 19 , but customs officers have announced its extension to Tuesday 23 causing panic to drivers and a headache to the government .
According to the bourgeois media , half the stations in and around Athens have already run out of unleaded , with the depots of the rest expected to empty within the day .
The only city that has evaded the problem due to extended deposits is Salonica .
Mr Kiousis , the petrol station union president has claimed that already across the country 85 % of petrol stations are completely dry .
The extension of the strike means that all imports and exports have come to a standstill and customs will again open on Thursday 25th , after the 24h general strike of the previous day .
Meanwhile workers of the Ministry of Economics continue to strike , blocking the entrance to the Ministry even to the Minister himself who has to accommodate him self in the premises of other ministries in order to perform his publicly hated deals with the EU .
At the same time , the government 's face is at a new all time low after the police shooting of a 25 year old plumber during a battle with alleged bank robbers in the eastern suburbs of Byronas .
According to ballistics the unlucky worker was hit 9 times at the back and the head , all by police bullets , as he was trying to take refuge at an engine - shop .
According to neighbours , while shooting the bystander , the cops yelled " I 'ate ' the motherfucker " .
The brutal killing of the father of an 18 month old baby has fueled public dismay towards the police , now even more perceived as a gang of armed maniacs .
The impression was worsened by the police chief of Athens claiming the operation was " successful " with the Minister of Public Order insisting that the only solution to such incidents is more and more armed police .
The Byronas tragedy has come as a blow to the credibility of the greek government as a whole since it has recently gone public saying , as a response of financial and labour fears concerning the crisis , " If we cannot guarantee anything else , we can guarantee your security " .
The credibility of the police has been further eroded as a result of two bombs that have damaged the headquarters of JP Morgan in Athens and the political office of the Minister of Public Order in Peristeri .
The former explosion occurred in Athens ' most heavily guarded quarter , Kolonaki , while the latter occurred despite efforts of police to destroy the bomb by means of a controlled explosion .
On other news from the labour struggle front , workers mobilisation against the layoff of a worker at the prestigious arty publishing house Agra are continuing apparently causing panic to its bosses who like to portray themselves as progressives , to the extent that they have taken recourse to publishing letters of support to the lay - off (! ) by a series of well - known artists and authors , the vanguard of the Spectacle of culture in greece .
The union of workers of the book and printed material sector has gone on a 48h strike over the lay - off with persistent demos outside
Agra 's offices and main bookstore in Exarcheia .
Finally , pharmacists have announced a 24h warning strike against the austerity measures for Monday 22 of February .
Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 Slim is coming sooner than later , according to the spy photos released earlier this year of its hardware components .
So , it ’s only fitting that we count down the five most creative mods of this current generation .
Continue reading to see them all .
1. One - Handed Xbox 360 Controller
This custom - built one - handed Xbox 360 controller was created by none other than the master video game hacker himself : Ben Heck .
According to Ben , “ before the right analog stick is actuated by setting this controller against a leg or table ; an elastic strap / velcro attaches everything to your hand . ”
2. Xbox 360 Joystick
Built by SRK member Akira Kuramoto , this is one Xbox 360 accessory you wo n’t find at your local Gamestop .
Basically , he decided to one - up its wired Xbox 360 joystick predecessor by creating a wireless version .
That ’s not all , it ’s decked out with colorful push buttons — LEDs will soon be added to them — and even a clear ball top joystick .
3. Halo 3 Scene
What may seem like a Halo 3 diorama at first is actually a fully - functional Xbox 360 that looks it belongs in one of Bungie ’s highly popular games .
Aside from the soldiers , grassy area , stones , transparent case , the system even comes with matching silver controllers to boot .
4. Xbox 360 Car
Sure , playing Xbox 360 while driving is n’t the best idea , but with this car , you can easily entertain guests .
Simply press the power button , flip down the visors , which have integrated LCD displays , and they ’re ready to play .
Just hope you do n’t get a RROD on a long road trip .
5. Xbox 360 Laptop
The one - handed controller above is most certainly creative , but we could n’t leave Ben Heck ’s Xbox 360 laptop off this list .
His latest revision features a 17 - inch widescreen Gateway monitor , built - in Ethernet port , an integrated Wi-Fi adapter , digital pushbutton volume controls , Jasper motherboard , and two USB ports .

A 26 year old woman who was born in Tunisia has been fined 500 Euros in Italy after she was spotted by police with a veil covering her face .
The law used to fine Amel Marmouri was based on an existing anti-terrorist law dating back to 1975 , which makes it illegal for a man or woman to cover their face in a way that prevents them from being identified whilst in a public place .
The authorities in Novara fined Amel through a city ordinance that has banned all items of clothing that " prevents all immediate identification of the wearer inside public buildings , schools and hospitals " .
Mayor of Novara , Massimo Giordano states that " people who come to come to live in our city must respect our traditions " .
The woman 's husband , Ben Salah Braim , has said that he must now keep his wife at home because the Koran states that no man must look at her face in public and has no idea how he will afford the 500 Euro fine .
Rules is rules .
If that 's the law in the city then you must obey it or move out .
Women are banned from wearing bikinis in public in many Islamic countries because it goes against the cultural / religious traditions which have grown over generations , the same respect should be paid by Muslims when in other countries adhering to the dress codes of that country .
If a woman goes out in Saudi Arabia wearing nothing but a mini skirt and a bra then she will be arrested so why should it be any different when the burqa or any veiled item of religious clothing is worn in a country where the traditions and cultural sensitivity forbid it ?
I am not saying the Burqa is good or bad but do n't expect it to be tolerated just because your faith demands it and the same goes for ANY item of clothing which is out of step from the traditions of the country in which it is worn .

There ’s one complaint we here at OSNews get thrown in our faces quite often : what ’s up with the lack of , you know , operating system news on OSNews ?
Why so much mobile phone news ?
Why so much talk of H264 , HTML5 , and Flash ?
Where ’s the juicy news on tomorrow ’s operating systems ?
Since it ’s weekend , I might as well explain why things are the way they are .
Hint : it has nothing to do with a lack of willingness .
OSNews was founded in 1997 , and depending on if you ’re Columbus or Wichita , that ’s either a bad or a good year .
That insipid Scotty Lynch notwithstanding , I find 1997 a great year , simply because , well , OSNews was launched then .
Sure , it did n’t look anything like the site before you today , but the format was n’t much different .
OSNews , however , did n’t really take off until Eugenia took over in 2001 , after leaving BeNews .
This was a very exciting time for the desktop operating system space – the space OSNews has traditionally focussed on .
So much stuff was going on right at the start of the new millennium .
Apple was finally ready to take the old MacOS behind the shed and put it out of its misery .
After years of hard work , Mac OS X first arose from the dismembered body parts that once made up NEXTSTEP , and while early Mac OS X releases were about as pleasurable to use as a broken toilet , it was still a very exciting time if you were an operating system enthusiast on the Mac side of things .
Something similar was going on in Redmond .
The Windows 9 x product line had really run its course , and finally , in 2001 , Microsoft was ready to merge its server and desktop operating system line with Windows XP .
From there on out , both desktop and server used Windows NT , and while Windows XP was off to a rocky start , its second service pack made is somewhat usable ( I never liked XP ) .
If you were an operating system enthusiast on the Windows side , these were exciting times .
In the open source space , things were really looking up .
After almost a decade of development , Linux was really maturing quite rapidly as a desktop operating system .
Both GNOME and KDE were looking pretty good , and offered compelling and usable alternatives to Windows – even though you were still supposed to get your hands dirty .
For open source enthusiasts , these were exciting times .
Today , I would quit there .
However , back in those days , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , a lot more was going on that had people excited .
Yes , Be , Inc. , which produced the best desktop operating system ever conceived , was still in operation .
Sure , it was clinging on for dear life , but there was still excitement around the BeOS .
There were countless other projects aiming to one day conquer your desktop , and instead of the cynicism we hear today , they were greeted with cheers and applause ; AtheOS / Syllable , SkyOS , QNX , eComStation , and god knows what other stuff has occupied my hard drives over the years .
Somewhere along the way , however , we settled .
Like a 35 year old woman sick of trying to find the perfect man , we grew tired of trying to find that perfect desktop operating system – and just like that 35 year old settling for that guy , we settled for Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux .
Instead of dreaming of that Ferrari or Aston Martin , we settled for the Peugeot 307 , the Renault Megane , the Opel Astra .
You do n’t see much alternative operating system news on OSNews any more because there is none .
Sure , there ’s the occasional “ Blubbilux Gets FAT32 Support ” , but beyond that whoopdidoo , it ’s a scary empty wasteland out there .
Geeks have settled for Macwinilux , and have more interest in debating the choice of fonts on Apple ’s web site than they do discussing cold and bare metal operating system technologies .
Everyone with a blog is a geek now – while back in my day ( yes , I ’m only 25 , but still ) , you needed to actually do geeky stuff to be a geek .
Like , I do n’t know , build a Linux system from scratch , or use QNX as your one and only operating system for six months ( Hi ! ) .
Let ’s throw the cards on the table as hard as possible .
SkyOS is dead .
Barring the occasional accidental hiccup , Syllable is dead .
QNX as a desktop operating system is dead .
ReactOS can finally run three Windows applications if the planets happen to align correctly .
AROS may be genetically engineering horses into a race of sunshine - farting unicorns , but they have the communicative skills of a dead lobotomised possum .
MorphOS and RISC OS are still twitching every now and then , but you ca n’t buy anything to run it on unless you ’re willing to spend hours searching for second hand hardware ( MorphOS ) or are willing to give up two kidneys to afford outdated second hand - hardware ( RISC OS ) .
In the established worlds , the situation is n’t any better .
To all those zealots cheering for team Macwinilux : your raison d’Ã ªtre has n’t done anything even remotely revolutionary since 2001 .
Sure , Windows looks glassier now , but it ’s still Windows .
Mac OS
X now actually does something even remotely related to “ running ” , but you can show any die - hard Mac fan a screenshot of Mac OS X 10.2 and it will take him a while to realise it ’s not Snow Leopard .
The KDE guys spent years and years creating this amazing platform called KDE4 , but since they lack any form of end - user imagination , could n’t do anything with it other than recreate KDE 3.5 , only with less features and higher hardware requirements .
GNOME has been this for eight years .
Even those few shimmers of light in this dark empty void that is called the desktop operating system market are old lights , lights that are trying to recapture the glory of yore .
As much as I love Haiku , it ’s recreating a 10 - year old operating system .
Sure , the new AmigaOne X1000 has WANT written all over it , but it ’s still powered by a severely ageing operating system .
As the industry has moved on , so have we at OSNews .
Okay , I refuse to ever refer to the internet as a cloud ( anyone that does has something to sell and ca n’t be trusted ) , but there ’s no denying that a lot of interesting stuff is going on here , for instance with HTML5 – so we report on that now .
The smartphone space , as small as it really is , is filled with new and interesting operating systems ( Android , iPhoneOS , Windows Phone 7 , webOS ) , so we report on those .
Innovation in the technology world is being severely hampered by patents , so we report on that .
OSNews has moved on .
As much as it saddens me to see the technology world settling on Macwinilux ( do n’t flatter yourself , those three are pretty much the same ) , it ’s a fact I have to deal with .
It ’s my job to fill OSNews with lots of interesting news to discuss , and even though I would love to be able to talk about how new and exciting operating systems are going to take over the desktop world , I have to be realistic too .
Geeks ( meaning you and I ) have made a very clear choice , and it does n’t seem like anything ’s about to bring back those exciting early days of OSNews .
It ’s time to nut up , or shut up .
Want more alternative operating system news on OSNews ?
Then make sure there is something for me to report on .
I. Introduction
Rice consumption in Japan has been decreasing since the mid 1960's .
During recent years , it has been decreasing by 1 % a year .
Accordingly , the domestic rice production , which is the heart of agriculture in Japan , has also been decreasing .
The same trend is observed in many Asian countries , such as Taiwan , Malaysia , Singapore , and even in China .
In China , per capita rice consumption has been steadily decreasing since the early 1990's .
To stop declining rice consumption is a critical issue .
To develop some value - added rice products is important to encourage rice consumption as a whole .
Germinated brown rice ( GBR ) and rice bread ( RB ) are two examples that attract consumers .
GBR and RB currently are becoming increasingly popular setting up fair sized industries in Japan during the last several years .
Large companies have been producing rice cookers designed for GBR and RB , marketing channels for them are being developed , more products based on GBR and RB are on the road , and more and more retail shops are selling GBR and RB .
Even school lunch is involved nationwide .
The GBR and RB can grow to be some of the keys for recovering the popularity for rice in Japan and other Asian countries .
II . Germinated Brown Rice ( GBR )
Background of GBR Nutrition of sprouted grains has been studied since decades ago .
Finney ( 1978 ) showed enhancement of wheat and soybean seeds if they were sprouted .
Tkachuk ( 1979 ) also found similar situation in wheat .
Saikusa , Horino and Mori ( 1994 ) found that γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) increased dramatically if brown rice is soaked in 40 degrees in Celsius water for 8 hours to 24 hours .
Okada et al. ( 2000 ) reported that intake of GABA for 8 consecutive weeks suppressed blood pressure and improved sleeplessness , and autonomic disorder observed during the menopausal or presenile period .
More recently , Jeon et al. ( 2003 ) found that GBR may be effective for suppressing liver damage .
In Japan , people in the ancient era may have been eating brown rice soaked ( Kayahara , 2003 ) .
GBR was established for marketing in Japan in 1995 .
GBR products were developed and marketed first by Domer Co. ( Ueda City , Nagano Pref. ) and the city government , Mino-cho of Kagawa Pref. , was one of the earliest organizations engaged in the production of GBR .
It is now produced by several private companies including agricultural cooperatives .
During the last decade , 49 items related to GBR have been patented .
The method to make GBR is quite simple .
Soak the brown rice for one night or two depending on temperature and they are sprouted .
This process make the internal minerals change , and the brown rice becomes more nutritious , easier to chew and tastier .
Contribution of GBR to Health Eating brown rice became popular in Japan back in the 1970's .
That was because of rich fiber and other nutrients contained in the brown rice .
However , the popularity did not last long due to the fact that brown rice had to be cooked in the pressure cooker and was still hard to chew and less tasty .
GBR overcame the problem .
It can be cooked in an ordinary rice cooker and is soft enough to chew even for children .
Further , an added benefit is the fact that GBR is much more nutritious .
During the process of being sprouted , nutrients in the brown rice change drastically .
Various types of analyses on Germinated brown rice have been conducted in Japan .
Those major nutrients that increase in content in the GBR are γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , dietary fiber , inositols , ferulic acid , phytic acid , tocotrienols , magnesium , potassium , zinc , γ- oryzanol , and prolylendopeptidase inhibitor ( Kayahara and Tukahara , 2000 ) .
Kayahara and Tsukahara indicate that volume of nutrients contained in GBR relative to milled rice are 10 times for GABA , nearly 4 times for dietary fiber , vitamin E , niacine and lysine , and about 3 times for vitamin B1 and B6 , and Magnesium ( Fig. 1 ) .
Accordingly , they conclude that continuous intake of GBR is good for accelerating metabolism of brain , preventing headache , relieving constipation , preventing cancer of colon , regulating blood sugar level , preventing heart disease , lowering blood pressure as well as preventing Alzheimer 's disease ( Table 1 ) .
Table 2 shows the results of analyses on nutrients contained in GBR relative to the situation of brown rice before germination .
In these analyses , we selected not only Japanese rice but also California medium grains ( Calrose and M401 varieties ) and Vietnamese long grains ( ordinary grains and jasmine rice ) .
Through many chemical analyses , it was indicated that level of moisture and length of period after harvest influence whether the brown rice can be sprouted or not .
These two factors appear to influence the magnitude of change in nutrients .
Therefore , those two items are shown in the table as well .
The results of the analyses indicate that there is a significant change in profiles of free amino acids for all brown rice as they get sprouted .
GABA increased from 3.6 to 6.1 for the Vietnamese ordinary long grain despite the extremely low germination rate .
GABA in Calrose increased more than two times from 4.9 to 10.9 and for M401 more than three times from 2.7 to 9.8 with germination rates of 90 % and 56 % , respectively .
For the Japanese Koshihikari and Hitomebore varieties , GABA increased from 7.6 to 16.6 and from 10.5 to 13.6 , respectively , with high germination rates .
Preparation and Marketing of GBR
The basic procedure to prepare GBR is ; first select good brown rice to germinate ; second , soak it for some 20 hours in warm water at around 30 to 40 degrees in Celsius or longer with cooler temperature ; changing water a few times depending on smell being developed during the soaking ; wash it lightly before cooking .
GBR producing companies pack it into two types ; dry and wet .
Moisture level of dry and wet GBR are generally at 15 % and 30 % , respectively .
The marketing procedures are conducted mainly through three routes : Catalogue , internet and retail shopping .
Market prices of the GBR is at the range of 1,000 yen ( appr. US$ 9.00 ) to 800 yen ( US $ 7.00 ) per 1 kg comparing the prices for the ordinary milled rice ranging from about 300 yen to 600 yen depending upon quality .
Although GBR can be easily prepared at home , they are priced extraordinarily high for sale .
The GBR was originally started in 1995 .
Nowadays , GBR products are being sold as much as 15,000 MT in Japan , and the marketed value as much as approximately 15 billion yen .
Total rice consumption in Japan is currently about 9 million MT in brown rice basis .
The industry has targeted total sales of GBR in Japan at 90,000 MT , a 1 % of the total rice consumption , in the near future .
GBR is also served at restaurants .
An oriental atmosphere restaurant in Kyoto has served home - made GBR rice since 5 years ago .
The owner insists that GBR attracts young women .
GBR is often quoted in periodicals featuring health and fashion .
Both the aged for mainly health and young mainly for fashion and health appear to appreciate the GBR .
GBR is already applied to many products such as GBR rice - balls , GBR soup , GBR bread , GBR doughnuts , GBR cookies , GBR rice burger , etc. GBR is mixed with other materials in those products .
GBR can be applied to many dishes in the world .
Italian risotto , Spanish paella , Brazilian fejoada , and Indian curry & rice , etc may be suitable for using GBR .
It can be used even for sushi .
Among all those possibilities , making GBR at home is the best , cheapest and most nutritious .
Because GBR is eaten as brown rice , there is no 10 % loss which usually occurs during the milling process from brown rice .
GBR 's high nutrition content is quite critical when food supply is short .
GBR can be applied to indica rice .
Indica rice often contains some bitter tasting material on the outer layer of the grains .
Accordingly , it is suggested to soak it in the refrigerator for an extra day or two before cooking ( Horino , 2004 ) .
Horino hints that the parboiled rice process may be applied for GBR rather easily for the indica rice .
Before steaming the rough rice , the rice can be sprouted first .
III .
Rice Bread ( RB )
Growing business RB became possible to make by the creation of fine rice flour developed by the Niigata Food Products Research Institute ( Niigata - ken Shokuhin Bunseki Senta ) .
Rice bread is getting more popular in Japan .
In Tottori City , some 15,000 kids have been enjoying rice bread twice a month .
According to the questionnaire the City office surveyed as of 2002 , 50 % of the kids feel that rice bread is enjoyable , 23 % neutral , and 27 % moderately dislike it .
After a year of eating rice bread regularly , about 80 % of the kids show their fondness toward rice bread .
RB is generally made with 80 % rice flour and 20 % gluten .
In Japan , rice is relatively much more expensive than wheat .
For rice bread , therefore , low quality rice or old rice , which is substantially cheaper than ordinary new rice , is being used .
Rice that is 5 to six years old can be used for rice bread and the quality of the bread is not necessarily impaired much , according to the bakeries .
More varieties of rice bread are being developed ; plain rice bread , raisin rice bread , nut rice bread , rice bread rolls , croissant rice bread , and many other kinds .
They have established gluten - free rice bread using only rice flour mainly .
This type of rice bread is suitable for those who are allergic to gluten .
Rice bread is being sold commercially , and the number of bakeries selling rice bread is increasing nowadays .
Prices of RB at bakeries are quite expensive relative to wheat rice .
In a Tottori bakery shop , one loaf of rice bread is sold for 450 yen ( about US $ 4.00 ) and wheat bread for 150 yen ( about US $ 1.40 ) .
Rice bread is about 3 times as expensive as wheat rice .
In this bakery , which started selling rice bread in November 2002 , rice bread has now grown to account for 20 % of its total sale value .
There are no official statistics to show how much of rice bread is being consumed in Japan .
In 2001 , one milling company used as much as 1,100 MT of rice for bread flour .
Costs of Rice Bread Costs of rice bread in Japan is relatively much more expensive than wheat .
Tables 3 and 4 show cost items to produce rice bread flour in Japanese yen and the U.S. dollars , respectively , converting yen into dollar using exchange rate of 105 yen a dollar .
One kilogram of brown rice costs 120 yen or US $ 1.14 , which is the price for low quality rice and substantially cheaper than the costs for table rice at around $ 4.00 / kg .
Charge for milling for milled rice is $ 0.1 / kg .
A loss of 15 % occurs when low quality rice is milled with a milling rate at 85 % .
Therefore , accumulated price for 1 kg of milled rice turns out to be $ 1.46 .
Then , a charge for flouring is $ 0.86 / kg with milling rate at 80 % .
Thus , accumulated costs so far is $ 2.89 / kg .
Finally , rice flour must be added with wheat gluten to become sticky .
This is $ 3.81 / kg in Japan .
If rice flour 80 % and gluten 20 % are mixed , the cost for the mix becomes $ 3.08 .
This compares with wheat flour at $ 0.8 in Japan .
Rice bread flour is nearly 4 times more expensive over wheat flour .
Rice bread at the school lunch in Tottori is being subsidized by the city government just for the additional portion of the cost over wheat bread .
The national Japanese government provides subsidies to schools if they use old rice for bread .
Rice bread is provided at schools in 11 prefectures out of 47 in Japan as of 2003 replacing wheat bread .
The number may be increasing in 2004 .
What would be the cost different between rice bread flour and wheat flour in the world market ?
Table 5 indicates an estimate based on world prices .
Price of milled rice is from Thai 100 % B market price .
Adding charge for flouring at $ 0.1/kg and gluten at $ 2.7 / kg , costs of rice bread flour become $ 0.84 , which compares with $ 0.25 /kg at the wholesale market ( Wheat Outlook Yearbook , 2003 ) .
Rice bread flour still appears to be almost 3 times more expensive than its counterpart of wheat .
Tina Harden learned the hard way that you can't stop " Gossip Girl , " you can ca n't even hope to contain it .
The Central Florida mom has been waging a nearly two - year war against the series of tween books , refusing to return them to the public library in the hopes of keeping them out of the hands of impressionable youngsters like her daughter .
Harden said she could n't believe the content she read in the books , which inspired the hit WB TV show of the same name , when her daughter brought one home .
Sex , drugs , dirty language , all too much for the Seminole County mom .
" I was just shocked that this was in the young adult section of the library , " Harden told WESH .
Harden decided to take action .
She checked out three " Gossip Girl " books as well as a book from the " It Girl " series in 2008 , refusing to return them .
She has racked up over $ 85 in fines while keeping the books for the past two years .
" I am not a book burner , I am not a censor , " she insisted .
Harden suggested the library restrict access of the books to teens or put a warning label on the books .
The library declined , since restricting access would be censorship .
They capitulated slightly , however , and moved the books from the young adult section to adult fiction .
Harden 's book hijacking efforts did little to stem the tide of " Gossip Girl " indulgence , as the library carried multiple copies of the series .
One of the books , " Notorious , " was checked out 129 times in the last five months .
Harden finally returned the books Thursday , but has no plans to pay back the $ 85 dollar fine .
A girl who posted pics of her " epic boobs " and inadvertently became an Internet meme lost a lawsuit against the outlet that made her a star .
It raises the question :
If you become an internet meme , what should you do ?
Epic Boobs
Girl 's lawsuit against the British titty mag Loaded over the use of a photo that originated on her Bebo profile ( and was immortalized on comment boards for EPIC BOOBS ) has been tossed out , quashing Epic Boobs Girl 's latest attempt to end her meme .
In an anarchic world of mass , fleeting fame , is there any recourse for the unwitting subjects of internet memes ?
Here are a few tips on memes ' options , featuring advice from a real , live person who went through it and survived .
1. HIDE
Epic Boobs
Girl may have posed for sassy , boobalicious pics with her friends , but she definitely did n't foresee having her face plastered in masturbatory magazines .
Almost instantly , internet users raided her Bebo profile and saved every picture of her glorious rack .
If you have n't already taken privacy - protecting precautions , it 's probably too late .
Besides , hiding is by far the most boring thing you can do once you 've become a meme .
You 'd be far wiser to ...
2. PROFIT
These are your 15 minutes of fame !
Ride it like a Dorothy Gale on a gust of wind in a Kansas tornado .
Here 's what you could get out of it :
• Fame :
All the world 's a reality TV show , all the people merely fameballs .
Smacked in the face with the opportunity to stretch their fifteen minutes as long as possible , few can resist .
Tennessee twink Chris Crocker parlayed his plea to " Leave Britney Alone ! " into a full - fledged multimedia career .
He now lives in L.A. and earns his keep with appearances , comic books , and his ever - popular YouTube channel .
David After Dentist 's dad franchised his kid's visage into tee - shirts and stickers on DavidAfterDentist.com — presumably with rapidly depleting returns on investment .
Even Rick Astley — whose musical career spans far further back than his incessant appearance in rickrolls — managed to ride the zeitgeist with new tour dates and albums .
The risk , of course , is that you turn into an overexposed sell - out .
But that 's also how we measure success in this world , so do as you must .
• Fortune :
Though fame and fortune go hand in hand , if you want is money without stardom , it 's doable .
Take , for instance , the Numa Numa guy , whose voice most people have never heard , though they 've seen him lip syncing in ads for Geico , Vizio , and others .
Most people do n't know this guy 's real name and would n't recognize him if his lips were n't moving .
Ultimately all we know is that he makes a ridiculous amount of money for licensing a YouTube video that has 35 million views .
• Something Else : Did you know some people use fame for the force of good ?
The dad from the " You 're Not a Single Lady " kept a blog chronicling son Losiah 's adoption from South Korea .
When Losiah became a meme , Carlos Whittaker took the opportunity to " bring adoption to the forefront of the conversation . "
And if it helped Carlos ' career as an artist , pastor , thinker , [ and ] experience architect , well , that 's fine , too .
3. SUE YOUR MEME INTO SUBMISSION
A major meme has yet to be sued into submission ( see : Streisand Effect , the ) but meme subjects have certainly tried .
Epic Boobs
Girl 's plight is among the more sympathetic ones .
The fact that her suit failed suggests there is little hope for anti-meme legal action .
Likewise , Glenn Beck 's plight against " Did Glenn Beck rape and murder a girl in 1990 ? " illuminates the bottomless pit of failure that awaits those who try to sue their memes into submission .
To satirize Glenn Beck 's notorious reliance on mistruths , internet users reappropriated a Gilbert Gottfried joke that demonstrates how warning against a rumor can actually start a rumor .
They started asking whether Glenn Beck had raped and murdered a young girl and why he had not commented on it .
Thus , without ever accusing Glenn Beck of raping and murdering anyone , they successfully wedged the accusation into his Google results and the collective subconscious .
Beck tried to sue the owner of DidGlennBeckRapeandMurderaYoungGirlin1990.com into submission .
He failed .

4. SHRUG , LAUGH , AND MOVE ON
The most dignified and rational option for internet memes , shrugging and moving on with your life is probably best .
Approval Guy became famous when a photo of him sitting alone , looking nerdy - but - happy at a lingerie party , became a meme .
He pondered what to make of his fame , ultimately deciding to do nothing .
We reached Approval Guy by email , and this is what he said :
Being posted all over the internet does n't bother me at all , in fact , I find it hilarious .
I really enjoy seeing the creativity of others and think they should continue to do as they please with my image .
I have not made a profit from " Approval Guy " and nor do I plan to .
On the other hand , if the opportunity arose , I would n't mind taking advantage of it .
Well played , Approval Guy .
If you love your fleeting fame , set it free — it'll be better as a second - date story and wryly cherished memory , anyway .
Approval Guy cautions , however , that not all memes are created equal .

The quadrants of the Milky Way The Milky Way Galaxy is located in the map
( click to navigate )
The Milky Way Galaxy was one of two trillion galaxies believed to exist .
The number of stars it contained was variously estimated to be over three billion to over four hundred billion stars .
It generated its own magnetic field , which experienced dips and peaks .
The galaxy was 100,000 light years wide .

Characteristics
The Milky Way Galaxy was theorized to have been created following a great explosion , and it was further theorized that its center might still be creating new matter .
This theory was proved correct with the finding of the creation point in 2269 .
The core was surrounded by the Great Barrier , containing a planet thought to be Sha Ka Ree by Sybok .
( TAS : " The Magicks of Megas - Tu " ; Star Trek V : The Final Frontier )
The rim of the Milky Way 's disc was surrounded by a massive energy field of negative energy called the galactic barrier , which makes travel into and out of the galaxy difficult .
( TOS : " Where No Man Has Gone Before " , " By Any Other Name " )
By 2369 , the extragalactic space was being charted by starships .
( TNG : " Aquiel " )
In the science of stellar cartography , the Milky Way was divided into four major areas called quadrants : Alpha , Beta , Gamma , and Delta ( the first four letters of the Greek alphabet ) , each of which composed one - quarter of the galaxy .
Each quadrant was divided into thousands of sectors .
The Galactic Core was the intersection of all four quadrants .
( TNG : " The Price " ; Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country ; VOY : " Pathfinder " )
In the mid-22nd century , scientists estimated that one out of every 43,000 planets in the galaxy supported intelligent lifeforms .
( ENT : " Fight or Flight " )
Thus , in the galaxy there were millions of planets that could support intelligent life .
( TOS : " Metamorphosis " )
According to Dr. Leonard McCoy , there was a mathematical probability of three million Earth - type planets in the galaxy .
( TOS : " Balance of Terror " )
History
In the 12th century , the Sphere - Builders built a network of spheres in the Milky Way , which created trans - dimensional disturbances as a prelude to invading the Milky Way .
( ENT : " Chosen Realm " , " Azati Prime " )
By 2267 , there were Humans on a thousand planets in the galaxy .
( TOS : " Metamorphosis " ) Between 2064 and 2364 , Humans had charted 11 % of the galaxy .
( TNG : " Where No One Has Gone Before " )
Within a year , the Federation had charted an additional 8 % of the galaxy .
( TNG : " The Dauphin " )
By 2268 , research expeditions of the Federation had catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets suitable for colonization .
( TOS : " By Any Other Name " )
An expedition sent by the Kelvan Empire , from the radiation - imperiled Andromeda Galaxy , scouted the Milky Way for possible invasion in 2268 .
( TOS : " By Any Other Name " )
In a potential alternate timeline , by the 26th century the Sphere - Builders had transformed 50,000 light - years of space in the Milky Way , wiping out thousands of planets , before finally being defeated and expelled from the galaxy by the Federation at the Battle of Procyon V. ( ENT : " Azati Prime " )
In a possible 3186 experienced by Gabrielle Burnham , she found every world in the galaxy rendered lifeless by Control .
She noted that this represented the loss of tens of trillions of lives .

Ban : IAEA to make its own assessment on nuclear issue

Hilary Leila Krieger and E.B. Solomont contributed to this report .
Turkey 's prime minister isseeking international support for a deal under which Iran would ship much of its low - enriched uranium to Turkey .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's office said Saturday he had written to the leaders of26 countries saying the deal would resolve the nuclear standoff with Iran by way ofdiplomacy and negotiation .
The countries included all permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council .
Iran will submit an official letter to the IAEA on Monday morning conveying its acceptance of the uranium enrichment deal brokered by Turkey and Iran , state - run news agency IRNA reported on Friday , citing a statement by the country 's National Security Council .
“ Following the joint declaration by Iran , Turkey and Brazil , permanent representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the IAEA officially announced its readiness to submit our country ’s letter to the IAEA Chief per paragraph six of the Teheran Declaration , " the statement reportedly read .
Also on Friday , IRNA quoted a top Iranian cleric as saying that the deal was a " powerful response " that " put the ball in the West 's court . "
He reportedly stated that far from being a ploy meant to facilitate enrichment for military use , the deal should be seen as a confidence - building measure .
Meanwhile in Turkey , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon expressed hope that the deal reached last week would " open the door to a negotiated settlement " between Iran and Western nations , according to a Reuters report .
Ban reportedly called the enrichment agreement " an important initiative in resolving international tensions over Iran 's nuclear program by peaceful means . "
He went on to praise Turkey 's role and cooperation with Brazil in negotiating the deal , stressing that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) would have to make its own assessment concerning the issue at hand .
The deal – signed with Turkey and Brazil on Monday – would see Iran shipping its low - enriched uranium for further enrichment in Turkey , to be returned as fuel rods that could not be used for a nuclear weapons program without first being reprocessed .
While the new arrangement would see a similar amount of uranium shipped abroad as in a deal proposed in October by the P5+1 , Iran has since produced sufficient additional low - enriched material to leave it with enough to make such a weapon even if it sends the originally agreed on amount abroad .
In addition , Iran has signaled it intends to keep enriching uranium to a higher level in the meantime .
By now you may have heard about a controversial immigration law passed in Arizona that makes it a crime under state law to be in the country illegally .
The law grants police the power to stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being illegal .
The measure was criticized Friday by President Barack Obama , who asked the Justice Department to research the law .

What happens to health during an economic recession ?
The question surely is a no-brainier .
Wages drift down , unemployment goes up .
Those who have lost jobs become depressed ; those who have n’t grow fearful and anxious that they may .
The outcome for many is stress if not deprivation .
Health , it ’s clear , will suffer ; the death rate is bound to rise .
Right ?
Wrong – at least if the experience of history , and one bit of history in particular , is anything to go by .
Few economic downturns have been as dramatic and as deep as the Great Depression that overtook America during the 1930s .
But figures from that time show that mortality fell and life expectancy increased .
The data suggest that economic hardship is good for health .
Can this be true ?
Links between bodily and economic well - being are far from straightforward .
In the related area of socioeconomic inequality we ’ve already become aware of unexpected influences through the work of Professor Richard Wilkinson of the University of Nottingham .
In his 2009 book The Spirit Level , co-authored with Kate Pickett , he summarised a raft of research all pointing in more or less the same direction .
In countries where there is a big earnings gap between rich and poor , life expectancy is lower while mental illness , obesity and drug and alcohol abuse are all more common .
The real surprise is that it ’s not only the poor who suffer .
The population as a whole do less well if the gap is wider .
The nations with the smallest wealth gap and the lowest incidence of health and social problems are the Japanese and the Scandinavians .
The countries with , respectively , the greatest and highest are America , Portugal and Britain .
The biological explanation for this is uncertain , but possibly mediated by the hormonal effects of perpetual anxiety about status and position , or loss of them .
Economics affects health but not always as you might expect .
Dr Jose Tapia Granados is a researcher with a particular interest in the Great Depression .
A doctor by training , he moved into economics and works at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan .
During the Depression , from mid 1929 through to 1933 , he says , life expectancy at birth rose from 57.1 to 63.3 years ; mortality fell .
The pattern was much the same for men and women , and blacks and whites .
Years of recession are followed by years of recovery in which GDP returns to what it was and then grows .
Between 1934 and 1936 the US economy boomed – but mortality rose and life expectancy fell .
In 1938 , there was another recession and another reversal of the trends .
The pattern lasts throughout economic ups and downs from the start of the 1920s to the end of the 1940s .
Deaths from TB and cardiovascular disease tended to fall in bad years , but peaked in economic expansions .
This apparently perverse relationship between changes in economic activity and changes in mortality was first seen as far back as the 1920s – to the bewilderment of those who ’d noticed it .
“ They were so puzzled they felt they must be doing something wrong with the numbers , ” says Dr Tapia Granados .
More work in the 1970s fostered the suggestion that although the figures were right they reflected a lag between the downturns and the emergence of their damaging effects .
Although the effects might appear during the recovery phase , it was said , they were not caused by it .
Dr Tapia Granados does n’t accept this explanation , saying that for this to be credible , he says , business cycles would have to be regular and of equal length .
So what is going on ?
There is evidence that in periods of economic expansion people smoke and drink more , sleep less , work longer , experience more stress , and suffer more industrial injures – all bad for health .
And what of the period of economic contraction ?
It ’s a mirror image , he says , in which most of these influences are reversed .
An enforced switch to part - time working , for example .
“ To work many hours per day increases risk of heart attack .
Fewer hours decreases risk .
During recessions road traffic deaths decrease and during expansion they increase . ”
Hence the counterintuitive outcome ; recovery from recession , not the recession itself , does harm .
Critics point to a contradiction between this and the link between rising GDP and improving health .
Dr Tapia Granados acknowledges this , but denies a contradiction , saying : “ I ’m talking about fluctuations on top of the general trend . ”

Arizona to Obama : We need Predator drones !
Gov. Janice Brewer of Arizona has requested surveillance drones to patrol the border with Mexico .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Unbowed by a raft of boycotts over her immigration policy , Arizona Gov. Janice Brewer has requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico .
Brewer , in a letter to President Obama , asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the " border states " from other parts of the country .
The governor specifically asked for OH - 58 Kiowa helicopters , used by the military for reconnaissance , noting that Arizona currently has only four of them " available for border missions . "
" These helicopters are extremely valuable assets in supporting law enforcement efforts on the ground , " she wrote .
" The number available , though , is inadequate to provide the kind of support needed on the Arizona border . "
The governor said that a fleet of eight to 10 Kiowa helicopters " would enable us to double our border coverage to 2,000 hours per year .
To be effective , these additional aircraft must be equipped for day and night operations . "
Her letter included a map showing the state - by - state allocation of Kiowa helicopters , as well as newer Lakota helicopters .
The governor also requested " wider deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) along our nation 's southern border . "
UAVs are flying , remote - controlled robot drones that are widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There are several different military models that fall under that description , including the Hunter , Predator , Reaper and Global Hawk , but the governor did n't request a particular type .
" I am aware of how effective these assets have become in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom , and it seems UAV operations would be ideal for border security and counter - drug missions , " said the governor .
Her letter was dated May 20 , the day that Mexican President Felipe Calderon met with Obama at the White House , condemned Arizona 's new immigration law before Congress and later attended a state dinner
The new law , which goes into effect in July , requires police to " determine the immigration status " of anyone under " reasonable suspicion " of being an illegal alien .
The most significant detail in this law is that it shifts this responsibility -- normally accorded to federal immigration authorities - to state police .
The governor , who signed the bill into law on April 23 , maintains she is trying to pick up the slack for the federal government in cracking down on illegal immigration , including drug and human trafficking , along the border .
The boycott
But the law 's opponents are concerned that it endorses racial profiling .
Gerry Miller , chief legislative analyst for Los Angeles , said in a May 11 analysis that the Arizona law will " promote racial profiling , discrimination and harassment . "
Obama , during a press conference with Calderon , called the bill a " misdirected expression of frustration . "
The city council of Los Angeles is boycotting doing business with and traveling to the state of Arizona .
Estimates of the economic impact range from $ 10 million to $ 56 million .
But boycotting Arizona is n't so simple .
The Arizona Corporation Commission , which oversees for the state 's electric and water utilities , said the state 's power plants supplies 25 % of Los Angeles .
In response to the boycott , Arizona Corporation Commissioner Gary Pierce offered to pull the plug on the City of Angels -- though he emphasized that this would require renegotiations between the city and the power plants .
Further complicating the matter , Los Angeles is part owner of two of the Arizona power plants .
" I am confident that Arizona 's utilities would be happy to take those electrons off your hands , " wrote Pierce to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
But so far , the power remains on .
Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman noted recently that the Constitution " specifically prohibits economic blockades by a state or city against another . "

These things Stephen Davis cannot banish from his memory from that night of chaos aboard the Deepwater Horizon : the sensation of being flung into a wall by a powerful explosion , the desperate , muddy scramble on a deck lit only by the reflections from a huge pillar of flame ; the look in men's eyes before they jumped 18 metres ( 60 ft ) into the water .
" You could taste the fumes , that godawful taste in your mouth , " he said .
" It was hard to breathe .
The oxygen was being sucked out of the living quarters .
" Then all of a sudden – just boom .
It was the biggest explosion I ever heard in my life . "
Davis was hurled 5 metres into a wall .
" The whole rig was vibrating and shaking , " he said .
" It 's like we walked straight into hell . "
One month on from the 20 April explosion on the offshore drilling rig , the true scale of the environmental and economic destruction wrought by a gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has yet to entirely unfold .
Scientists have yet to establish a firm estimate of how much oil and gas is spewing into the Gulf from the geyser on the ocean floor , or to determine its future course .

Heavy patches of crude reached the marshes of Plaquemines , Louisiana this week and the Obama administration admitted the oil had got caught up in the powerful loop current , where it could reach the coral reefs of the Florida Keys .
Once in the current , the oil could travel as far as Mexico or Cuba , Frank Muller - Karger , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida , told Congress this week .
For Davis , the events of that night , when the rig exploded killing 11 of the 126 crew , was only the beginning of his ordeal .
He says he and other survivors were to spend the next 40 hours in isolation – barred from phoning their families – while his lawyers believe Transocean , the owners of the rig , readied its legal defences .
Seventeen crew members were seriously injured in the incident .
For Barack Obama , whose officials are being held to account for their oversight of offshore drilling in congressional hearings this week , the disaster could be the defining event of his presidency .
For the companies involved in the disaster – BP , the well owner , Transocean , the rig owner , and subcontractors Halliburton and Cameron – that night was only the beginning of what lawyers predict will be one of the longest and most complicated court battles the US has ever seen .
" This will be one of the biggest torts probably in the history of the United States , " said Anthony Buzbee , a Houston lawyer who is representing Davis and nine other survivors who are seeking $ 5.5 m ( £ 3.7 m ) each in damages from Transocean and other firms .
" These cases will be going on for many , many years . "
He said he was preparing litigation against two other firms who supplied equipment to the rig .
The day of 20 April had started like any other for Davis , a 36 - year - old native of San Antonio , Texas .
He spent most of his 12 - hour shift in the centre of the rig , welding the transporter platform for the blowout preventer ( BOP ) .
Investigators see the failure of that safety device , which sits on the ocean floor , as one of the causes of the disaster .
As Davis went off shift , he overheard an engineer say he was going to try to relieve the pressure on the BOP .
Davis ate dinner , phoned his fiancee and son , worked out in the gym and returned to his quarters in the lower level of the rig .
During all that time – about three hours – he heard loud hisses as engineers worked to reduce the pressure building up from the ocean floor .
Later , this would strike him as odd as relieving pressure is usually achieved quickly .
He had been in bed watching TV for about 15 minutes when he heard the first bang .
Initially he thought a crane might have dropped a piece of casing or a boom .
Then the rig started shaking and the lights went out .
He put a lifejacket on over his shorts and T - shirt , grabbed his tennis shoes and ran into the hallway .
Davis has been working on offshore rigs for seven years but had only been on the Deepwater Horizon four days .
He did not know his way around .
" My comfort zone was really small , " he said .
He had made it part way up the stairs towards the lifeboats on the middle deck when the walls caved in .
Davis found another staircase .
On deck , screaming workers were sliding through mud , looking for their designated lifeboats .
The reserves of helicopter fuel and diesel caught fire and exploded .
" People were panicking , " he said .
" They would look at you and just jump into the water .
You could understand why if you looked behind you and saw all these explosions , you would think you were either going to burn up or jump . "
Davis made it to lifeboat No 1 .
It was an 18 metre drop to the water and the lifeboat was overloaded , but the vessel did not capsize and its pilot guided it safely to the rig 's supply vessel , the Damon Bankston .
He watched the Deepwater Horizon burn from there .
" We actually watched the derrick [ a lifting device ] melt from the starboard side of the rig as they airlifted the guys out .
It was horrid , it was overwhelming , it was unbelievable . "
By Davis 's estimate , it took 12 - 15 minutes to get from the rig to the work boat , but it would take another 36 - 40 hours before they were to return to shore – even though there were dozens of boats in the area and Coast Guard helicopters airlifting the most severely injured to hospital .
Some of the men were openly furious , while others , like Davis , were just numb .
He says they were denied access to the onboard satellite phone or radio to call their families .
When the ship finally did move , it did not head for shore directly , stopping at two more rigs to collect and drop off engineers and coast guard crew before arriving at Port Fourchon , Louisiana .
The company was ready for the men then , with portable toilets lined up at the dock for drug tests .
The men were loaded on to buses , given a change of clothing and boxes of sandwiches , and taken to a hotel in Kenner , Louisiana , where finally they were reunited with their families .
Lawyers say the isolation was deliberate and that Transocean was trying to wear the men down so they would sign statements denying that they had been hurt or that they had witnessed the explosion that destroyed the rig .
" These men are told they have to sign these statements or they can't go home , " said Buzbee .
" I think it 's pretty callous , but I 'm not surprised by it . "
Davis had been awake nonstop for about 50 hours by that point .
He signed .
Buzbee says most of the men did .
But that is unlikely to limit the lawsuits against the companies involved in the disaster .
In addition to survivors , Buzbee is representing more than 100 oystermen , fishermen and seafood packers who are seeking economic damages .
" Anyone whose livelihood depends on the water is going to have some sort of damage , " he said .
Dozens of other lawyers are also assembling cases .
For Davis , though , it is still too early to think about his next step .
Will he ever set foot on a rig again ?
He can't say .
" For now , I 'm just numb . "
KAMPALA Ã¢â‚¬â€ UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Monday he was “ shocked ” by a deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla and demanded a full investigation .
“ I am shocked by reports of killings and injuries of people on boats carrying supplies for Gaza , ” the UN chief said at a press conference following the opening in Uganda of a key conference on the International Criminal Court .

“ I condemn this violence , ” Ban added , as an Israeli television channel reported that as many as 19 pro-Palestinian activists may have been killed in the Israeli military raid .
“ It is vital that there is a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place , ” Ban said .
“ I believe Israel must urgently provide a full explanation , ” he added , moments after delivering a speech hailing the “ new age of accountability ” heralded by the creation of the ICC in 2002 .
The Hague - based tribunal , of which Israel is not a member , is the world ’s first permanent court mandated to bring perpetrators of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide to justice .
The UN chief said that a detailed account of the incident was needed before the international community could coordinate its response .

“ I ’m sure that there will be enough time for the international community to assess the proper response including through the United Nations , ” he explained .
“ Right now , what is absolutely vital is that we first have a full account of the incident , what had happened , and Israel must provide the full explanation on this .
“ For any further course of action I will have to discuss with member states of the United Nations Security Council or other concerned parties , ” Ban said .

“ I understand that the league of Arab states may be meeting in an urgent session so we will actively coordinate with concerned parties , ” he added .
Speaking from Doha , Arab League chief Amr Mussa slammed the deadly Israeli raid as a “ crime ” and warned it had thrown into doubt the latest US - backed Middle East peace efforts .
“ There ’s no impending free agency , no gripes about anything , no indictments coming , no investigations , ” said Larry Baer , the team president .
“ We can ask for unconditional love of these players , and it goes both ways . ”
Lincecum will face the Mets on Sunday , when he will probably build on his runaway major league lead in strikeouts .
He has 56 in 42 1/3 innings , including 13 on Tuesday against the Marlins .
Lincecum is 4 - 0 with a 1.70 earned run average , a fast follow - up to an exhibition season that began with Ken Griffey Jr. barging into the Giants ’ clubhouse , just to shake Lincecum ’s hand .
“ Wow , ” Lincecum said , staring up at reporters .
“ He just came over here . ”
Griffey , the best player on the Mariners while Lincecum grew up near Seattle , simply wanted to say hi .
As much as Lincecum ’s awards , the visit from Griffey confirmed how different things are for him now .
“ That was definitely a surreal kind of situation for me , because it was always kind of the other way around prior to that , ” Lincecum said Wednesday .
“ I kind of wanted to be doing what every major league baseball player was doing , being here .
I would n’t say we ’ve changed places , because the train just moved along .
The next generation comes in , and you get to meet a lot of fans and kids who are in your similar situation . ”
Lincecum has an undeniable appeal to that next generation .
Last year , he starred in a clever video - game commercial with a computerized version of himself .
This spring , he is featured prominently in ads for Major League Baseball and for ESPN ’s “ SportsCenter . ”
He stands out partly because of his incongruous look .
Outfielder Mark DeRosa , who signed with the Giants last winter , said he never knew Lincecum was so athletic until he saw him ace the team ’s agility testing — standing broad jump , vertical leap — in spring training .
DeRosa already knew how that translated to the mound .
The co-writer of The Dark Knight has been officially confirmed as a scribe for the next Superman movie .
It looks like Warner really wants to make its next Superman movie a success on par with The Dark Knight , and is using top talent from the Batman reboot to do so .
After bringing on Dark Knight director Christoper Nolan as a guiding light , Warner Bros. has now also hired David S. Goyer , co-writer on The Dark Knight , to pen Superman 's next theatrical tale .
The movie 's current title is planned to be The Man of Steel .
It wo n't be an origin story , which is a good thing , because everybody across all dimensions , even those without Superman in them , already knows the origin of the world 's greatest hero .
Thomas Tull , head of Legendary Pictures , allegedly went straight to Goyer , who pitched a storyline that would bring Superman back to when John Byrne revamped him in 1986 with The Man of Steel comic miniseries .
Goyer 's modern sort of narrative , where The Daily Planet is struggling due to the internet , includes major villains Lex Luthor and Brainiac doing something evil - ish in Metropolis .
It also supposedly sets up a " huge Kryptonian mythology . "
Superman Returns star Brandon Routh will not ... return , nor is the film 's director Bryan Singer likely to work on The Man of Steel .
And no , Nicolas Cage is n't going to star in it either .

His routines featured elocutive but often short , sometimes one - line , observational comedy , mixed with absurd and paraprosdokian elements as well as non sequiturs .
Hedberg ’s unique comedy and gentle on - stage persona gained him a cult following .
Quotes From Mitch Hedberg
I used to do drugs .
I still do , but I used to , too .
You know , I ’m sick of following my dreams , man .
I ’m just going to ask where they ’re going and hook up with ’em later .
I had a small scene in a movie with Peter Frampton .
And we had to smoke pot for our scene – but it was fake pot !
Do not buy pot on a movie set .
But I got to smoke fake pot with Peter Frampton , that ’s a cool story .
It ’s as cool as smoking real pot with a guy who looks like Peter Frampton …
I ’ve done that way more .
I bought a seven - dollar pen because I always lose pens , and I got sick of not caring .
See , this CD is in stores .
The only way I could get my last CD into a store was to take one in there and leave it .
“ Sir , you forgot this ! ” “ No , I did not .
That is for sale .
Please alphabetize it . ”
Some people think I ’m high on stage ; I would never get high before a show , because , when I ’m high , I do n’t wanna stand in front of a bunch of people I do n’t know .
That does not sound comfortable .
Like , when you ’re high , and a joke does n’t work , it ’s extra scary .
It ’s like , “ Whoa , what the hell happened there ?
I am retreating within myself .
Why have all these people gathered ?
And why am I elevated ?
Why am I not facing the same way as everyone else ?
And what is this electric stick in my hand ? ”

​ When I was on acid , I would see things like beams of light … and I would hear sounds that sounded an awful lot like car horns .
I order the club sandwich all the time , but I ’m not even a member , man .
I do n’t know how I get away with it .
I sit at my hotel at night , I think of something that ’s funny , then I go get a pen and I write it down .
Or if the pen ’s too far away , I have to convince myself that what I thought of ai n’t funny .
My manager was concerned , he said “ Mitch , do n’t use liquor as a crutch . ” I ca n’t use liquor as a crutch … because a crutch helps me walk .
Liquor severely screws up the way I walk .
It ai n’t like a crutch , it ’s like a step I did n’t see .
Is a hippopotomus really a hippopotomus or just a really cool opotomus ?
I love my FedEx guy cause he ’s a drug dealer and he does n’t even know it … and he ’s always on time .
​ I had a neighbor , and whenever he would knock on my wall I knew he wanted me to turn my music down , and that made me angry because I like loud music , so when he knocked on the wall I ’d mess with his head .
I ’d say : “ Go around !
I can not open the wall .
I do n’t know if you have a doorknob on the other side , but over here there ’s nothing .
It ’s just flat . ”
I do n’t have a girlfriend .
I just know a girl who would get really mad if she heard me say that .
Because of acid , I now know that butter is way better than margarine .
I saw through the bullshit .
I went camping once , and got into an argument with a girlfriend in the tent .
This is a really bad place to get in an argument , because I walked out and attempted to “ slam the flap . ”
How are you supposed to express your anger in this type of situation ?
Zipper it up really quick ?
* Zipper Noise * !
Fuck you .
I find a duck ’s opinion of me is very much influenced by whether or not I have bread .

Eddie ’s first comment was “ Man , this guy ’s a survivor ! ”
I hope the next time I move I get a real easy phone number , something that ’s real easy to remember .
Something like two two two two two two two two .
I would say “ Sweet . ”
And then people would say , “ Mitch , how do I get a hold of you ? ” I ’d say , “ Just press two for a while .
And when I answer , you will know you have pressed two enough . ”
People used to think I was high on stage , because people associate long hair with drug use .
I wish long hair was associated with something other than drug use .
Like an extreme longing for cake .
Then strangers would see a long haired guy and say , “ That guy eats cake .
He is on bunt cake . ”
Mothers would say to their daughters , “ Do n’t bring the cake eater over here anymore !
He smells like flour .
Did you see how excited he got when he heard your birthday was fast approaching ? ”

​ Last time I called shot gun we had rented a limo , so I fucked up …
My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen banana , I said “ No , but I want a regular banana later , so … yeah . ”
My friend said to me , “ I think the weather ’s trippy . ” I said , “ No , man , it ’s not the weather that ’s trippy , perhaps it is the way that we perceive it that is indeed trippy . ”
Then I thought , “ Man , I should have just said , ‘ Yeah . ’ “ I ’m against picketing , but I do n’t know how to show it .
Sometimes I wave to people I do n’t know .
It ’s very dangerous to wave to someone you do n’t know because , what if they do n’t have a hand ?
They ’ll think you ’re cocky .
“ Look what I got motherfucker !
This thing is useful .
I ’m gonna go pick something up ! ”
I like baked potatoes , man .
I do n’t have a microwave oven .
It takes forever to cook a baked potato in a conventional oven .
Sometimes I ’ll just throw one in there , even if I do n’t want one .
By the time it ’s done , who knows .

“ He could do a lot of good things quickly ”

In another display of cult like Obama worship , comedian and film director Woody Allen has suggested that it would be good for America if president Obama were allowed to do away with freedom , and presumably the Constitution , and rule with an iron fist .
In an interview published by Spanish language newspaper La Vanguardia , Allen is quoted as saying “ I am pleased with Obama .
I think he ’s brilliant .
The Republican Party should get out of his way and stop trying to hurt him . ”
The director of Annie Hall and Manhattan also said “ it would be good … if he could be a dictator for a few years because he could do a lot of good things quickly . ”
That ’s generally what dictators do Woody , as a prominent Jewish figure one would have thought you ’d have thought through such comments before blurting them out .
Allen ’s comments recall the disturbing drivel we were forced to endure when Obama entered office , as celebrities pledged their “ service ” to the president and vowed to “ be a servant ” , while encouraging their mind washed fans to do the same .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
With Obama installed as dictator presumably he would never be picked up on actions such as those witnessed yesterday when he signed the Press Freedom Act and then promptly refused to answer any questions from the press .
A free press is , of course , the enemy of a dictator .
“ Recall that last Friday the president refused to take any questions after delivering his angry statement on the oil spill in the Rose Garden .
And he has not held a prime - time White House news conference in many months , despite much pleading from pundits and members of the media , ” reports CBS News ’ Chip Reid .
Presumably under a Woody Allen imagined Obama dictatorship , the president ’s recent statement “ The practice of listening to opposing views , is essential for effective citizenship ” would no longer apply and we ’d just be forced to listen to Obama ’s views and abide by his
With Cass Sunstein at his side ready to tax or outright ban theorizing and opinion forming , and Supreme Court Nominee Elena Kagan ready to “ disappear ” free speech and ban books , Obama certainly could do a lot of these things quickly .
Unfortunately , Allen ’s comments do n’t seem so ridiculous when one considers Obama ’s extensive use of , and stated intention to continue using , presidential executive orders and directives to effectively rule by decree .
Essentially , Woody Allen is getting what he ’s asking for .

Comment on this article
In a groundbreaking article T. L. Freeman discusses the relationship between actual age and effective age .
His conclusion is that the passing of the years goes faster as we grow older .
This makes sense ; for instance when you are 10 years of age , a year represents 10 % of your life , and seems like a very long time .
However , when you are 50 years old , one year has reduced to only 2 % of your life , and hence seems only one - fifth as long .
Summarizing this work , Freeman comes to the conclusion that the actual age ( AA ) needs to be corrected for the apparent length of a year ( AY ) .
The apparent length of a year is inversely proportional to one person 's actual age :
AY= α /AA
The constant of proportionality α is rather loosely defined by Freeman as the age at which a year really seems to last a year , and it was arbitrarily set at 20 years ( α =20 ) .
Now Freeman determines the concept of Effective age , which is simply the integral over time of the Apparent Year from age 1 to the actual age ( AA ) of interest :
AA AA EA = ∫ AY d( AA ) = ∫ 20 / AA d( AA ) = 20 ln( AA ) 1 1
Although this formula results in some interesting conclusions , there are several flaws with this concept .
As mentioned above , the choice of the proportionality constant is rather arbitrary .
There is no rational justification for the choice of this age , but it was solely chosen based on Freeman 's own perception of ( the passing of ) time .
Next , the evaluation of the integral seems incorrect , since its lower limit was set at 1 , and not at 0 .
Obviously , the choice of zero as lower integration boundary yields can not be evaluated due to the logarithmic term in the expression .
Because of the obvious problems with Freeman 's concept of time perception , it is necessary to redefine the Effective Age on a sounder basis .
In the traditional concept of time perception , one person 's Actual Age is proportional to the passing of time ( t ) .
AA = β t + γ
Note the occurrence of two parameters β and γ that are traditionally set to one and zero , respectively .
However , each has a clear ( though usually underappreciated ) function in time perception .
The β - parameter describes the rate at which one person ages ; some persons remain annoying little crybabies during their life , while others become boring old farts at 20 .
The γ - parameter describes the origin of one person 's time perception .
Did you ever meet those proud parents boasting about their little one who is only x months old , and already walks , writes obfuscated C , or recently sold his first dot.com ?
No , these youngsters are n't bright for their age ; they simply have a high γ - factor .
It is clear that with this definition , one person 's Actual Age may already be non-synchronous with time .
However , analogous to Freeman 's work , the apparent length of a year ( AY ) is not constant :
AY= α / AA = α /( β t + γ )
δ
ε
AY= α /( β t + γ ) = ( α / β ) /( t + γ / β ) = δ /(t + ε )
δ
ε
We can remove one of the parameters by defining two parametersand
The actual values ofandwill become clear from the boundary conditions
In order to obtain the Effective Age , the integral of AY is evaluated .
Note that the integral is evaluated over time , and not over Actual Age , since AA is a function of time :
t t EA = ∫ AY d(t ) = ∫ δ /(t + ε ) d(t ) 0 0 EA = δ ln(t + ε ) - δ ln( ε )
ε
The lower boundary condition ( t=0 ) should yield an Effective Age of zero years ( EA=0 ) .
Therefore= 1 .
The upper boundary is less apparent .
It should be chosen so that at t=t max , EA = t .
At death , the Effective Age and real time are again equal .
However , no person knows for sure his or her personal life expectancy .
This is clearly an issue for molecular biologists to address .
However , if we assume for a person a life expectancy of 80 years ( t=80 , EA=80 ) , we obtain :
δ = 80 / ln( 81 ) 80 ln(t +
1 ) EA = ---------- ln( 81 )
time ( yrs. ) EA ( yrs . ) Life % 0 0.0 0 1 12.6 16 2 20.0 25 3 25.2 32 4 29.3 37 5 32.6 41 10 43.7 55 15 50.5 63 20 55.4 69 30 62.5 78 40 67.6 85 50 71.6 89 60 74.8 94 70 77.6 97 80 80.0 100
This formula can now be used to calculate the Effective Age ( and the Effective percentage Completion of Life ) as a function of time .
This is shown in the following table :
And thus , the bold statement in the title is justified .
Life is half over at age ten , and three quarters over at age thirty .
Note the rapid increase at very young ages : in the initial stages of life , life itself makes big strides forward .
For instance , consider the concepts of speech , eating and walking ; skills that are learned at a young age and are carried on throughout a person 's life .
Another interesting observation that we can make is the age at which one year really seems to last one year .
This can be calculated quite easily from the derivation above .
For a life expectancy of 80 years , it is equal to 80 / ln( 81 ) - 1 = 17.2 years .
Quite close to Freeman 's original assumption of 20 years .
Consequences :
" Summer vacations lasted almost forever when I was in grammar school " :
True , they did .
In fact , when you were six years old , an Apparent Year would be close to three years .
That would make a three week summer vacation feel like almost nine weeks !

Pallbearers carry the casket of actor Corey Haim from a memorial chapel in Toronto March 16 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Mike Cassese
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Actor Corey
Haim died of pneumonia and heart problems , and tests during an autopsy on his body found “ no significant contributing factors ” from drugs , the Los Angeles coroner ’s office said on Tuesday .
Haim , a Canadian - born teen film star of the 1980s who had spoken openly about struggles with drug and alcohol addiction , collapsed at his Los Angeles apartment and died in a nearby hospital on March 10 .
He was 38 .
Officials initially thought his death was due to a drug overdose .
California law enforcement officials said he bought more than 550 doses of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the weeks before his death in what they linked to a big , illegal prescription drug ring .
But the coroner ’s office said on Tuesday that Haim died of natural causes from a combination of pneumonia , respiratory and heart problems .
Ed Winter of the coroner ’s office said that Haim ’s mother found her son in distress in the middle of the night and he collapsed with flu - like symptoms .
He was pronounced dead in the hospital less than an hour later .
Haim was best known for his work on the 1980s movies such as “ Lucas ” and “ The Lost Boys ” .
He also worked with fellow teen star Corey Feldman on the U.S. television reality series “ The Two Coreys ” in 2007 and 2008 .

With the existence of feathered dinosaurs now being well established , a couple of researchers have moved on to learning more about how the feathers grew during the dinosaurs ' lifetimes .
By looking at samples of older and younger oviraptosaurs , they 've noticed that that , unlike modern birds that grow normal feathers once their downy feathers molt away , the oviraptosaurs seem to have gone through multiple stages of feather development .
The work is based on two specimens — one oviraptosaur that had died and been fossilized in its youth , and another that had matured and lived longer .
Both of the fossils had evidence of feathers on different areas of their body , but were nowhere near as fully feathered as creatures like the archaeopteryx .
Both specimens had wing - like feathers on their front legs , with downier feathers along their back and hips .
The older specimen had larger , wing - type feathers on both the outermost and middle sections of its arms , while the younger one had the ribbon - like feathers on its middle arm section .
The older dinosaur also had downy feathers along most of its spine and on its head .
The biggest difference , though , was an unusual type of feather found on the younger oviraptosaur that were thin and ribbon - like with tips that were tufted with normal feather growth .
There were no feathers like this on the older oviraptosaur , suggesting that the tufted - tip feather was a developmentally intermediate stage of feather growth — individual dinosaurs first grew downy feathers , then thin , tufted - tip feathers , then full ones .
By contrast , modern birds start growing full feathers as their down falls off .
Of course , these feather observations are drawn from only two oviraptosaurs , so it 's possible that the tufted feathers are an anomaly , or a possibly the result of a poorly preserved specimen .
Still , any related specimen should help our understanding of the role played by the earliest feathers .

A mum discovered clutching the hand of her dead autistic son has been accused of murdering the 11 - year - old .
Yvonne Freaney , 48 , appeared in court yesterday charged with killing wheelchair - bound Glen and was remanded in custody .
Police had launched a desperate hunt to find the mother after relatives raised the alarm .
Minutes later officers arrived at the Sky Plaza Hotel near Cardiff Airport , where they found Freaney sitting with his body , holding his hand .
Mother and son had left home at the weekend to book into the three - star hotel in Rhoose , Vale of Glamorgan , less than 10 miles away from their Penarth house .
It is understood Glen had suffered from severe autism , could not talk and needed a computerised voice system to communicate .
A fellow guest , who booked in at the hotel after her flight was grounded by volcanic ash , said : " When we arrived there were police were everywhere .
" It was n't until later that we were told a young boy had been found murdered in one of the rooms .
It is so tragic . "
Police believe the youngster died on Thursday or Friday and his mother had stayed with him in the room until they were found on Saturday .
Det Chief Inspector Richard Jones said : " This is a tragic murder of a young boy . "
Rhys Jenkins , 23 , whose farm is opposite , said : " I was working in the fields when I saw four ambulances race to the hotel .
The road was filled with police going back all of Sunday . "
Neighbours told how Yvonne was a " loving and devoted mother " to Glen .
Schoolfriend Sue Whingren , 47 , said : " She is just a really nice lady who was always a good laugh and a loving mother .
" We used to talk about our kids sometimes and we all have a moan occasionally but nothing more than usual .
" Glen was severely autistic but all her kids have always been well - cared for . "
Neighbour Kathleen Price said : " It is a terrible tragedy . "
Glen was the youngest of her three children with husband , former RAF officer Mark .
He was being comforted by family yesterday .
Freaney will appear at Cardiff court again today .
The White House and leading lawmakers came to an agreement Monday about how to end the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military , likely speeding the end of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
Backers were optimistic that they could this week attach the amendment to a broader defense funding bill expected to pass this year .
The bill would n't immediately repeal the Clinton - era policy .
Rather , it would take effect as soon as a Pentagon review is complete and the president signs off on the military 's recommendations ...

Disgraced former Congressman Eric Massa , of the infamous Glenn Beck interview , is back again with a new charge that Dick Cheney is engaged in treasonous activity by hatching a conspiracy to get Gen.
David Petraeus elected president in 2012 as a Republican .
Massa told Esquire , “ we would be witness to an American coup d’état . ”
Petraeus denies it , and Cheney is not talking .
The story according to Massa as printed in Esquire goes like this , “ Four retired generals , he said — “ three four - stars and one three - star ” — had picked up disturbing reports that Petraeus , the commander of United States Central Command , whose portfolio contains the worst trouble spots on the globe , including Iraq and Afghanistan , had recently met with Cheney — twice — and Cheney was trying to recruit him to run in 2012 .
Were he to be the nominee , Massa said , Petraeus would be in the unprecedented position of a military man running for president against his own commander in chief . ”
Massa continued , “ We have to see this for what it is .
There is a reason that we have in this country civilian leadership of the military .
It is , among other things , to avoid something like this .
Because in order to succeed electorally , General Petraeus must fail militarily .
You understand ?
In order to succeed electorally , he must fail in his mission .
Were he to run and win — and if he were to run , he would win in a landslide — we would be witness to an American coup d’état .
It is the functional equivalent of the political overthrow of the commander in chief . ”

Massa accused Cheney of plotting a coup against the US government , “ I know something about the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
And I want you to tell me how this is not a coup .
You ’ve got a commander with armies in the field , and he ’s plotting with Dick Cheney to bring down his commander in chief .
How is that not a coup ?
It ’s Seven Days in May ! ”
A Petraeus spokesman told Politico that there is no truth to Massa ’s claim , “ Gen. Petraeus has not met with former VP Cheney to discuss a possible 2012 presidential nomination .
Nor has he exchanged anything other than pleasantries with the former VP in their one or two chance encounters since VP Cheney left office .
Gen .
Petraeus has stated on the record numerous times that he has no interest in , nor intention of , running for political office . ”
Even when you consider Dick Cheney ’s involvement , this is a pretty fantastic allegation .
Massa assumes that Petraeus would want to run for president in 2012 , that what Cheney is doing is plotting the overthrow of the United States government , and most importantly if Petraeus ran , he would defeat Obama .
I happen to think that a potential Petraeus candidacy would play out similarly to that of Wesley Clark ’s failed presidential bid .
In the modern era , military persons often lack the media and political skill sets to be formidable candidates .
The days of direct military service being a direct path to the presidency ended with the Ike .
Massa also does n’t take into account that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan remain unpopular , and that it is the economy , not national security , which is dominating the minds of electorate .
Choosing a candidate who is directly involved in war would be popular with Republicans , but not the electorate at large .
Selecting a candidate with no experience at all in politics would be the fast track to being blown out by Obama in 2012 .
Determining what if anything to believe in Massa ’s claims is tricky , because Massa is crazy , but Cheney is evil .
Dick Cheney tried to circumvent the constitution by declaring himself a separate branch of government .
The former vice president is someone who views the law as an optional guideline , but Massa is insane , so I think the part about Cheney trying to recruit Petraeus to run makes sense , because he does n’t care for Palin or Romney , but the coup part strikes me as a fantasy .
Then again , it can be argued that Cheney ’s time as vice president was littered with treasonous acts , so I would n’t put it past him , but the 2012 part of this makes no sense at all .
Mark Hamill , star of the original Star Wars , has become a founding board member of Berkeley Square Films .
Berkeley Square is about to go out to the market and raise money through an investor share offer .
Nobody from BSF was available to tell me how much it wants to raise , nor how the company plans to go about it .
Which is pretty odd given it ’s the day they ’ve put out a press release .
Daniel Figuero , one of Berkeley Square ’s directors , is one name I do recognise though .
Figuero was involved in several low - budget British films in the 90s including An Ideal Husband and The Scarlet Tunic that raised money through the Enterprise Investment Scheme .
So I guess that ’s what Berkeley Square will be trying to do too .
The company plans to make movies budgeted up to $ 7 million .
William Morris Endeavor agent Graham Taylor will be packaging BSF projects .
As to what these projects are , all will be revealed during the Cannes Film Festival apparently – although there ’s been chatter that one will be an adaptation of Hamill ’s own comic book creation , The Black Pearl .
BSF is also planning to launch its own sales agency , which will handle other people ’s projects too .
The idea is that the creatives will be based in Los Angeles , with London handling the financial side .
Other board members include Paul Tamasy , a Los Angeles - based multi-hyphenate who created the Air Bud franchise for Disney ; Stephen Metcalfe , former co-head of equity capital markets for Asia Pacific at investment bank Nomura International ; Justin Howard , ex co-manager of equity fund Charterhouse Investments ( Hong Kong ) ; and business entrepreneur John Tibbs .
Let ’s hope the Force is with them .
The mould - breaking Rahmani 30 school has a record of success
By Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News , Patna
In a congested part of Patna , capital of India 's Bihar state , stands a striking yellow building - a 100 - year - old mansion that has clearly seen better days .
Inside it , in a small dark room , a young bearded cleric is reading out sermons from the Muslim holy scriptures to a group of boys seated cross-legged on the floor .
They are in their late teens , some are wearing skull caps and they all listen to him with rapt attention .
At first glance , this could be any of the region 's hundreds of Islamic seminaries or madrassas , where young Muslims receive religious instruction .
But this is no ordinary seminary .
After prayers , the boys head out to a classroom , pen and notebook in hand , where they listen with equal attention to a lecture on advanced mathematics .
This is the unusual setting for Rahmani 30 - a training institute which prepares talented but underprivileged young Muslims for entry into India 's best engineering colleges - the Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) .
Only the top 2 % make it through the stiff entrance exam .
Getting ahead India 's large Muslim minority is consistently placed at the bottom of social and economic rankings .
I wanted to make something of my life , become someone
Irfan Alam , student Part of this has to do with education - most Muslims end up studying in madrassas , which means they have little chance of being employed in the private sector or government .
So the significance of Rahmani 's initiative is not lost on anyone .
It is the brainchild of a senior Bihar police officer , Abhyanand , who takes time off from his day job to teach the boys physics .
Rahmani was inspired by a similar school - the Super 30 , where Abhyanand used to work and which is also aimed at poor children but not Muslims exclusively .
" In our country , any difficult examination is very fearful because a huge number of students take part but only a few get in , " Abhyanand says .
The advantage at Rahmani , he says , is the kind of students they get - mostly from poor backgrounds and determined to get ahead in life .
" They come from a rural background and that is their strength .
They become competitive because , for them , it is a win or lose situation .
" If they do n't make it they do n't stand anywhere [ socially and economically ] . "
Great chance Irfan Alam , 15 , the son of a barber who is preparing for the IIT exam due to be held in 2011 , says it is a great opportunity .
" I wanted to make something of my life , become someone , " he says smiling shyly .
The school 's philosophy is inspired by the ideas of a madrassa " It 's the perfect platform .
The teachers are amazing and the best part is that it 's completely free . "
It is a chance that few others where Irfan comes from will ever get .
His village is a good four hours drive north of Patna , with lush green wheat - fields , narrow dirt tracks and few proper buildings .
Most people here work as farm labour and a large number of the men are barbers by trade .
I meet Irfan 's father , Mohammad Shafiq , outside his modest , two - room hut made of mud and straw .
Now recuperating after an eye operation , he tells me how his son displayed flashes of brilliance as a child and soon outgrew his village school .
So he decided to send him away .
" Nobody studies here .
Most of the teenagers waste their time or start drinking heavily .
" I can't read and write myself and it was always my dream that my son should be educated and not become a barber like his father and grandfather . "
Back at Rahmani the classes are done but the studying continues late into the night .
Irfan sits with three of his friends inside his little dorm room , poring over textbooks and brainstorming .
In another room , one of the teachers uses a webcam to conduct a tutorial with students in another part of Bihar .
Cultural debate
It 's a fascinating mix of the traditional and the modern .
" The basic philosophy of a madrassa is that the boys live , eat and study together .
There is no distinction between rich and poor - everybody is equal , " says Maulana Wali Rahmani , an influential cleric who heads this institute .
" There 's also a culture of open debate .
It 's something I experienced myself while growing up in a madrassa .
So we thought , why not channel these strengths in a whole new direction and see what we can achieve . "
To find out how spectacularly they have succeeded , you need to travel 1,000 km ( 625 miles ) , to the national capital , Delhi .
It is a completely different world in the tree - lined , sprawling IIT campus .
Young men and women stroll into their classrooms , dressed in jeans and T - shirts , back - packs slung over their shoulders .
These are India 's brightest brains , many of whom will go on to work in the country 's top software companies or head to Silicon Valley .
Among them is a shy , earnest young man - Shadman Anwar , part of Rahmani 's inaugural batch of students last year , all 10 of whom made it through to the IITs .
" It 's been a dream come true , being here with all the other students .
And I do n't feel as if I 'm any different , " he says .
His is the kind of confidence that has helped raise expectations at Rahmani , whose administrators now want to establish 10 similar schools over the next couple of years .
India 's Muslim community is often said to have under - achieved , plagued by poverty , low education standards and a conservative outlook .
Now in one of India 's poorest states , a small initiative is trying to break the mould .

Written by L. Hamre
In an age where high - definition visuals dominate the gaming landscape and the onslaught of 3D is just over the horizon , the simple pixel has been surprisingly enduring .
Originally born out of necessity — because games were incapable of rendering more detailed graphics — manipulating pixels has since become an art form in its own right .
So why do many developers , artists , and gamers prefer pixels when more realistic , detailed art styles are available ?
Is it simply a matter of nostalgia , or is there something inherently appealing about pixel art ?
Ars spoke to some of the field 's independent artists and developers to find out .
An army of pixels
" I think it ’s all down to nostalgia .
A lot of the people commissioning this type of art grew up playing 2D games so it ’s in their hearts , a love for pixels , " artist Gary J. Lucken , better known by the pseudonym Army of Trolls , told Ars .
" I also think it ’s more timeless than 3D graphics , 3D seems to get better and better whereas pixel art is much more reliant on the artist : what looks great in pixels now looked great back in the ' 80s arcades , it ’s timeless ...
I also think people love busy , detailed images , especially the isometric cities .
There 's something appealing about the grid - like structure and all the ‘ Where ’s Waldo ’ style detail you can cram into the pixel art . "
Evil Dead RPG mockup by Army of Trolls
Lucken dabbled in pixel art as a child , starting with a Commodore 64 before moving on to the Amiga and Atari ST .
Eventually his hobby became more serious when he met a number of like - minded artists on the Pixelation forums , and he has since created gorgeously detailed pixels for clients like Edge magazine , the BBC , Honda , Disney , and more .
He cites classic arcade games like Bubble Bobble , Tapper , and Donkey Kong as his influences , as well Super Nintendo titles like Secret of Mana .
" I do a lot of isometric cities , but I think ...
I enjoy pixel art more in its purest form , a few colors , simple small sprites , " Lucken explained .
" Even better if they are animated well . "
More than nostalgia
While the nostalgic aspect is clearly a large part of the appeal when it comes to pixel art , developer Adam Saltsman — also known as Adam Atomic and the creator of games like Canabalt and Gravity Hook — believes that there is something else at work as well .
" I wo n't argue that pixels do n't evoke a heartwarming sense of nostalgia , because they totally do , but I do n't think that 's why they 're effective , " Saltsman told Ars .
" Pixel art is the king of communication and abstraction , which are the twin hearts of game art .
My favorite example is fruit powerups from early NES games .
Games were limited to 3 colors and 8x8 or 16x16 icons to try and convey a lot of information , and frequently you'd be confronted with items that were clearly positive and helpful ; not enemies , not traps .
However , you had no idea what they were supposed to be !
" The same thing was true for various enemies : the first sine wave enemies from the Gradius games we always just called ' those hamburger things . '
I love that you can bring some of your own interpretation to a pixel art representation while it simultaneously communicates the purpose of the thing quite clearly . "
A screenshot from Canabalt by Semi Secret Software .
And like Lucken , Saltsman cites his major inspirations as being a combination of both classic arcade games and fellow artists .
" Metal Slug X bears a lot of responsibility here , " he told Ars .
" They had a Neo Geo machine running X just up the street from where I lived in college , and we dumped a fair amount of quarters into that thing .
A lot of pixel artists know and love the Slug , but that had a pretty overwhelming influence over me for a long time .
There 's this Swedish guy , Arne Niklas Jansson , who sometimes goes by Prometheus on the Web , who is n't exactly a pixel artist but who has been a huge influence on me as well .
After that I could just go down the list : Paul Robertson 's animations are second - to - none , and Kenneth Fejer has just about perfected clear , communicative , efficient pixels .
I learned a lot of what I know from the Pixelation forums , which are full of thoughtful , helpful , talented folks :
Helm , Sven , Fool , Nathan DC , Jad , Big Brother , etc. , not to mention the pixelers who were rocking it before my time : Stoven , Henk and so on .
So many amazing , helpful talents out there ! "
Old style , new audience
The appeal of pixel art and simpler , 8 - bit style games was so great for Richard Grillotti and Miles Tilmann that the two decided to form a studio devoted solely to creating those types of experiences : Pixeljam Games .
The studio has released a number of popular browser - based games including Dino Run and Gamma Bros. , as well as titles like Cream Wolf and Turbo Granny , which were licensed for Adultswim.com .
" I began to play around with fullscreen abstract pixel animations in the mid- to late - '90s , once I discovered how fun it was to zoom into any image in Photoshop and see pixels huge and colorful filling the screen , I wanted to explore them some more in an art context , " Grillotti told Ars .
" I began making abstract pixel animations and the name Pixeljam came to mind .
I registered the domain name and displayed them on pixeljam.com ...
Eventually , once Miles and I began to dabble with the idea of making video games in pixel style , it seemed natural to just make pixeljam.com the home for those as well . "
The Birth of Pixel Venus by Richard Grillotti
Surprisingly , Grillotti explained that despite the retro theme that 's prevalent throughout all of Pixeljam 's games , it turns out that they actually appeal to a fairly young audience .
" We know there 's a lot of nostalgia involved in people 's enjoyment of games of this style , but we 've also discovered that young kids really dig it too , " he told Ars .
" That was a surprise .
We thought they'd be like ' Why are these graphics so crappy ? ' but it turns out that they really get into it .
Most of the fans of Dino Run are quite young .
I think it 's in part because the style is somehow inherently cool looking and the 8 - bit sounds are also quite fun to listen to . "
" I think the style definitely has something to it beyond nostalgia , " agreed Tilmann .
" The nostalgia factor helped bring it back into mainstream consciousness , but now that it 's here I think people can see beyond the novelty .
There really is something liberating about being able to represent your game objects with as little information as possible . "
So while nostalgia clearly has something to do with pixel art 's longevity , it 's far from the only contributing factor .
The minimalist approach allows developers to create simpler , easier - to - understand games that are a far cry from the increasingly more complex games that seem to dominate the market .
And as Saltsman explained , the combination of these two factors is largely the reason that pixel art has been so enduring .
" Pixel art is the most communicative and most abstract art form easily available to games , and it comes with bonus nostalgia points . "
Whaling has been banned since 1986 .
And yet the actual number of whales killed each year has been increasing steadily .
Japan , Iceland , Norway and indigenous groups hunted and killed at least 17,000 whales over the last decade .
[ audio clip of minke whale song ]
That 's the song of an Atlantic minke whale — and minkes are often the type of whale in the cross-hairs of Japanese and Scandinavian harpoon ships .
Whale meat is n't confined to those countries ; a sample showed up in a California sushi restaurant in March .
But there ’s an effort to hold back the rising tide of whaling .
A group of countries , including the U.S. , has proposed permitting a limited amount of whaling .
This would allow for the return of the commercial whaling that Ronald Reagan led the charge to ban .
In exchange , whaling countries would accept quotas for the number of whales they could kill .
The proposal will be voted on at the end of June .
Unfortunately , those quotas over the next decade would be exactly the same as the number of whales hunted and killed today for so - called " scientific purposes . "
So the plan might slow the steady creep up in whaling .
But it would n't halt , or even curtail , the current hunt .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
Communities are feeling the sting of tumbling property values as more taxpayers appeal their assessments -- and successfully lower their tax liabilities .
Take the Las Vegas area , an area hard hit by price declines .
More than 6,000 taxpayers -- including both residential and commercial property owners -- filed appeals in Clark County , Nev. , after receiving a notice of value card in December , up from nearly 1,400 appeals received the year before , said Michele Shafe , assistant director for assessment services in Clark County .
Of the 6,000 who filed appeals this time around , more than 4,500 received reductions to their assessed value , she said .
" That 's about a 76 % success rate for all the appeals that were filed , " she said .
Many of the reductions hovered around a 30 % to 40 % range , she said .
That represents a substantial hit for local taxing bodies that have already suffered due to a sharp decrease in sales tax revenue as consumers scale back their spending .
One way government is making up for it : County departments will be required to cut 5 % out of their budgets as fewer funds make their way into government coffers , she said .
And what is happening in Vegas is n't staying in Vegas : Many local governments around the country are experiencing similar revenue declines -- especially those hardest hit by the housing downturn .
" The property tax is the main source of revenue in a lot of these places , " said Chris Hoene , director of policy and research for the National League of Cities .
" So any hit to the property tax means that there will be some cuts in services somewhere . "
Communities are making cuts to libraries , parks and special events , he said .
Many also are instituting hiring freezes in response to lower revenues .
And Hoene said that this is only the first or second year of a three - to four - year cycle of declining revenues for local governments .
In general , many communities are n't raising taxes to combat the shortfalls at least in part due to the political fallout that would come with it , Hoene said .
" The majority are not raising taxes , simply because it's a difficult time to do so , " he said .
Instead , he 's seeing a bigger use of fees , which are " much smaller and more incremental ... and much more politically palatable to the public . "
Why now ?
While some areas reassess property values annually , others do only a portion of homes each year , said Jacqueline Byers , director of research for the National Association of Counties .
So some homeowners may still have assessed values that reflect , say , 2007 values -- and the discrepancy is evident in rapidly declining markets .
" They 're watching the value of their property go down , and their assessment is on a two - or three - year - old value .
That 's why they 're appealing , " Byers said .
" People are waking up to it and trying to save money . "
California 's system is somewhat unlike the rest of the country ; reappraisals for property tax purposes typically occur when properties change owners or when substantial improvements have been made .
But in Los Angeles County , the assessor 's office has done a proactive review of assessed values , based on market trends in the area -- a process that also cuts down on the number of appeals , said assessor Rick Auerbach .
The review of 473,000 homes -- bought between July 1 , 2003 and June 30 , 2008 -- resulted in lower assessments on 334,000 single - family residences and condo units , according to a release from last week .
The new assessed values reflected an average $ 1,400 property tax savings for single - family homes and an average $ 1,100 savings for condo units , the release said .
Yet Auerbach acknowledged that other areas in the state have seen even more of an impact .
" Home values have declined and foreclosures are up , " he said in the release , " but not to the same extent as in some neighboring counties . "
And , he indicated , the relief is temporary : " My staff is ready to act quickly and efficiently in reflecting the inevitable turnaround as it did in processing reduced home values , " he said .
What to do
Think your assessed value needs adjusting ?
Areas have different protocols and timelines for appealing an assessment .
Below are some tips :
There is rightly huge concern and anger in the west at the recent increased homophobia in Africa , in particular Malawi's conviction of a gay couple to 14 years ' hard labour , and Uganda 's proposed new law for the death penalty .
And the campaigning and protests must continue to protect people 's rights .
But at the same time , it 's crucial that there is some understanding of what this is all about if the campaign is to have any chance of making headway .
Anyone who has spent any time in Africa or with Africans will know all too well how toxic this subject has become .
There is consensus among the vast majority of Africans that homosexuality is wrong .
This is one subject on which a group of Africans from a range of backgrounds and countries will largely agree .
In fact , the more articulate opponents of homosexuality are often the most educated , those most exposed to western culture .
In a chaotic , noisy restaurant in Africa a couple of years ago there was an extraordinary conversation , which left me very disturbed .
Several very educated professionals – all of whom I liked immensely and saw as decent , honourable people – insisted that homosexuality was un-African , a decadent western problem and would never be tolerated in Africa .
Or maybe it would in 50 years ' time , was the one concession after several hours of vigorous argument .
What 's more , they insisted they could never work alongside a gay or lesbian colleague .
The discussion left a deep impression because it was clear that something fundamental about what it means to be African – and it is very hard to generalise about 500 million people – was at stake .
I 'm not sure I still quite understand , but here are some starting points .
First western reporting misunderstands the role of religion .
For example , earlier this week , the BBC carried a report from Uganda in which a pastor in Kampala launched a tirade against homosexuality .
But he is not creating that antipathy , he is stewarding it – remember this is one of the most competitive and lucrative career options for upwardly mobile Africans ; homophobia becomes a recruiting tool to build their church membership .
The increasingly vocal homophobia is largely a phenomenon of rapid and chaotic African urbanisation , a response to tumultuous social and economic change in which traditions of family and village life are being strained to breaking point .
Second , combine that with the historically tense complexity of Africa 's relationship with the west : part admiration , part envy , part anger and seething resentment .
Anything that smacks of westerners telling Africans what to do prompts instant bridling ; it evokes a bitter history of colonialisation and exploitation , which still reaps a terrible legacy of unstable states .
The west 's history in Africa is riddled with atrocity and outrage for several centuries .
Central to much of that was the emasculation of African men .
Warriors were defeated , slaughtered in their thousands by superior technology ; they were enslaved and shipped to America ; they were disciplined into wage labour in the mines of southern Africa .
Traditions of hunting and raiding have been curtailed almost everywhere .
Chronic , endemic unemployment defines the majority of African men's lives – farming , on which 80 % of the population depends , has always been a woman 's job .
A crisis of masculinity underlies much of the hysterical rhetoric around homosexuality .
It is the same issue that has inhibited the battle against HIV / Aids .
The prejudice against wearing a condom because it is less manly is evident in many African countries ; it puts millions of women 's lives at risk – as well as men – but despite public information programmes and free condoms it can still prove hard to shift .
There are other issues to consider in the complex background .
Sexuality and reproduction have been clearly severed in the west ; you have sex and then you make an entirely separate decision to have a child .
In most parts of Africa , fertility is intimately bound up with your identity as a woman or man .
You are not truly a man until you have fathered a child ; and the fathering of children is a key expression of your virility .
So the idea of a sexual relationship de-linked from producing children is perceived as " unnatural " .
This is a toxic brew and for gay and lesbian rights activists in Africa I see only a long , thankless slog and much personal danger .
I very much hope I 'm wrong .

Palin cuts spot for Rand Paul
Rand Paul ’s latest ad in the Kentucky GOP Senate primary touts the support of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who is bucking the GOP establishment to weigh in on his behalf .
Paul first received Palin ’s endorsement in February over Secretary of State Trey Grayson , who is viewed as the choice of national Republicans in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen .
Jim Bunning .
But Paul , a tea party movement favorite , has led Grayson in recent public polls and even picked up the surprise endorsement of Bunning last week .
Advertisement
The 30 - second television spot , which began airing in the state ’s major media markets Monday , features a clip of the 2008 vice presidential nominee praising Paul ’s conservatism .
It comes on the heels of Grayson ’s comments last week when he told the Louisville Courier Journal that he did n’t believe the former governor was qualified to be president — a clip that was widely circulated by Paul ’s campaign .
“ He wants limited government .
I respect that , and I ’m proud to support him , ” Palin says in the ad .
GOP presidential nominee John McCain and Palin easily carried Kentucky in 2008 with 57 percent of the vote .
Paul campaign manager David Adams declined to specify the size of the Palin ad buy , but told POLITICO it is only one of a several ads the campaign will cycle through in the weeks leading up to the May 18 primary that prominently feature other Paul backers — including a planned spot featuring Bunning ’s endorsement .
Here 's the Paul ad :
After an extended invite only period spanning across many months , Pianosheets ( PS ) have opened registrations to the public .
PS is a very unique private tracker that indexes content not usually found on your average BitTorrent tracker .
It tracks piano sheet music , tutorials , electronic books & books with audio plus other educational material that will probably be useful for all students of music .
The site has been online for several years ( see our previous post about PS made way back in 2008 ) and has a loyal user base making it one of the more active communities in the BitTorrent scene .
It recently underwent a massive upgrade and is now powered by What .
CD ’s Gazelle codebase .
If you are a musician or if you are a student currently learning / willing to learn music , chances are that you ’ll find PianoSheets a pretty damn useful online resource .
Last time we featured this tracker it only had 1500 active torrents .
This amount has now risen above 6700 .
User base has also been strengthened and there are now over 4500 + active members registered on PS .
For a niche private tracker that has been invite only during most of its lifetime , these statics are pretty good .
Like in most private trackers focusing on a niche category , content is king on PianoSheets .
This tracker has some unique torrents you might not find elsewhere – piano sheet music as well as various books , educational material on a number of other musical instruments such as drums , guitar , harmonica , keyboards , organ , woodwind , etc are available for download .
Magazines , lyrics , full scores , theory books , etc may also be found .
A screenshot capturing part of PianoSheet ’s torrent index and some of its torrent tags can be seen below :
The ‘ Collections ’ section on PianoSheets makes it easier to discover related torrents .
It ’s a powerful usability feature that creates virtual torrent packs – something similar to ‘ Collages ’ found on most Gazelle based sites .
This section is easily accessible from the top toolbar .
Signups for PianoSheets are currently open .
This is the first open signup after several months so do n’t hesitate to make full use of it .
As said above musicians and music students should find this tracker useful .

Education officials in the US state of Texas have adopted new guidelines to the school curriculum , which critics say will politicise teaching .
The changes include teaching that the UN could be a threat to American freedom , and that the Founding Fathers may not have intended a complete separation of church and state .
Critics say the changes are ideological and distort history .
However , proponents argue they are redressing a liberal bias in education .
Analysts say Texas , with five million schoolchildren , wields substantial influence on school curriculums across the US .
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles says publishers of textbooks used nationally often print what Texas wants to teach .
Jefferson out
Students in Texas will now be taught the benefits of US free - market economics and how government taxation can harm economic progress .
They will study how American ideals benefit the world but organisations such as the UN could be a threat to personal freedom .
And Thomas Jefferson has been dropped from a list of enlightenment thinkers in the world - history curriculum , despite being one of the Founding Fathers who is credited with developing the idea that church and state should be separate .
The doctrine has become a cornerstone of US government , but some religious groups and some members of the Texas Education Board disagree , our correspondent says .
The board , which is dominated by Christian conservatives , voted nine - to - five in favour of adopting the new curriculum for both primary and secondary schools .
But during the discussions some of the most controversial ideas were dropped - including a proposal to refer to the slave trade as the " Atlantic triangular trade " .
Opponents of the changes worry that textbooks sold in other states will be written to comply with the new Texas standards , meaning that the alterations could have an impact on curriculums nationwide .
Since the Assassin ’s Creed 2 DRM is now truly broken , I thought it would be nice to “ celebrate ” by giving the game a try .
Susan Arendt said in her review that , “ You ’ll find a lot to love , I promise .
Assassin ’s Creed 2 is the best kind of sequel . ”
Wired calls it , “ The ultimate killer app . ”
Yahtzee did n’t threaten to sodomize the developers or eat their young , which is pretty high praise from him .
In fact , I have n’t found any negative reviews of the game at all .
Of course , all of those reviews were talking about the console versions .
Let ’s see how the PC version holds up .
I have a review copy here and it ’s about time I fired it up and saw what all the fuss was about .
First step is agreeing to the EULA :
Once done , the game connects to Ubisoft , downloads a patch , applies it , restarts itself , and then gives me the EULA again :
So , thanks for that guys .
You know , that was n’t exactly a gripping narrative when I read it two minutes ago .
But whatever .
I agree already .
Yes , you can have my firstborn and all my rights and fair use does n’t exist and you are awesome and the world is just as you say it is .
Okay ?
Now run the damn software .
Oops .
Looks like the launcher itself needs to update … itself .
Once the launcher is re-launched :
Ah . A login screen .
We knew this was coming , did n’t we ?
This single - player game pretends it ’s an MMO in the same way that a car plummeting into a ravine might briefly pretend it ’s an airplane .
I do n’t have an Ubi account .
So , let ’s fill out this paperwork .
Okay .
Name .
Email .
Birthday .
( Really ?
Are you guys going to send me a present ? )
Password .
Done .
Terms of service .
Mostly for the forums and other stuff I ’ll never , ever use .
I hit the “ accept ” button , but secretly I do n’t really accept any of these terms in my heart of hearts .
The software is unable to detect my duplicity .
However :
How annoying .
You know just yesterday I signed up for a Livestream account .
It was able to tell me if my chosen name was taken , live , as I typed it in .
It let me know if the confirmation fields were ok without me needing to hit the “ submit ” button first .
This functionality took place within the context of a webpage .
Fine .
I ’ll try a different name .
Ah !
Did n’t I just agree to this ?
Thanks .
You guys are super .
Okay , enough screwing around .
Let ’s get on the assassin ’s murderbus to stabbytown .
Oh .
Okay .
So now I have to register the game .
Right .
Let me just look up my 19 - digit keycode .
Thankfully I can copy & paste this .
This is one case where digital is superior to having a hardcopy .
It ’s always a pain when they print the key using the “ Dot Matrix Indecipherable ” font in faded ink and you ca n’t tell the ones from the I ’s or the zeroes from the O’s .
When you launch the game , the updater runs for a second and checks for updates .
Then it blinks away and this little window appears with a spinning “ please wait ” symbol .
Then that thing vanishes and the login program shows up .
Then the thing counts down from three and launches the game .
So that ’s an interesting little software contraption they ’ve built .
Snark aside , the game is fine .
I do n’t know that I ’ll do a proper review series of it .
We ’ll see if I have anything novel to say after a few hours with it .
The game is purportedly dynamite on the console , but you should take a look at the shots above and ask yourself if this is how you want to be treated for your $ 50 .
In any case , I just thought I ’d provide a snapshot of how the system “ works ” .
Barack Obama announces plan to open oil exploration off of the East coast of America
Today Barack Obama announced his plan to begin oil exploration off of the East coast of the United States .
It is not all that often that I agree with a position that the president has taken , but this in one of those rare times that I do agree with him– if he is serious about it .
I am not sure that he is really serious about it , but I hope that he is .
Under Barack Obama ’s plan– which is similar to the plan that President Bush put forward– oil exploration would be allowed on the East coast , parts of Florida , and in the Gulf of Mexico near the shores of Florida .
As a candidate for president , Barack Obama assured Florida residents that he would keep the moratorium in place that banned the exploration for oil off of Florida ’s coast .
In June 2008 , then - Sen .
Obama told reporters in Jacksonville , Florida , “ when I ’m president , I intend to keep in place the moratorium here in Florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off Florida ’s coasts .
That ’s how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good . ”
This new proposal is a direct opposite position than the one that he had taken during the campaign and it is one campaign promise that I hope he breaks .
However I have two questions .
The first question that I have is , what is motivating him to break this promise ?
There are three possibilities that I can think of for this change of heart , if indeed he plans to move forward with this proposal .
Reason number one :
He really believes that this is part of a solution to move towards energy independence from the Middle East .
Reason number two :
He understands the damage that he has done in regards to bipartisanship and civility in the underhanded way he and the Democrat leadership passed healthcare reform and he is trying to heal the wounds of this legislation by throwing a bone to the right in an effort to bring the country back together .
Reason Number three ( the reason I believe is the most likely ) :
He is offering to drill off of the coast as a compromise when he decides to push his cap and trade proposal through congress .
Taking these three possibilities in order .
I do not believe that Barack Obama feels that this is a legitimate way for the United States to achieve energy independence from the Middle East .
I believe that he honestly thinks that moving forward on alternative energy is the way to go on this issue .
Everything that Barack Obama campaigned on when it came to this issue leads me to believe that he does not believe this is a viable option .
I also do not believe that this is an effort to heal the wounds that he has inflicted on the country over the healthcare reform bill .
I believe that Barack Obama thinks that he knows what is best for the American people and that the American people will realize he was right on healthcare reform some day .
He believes that the American people will eventually forget the underhanded way congress passed this legislation once they see the good he hopes this bill will produce .
The last reason is the reason I feel is most likely .
He intends to push cap and trade legislation that will further damage the United States economy and he hopes that by adopting a position that is similar to President Bush ’s position he will be able to win over enough votes to pass the cap and trade legislation .
Let me state for the record here that I also believe that alternative energy is part of the solution to end– or at least diminish– our dependency on foreign oil .
But it is only part of the solution , increased domestic oil production should also be part of the solution .
Cap and trade is not part of the solution .
Cap and trade has nothing to do with energy independence and it never did .
It was n’t until people became skeptical of the notion of cap and trade that the environmentalists tried to spin cap and trade into an issue of energy independence and predictably from there into an issue of national defense .
Cap and trade was always about and will always be about global warming – an issue whose very legitimacy is in doubt with the disclosure of Climategate .
We will soon find out if Barack Obama is serious about this issue .
If he takes this issue as seriously as he did the healthcare reform issue he will let nothing stop him from passing it .
He can simply dictate to congress what he demands and tell them that they WILL pass this bill , as he did with healthcare reform .
He will tell congress that it does n’t matter what people think about this because it is n’t about politics .
Just as he did with healthcare reform .
He forced healthcare reform upon the American people through dictate , and he can do the same thing here if he truly believes it is what is best .
I am not condoning this action , I am merely stating that it can be used as a barometer to gauge how serious he is about drilling off of the United States coast .
This leads me to the second question I have about Barack Obama ’s offshore drilling proposal .
How many Democrats that opposed this idea when it was proposed by President Bush will flip on the idea now that it has been proposed by a Democrat president .
If ANY do , it will be an indictment upon them and a clear acknowledgement that they did not oppose the position just the person who proposed it .
In the end , I believe that this proposal is going nowhere .
In fact I believe that Barack Obama only proposed it because he knows that it is going nowhere .
This is just a chance for Barack Obama to appear as though he is reaching out to the right while knowing that it will never come to light .
In my opinion I think that this is a great political move for the president but I am not expecting anything to come from it .
We have heard this story before and the ending is always the same .
I hope that something happens here – but not at the expense of passing cap and trade– but I am very doubtful we will see any progress on this issue .
Trues med dagbøter på 6.000 kroner .
En pikant strid har blusset opp om retten til å bo i den gamle « Skomakerhytta » , skriver Budstikka.no .
Kommunen vil nemlig ikke ha fastboende i den gamle hytta på Bekkestua .
SELGE HYTTA ?
Finn megler
Fra « Skomakerhytta » - omgitt av fuglekvitter og skogsidyll - kan komponist Kjell Samkopf ( 58 ) titte ned på beboerne i boligfeltet ved Åsterudsletta .
Enn så lenge .
Utsikten er fantastisk .
Man ser fra Holmenkollen og langt utover Oslofjorden .
Hytta ligger , sammen med en håndfull andre , tett på den øvrige bebyggelsen , men samtidig midt i et landskapsvernområde .
Praktfull utsikt
Dette har skapt problemer for Tom Ingar Nilsen ( 70 ) fra Grimstad .
Han eier den rødmalte hytta med adresse Dæliveien 56 , som Samkopf har leid siden 2004 .
I slutten av mars mottok Nilsen et skarpt brev fra bygningssjef Ketil Krogstad i Bærum kommune .
Bygningssjefen liker ikke at hytta brukes som helårsbolig .
« Under henvisning til at personer er registrert med fast adresse på gnr .
1 , bnr. 115 , Dæliveien 56 , legger bygningssjefen til grunn at det er foretatt ulovlig bruksendring fra fritidsbolig til helårsbolig , (..)
Det er også lagt vekt på at det dreier seg om en bevisst overtredelse fra Deres side , idet De gjennom reguleringsplanen vet at bygningen er regulert til fritidsbolig » , heter det i brevet .
Truer med mulkt
Fra 3 . mai vanker det dagbøter på Nilsen dersom han ikke har ryddet opp : 35.000 kroner i tvangsmulkt , og 6.000 kroner hver dag i dagbøter .
Bjørn Ingar Nilsen sier til Nettavisen at det ikke er første gang det har vært strid om eiendommen hans .
I Åsterudkroken – rett nedenfor skomakerhytta - bor Høyre - politiker Erik - Odd Espelien .
På nittitallet hadde de to en bitter strid om veirett til Nilsens hytte .
- Vi kjørte saken til retten den gangen .
Nå er det den samme karen som bringer denne saken inn for bygningsrådet i kommunen , sier Nilsen til Nettavisen .
- Kan ikke vite
Nilsen mener det ikke kan være hans problem at leietakeren hans melder flytting til huset han leier , og at det vil være en vanskelig oppgave å kontrollere hvorvidt en person bor der fast eller ikke .

« Innholdet av Deres brev er referert for en advokat .
Han er forundret over at De kan true meg med sanksjoner for forhold som er utenfor mitt ansvarsområde .
Jeg har leiet ut eiendommen til fritidsbruk .
Det at en leietager uten mitt samtykke melder bostedsadresse til eiendommen skal utløse et straffeansvar for eiendommens eier , synes juristen å mangle den nødvendige lovhjemmel » , skriver Nilsen i sitt svar til kommunen .
Beklager
Kjell Samkopf på sin side har i brev til kommunen bekreftet at han bor fast i skomakerhytta , og at han synes det er beklagelig at utleier har kommet i en slik vanskelig situasjon på grunn av ham .
Samkopf sier han nå vil leie en hybel i området , og flytte ut innen fristen , slik at Nilsen slipper å få dagbøter .
Han ber om et møte med bygningssjefen for å avklare hva slags bruk av hytta som er tillatt .
« Jeg ber derfor om et møte ( ..)
Dette for å se om det er grunnlag for om jeg i fremtiden kan fortsette å leie eiendommen og bruke denne som « skrivestue » for min komponistvirksomhet , (.. ) , heter det i brevet fra Samkpf , datert 15 .
april .

Nilsen har drevet som eiendomsmegler .
Han kjøpte hytta for 40.000 kroner i 1991 .
Før han flyttet til Grimstad , bodde han på Nesøya i Asker .
I sine brev til Bærum kommune fremholder Nilsen at Skomakerhytta – også kalt Aspaas - og andre lignende eiendommer i området har vært brukt til helårsboliger for familier .
Ikke alle disse har kommunalt vann og avløp .
Om sin egen hytte skriver han at det ikke er riktig at den er bebygd med en fritidsbolig :
« Bygningen ble i 1922 oppført som et møtelokale for Skomagerarbeiderforeningen af 1918 .(..)
For øvrig kan opplyses at Aspaas i årene 1940 – 1946 med kommunens godkjennelse var bolig for en familie .
Når ble bygningen omregulert til fritidsbolig » ? , spør han .

People and tigers increasingly compete for space .
The conflict threatens the world ’s remaining wild tigers and poses a major problem for communities living in or near forests with tigers .
As forests shrink and prey gets scarce , tigers are forced to hunt domestic livestock , which many local communities depend on for their livelihood .
In retaliation , tigers are killed or captured .
“ Conflict ” tigers are known to end up for sale in black markets .
[ Update : As a few readers have pointed out , the S&P 500 index is “ float - adjusted . ”
That means it measures the value of only the shares that are available to the public for trading , rather than all shares .
That takes some of the fun out of AAPL passing MSFT on the S&P .
Microsoft ’s total market capitalization is still bigger . ]
The day we fanboys have waited for is here : Apple finally passed Microsoft in this afternoon ’s trading to gain the second - highest value on the S&P 500 index .
Apple ’s float - adjusted market cap climbed to $ 242 billion , passing Microsoft ’s $ 239 billion .
Only Exxon Mobil , the energy concern , is valued higher by Standard & Poors , at $ 324 billion .
Microsoft has its fanboys , too , who are insisting that only the official end - of - trading figures for market cap should be considered in marking this milestone .
S&P adjusts its figures according to how many shares “ float , ” or trade , so market - cap numbers reported by sites like Google Finance will differ .
Apple and Microsoft are close enough now that they ’ll probably continue to swap places , as Apple and Google did after Apple first exceeded Google ’s market cap .
And it would only take a small blip for Apple to beat Microsoft on all possible measures of market cap .
But given Apple ’s long history of trailing far behind Microsoft in value , it ’s a noteworthy milestone .
It ’s seems hard to believe now , but in 1997 Microsoft invested $ 150 million in Apple , when the company was worth around $ 2 billion .
Those shares would now be worth $ 18 billion .
That ’s enough value on the books to give Microsoft a comfortable lead over Apple today .
But then - CFO Greg Maffei reportedly hedged Microsoft ’s bet by shorting an equal amount of Apple stock .
If that ’s true , then Microsoft never made a dime off the deal .
Update 2 : Dan Frommer at Business Insider reposted a chart below that shows what ’s happening between the two companies .

Wild card poker is a variation of poker that implements the use of at least one “ wild card . ”
A wild card is a designated card that a player can assign any value and suit .
A wild card livens the action by making stronger hands easier to complete .
This post is about the following question .
In wild card poker , which hand is more valuable : three of a kind or two pair ?
The mathematics are peculiar and the question is something of a paradox .
Before I get into this question , it is useful to understand the logic of poker hand rankings .
What makes a poker hand valuable ?
Poker hand rankings could be arbitrary and a rule based on tradition .
But , as everyone knows , there is a clever logic to poker rankings .
The value of a hand is determined by its mathematical probability of occurrence , or frequency .
A hand is ranked more valuable if it is less likely or harder to make .
This is why a flush has a higher ranking than a straight : it is harder and less probable to complete five unsequenced cards of a suit ( flush ) than to get five sequenced but unsuited cards ( straight ) .
It is a standard probability exercise to verify that the poker hand rankings are based on their frequency .
Here is a table that summarizes the rankings and probabilities ( detailed math here ) :
RANKING OF POKER HAND VS PROBABILITY

Poker hand Number of ways Probability Straight Flush 40 0.0015 % Four of a Kind 624 0.024 % Full House 3,744 0.14 % Flush 5,108 0.20 % Straight 10,200 0.39 %
Three of a Kind 54,912 2.1 % Two Pair 123,552 4.75 % One Pair 1,098,240 42 % High Card 1,302,540 50.1 % Total 2,598,960 100 %
In a way , the frequency ranking makes the game of poker fair and logical .
A three of a kind is more valuable than a two pair exactly because it is harder to achieve that hand by more than two percentage points .
This ranking is fundamental to standard games of poker .
But an extension is to ask : what happens when a wild card is introduced ?
Wild card poker effects
Poker can also be played with wild cards to liven up the action .
One common variation is to add a joker card to the deck and allow it to be wild and represent any card .
The addition of a wild card does three things .
1 . It creates a new hand “ five of a kind ” where all five cards are the same value , like five aces or five kings .
2 . It affects the probability of getting a hand .
It is now easier to make stronger hands because the wild card can be designated to complete a full house or a pair .
3 . It forces a player to make a choice about the wild card .
Which card should the wild card represent ?
The answer is obviously to choose to card that will make the best possible hand given the other cards the player is holding .
This third effect creates a new choice for the player in declaring a hand .
If a player holds a pair and also a wild card , then there are two possible ways to declare the hand .
The hand can be called a three of a kind if the player declares the wild card to match the pair .
Alternately the hand can be called a two pair if the player declares the wild card to match an unpaired card to go along with the pair .
( Say a player has 4,4,2,6 , and a joker .
The joker can either be a 4 to complete a three of a kind , or it can be a 6 to complete two pairs of 44 and 66 )
Which hand should be chosen ?
This is the source of the paradox .
The wild card poker paradox
For the moment we will assume the standard ranking that three of a kind is more valuable than a two pair .
We can then calculate the probability of making each hand in wild card poker .
We will make the assumption that a player holding a pair and a wild card will choose to make this hand a three of a kind rather than a two pair .
The resulting probabilities are ( taken from curiouser.co.uk ) :
SINGLE WILD CARD POKER
( THREE OF A KIND RANKED ABOVE TWO PAIR )
Poker hand Number of ways Probability Five of a kind 13 0.00045 % Straight Flush 184 0.0064 % Four of a Kind 3,120 0.11 % Full House 6,552 0.23 % Flush 7,804 0.20 % Straight 20,532 0.27 % Three of a Kind 137,280 4.8 % Two Pair 123,552 4.75 % One Pair 1,268,088 44 % High Card 1,302,560 45 % Total 2,869,685 100 %
Most of the frequencies are in line with the standard ranking , but there is one glaring exception .
The three of a kind occurs with a slightly higher frequency than two pair !
This violates the principle that less probable hands are ranked as more valuable !
This table suggests that ranking three of a kind higher than two pair is a mistake .
One attempt to fix this problem is to reverse the rankings : instead make two pair more valuable than a three of a kind .
The problem with this approach is that players will respond to the rule change .
If a player is holding a pair and a wild card , then the player will declare the wild card to complete the higher ranked two pair rather than the three of a kind .
Therefore , we have to recalculate the probabilities .
Under this new rule , the probabilities become ( again from curiouser.co.uk )
SINGLE WILD CARD POKER
( TWO PAIR RANKED ABOVE THREE OF A KIND )
Poker hand Number of ways Probability Five of a kind 13 0.00045 % Straight Flush 184 0.0064 % Four of a Kind 3,120 0.11 % Full House 6,552 0.23 % Flush 7,804 0.20 % Straight 20,532 0.27 % Two Pair 205,920 7.2 %
Three of a Kind 54,912 1.9 % One Pair 1,268,088 44 % High Card 1,302,560 45 % Total 2,869,685 100 %
Again , the table is fine except for the exception : now that the two pair is ranked as more valuable , the frequency of its occurrence is higher than three of a kind !
The poker rankings again violate the principle of more valuable hands occurring less frequently .
As one can imagine , the ranking problem persists when playing wild card poker with two jokers or other rules like “ deuces wild . ”
The situation was studied by mathematical researchers John Emert and Dale Umbach of Ball State University in a 1996 Chance article who explained :
When wild cards are allowed , there is no ranking of the hands that can be formed for which more valuable hands occur less frequently
The paradox is not going away , and it is fruitless to pursue a completely logical frequency ranking in wild card poker .
Resolving the paradox : inclusion frequency
Emert and Umbach did take a stab at fixing the wild card poker paradox .
Since frequency ranking could not work , it would have to be abandoned and a new standard established .
The idea is called inclusion frequency , which they describe as the following ( quoted from here )
We propose a ranking that , rather than partitioning the ranked hands into disjoint categories , acknowledges that certain hands can be labeled in several ways .
For example , any hand that could be labeled a full house could also be considered as two pair , three of a kind , or even one pair .
A hand such as ( Waaab ) could be declared to be any of these types as well as a four of a kind ” ¦
We define “ inclusion frequency ” for each type of hand to be the number of five card hands that may be declared as such .
The inclusion frequency ranking is determined by ranking the hands so that those type of hands that have smaller inclusion frequencies are more valuable .
This idea will always make a full - house more valuable than a three of a kind or a two pair , for instance , because the full house could be included in the count of three of a kind with two extra cards or in the count of two pairs .
Similarly , a three of a kind using a wild will also be included in the count of two pair , making the inclusion frequency of a two pair necessarily larger than three of kind .
A three of kind will therefore always be more valuable than a two pair .
Now there is no paradox about which hand is more valuable .
The only peculiar thing is that the flush becomes more valuable than a full house with one or more wilds .
With four wilds it can be shown that a flush is more valuable than even a four of a kind !
You can see the inclusion ranking of the hands here .
While this new ranking removes the paradox , it may come at a high price of changing the rules and potentially confusing players .
And so wild card poker remains something of a mystery with its paradoxical card rankings .
The Justice Department files a lawsuit against Arizona ’s immigration law
The Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to strike down Arizona ’s immigration law .
No , not Arizona ’s new controversial immigration law that has received so much attention lately , but an immigration law that was signed in 2007 by then governor Janet Napolitano .
The suit is being brought up on the grounds that it is unconstitutional because it forces private businesses to check the immigration status of potential employees using e-verify .
This suit is being brought forward not by businesses that do not want to verify the immigration status of potential employees , but by those potential employees who do not want their immigration status verified .
Let me state up front that I support Arizona ’s new immigration law as well as the law in question here –
I do not have a problem with companies being told they must use the e-verify system before hiring an employee .
If a company is going to be punished for hiring illegal immigrants should n’t they have the proper tools in place to make sure that the people they are hiring are in the country legally ?
But what I do have a problem with is the duplicity – or should I say hypocrisy– of people like Janet Napolitano , who have come out against the new Arizona law when she signed a law that could lead to the same type of racial profiling that she is supposedly against .
I know that critics will claim there is a difference between an employer using e-verify before hiring a person and law enforcement asking for a person to verify his or her immigration status , but racial profiling is racial profiling – is it not ?
Are there different degrees of racial profiling ?
Are some forms of racial profiling acceptable ?
It would certainly seem that this is the case in Janet Napolitano ’s mind .
She signed a bill that would allow racial profiling on one level , while coming out against a bill– that she admitted she has n’t bothered to read– because it supposedly would allow racial profiling on another level .
You ca n’t have it both ways Janet Napolitano .
In a perfect world , businesses would n’t have to worry about whether a person is here legally or not because they would be able to trust the government to enforce immigration laws , but sadly that is not the case and so Arizona has taken matters into its own hands with their new immigration law .
This has drawn the fury of the left ; including people like Barack Obama , Eric Holder , and Janet Napolitano .
When Janet Napolitano was governor of Arizona and still had her state ’s best interests at heart she signed a bill that had a form of racial profiling in it .
But now that she has left the state and is a big shot in the Obama regime , she has forgotten the troubles that her state has with violence and drugs at the hands of illegal immigrants at the border , and so she has condemned an attempt by the current governor of Arizona , Jan Brewer , to protect her citizens ’ best interests because it is falsely rumored to contain some of the same racial profiling that she signed into law as governor .
How To Reboot Your Sleep Cycle And Get The Rest You Deserve
Nothing can stand in for a good night ’s sleep .
Today we ’re not going to show you how to scrape by with less sleep ; instead , we ’re going to help you reboot your sleeping habits so you get the sleep you need ( and deserve ) .

Who would n’t want more sleep ?
We live in a 24/7 world where the work of the day does n’t have to end when it gets dark , work can start long before the sun comes up , and even when the work is done you ’ve got a million - and - one distractions to keep you up well into the wee hours surfing , clicking and not getting a good night ’s sleep .
This guide aims to help get your sleep cycle back in order and start getting the rest you need .
A few things need to be said before we go any further .
First , sleep deprivation is n’t a badge of honour .
It ’s a very Protestant Work Ethic attitude to act like being so busy and stretched thin that you must go without sleep just to get it all done is something to be proud of .
If you ’re going to insist that abusing your body with sleep deprivation is something to be proud of and a necessary part of being a working adult , then you ’re not in the right frame of mind to really take this advice to heart .
Going with little sleep is sometimes an unfortunate necessity , but it should n’t be adopted as a way of life and a point of pride .
( You certainly would n’t brag to your friends how awesome you are malnourishing yourself . )
Second , if you read through this guide , take the advice to heart , and still see no positive change in your sleeping patterns , you may very well need to see a doctor .
There are a multitude of medical reasons for why you might not be getting a good night ’s sleep , including things like Sleep Apnoea .
Conditions that interrupt your sleep slowly shave years off your life and decrease the quality of life in the ones you have left .
If you suspect you have a sleep disorder talk to your doctor and go see a sleep specialist .

Finally , there is n’t a tip in this guide I have n’t personally used .
Between being a student , a parent , an educator , a writer here at Lifehacker and for one horrible year doing it all in addition to working 12 - hour graveyard shifts , there is n’t a whole lot about sleep deprivation and putting your “ sleep life ” back together that I have n’t experienced .
Sleep deprivation is brutal and I hope whether you ’ve been short - changing yourself an hour of sleep a day or eight that you take something away from this guide that helps get things back on track .
Effects of Sleep Deprivation
An important part of getting your sleep schedule back under control is understanding what you ’re doing to yourself by not getting enough sleep .
Your body is a complex machine that evolved over millions of years to the state it is in today .
Our modern coffee - swilling , go - go - go , work - until - the - crack - of - dawn - and - collapse culture has only been around for the tiniest fraction of the history of the human species .
We have n’t adapted to less sleep , and we ’re likely not going to adapt any time soon .
You need as much sleep today as your greatest of great grandfathers needed in 2010 BCE .

What happens when you do n’t get enough sleep ?
Everyone is familiar with the common side effects , like being tired the next day , sore muscles and general irritability .
Sleep deprivation also has a myriad of side effects you do n’t see as easily as yawning or a snippy attitude .
Sleep deprivation increases your risk of heart disease , impairs memory retention , increases risk of diabetes and obesity ( adequate sleep is required for proper glucose processing and insulin regulation ) , and increases risk of depression and other mental illness , the list goes on and on .
Earlier this month we shared a study with you showing that sleep deprivation is similar to being outright intoxicated .
Most people would frown strongly upon someone showing up to work drunk every day , but we all act like sleep deprivation is just the way it has to be .
Sleep is a critical part of your body ’s maintenance routine and depriving yourself of it as the same as running a machine with no down time for preventive care and repairs .
You can do it but eventually something breaks and usually catastrophically .
You can read more about the effects of sleep deprivation and related studies here .
Short Term Recovery : Getting the Ship Back On Course Before It Crashes
Let ’s get a big misconception out of the way .
You do n’t have a “ sleep bank ” .
If you ’ve gone for the last year chronically sleep deprived you do n’t have to refill some sort of sleep tank in your tummy in order to start feeling normal again .
You can start doing things today to increase the sleep you ’re getting and start feeling better immediately .
It will take a few weeks of consistent and restful sleep to shake the after - effects of sleep deprivation but do n’t despair , you wo n’t need to “ sleep off ” all 1498 hours of sleep you shorted yourself over the last year .

Another misconception is the amount of sleep people require .
The only person who can judge the amount of sleep you need to be happy and alert is you .
Studies come out year after year saying X number of hours is the best number of hours — eight hours to feel most rested , seven hours to live long like the Japanese , six hours and you ’ll die young — but the only expert on what is best for you is you .
We ’ll return to the topic of how much sleep you need and how to measure it in a moment , for right now let ’s focus on what you can do tonight .
Practice Good Sleep Hygiene : Sleep hygiene is similar to your end - of - day personal hygiene .
Just like you wash your face and brush your teeth before bed , sleep hygiene is an umbrella term that covers all the things you do leading up to sleep that help or hinder restful sleep .
Good sleep hygiene involves getting your body ready for good night ’s sleep and not over stimulating it .
How can you practice good sleep hygiene ?
Start by shifting your perspective on what bedtime and sleep really are .
Bedtime is n’t just the point where you collapse from working hard and staying up too late , bedtime is the start of a block of time very important to your body .
You need good sleep and you should treat your bedtime with proper respect .
Do n’t drink anything with caffeine in it after dinner .
Dependent on age , gender and other physiological factors , the half - life of caffeine in the body is roughly 5 - 10 hours .
In other words , that cup of coffee you drank at 7 pm is still with you at midnight .
Nicotine is another common stimulant , you should quit or make your last cigarette of the day well before bed .
Do n’t drink anything with alcohol in it .
Alcohol is a depressant and will help you get to sleep .
The problem is it depresses everything in your system including your metabolism .
Alcoholics report having no dreams because alcohol disrupts REM sleep , a critical sleep phase for both brain and body health .
Step away from the screens .
Exposing yourself to the glow of a screen before bed will keep you awake .
Your body is hard - wired to wake up when light is bright and go to sleep when it gets dark .
If you shine a bright light in your face before bed you ’re telling your body it ’s time to perk up and be alert .
If you absolutely must use a computer or mobile device later in the day at least turn the screen brightness way down to semi-counter the effect of the light .
Change your body temperature .
Your body drops in temperature as you drift off into sleep .
You can trick your body by simulating this temperature shift .
In the colder months take a hot shower or bath late in the day , your body temperature will rise and then fall again as you cool off from the shower making you sleepy in the process .
It ’s harder to do this in warmer weather , but you can substitute the hot shower with a cold one .
While a cold shower seems terribly unpleasant — and trust me , it ’s not as fun as a hot bath on a winter night ! — it will also induce a temperature swing that will make you sleepy .
Minimise external distractions .
It ’s especially important while you ’re easing yourself into a new sleep routine to minimise external distractions .
Have a cat that jumps on the bed at 3 am ?
Toss them out of the bedroom before bedtime .
Neighbour starts up his diesel truck at 4 am to go to work ?
Wear ear plugs .
Spouse gets up and turns on the lights to get dressed before you ?
Sleep with a sleep mask on .
No napping .
Later on when you ’ve ironed out the details of your sleep cycle you may find that a power nap early in the day is great for you .
Right now though we ’re focused on rebooting your sleep cycle .
No napping .
You need to go to bed at the end of the day when you are tired , not at a later time because you sneaked a nap .
Purge your bedroom .
No computers , no television , no balancing your chequebook in bed , no reading over those damn TPS reports , no anything but sleeping and getting it on ( in whatever order works best for you ) .
If you have a television in your bedroom and you never turn it on , do n’t break your back hauling it down to the basement .
If you ’re a chronic bedroom channel - flipper however , you need to get it out of the room .
Your bedroom should be a place your body associates with nothing else but sleep and sex .

Do n’t torture yourself .
You did n’t drink any coffee , you turned off the computer at 7 pm , you lugged the TV down to the basement , you put in ear plugs and pulled the shades , but it ’s 11 pm and you ’re still tossing and turning .
Do n’t torture yourself by laying in bed frustrated .
Get out of bed and do something that will relax you .
Do n’t go watch television , play video games or anything else that will stimulate your brain into thinking it is time to wake up .
Go sit in a comfortable chair and read a book for a little while .
Sort through magazines you ’re going to toss in the recycling bin and clip out a few interesting articles .
Do something low - stress and relatively boring for 20 - 30 minutes and then go lay down again .
You do n’t want to get in the habit of thinking of bedtime as unpleasant and stressful .
Your initial energy should be focused on making bedtime pleasant , preparing for bedtime well before the bedtime hour and making sure to limit stimulating activities ( exercise , coffee drinking , action - movie watching ) to earlier in the day .
You need to start doing these things right now .
Reading this at 5 pm after getting home from work ?
Put that cup of coffee down right now .
Stop telling yourself you ’re going to get around to finally getting a good night ’s sleep and start getting one .
Long Term Recovery : Charting a Course for Pleasantville
Once you ’ve started with the basics outlined above , like decreasing bedtime stimulation , it ’s time to get serious about the big picture of your sleep needs .
Good sleep is n’t accidental .
Unless you ’re a baby fresh off the breast and passed out in a milk - coma you ’re responsible for your own good sleep .
It might seem counter - intuitive since sleep looks like the most passive sport around , but preparation and study is key .
Once you start working in our earlier tips it ’s time to start measuring how effective they are and ensuring you get enough sleep .

Analyse your sleep needs .
Do you know how much sleep you actually need ?
Could you tell someone with certainty that you ’re happiest after seven hours of sleep ?
Do you wake up when the alarm goes off or do you wake up before it and turn it off on your way out of bed ?
There is only one good way to find out how much sleep you need and that ’s going to bed earlier than you think you need to .
Creep your bedtime forward by 15 minutes every few days until you start waking up on your own in the morning .
When you start waking up before your alarm clock consistently — for a minimum of one week , weekends included — you ’ve found your optimum sleep window .
Waking up should n’t be a jarring affair that involves you smashing your fist on your alarm clock and growling .
For months now I ’ve been waking up ahead of my alarm clock and let me tell you , it feels awesome to wake up on your own and not to the sound of a buzzer .
“ Beating ” the alarm clock every day is like a little victory right out of bed .
Obey the Routine .
I ca n’t tell you what your perfect routine is .
Maybe your routine is no coffee after 3 pm , dim the lights around your apartment at 7 pm and read in bed for 20 minutes at 9 pm before it ’s lights out — or maybe it ’s none of those things .
What is important is that you find a routine that works for your schedule and you stick to it .
You might not be seven years old anymore but your adult body appreciates a routine bedtime just as much as it did when you were a kid .
Whatever routine you decide on stick with it long enough to see if it works and tweak it gently and one thing at a time if it does n’t .
Anticipate Lack of Sleep .
Sometimes lack of sleep is 100 per cent unavoidable — somebody in your family gets in an accident and you ’re up all night at the hospital , you get snowed in at the airport and you just ca n’t sleep well on a plastic bench , etc — but most times we see an event coming that will cut into our sleep cycle .
If you know you ’re going to be up late , take a power nap in the afternoon .
If you ’re coming off a late - night bender make sure to adjust your bedtime the day after to get you into bed sooner .
Short term sleep deprivation can be quickly remedied with adequate rest .
Do n’t let a wild weekend throw off your sleep schedule for the rest of the month as you stay up too late , sleep in too late and spend two weeks slowly — if at all — recalibrating your sleep schedule .
You do n’t have to tell me how hard it is to get your sleep schedule back on track .
After I got off third shift I wondered if I ’d ever stop feeling like a zombie and start feeling like a normal person again .
It ’s hard to do and easy to screw up .
Take the above advice to heart though and you ’ll be sleeping deeply , waking refreshed and wondering how you ever got by on caffeine and grit alone .
Those Shorts Can’t Be Any Shorter
This picture is funnier if you start from the bottom and work your way up .
It ’s like there ’s a surprise waiting for you at the end .

Meet Ingrid , a pitbull perhaps taking more Viagra than any man could afford to take on Long Island .
" It saved Ingrid 's life .
Without Viagra we would n't have her with us today , " said Jodi Record .
Ingrid has to pop the blue pills just to stay alive , according to her caregiver Record .
" She takes two pills twice a day , " said Record .
Ingrid , who takes her time getting around , was rescued by workers here at Little Shelter in Huntington , NY some two years ago .
" She spent her life tied to a fence and when we found her she had 14 pounds of fluid on her abdomen , " said Record .
The pup , whose cheery disposition defies her hard luck , was used as a " bait " dog to incite dog fights , according to her profile on Little Shelter 's website .
In addition , Ingrid was diagnosed with heartworm and a severe heart condition that needed immediate regulation to keep her alive .
A veterinarian would suggest Viagra as a solution to keep the small pooch up and running , saving her life .
And it appears to be working .
" Viagra opens up the blocked vessels that go to the heart so it allows the blood to flow through the body , " said Record .
Who keeps the supply of Viagra pouring in ?
A list of generous guys in the area .
" If every man in America that has Viagra sends one pill to Ingrid that will be keeping her alive for several years , " said Record .
Ingrid is now searching for a place to call home .
And whoever chooses to adopt the dog will receive a lifetime supply of Viagara pills to care for the pooch .
A good home and loving family would be nice to add to that prescription .
If you are interested in adopting Ingrid call 631-368-8770 or find out more online .
So far , just a headline at the Wall Street Journal : “ BP Suffers Setback in Installing Containment Dome ” and merely a “ Breaking News ” listing .
From its e-mail alert :
Hydrate build - up stalled placement of the containment dome over gushing oil .
The BP executive of the dome said , “ I would say it has failed . ”
Scanning other news services ; will update post haste .
Update 4:10 PM : Reuters has more senior execs denying the dire reports .
Since initial reports said there was no oil leak , I ’m not sure how much cred to give optimistic accounts :
BP engineers encountered flammable hydrate formations while lowering the four - story structure onto the leak , said Doug Suttles , the company ’s chief operating officer .
BP Plc hit a snag in its efforts to lower a giant containment dome to trap oil from a blown - out Gulf of Mexico oil well on the sea floor that could take two days to troubleshoot , a BP executive said on Saturday .
CNN has more detail :
The effort to place a containment dome over a gushing wellhead was dealt a setback when a large volume of hydrates — crystals formed when gas combines with water — accumulated inside of the vessel , BP ’s chief operating officer said Saturday .
Gas hydrates are lighter than water , and as a result , made the dome buoyant , Doug Suttles said .
The crystals also blocked the top of the dome , which would prevent oil from being funneled to a drill ship .
The dome was moved off to the side of the wellhead and is resting on the seabed while crews work to overcome the challenge , Suttles said .
“ What we had to do was pick the dome back up , set it over to the side while we evaluate what options we have to actually try to prevent the hydrate formation or find some other method to try to capture the flow , ” he said …
The technique has never been tried at such a depth and there are no guarantees it will work , said BP , which holds the license for the well .
“ It ’s a technology first , ” BP CEO Tony Hayward told CNN ’s David Mattingly Friday .
“ It works in 3 [ hundred ] to 400 feet of water .
But the pressures and temperatures are very different here .
So we can not be confident that it will work . ” …
Casi Calloway , CEO of the environmental group Mobile Baykeeper , said Saturday she hopes the dome operation is successful , but she ’s not counting on it …
BP hopes to connect the dome to a drill ship over the weekend and to begin sucking oil from the containment dome up to the ship by the beginning of next week , the company ’s chief operating officer , Suttles said at a news conference Friday afternoon .
“ This has not been done before and it will undoubtedly have some complications , ” he added .
Like BP , the U.S. Coast Guard worked Friday to manage expectations about the success of the operation .
“ This is going to take a few days and this is not going to be something instantaneous , ” Coast Guard Rear Adm .
Mary Landry said .
“ It may or may not work . ”
On the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , the Coast Guard will continue its efforts to disperse and contain the massive oil slick , which has started to reach Louisiana ’s outer islands .
The Coast Guard performed four controlled burns , dropped 28,000 gallons of dispersant chemical and skimmed 8,000 barrels of an oil - water mix on Thursday , said Petty Officer Brandon Blackwell .
Calloway said the use of dispersants is also cause for concern .
“ We do n’t know what ’s in it , we do n’t know much about it , ” she said .
“ All it really does is sink the oil to the bottom and kind of get it out of sight .
So the public does n’t worry about it as much but the dispersant in itself is toxic , ” Calloway said .
“ We do n’t know what the half - life of it is , or how it changes the composition of oil . …
We do n’t know how long it stays in the water . ”
Q. How do you pronounce Thiaoouba ?
A. Thiaoouba is the English representation of the word in which " T " is silent and " b " is a sound between " B " and " V " .
Hebrew people pronounce Thiaoouba " Hyehouva " .
Interestingly , this is the most frequently encountered word in the Bible , because it is the name Moses used to refer to " God " when he wrote the first 5 chapters of the Bible in Hebrew @ 3250 years ago .
Q . Do you have any material evidence ?
A . Do you mean " technology " ?
No .
This is precisely what our friends do not want us to know .
We do not need any more material technology on Earth .
Giving us more technology is much like giving a machine gun and a box of grenades to kindergarten kids to play with .
We do not comprehend what we do to our consciousness and to Nature around us .
We can not handle our current " technology " .
We use it to destroy each other and the Planet as well .
However , the people of Thiaoouba described many fascinating examples of TRUE technology that we have lost on Earth , many thousands of years ago - such as antigravity , space travel , telepathic and cosmic communication , bio-energy and science of consciousness , just to mention a few examples .
It seems that our " science " may take decades just to admit some possibilities ...
They also gave me comprehensive explanations of most of the " mysteries " on Earth to include in my book , some of which will only be solved in the future ...
Q. What is the main message of The Book ?
A . The message from Thiaoouba is that ‘‘ material technology , without spiritual knowledge , is leading us to inevitable global catastrophe on Earth .
Technology should ASSIST in the spiritual development and not be used ( as it is used now ) to enslave people within a monetary system and materialistic world , which are both temporary anyway .
’’ ‘‘ Superficial ’’ is an excellent word you can use to describe the monetary system and materialistic world .
At the moment , we focus most of our attention on our physical bodies , but this is a serious mistake .
The physical body , like everything material , is actually temporary , whereas the psyche , being part of the Astral body never dies ...
We should concentrate on the development of the mind ...
The people of Thiaoouba also stress the importance of our individual free will .
" We all have free will and it is up to us to discipline ourselves in order to improve spiritually .
To impose one 's free will on another , in a way which deprives the individual of exercising his own free will , is one of the greatest crimes that man can commit ... "
In view of such a statement , our entire society on Earth is based on wrong principles .
Most people are forced to follow the flock ...
The Book not only describes a full diagnosis of the current situation , but also contains detailed instructions of what to do and how .
Specifically , how the same problems have been overcome on other planets similar to ours .
The most important is the context of this information : the purpose of our existence , demonstrated by very advanced people , who have themselves passed our current stage of development long , long ago .
Q . Any chance to go to Thiaoouba ?
A. People from Thiaoouba take one of us approximately every 100 years or so .
You would not want to go there .
Michel is frequently very sad when he talks about Thiaoouba .
Imagine being shown a paradise , only to be told that it is not for you .
He wants to be there , but he can't .
And when he came back he found himself well and truly against most people on Earth , including his family , against the science , habits , religions , way of life ...
Even against all UFO researchers ...
It is sometimes very hard when you know the truth .
Q. What about toilets on Thiaoouba ?
A. On Thiaoouba they use a kind of device that looks similar to our toilet , but is n't .
It simply disintegrates the waste as it comes out - into elementary particles I guess .
No water , no paper , no smell , nothing .
Michel was scared that this machine might disintegrate his private parts ...
Q. People from Thiaoouba bring the message of love .
What about killing people in the parallel universe ?
A. People get stuck in the parallel universe for thousands of years .
Killing them there is a sort of favor , because their astral bodies are liberated and can progress on the path of reincarnation .
If they do not get killed , and do not have the knowledge to get out , they exist there until the planet exists , which is quite a while .
Not that there is anything wrong with it .
We have all the time in the Universe ( 1e22 years approximately ) to evolve and reach the Source of Consciousness .
I guess , that killing in there was a part of Michel 's lesson .
Q. What happened to the dinosaurs ?
A . They died when one of the 2 small moons crashed into the earth @ 5 million years ago , causing a global catastrophe , flooding etc ...
Earth had 2 smaller moons before the one we have now .
Why do you ask about dinosaurs ?
Is it not people who are about to become extinct on Earth very soon ?
Q . What do you know about the needles , which the people from Thiaoouba have removed twice from their orbit around Earth ?
A. Scientific American , August 1998 ( Vol 279 , Number 2 , article by N.L.Johnson , Page 43 , ( 63 in US edition ? ! ) ) explains :
" 80 clumps of needles ( were ) released in May 1963 as part of a US Department of Defense telecommunication experiment .
The radiation pressure exerted by sunlight ( ??? ) was to have pushed the tiny needles - all 400 million of them - out of orbit ... "
Observations confirm that the needles became " clumped " together and transferred on a higher orbit than they were originally released on .
Magnetic attraction has to be excluded from consideration , because needles were made out of copper .
Show me anything else in the Universe that has been pushed " out of orbit " by the " pressure of sunlight " .
Why do we use rockets then ?
Even if one needle is only 0.01 gram - 400 million of them is 4 tonnes !!!
I challenge every scientist on Earth to explain how " the pressure of sunlight " can displace 4 tonnes of metal onto a higher orbit .
The removal of the needles was an intelligent intervention , demonstrating unsurpassed technological possibilities of the people of Thiaoouba .
What do you do if your kids play with matches in their room ?
Q. The Book is great .
But materialistic reality is SO overwhelming .
I feel helpless .
A. Michel and I share your frustration .
But everything is ultimately done by single people .
The change must be initiated by people like you and me , who do not follow the flock .
We seem to be the mental paraplegics of the Galaxy .
Everyone , including all animals on Earth , use telepathic communication - except us .
However , if a sufficient number of people ( the critical mass ) have the right attitude , many others will click - telepathically .
Q. In chapter 7 Thao states that the Moon will crash with Earth in about 195,000 years .
Measurements of our scientists indicate that the Moon moves away from Earth about 1 cm / year .
Does n't it disprove your book ?
A. ( by Tom Chalko , PhD ) Scientific conclusions are only as good as assumptions taken in reaching them .
Hence , you need to examine the method and assumptions our scientists adopt with the same skepticism you try to examine the book .
The method of measuring the distance between Earth and the Moon is based on bouncing the light ( laser pulses ) from the reflectors located at the surface of the Moon and measuring the time it takes for the light to reach sensors back on Earth .
By the " distance " between Earth and the Moon they mean the distance between their centers of gravity .
Some of the obvious assumptions our scientists make are
1. the centers of gravity of Earth and Moon are fixed ( do not move ) with respect to the corresponding planetary / lunar surfaces
2 . Light beam between Earth and Moon travels through media that do not change with time
Each of these assumptions needs scrutiny .
1. Neither Earth , nor the Moon are rigid bodies .
Their interiors are partly liquid and semi-solid .
Hence , observations of our scientists can be explained by slight changes in mass distribution inside Earth / Moon interiors .
Incidently , some notorius and unexplained errors in satellite positions can be expained this way too .
See this article and the video below for more details .
2 . The moon seems to develop its atmosphere .
If you look at a new moon , you will be able to see its entire outline .
In the past , this was not possible .
Observing the entire lunar outline is only possible if the moon has an atmosphere .
As you know , light travels through atmosphere slower than through vaccum .
Hence , thickening of the lunar atmosphere would contribute to a conclusion that the Moon drifts away from Earth .
Increase in pollution / composition of Earth 's atmosphere ( CO 2 ) has a similar effect .
" Not appearances , but what is BEHIND them is the most important " .
Q. You should do what you preach .
Why do you charge money for The Book ?
A . We have tried to ask printers , distributors and shipment companies to do their job for free .
It was not possible .
We have tried to give The Book free of charge , only to find it later in rubbish bins ...
What do you do when someone tries to give you a free book in a mall ?
We found that people have so much attachment to money , that they do not value anything that comes for free ( like fresh air for example ) .
At present we give books free only to those who specifically request them and cannot afford them .
The e-book online is also free .
By selling the book to those who see a benefit from having it and can afford it - we sustain our activity of giving it away .
Q. The Book 's message sounds very similar to some religions .
What 's the difference ?
A. Most religions preach love , and yet , their purpose is to confuse and misinform people for two reasons : money and the power of manipulating people .
Their tool is frequently fear , which they induce to get control .
For example , the Catholic Church removed reincarnation from the bible and included Satan , so they could murder and torture people in the name of God and love , apparently " fighting " Satan .
Most wars are a direct consequence of religious " brainwashing " .
When you seek true love you do not go to a prostitute .
When you truly seek God , you do not go to an institution that makes business by claiming to represent God .
Do you think that God needs a proxy ?
Have you read The Freedom of Choice ?
The book 's main message is that the most beautiful temple of man is within and has always been .
To reach it you should meditate and then concentrate , which is different , although the two are usually confused by teachers on Earth .
We should grow up , drop ridiculous rituals and stop following the flock , lead by those who take advantage of us .
Q . There are tons of info on Grays , Reptilians , Plaedians , TauCetis , Cassiopeans , Arcturians , Andromidans etc. on almost every Web site I visit but nothing on the Thiaooubans ?
A . There are many ways to distort the truth .
People on Earth are busy amusing themselves with theories , fairy tales and scary stories - they are not yet ready for Reality ...
By the way , Thiaoouba is The most frequently used word in the Bible .
Translators twisted it from Hebrew as Yehova .
You have to admit that this word has been known on Earth for thousands of years ...
In particular , the " angel of God " in the first contact with Moses demanded to be called Thiaoouba ( Yehova ) ‘‘ for generations to come ’ ’ .
This demand is still recorded in the Hebrew version of the Old Testament ( Torah ) .
Priests soon distorted this and now Hebrew people are not even allowed to pronounce this name (!!!)
God is God and YHWH is Thiaoouba - the name of the planet , on which everyone is at least as evolved as Moses , Buddha or Jesus .
Q. Some UFO books talk about " fights " between advanced aliens .
What is the truth ?
A . There are no fights for Earth , or for anything at all , among truly advanced people .
It can not be .
Truly advanced people can create anything material they want by their thoughts alone .
Our ancestors on Earth called them " gods " for a reason .
In addition , all material things , including suns , planets , galaxies etc ... are actually temporary .
Every atom is just a vibration and will eventually disintegrate into nothingness .
True , eternal stuff is the consciousness - intelligence , sense of humor etc ...
You have to admit that it is impossible to " fight " for that .
Everyone in the Universe has to learn all lessons individually .
Q. The Book contains a lot of facts known on Earth from various sources , some of them covered up .
Why ?
A. Michel 's mission is to straighten all scrambled facts and put them in the right perspective , as well as in the order of importance .
Q. Other UFO " abductees " say a lot of sensational stories , which are quite chilling .
What do you think ?
A. Michel knows which " abductees " are simply faking their experiences , but he is not allowed to speak about it .
It is up to the people to find out who is right .
This is our homework : wake up to the truth by ourselves .
Remember : people from Thiaoouba will never do homework for anyone .
They will only ensure , that everyone has enough hints to identify truth .
Remember that fear is the easiest feeling to induce , and it paralyses your logic .
For centuries priests and governments have used fear techniques to control the flock .
Anyone who promotes fear is not aware of the Universal Law .
Q. What about Grays and other aliens seen on Earth ?
A . There are some races of people on a similar level of mentality to ours , visiting us on Earth .
Michel was given telepathic permission from Thiaoouba in 1995 to talk about Grays in front of TV cameras in the USA .
Gray people are from a " planet of sorrows " too , and on their own planet they have completely lost their immune system , as a consequence of their " civilized " activities .
Simply speaking they are going extinct very quickly .
They have the technology to come to Earth and they come here to watch the reactions of our immune system , because we just started loosing ours in 1948 .
They hope , that by observing our reactions they can help themselves .
They have implanted about 150 people world - wide ( not 5 million as some say ) with monitoring devices .
People from Thiaoouba watch this activity too and clearly say that there is no danger .
Q . Do you really expect anyone to believe what is in The Book ?
It is so unreal .
A . You do n't need to believe .
You need to know .
Serious scientists have already verified enough from The Book to consider every sentence in it very seriously .
Have you seen this article ?
Take a brainwash test :
Some industries make huge profits only when you are sick .
When you are healthy they have no business whatsoever .
Do you really believe their " health " advice ??
Note that most people do .
Another test .
Suppose that everyone gets a job and a loan .
Guess who benefits most from such a scheme .
Are n't you following the flock ?
The best physicists on Earth agree that everything material is just vibration , and it is actually temporary .
The real stuff is our consciousness .
People need a lot of effort to comprehend the Reality of the Universe .
The evidence is overwhelming .
We have eyes - but do we see ?
Q . It is impossible to travel to the other side of the galaxy , live there and come back in 10 days , even with the speed of light .
How do you explain your travel ?
A. Michel has traveled much faster than the speed of light , using a technique called trans - substantiation .
You can not do it in the solar system , you have to be in deep space first , otherwise you will explode .
Michel 's understanding is that the spaceship traveled several hours to get out of our solar system , and several hours to reach Thiaoouba from outside theirs .
Inside the spaceship Michel could n't tell when the trans - substantiation occurred .
The image became different on the " camera " screen .
Q. What was the food on Thiaoouba ?
What did you have for dinner ?
A. People on Thiaoouba drink half a glass of something they called hydromel , every 2 days .
Michel did not like it , but he had to admit that it was extremely nourishing .
Eating a lot seems to be disturbing the conscious development .
People on Thiaoouba do not waste any time whatsoever preparing food .
Q. I have been caught in between two worlds : material and spiritual .
What would be the right position ?
A. Material technology should ASSIST in our spiritual development .
If it is used to garbage our mind with misinformation , horror and violence ( TV , VCR ) or destroys the planet , then it is misused .
There is no problem with duality : we are really eternal astral beings undergoing lessons in physical bodies .
The sole purpose of our physical existence is spiritual development .
Anything that happens around us is a part of the lesson .
Our learning tool is our free will .
We should use it to make a continuous series of choices in our life and watch their consequences .
The aim is to understand the effects of our choices .
If we mess up the lesson ( do n't learn ) then we have to repeat the lesson in the next lifetime .
If we are absolutely stubborn and do not want to learn , we eventually get destroyed and re-cycled as everything in Nature .
Q. Where is Thiaoouba ?
A. Thiaoouba is most likely in the Pleiades ( there were no signs on the way ) .
Our Sun is barely visible from there .
Pleiades is quite a unique group of stars in which , unlike in most other " constellations " all stars are VERY CLOSE to one another .
There are not too many such groups of stars in our Galaxy .
Q . Is there any way for us to communicate with people on Thiaoouba ?
A . The only way to communicate with them directly was to use telepathy with the help of the Great Pyramid , which , by the way , is not only vandalised beyond description , but is also slightly out of its original alignment and we do n't have the technology or knowledge to correct it .
On Thiaoouba , of course , they have the knowledge to send us telepathic messages at any time they want .
But most of the people on Earth do n't even know how to listen .
People from Thiaoouba frequently visit and monitor us on Earth .
On these occasions it is possible to have a direct bi-directional telepathic contact with them , if they want to .
Q . What do your friends from Thiaoouba say about spirituality and religions on Earth ?
A . All religions , cults , sects etc. are truly dangerous .
They have been created after great men ( Christ , Buddha etc. ) died , by people with only 2 things in mind : money and power .
Religions are a true curse on Earth , because they are the source of spiritual misinformation .
They constipate people with fear , propaganda and rituals to the point that people stop thinking and follow the flock .
When you seek true love you do not go to a prostitute .
When you truly seek God , you do not go to an institution that makes business by claiming to represent God .
" The Kingdom of God is within you " as it says in the Bible , which once upon a time contained lots of other good information .
Unfortunately , many essential things were removed by priests who feared that people might become enlightened , fully independent and impossible to brainwash and control .
Just imagine what would happen if people discovered that God does n't need a proxy ...
Q. What do scientists say about The Book ?
A. Michel had a live radio interview with a group of physicists in Melbourne , who studied his book thoroughly and attacked his credibility quite viciously .
Michel asked them : did you read my book ? "
" Yes , several times " they answered .
Then Michel asked them " you are scientists and physicists : show me just one sentence in my book that you can prove with your instruments and knowledge to be a lie " .
Guess what .
They could not find one .
All of this was on air .
It was in 1994 and they are still searching .
Have you seen
http://www.thiaoouba.com/electron1.html ?
Q. What about skeptical scientists ?
What do they say ?
A. Basically , they say that The Book is fiction or even bullshit , until they actually read and study it .
One academic resisted for a long time , saying that he does not read paranoia and bullshit .
Finally he agreed to read the book , as " science fiction " .
When asked about his opinion of the book , he answered : ' Well , in my opinion there are 3 possibilities '
1 . It is a lie .
In this case I must admit that it is the best lie I have ever come across , and possibly the best lie of the century .
It clicks so well with our past and present that it is simply unbelievable .
2 . This guy ( Michel ) is a literary genius .
It is like Einstein + 100 * J. Verne ( my comment : Michel is a farmer with no education and has never written anything before , except letters to his mother )
3 . It is really true
You have to read the book yourself to make your own choice .
Q . Do they have money on Thiaoouba ?
What do they say about money ?
A . No , they do not have any form of money at all on Thiaoouba .
They say that the monetary system is a true curse on Earth .
Most people on Earth are totally enslaved by the monetary system ( by taking a job and a loan for example ) .
They pay interest all their lives ( @0.5 million dollars per person over their lifetime ) and it never crosses their minds that by doing so they help strengthen the very system that makes them slaves .
Few individuals ( 12 families or so ) control the entire monetary system on Earth .
Most people do not even know who they are ; they hide themselves using banks they own .
They have succeeded in convincing most people on Earth that making $ is the ultimate goal in life .
They throw some $ for grabs and people compete , fight for them , are ready to kill , even make a war .
They also lend money to governments and soon everyone becomes a puppet controlled by a $ .
Guess who benefits most .
Q . Do they have schools , libraries etc. on Thiaoouba ?
A. No .
They do n't even use pen and paper .
Their learning is by direct telepathy : mind to mind high - speed communication .
They get their information by telepathic connection with the Source - and they remember everything .
Can you imagine a planet where everyone is as evolved as Jesus or Moses ?
Q. How long do they live on Thiaoouba ?
A . As long as they wish .
Millions of years if they want to .
And their physical bodies are forever young , because they can regenerate any cell in their bodies at will .
Q . Do they have telecommunication ( phones ) on Thiaoouba ?
A. No .
They use telepathy .
For information , images , thoughts , feelings , teaching , learning , anything at all .
Q. People on Thiaoouba seem very serious .
What do they do for fun ?
A . They have fun most of the time .
They look like they receive good news every few seconds .
Also , they live as long as they wish , looking 20 the whole time .
Imagine what they can learn and how much fun they can have living for a million years or so .
They have a lot of time to relax , meditate , swim in the ocean , sunbathe etc . .
I guess their favorite is joining the Source of Consciousness - getting out of the physical body altogether .
Q. On Thiaoouba they eat so little , the fun of food is trying new tastes to get new experiences .
A. Food is fun only for some of us , and it is really a low - level fun .
We overeat and then feel sick .
We even get addicted to some foods without ever realizing it .
Their fun is more to do with the mind and a perpetual satisfaction from helping others and learning The Design and The Law of the Universe .
Excess food seems to be a serious obstacle in the development of the mind .
Try to concentrate after a 5 course meal for example .
You feel sleepy , not energetic and alert .
Q. What was the spaceship from Thiaoouba like ?
A . The long - range spaceship was perfectly spherical , shiny metallic , @ 80 m diameter , no doors , no holes whatsoever , levitating when not in flight .
You enter levitating with a special instrument , through a sort of piston that opens when you approach .
When inside , you watch the outside using enormous 3D holographic displays with unbelievable clarity , color , zoom etc .. .
Q. What are the people from Thiaoouba like ?
Have you been afraid ?
A. People on Thiaoouba are so nice , kind , loving and understanding .
But Michel felt like a kindergarten kid with them , mentally .
Thao ( Michel 's mentor there ) was constantly amused by his reactions to different things he saw and learnt there .
They are so wise , and knowledgeable , it is simply unbelievable .
When Michel thinks about them he cannot resist the tears in his eyes .
Q. Had anyone noticed that you were missing for 9 days ?
A. Michel 's entire family was very worried when he suddenly vanished in the middle of the night .
Since he had left the note for them ( as instructed by his new friends telepathically ) they did not inform police , they were just very worried , even after Michel came back .
Q. Some people say that aliens prepare for an invasion on Earth .
What is the truth ?
A. Fake alarms : there is no invasion .
There ca n't be .
Earth is extremely close to a global catastrophe , and therefore is a very unlikely destination for anyone intelligent .
Scare tactics are used just to exercise control over people , because fear completely blocks logical reasoning .
Q . What do they wear on Thiaoouba ?
A . All people on Thiaoouba wear vividly colored garments that match their auras .
On Earth we have just started developing so - called bioresonant garments and experiments with near - monochromatic color patterns ...
Q . What do people on Thiaoouba say about lovemaking ?
A . They say that when we go to the forest we do not see the trees .
We seem to miss the point .

Zimbabwe ambassador calls U.S. diplomat a ‘ house slave ’
When Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson took to the podium at Tuesday night ’s gala event , he probably did n’t expect any hecklers .
Carson , shown at right , was speaking at the Africa Day celebration at the Ritz - Carlton Hotel , a meeting of embassy officials representing countries all over the African continent .
A soft - spoken diplomat with a professorial air , Carson spoke on the progress of Africa from a colonial dominion to a group of independent , if struggling states .
His remarks were going along as expected — until he started to talk critically about the downslide of human rights and good governance in Zimbabwe .
“ You are talking like a good house slave ! ” came a shout from an audience member to Carson ’s right .
Your humble Cable guy nearly choked on his filet mignon as it became clear that the heckler , Zimbabwean Ambassador H.E. Machivenyika Mapuranga , was determined to keep interrupting the speech by shouting at Carson .
As the crowd hissed “ Boo ! ” and other disapproving condemnations , Mapuranga would n’t let it go , going on with shouts such as , “ We will never be an American colony , you know that ! ”
But Carson silenced both the ambassador and the crowd when he started speaking again .
Changing his tone , he scolded Zimbabwe by pointing out that such outbursts would have evoked vicious punishment in the southern African country , which has been ruled by revolutionary leader Robert Mugabe with an iron fist since the 1980s .
“ You can sit in the audience in darkness , but the light will find you and the truth will find you , ” Carson told Mapuranga , as event staff tried to quietly encourage the ambassador to get up from his table and leave the event .
Turning to the crowd , Carson said , “ It seems that Robert Mugabe has some friends in the room tonight .
Unlike in Zimbabwe , they are allowed to speak without oppression because this is a democracy . ”
The event staff was able to convince Mapuranga to leave , who shouted all the way .
His staff filed out behind him .
“ In Zimbabwe that kind of talk would have been met by a policeman ’s stick .
We do n’t do that here , ” Carson surmised , before returning to his prepared speech .
The diplomats at the event could n’t stop talking about the incident .
One said he was encouraged that the all - African crowd booed Mapuranga and cheered Carson , signaling that African diplomats do n’t like what ’s going on in Zimbabwe and generally support the Obama administration ’s policies in Africa .
“ It was n’t the right platform for him to do that , ” another diplomat said of Mapuranga , adding that Carson had won the respect of the crowd by coming to the dinner with “ facts , not just kind words . ”
That diplomat remarked that in Africa , ambassadors are such bigwigs that they would never be booted out of a public event for shouting something .
But in the United States , even ambassadors can be escorted out of the room by regular event staff .
“ In Africa , an ambassador is treated like a king .
Here he can be humiliated just like anyone else . ”
Bonus video : FP interviewed Mapuranga a few years ago after publishing the 2007 Failed States Index , where Zimbabwe appeared fourth .
Watch him tout Zimbabwe ’s “ sustainable development ” policies and blame Britain for the country ’s troubles :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad , including two Reuters news staff , was released on Monday by a group that promotes leaking to fight government and corporate corruption .
This image captured from a classified U.S. military video footage shows a wounded Iraqi person being loaded onto a van during a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad , including two Reuters news staff on July 12 , 2007 , and released to Reuters on April 5 , 2010 by WikiLeaks , a group that promotes leaking to fight government and corporate corruption .
REUTERS / WikiLeaks / Handout
The group , WikiLeaks , told a news conference in Washington that it acquired encrypted video of the July 12 , 2007 , attack from military whistleblowers and had been able to view and investigate it after breaking the encryption code .
A U.S. defense official , speaking on condition of anonymity , confirmed that the video and audio were authentic .
Major Shawn Turner , a spokesman for U.S. Central Command , said an investigation of the incident shortly after it occurred found that U.S. forces were not aware of the presence of the news staffers and thought they were engaging armed insurgents .
“ We regret the loss of innocent life , but this incident was promptly investigated and there was never any attempt to cover up any aspect of this engagement , ” Turner said .
The helicopter gunsight video , with an audio track of conversation between the fliers , made public for the first time a stark view of one bloody incident in the seven - year war in Iraq .
It showed an aerial view of a group of men moving about a square in a Baghdad neighborhood .
The fliers identified some of the men as armed .
WikiLeaks said the men in the square included Reuters photographer Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 , and his assistant and driver Saeed Chmagh , 40 , who were killed in the incident .
“ The gathering at the corner that is fired up on has about nine people in it , ” Julian Assange , a WikiLeaks spokesman , told reporters at the National Press Club .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The gunsight tracks two of the men , identified by WikiLeaks as the Reuters news staff , as the fliers identify their cameras as weapons .
Military spokesman Turner said that during the engagement , the helicopter mistook a camera for a rocket - propelled grenade launcher .
The helicopter opened fire on the small group , killing several people and wounding others .
Minutes later , when a van approached and began trying to assist the wounded , the fliers became concerned the vehicle was occupied by militants trying to collect weapons and help wounded comrades escape .
The Apache helicopters requested permission to attack the van and waited impatiently .
“ Come on , let us shoot , ” said one voice .
The fliers were granted permission to engage the van and opened fire , apparently killing several people in and around the vehicle .
Two children wounded in the van were evacuated by U.S. ground forces arriving at the scene as the Apache helicopters continued to circle overhead .
“ Well it ’s their fault for bringing their kids into a battle , ” one of the U.S. fliers said .
David Schlesinger , Reuters ’ editor - in- chief , said the video released by WikiLeaks showed the deaths of Noor - Eldeen and Chmagh were “ tragic and emblematic of the extreme dangers that exist in covering war zones . ”
“ The video released today via WikiLeaks is graphic evidence of the dangers involved in war journalism and the tragedies that can result , ” he said .
Reuters has pressed the U.S. military to conduct a full and objective investigation into the killing of the two staff .
Video of the incident from two U.S. Apache helicopters and photographs taken of the scene were shown to Reuters editors in an off - the - record briefing in Baghdad on July 25 , 2007 .
U.S. military officers who presented the materials said Reuters had to make a request under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) to get copies .
This request was made the same day .
Turner said the military had released documents to Reuters last year in response to the FOIA request showing the presence of weapons on the scene , including AK - 47 rifles and an RPG 7 grenade launcher .
Assange said he disagreed with a U.S. military assessment that the attack was justified .
“ I believe that if those killings were lawful under the rules of engagement , then the rules of engagement are wrong , deeply wrong , ” he said .
The fliers in the video act “ like they are playing a computer game and their desire is they want to get high scores ” by killing opponents , he said .
WikiLeaks posted the video at www.collateralmurder.com.

A frequent argument of those proposing tougher illegal immigration policies is that illegal immigration goes hand - in - hand with more crime .
They cite the fact that illegal immigrants must already live outside the law and suggest that the violent drug cartels operating across Mexico 's border could bring their criminal behavior into the U.S.
Are these arguments right ?
Here are cases for and against .
Extreme Enforcement Increases Crime The Washington Post 's Spencer Hsu reports that " police chiefs from several of the state 's and the nation 's largest cities " agree that " Arizona 's new crackdown on illegal immigration will increase crime in U.S. cities , not reduce it , by driving a wedge between police and immigrant communities .
...
Arizona 's law will intimidate crime victims and witnesses who are illegal immigrants and divert police from investigating more serious crimes . "
These police chiefs are not arguing that any immigration enforcement increases crime , only that Arizona - style extreme enforcement can increase crime .
... One Place Where That Was n't The Case Prince William County , a Virginia suburb of Washington DC , became notorious in years past for its Arizona - like extreme immigration enforcement .
National Review's John Miller points out that " crime rates are at a 15 - year low " in the county .
" The latest numbers are part of a trend that started long before the county took a stand against illegal immigration .
One thing is certain :
The county 's current policy has not led to more crime . "
Immigration Sanctuaries Don't Reduce Crime National Review's Heather MacDonald looks at the other extreme : Sanctuary cities .
" This standard argument in favor of local sanctuary policies has never been tested empirically by comparing witness involvement in sanctuary and non-sanctuary cities .
As Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu , head of the Arizona Sheriff 's Association and a supporter of SB 1070 , points out , cooperation from illegal aliens is already low .
... local governments have been creating unofficial amnesties through their sanctuary laws for years .
Those do n't seem to have worked out so well . "
Immigration Crime vs ' Serious ' Crime The Moderate Voice 's Jason Arvak makes the distinction .
" Supporters of the law point out that illegal immigration is a crime .
Ok , fair enough .
But how serious of a crime is it ?
Does anyone die or get injured from a poor guy crossing a border looking for work picking tomatoes ?
Of course not .
Yes , some illegal immigrants are criminals or drug runners or human traffickers , but so are a lot of citizens and legal residents . "
Crime in Immigrant Communities
It exists , says Doug Mataconis , which is why over - enforcement would be so counter - productive .
" Communities where immigrants , legal and illegal , live are also likely to be the targets of criminal activity for a variety of reasons .
If the impression is created that the local police are little more than agents of the Federal immigration authorities , then , obviously , someone who is the victim of a crime is going to be less likely to report that crime , or cooperate with investigating officers , if they believe that they risk deportation . "
As Illegal Immigration Rises in Phoenix , Crime Falls The Wall Street Journal 's Evan Perez reports that , from 2008 to 2009 , violent crime " plunged 16.6 % in Phoenix , despite a perception of rising crime that has fueled an immigration backlash . "
Violent crime fell 5.5 % nationally .
" For the first quarter of 2010 , violent crime was down 17 % overall in the city , while homicides were down 38 % and robberies 27 % , compared with the same period in 2009 .
Arizona 's major cities all registered declines . "
CATO 's Daniel Griswold adds , " One of the clinching arguments for Arizona 's tough new law aimed at illegal immigration has been the perception in that state that crime has been rising , and that undocumented workers are largely to blame . "

In the throes of intense fear , we suddenly find ourselves operating in a different and unexpected way .
The psychological tools that we normally use to navigate the world — reasoning and planning before we act — get progressively shut down .
In the grip of the brain ’s subconscious fear centers , we behave in ways that to our rational mind seem nonsensical or worse .
We might respond automatically , with preprogrammed motor routines , or simply melt down .
We lose control .
In this unfamiliar realm , it can seem like we ’re in the grip of utter chaos .
But although the preconscious fear centers of the brain are not capable of deliberation and reason , they do have their own logic , a simplified suite of responses keyed to the nature of the threat at hand .
There is a structure to panic .
When the danger is far away , or at least not immediately imminent , the instinct is to freeze .
When danger is approaching , the impulse is to run away .
When escape is impossible , the response is to fight back .
And when struggling is futile , the animal will become immobilized in the grip of fright .
Although it does n’t slide quite as smoothly off the tongue , a more accurate description than “ fight or flight ” would be “ fight , freeze , flight , or fright ” — or , for short , “ the four fs . ”
On a winter morning a few years back , a young woman named Sue Yellowtail went through them all in about 10 minutes .
FREEZEThe Mancos River rises in southwestern Colorado and flows through the Ute Mountains on its way to New Mexico , where it empties into the San Juan River three miles shy of the Four Corners intersection .
Over millions of years , the river and its tributaries have carved a fanlike rill of dramatic canyons out of the ancient sediments of the Mesa Verde tablelands , a maze of vertiginous stone walls .
The rugged , arid landscape of juniper forest proves a rich habitat for wildlife .
At 25 , Sue Yellowtail was just a few years out of college , working for the Ute Indian tribe as a water quality specialist .
Her job was to travel through remote areas of the Ute reservation , collecting samples from streams , creeks , and rivers .
She spent her days crisscrossing remote backcountry , territory closed to visitors and rarely traveled even by locals .
It ’s the kind of place where , if you got in trouble , you were on your own .
On a clear , cold morning in late December , Yellowtail pulled her pickup over to the side of a little - used dirt double - track , a few yards from a simple truss bridge that spanned a creek .
As she collected her gear , she heard a high - pitched scream .
Probably a coyote killing a rabbit , she thought .
She clambered down two steep embankments to the water ’s edge .
Wading to the far side of the creek , she stooped to stretch her tape measure the width of the flow .
Just then she heard a rustling and looked up .
At the top of the bank , not 30 feet away , stood a mountain lion .
Tawny against the brown leaves of the riverbank brush , the animal was almost perfectly camouflaged .
It stared down at her , motionless .
She stood stock - still .
Yellowtail had entered the first instinctual fear - response state , the condition of freezing known as attentive immobility .
Even before she was aware of danger , subconscious regions of her brain were assessing the threat .
Cued to the presence of a novel stimulus , the brain deployed the orienting reflex , a cousin of the startle reflex .
Within milliseconds
Yellowtail ’s heart rate and breathing slowed .
A brain region called the superior colliculus turned her head and slewed her eyes so that the densest part of the retina , the fovea , formed a detailed image of the cat .
The visual information then flowed via the thalamus to the visual cortex and the amygdala , the key brain center for evaluating threat .
Her pattern - recognition system found a match in the flow of sensory information .
It recognized a pair of eyes , then the outline of a feline head .
In less than half a second , before her cortex even had time to complete the match and recognize what she was seeing , her emotional circuitry had already assessed the situation :
It was bad .
Subconsciously , her brain also determined that the threat was not immediately pressing , and so a region called the ventral column of the periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) triggered attentive immobility .
This is generally considered the first stage of the fear response , because it tends to occur when the threat is far away or not yet aware of the subject ’s presence .
The goal is to keep it that way .
When a person is frozen with fear , she is motionless but far from passive .
With cortisol and adrenaline coursing through her body , she is primed for physical action , alert and intensely focused .
The heart rate slows and blood pressure shoots up .
Muscles tense and the pupils dilate .
The body may tremble and the eyes bulge .
If the fear is intense , the mind might be plunged into a state called hypervigilance , in which a person scans the environment rapidly and randomly , unable to think through the available options clearly .
Freezing is a posture of an animal that , while in danger , is primarily concerned with not getting in worse danger .
Its plan is to do nothing , hope to avoid being detected , and see what happens .
In the natural environment , it often proves an effective strategy .
Young antelope can spend the better part of the day lying crouched and motionless in tall grass , their ears tucked and heads pressed against the ground .
When accidentally disturbed by a passing lion or hyena , they bolt so unexpectedly that the predator may be too startled to chase after them .
Yellowtail ’s was just the kind of situation that the behavior had evolved for : eluding a nearby predator .
But freezing is essentially a temporary measure , a stopgap until the danger either goes away or becomes more pressing .
It is a posture that asks the question : What next ?
In the morning light of Mancos Canyon , human and animal stood confronting each other .
Yellowtail had never seen a mountain lion in the wild before .
Even as she fought to contain her fear , she marveled at the beauty of it .
Its dark eyes looked back at her .
Who knew what it was thinking behind that gaze .
Was it curious , or hungry ?
FLIGHTAs she locked eyes with it , the mountain lion moved forward , descending the shrubby bank and heading straight toward her .
Yellowtail waded back across the three - foot - deep stream , back toward her truck .
To be prudent , she thought , she had better keep the width of the icy stream between herself and the animal .
As she made it to the far side , the big cat quietly slipped into the water .
A former biology major , Yellowtail had studied predator behavior .
She knew that if she began climbing the steep bank up toward her truck , she would expose her back , and she guessed that the moment of vulnerability might spur the mountain lion to attack .
Instead she moved quickly down the edge of the stream and crossed again , feeling her way over the slick cobbles underfoot .
Looking behind her , she expected to see the animal climb the far bank and disappear .
But no :
It followed her path along the water ’s edge and again started swimming after her .
“ I ’m in trouble , ” Yellowtail thought .
“ This is serious . ”
There was no doubting the mountain lion ’s intention now .
Trapped between the stream ’s steep narrow banks , she could n’t think of any way to keep the animal away .
She was holding a microcassette recorder that she kept for taking notes , and she threw it at the cat .
It just kept coming .
Yellowtail retreated down the riverbank , shouting and throwing rocks and chunks of ice .
Somehow she managed to keep herself from running .
She crossed the stream , worked farther down the bank , and crossed again .
The cat followed , relentlessly closing the distance .
Even as she felt panic building , Yellowtail had enough presence of mind to understand that what she was seeing was a classic example of predator behavior .
Running would only stoke the animal ’s attack instinct .
She had to fight the urge .
The mountain lion was close now , near enough to pounce .
As she splashed once more across the stream , the need to run surged over her like a shiver .
She bolted , splashing madly through the shallow water , her legs churning over the rough , slippery cobbles of the streambed .
She ran with everything she had .
Yellowtail was now in the grip of the second phase of the fear response , flight .
The sudden movement of the mountain lion had broken the spell of her attentive immobility and gotten her moving , but while the animal was still a fair distance off she had managed to keep her wits and suppress her fear centers ’ automatic panic reaction .
But as the cat drew closer , reason and willpower wavered as the fear grew stronger .
At last they gave way altogether .
This process has been witnessed in the laboratory using brain - scan technology .
Subjects inside an fMRI scanner were asked to play a Pacman - like game in which they were chased by a predator .
When they were “ caught , ” they were given a series of mild electric shocks .
While not exactly a realistic scenario , the game did elicit brain activity that paralleled Yellowtail’s .
When the “ predator ” was far away , the subjects ’ brains showed activity mostly in the prefrontal cortex .
As it drew nearer , the area of greatest metabolism shifted to the periaqueductal gray , the region that codes for the behavioral patterns of the four fs .
Yellowtail made it only halfway across the creek before her rubber boot caught on a large rock .
She stumbled , twisting , and went down hard into the water .
At that instant the mountain lion pounced .
Instinctively it lunged for Yellowtail ’s neck , but as she fell it misjudged and dragged its teeth across her scalp .
Under the weight of the big cat , Yellowtail slipped below the surface .
FRIGHTLooking back on the moment from years after the fact , Yellowtail can still recall every detail with perfect clarity .
She remembers feeling the warmth of the animal ’s mouth on her head .
She remembers looking up toward the surface through her sunglasses and thinking , with a perplexing degree of calm : “ When your time ’s up , your time ’s up . ”
Yellowtail had entered a third phase of the fear response , a state known as tonic immobility , or quiescence — in lay terms , playing possum .
When an animal is seized by an attacker , the caudal ventrolateral region of the PAG generates a response that from the outside looks like total collapse .
In the teeth of a full - blown sympathetic response , the parasympathetic system now swings into overdrive .
The body , insensitive to pain , goes completely limp , often falling to the ground as awkwardly as rag doll , limbs splayed , head thrown back .
Eyes closed , it trembles , defecates , and lies still .
It looks , in a word , dead .
This is the position of utter despair , a final , last - ditch Hail Mary pass of a strategy .
The one hope of quiescence is that the attacker , thinking its quarry has expired , will stop attacking .
In Yellowtail ’s case , the mountain lion appeared to react to her quiescence .
Momentarily it released its grip .
That was enough .
In an instant she snapped out of her dissociative dream state and was sputtering back up to the air .
Without reason , without thought , she started running again , flailing so hard that she ran right out of one of her hip boots .
And then — nothing .
Whatever happened next , Yellowtail has no idea , because for the next 10 or 15 seconds she was overcome by a panic so blind that she blacked out .
She had entered a realm of fear strong enough to shut down the memory - forming hippocampus and perhaps even consciousness itself .
The science behind that kind of amnesia remains murky , because such intense fear is a state as yet inaccessible to science .
It is known that amnesia often accompanies extremely terrifying experiences .
Chances are , an overdose of cortisol or a related substance , corticosterone , disrupts the hippocampus and inhibits the formation of new memories .
This could be beneficial if it prevents later traumatic recollections .
Yellowtail will never know what terror her amnesia cloaked .
At any rate , it did not last long .
The next thing she remembers , she was on the riverbank on the far side of the stream .
She had emerged from her blind panic oddly collected and remembers that time seemed to be moving in slow motion .
She found herself lying on top of the mountain lion ’s shoulders , her right arm thrust down its throat .
She looked down and saw that the animal ’s jaws were so huge that its canines were overlapped on either side of her arm .
NEXT : THE SHOWDOWN
FIGHT “ I ’ve got to kill this animal or it ’s going to kill me , ” she thought .
She happened to be wearing her fly fishing vest , from which hung a surgical - steel hemostat on a retractable string .
In the strange clarity of total fear , she reasoned through a course of action .
First she tried to wrap the string around the cat ’s throat to strangle it but abandoned that plan when the cat thrashed , slashing its teeth dangerously close to her fingers .
Before moving on to a new strategy , she paused and carefully inspected her left hand to make sure her fingers were all there .
“ Because if they were n’t , I was going to pick them up and put them in my pocket , ” she says today .
“ It ’s just crazy , the stuff that you think about . ”
Her next thought was to stab it in the eye with the hemostat .
“ It just dawned on me : ‘ I ’ve got to get to the brain , ’ so the eye was the best bet . ”
Without thinking twice , she clutched the hemostat and stabbed it over and over again into the cat ’s left eye .
The beast screamed a horrifying yowl .
She kept stabbing .
Yellowtail had worked her way through to the last of the four fs , the fight , or aggressive defense , response .
Like quiescence , aggressive defense is a tactic of last resort .
People in the throes of full sympathetic overdrive are capable of totally uninhibited , blind violence .
They will use any weapon and inflict any injury they can .
On the battlefield this impulse may be useful in the heat of fighting , but it can also lead to reckless , even mindless , behavior .
And it is very difficult to shut off .
Once the cortex has yielded control to the PAG , there is no getting it back until the shouting is over .
The annals of military history are filled with tales of soldiers who kept slaughtering well after the battle was over .
In Yellowtail ’s case , there was no need to restrain her impulse to violence .
After a while , though , she sensed that the mountain lion had had enough .
She kicked off her other hip boot and got ready to stand up .
The cat let go of her arm .
As soon as Yellowtail ’s weight was off it , the cat stood up too .
Yellowtail lunged at it , swearing and shouting , “ Come on , you want some more ? ”
The cat did n’t move .
Yellowtail lunged again , to see if it seemed ready to attack her again .
It just stood there , looking dazed .
Yellowtail backed up about 20 feet , then turned and ran down the bank until she found a cattle path through the brush leading back up the embankment to the road , and then to her truck .
“ The whole time , I was worried that she was going to come through the brush and get me , ” Yellowtail says , “ but she never did . ”
Yellowtail got into her truck and drove for help .
Not until she was in an ambulance did her multiple cuts and bruises begin to throb with pain .
Trackers returned to the site of the attack , located the mountain lion , and shot it .
It turned out to be an aged female , underweight and weak from starvation .
Yellow­tail figures that if the cat had been a full - size male , she would be dead now .
As it was , she came very close .
“ It ’s amazing what you can do when you ’re under that kind of stress , in a life - or - death situation , ” she says .
“ You do whatever it takes to keep yourself alive . ”

ATHENS , Greece —
When he was still a Taliban fighter , Zaher Muhamad never thought he would end up in Greece .
But as the might of the United States Army made itself felt in the post - Sept. 11 invasion of Afghanistan , Muhamad was forced to lay down his arms and flee , first to the Pakistani city of Peshawar , then onto Greece via Iran and Turkey .
Today , he heads an Afghan immigrant association and lives in St Panteleimon , a gritty Athenian neighborhood balancing awkwardly along the racial fault line dividing the Greek capital .
It is not a good time to be in Greece .
The country is in the middle of a crisis , with official unemployment skyrocketing to over 12 percent in general and 25 percent among young people .
Now that construction and industrial jobs are drying up , immigrants are less welcome than ever .
Muhamad is just one in the tapestry of immigrants crowding into St Panteleimon from Asia , Africa and eastern Europe .
Tensions skyrocketed in recent years as immigrants began outnumbering Greeks and members of the Greek far - right moved there to fight “ de- Hellenisation . ”
They rented or bought apartments overlooking the square , stretched Greek flags taut across their balcony railings , and began almost daily patrols harassing immigrants .
Although many left , others like Muhamad refuse to be intimidated .
“ Why should I be guilty of being in the West when it was the West through NATO that invaded my country ? ” Muhamad asked , as he sat with a group of friends in the Thousand and One Nights cafe , around a table strewn with cigarette packs and beer bottles .
Immigrants form an estimated 10 percent of Greece ’s population of 11 million according to the United Nations .
The trickle became a flood after Greece joined the Schengen zone in 1997 , meaning once a person enters Greece he can travel to other Schengen countries without passing through immigration controls .
As other EU members with long Mediterranean coastlines , such as Spain and Italy , tightened their border patrols , immigrants desperate to access Europe ’s employment opportunities landed in Greece .
Periodic legalization drives and political inaction have exacerbated the racial divide and turned locals against the foreign presence .
A chauvinist party called LAOS steadily gained in popularity .
In the 2009 elections , it won 15 seats in parliament and became the third most - popular party in Greece ’s second largest city , Thessaloniki .
Its success reflects changing popular attitudes toward immigrants .
" It 's not possible for us to welcome people who enter our home through the window , " wrote one anonymous reader of Ta Nea newspaper in an online comment responding to an article about the lives immigrants lead .
He went on to criticize the governing party , PASOK , for leniency toward immigrants .
“ In the past two years the harassment and intimidation have got worse and worse , ” Muhamad said .
“ The right wing parties ’ foot - soldiers often attack us , more as a vote - getting mechanism and to convince the electorate that they ’re doing the job the police are not up to doing than because of anything else . ”
On May 4 , knife - yielding vigilantes assaulted two Afghan laborers waiting to be picked up for a day ’s work .
A week before that , they had attacked the cafe where Muhamad spends his time .
“ There ’s a heavy police presence but they do nothing when the fascists attack immigrants , ” said Elektra Kouta , a human rights lawyer .
Just opposite the cafe , the domes of an enormous concrete Greek Orthodox church soar over the neighborhood square .
Adjoining it is a padlocked playground .
Half - empty cafeterias cluster around the open area , affording patrons a front - row seat to the frequent race - related attacks that occur .
Asian and Middle Eastern children play in front of the church , shouting to each other in Greek .
“ It was the playground that started it all , ” said Stamatis Petropoulos , a 47 - year - old taxi driver .
“ The Greeks felt that the immigrants ’ children were stopping their children from entering the playground , or maybe they did n’t want their kids to mix with the foreigners ’ kids . ”
One local who works at a neighborhood flower shop claimed that she had been turned back after she tried to register her child at a nearby school .
“ I do n’t have anything against immigrants but I was offended that even the kindergartens here give priority to their children . ”
“ The situation is miserable because thousands of people are trapped here , ” said Gregory Valianatos , a human rights activist who lives in the neighborhood .
“ The politicians who have trapped them here are to blame for the pissing in the street , the thousands of people trapped in cement apartment blocks and low - paying labor , not the immigrants themselves . ”
Last June , St Panteleimon ’s trash - strewn streets claimed another questionable first , when Muslim immigrants belonging to criminal mafias clashed .
About 150 men struggled with each other in a street - brawl , just one of several to have occurred in Athens as public order crumbles .
“ Things are falling apart every day that passes , ” said Myrto , a local business owner who refused to give her last name .
“ We watch and wait . ”
Global sea level rose by about 120 meters during the several millennia that followed the end of the last ice age ( approximately 21,000 years ago ) , and stabilized between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago .
Sea level indicators suggest that global sea level did not change significantly from then until the late 19th century when the instrumental record of sea level change shows evidence for an onset of sea level rise .
In the mid-19th century , the rate of sea level rise probably started exceeding the mean rate from the previous 2,000 years .
Satellite altimetry observations , available since the early 1990s , provide more accurate sea level data with nearly global coverage and indicate that since 1993 sea level has been rising at a rate of about 3 millimeters per year .
Sea level has risen since the early 1970s due to a combination of ocean thermal expansion and glacier mass loss ( IPCC 2007 and IPCC 2013 ) .
Contribution from the cryosphere
Which of the topics discussed so far in State of the Cryosphere have the potential to contribute to a rising sea level during a warming climate ?
Several — but some more than others .
The seasonal snow cover melts during spring and summer and much of that water flows into rivers which eventually reach the sea .
However , this is a process with a seasonal hydrologic cycle .
With no net increase in seasonal snowfall over time , and no significant increase has occurred in recent decades , melting snow is not a factor that contributes to annual net sea level rise .
Sea ice and ice shelves are already located in the ocean and thus do not have any further significant influence on sea level after they melt .
As permafrost thaws , and the ice within the soil melts , an additional amount of liquid water becomes available but how much of this water actually reaches streams and rivers , and eventually the sea , is not well known at this time .
The most significant contributors to sea level within the current climate are glaciers .
The most significant contributors to sea level within the current climate are glaciers , but ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica hold the potential to eventually dwarf other cryospheric contributors to sea level rise .
Current conditions : contribution from melting glaciers
Global sea level is currently rising as a result of both ocean thermal expansion and glacier melt , with each accounting for about half of the observed sea level rise , and each caused by recent increases in global mean temperature .
For the period 1961 - 2003 , the observed sea level rise due to thermal expansion was 0.42 millimeters per year and 0.69 millimeters per year due to total glacier melt ( small glaciers , ice caps , ice sheets ) ( IPCC 2007 ) .
Between 1993 and 2003 , the contribution to sea level rise increased for both sources to 1.60 millimeters per year and 1.19 millimeters per year respectively ( IPCC 2007 ) .
Antarctica and Greenland , the world 's largest ice sheets , make up the vast majority of the Earth 's ice .
If these ice sheets melted entirely , sea level would rise by more than 70 meters .
These ice sheets had long been believed to be in equilibrium , but more recent studies indicate growing ice sheet imbalance , with more mass leaving the ice sheet than is replaced by snowfall , especially in West Antarctica .
See Ice Sheets for more information .
In contrast to the polar regions , the network of lower latitude small glaciers and ice caps , although making up only about four percent of the total land ice area or about 760,000 square kilometers , may have provided as much as 60 percent of the total glacier contribution to sea level change since 1990s ( Meier et al. 2007 ) .

How glaciers ' contribution to sea level is computed
Global mass balance data are transformed to sea - level equivalent by first multiplying the ice thickness ( meters ) lost to melting by the density of ice ( about 900 kilograms per cubic meter ) , to obtain a water equivalent thickness , and then multiplying by the surface area of these " small " glaciers ( about 760,000 square kilometers ) .
This provides an annual average mass balance of approximately - 0.273 meters for the period 1961 to 2005 .
When dividing the mass balance value by the surface area of the oceans ( 361.6 million square kilometers ) , the final result is 0.58 millimeters of sea level rise per year .
The Glacier Contribution to Sea Level graph demonstrates how the contribution from melting glaciers began increasing at a faster rate starting in the 1990s .
This is in agreement with high - latitude air temperature records .
The IPCC ( 2013 ) stated that it was " very likely " ( at least 90 percent confidence ) that the mean annual global rate of ocean level increase was 1.5 to 1.9 millimeters between 1901 and 2010 , 1.7 to 2.3 millimeters between 1971 and 2010 , and 2.8 to 3.6 millimeters between 1993 and 2010 .

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report contained significant uncertainty in its projections for glacier contributions to sea level rise over the course of the 21st century .
An update ( Radić et al. 2014 ) incorporated a newly released inventory showing the outline of nearly every glacier on Earth , 14 global climate models , and two emission scenarios : RCP4.5 ( intermediate emissions ) and RCP8.5 ( high emissions ) .
The intermediate - emission scenario indicated a sea level rise of 155 ± 41 millimeters , and the high - emission scenario indicated a rise of 216 ± 44 millimeters , though the authors conceded that large uncertainties remain .
Sea level rise projections :
These graphs show projected glacier volume loss and corresponding sea level equivalent over the 21st century .

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report relied on a few hundred glaciers to make its predictions .
A subsequent study ( Zemp et al. 2019 ) drew from more than 19,000 glaciers worldwide .
Inferring from observed volume changes in those glaciers , the study found that mountain glaciers outside of the polar regions , as well as peripheral glaciers fringing the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets , contributed 27 ± 22 millimeters to global mean sea level rise from 1961 to 2016 .
The Glacier Model Intercomparison Project ( GlacierMIP ) projected future sea level rise , for the year 2100 relative to the year 2015 , driven by glacier mass loss outside the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets ( but also including glaciers along the peripheries of those ice sheets ) .
GlacierMIP used six global glacier models using four emission scenarios : RCP2.6 , RCP4.5 , RCP6.0 , and RCP8.5 .
Averaged results from the models ranged from 94 ± 25 millimeters for RCP2.6 , to 200 ± 44 millimeters for RCP8.5 .
( Hock et al. 2019 ) .
See Mountain Glaciers for more information .
Potential contribution of ice sheets
Destabilization of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets has the potential to raise global sea level , ultimately dwarfing contributions from mountain glaciers , although sea level would not rise uniformly everywhere .
Contributions from Greenland and Antarctica :
These maps show the effects of relative sea level change when ice is lost from Greenland ( left ) and West Antarctica ( right ) .
More severe levels of sea level rise appear in darker shades of orange and red .
The green line indicates sea level matching current levels .
Ice loss from West Antarctica amplifies sea level rise along the east and west coastlines of North America .

Ice loss from West Antarctica amplifies sea level rise along the east and west coastlines of North America .

No matter what contributes to global sea level rise , individual locations will experience different changes in sea level due to local factors .
A significant factor in many areas involves ice that melted long ago .
A glacier or ice sheet exerts pressure on the land directly underneath it , and can push adjacent land areas up , the same way gently pressing one part of a balloon will cause another part of that balloon to bulge .
Remove your hand , and the balloon will revert to its old shape .
Some areas , such as Juneau , Alaska , are actually rising because they are still adjusting to the retreat of glaciers after the Little Ice Age .
Multiple locations along the U.S. East Coast , however , are slowly sinking because of the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet , which previously exerted so much pressure on land to the north .
Going forward , ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica will have varying effects on Earth 's oceans .
That is because the ice sheet itself has mass that exerts a gravitational force on the surrounding ocean .
A loss of mass from the ice sheet causes nearby ocean levels to fall as the mass and gravity of the ice sheet decreases .
However , since overall sea level would rise , the sea level increase in areas far from the ice sheet would be higher than the global average .
Consequently , ice sheet contribution to sea level rise — even if it were the same amount — would have different impacts , depending on whether the contribution came from Greenland or Antarctica ( Bamber and Riva 2010 ) .
Projected sea level rise :
These maps show projected sea level rise from all sources ( not just ice sheet loss or contributions from the cryosphere ) under RCP 8.5 in 2050 , 2100 , and 2300 .
Note that each map has a different scale , so red represents 60 centimeters of sea level rise in 2050 , and 1,500 centimeters of sea level rise in 2300 .

How much ice sheets will contribute to sea level rise in the coming decades and centuries will depend in a large part on human activity .
Representative Concentration Pathways ( RCPs ) are scenarios for rates and magnitudes of climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions .
RCP 2.6 assumes low greenhouse gas emissions ; RCP 8.5 assumes high greenhouse gas emissions ; RCP 4.5 assumes greenhouse gas emissions in between 2.6 and 8.5 .
A 2014 study estimated global sea level rise — from all sources , not just ice - sheet melt — at 90 percent probability for the 21st century : 0.3 to 0.8 meters under RCP 2.6 , 0.4 to 0.9 meters under RCP 4.5 , and 0.5 to 1.2 meters under RCP 8.5 .
Although thermal expansion has been projected to contribute the most to sea level rise , the potential of large contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet has added significant uncertainty to predictions .
This is the factor responsible for the most of the spread in projected sea level rise by the late 21st century ( Kopp et al. 2014 ) .
A subsequent study incorporated physical processes on ice shelves that might accelerate ice sheet loss and sea level rise .
One process was hydrofracturing , a process where surface water slices through the ice due to its higher density .
Another process was marine ice cliff instability , arising from the relative weakness of ice .
Ice cliffs more than about 90 meters tall are inherently unstable because ice at earthly temperatures is too weak to support the edifice .
Incorporating these processes in some models leads to higher projections of global mean sea level rise by the year 2100 : 0.26 to 0.98 meters under RCP 2.6 , and 0.93 to 2.43 meters under RCP 8.5 .
The greater spread between RCPs indicated a greater role for emissions in ice sheet contribution to sea level rise ( Kopp et al. 2017 ) .
These studies underscore an important point : Being far away from a melting ice sheet is no source of safety .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Because of changes in Earth 's gravity field resulting from ice sheet mass loss , ocean sea level will actually drop near the areas of melt and rise elsewhere .
Miami , Tokyo , Shanghai , and Los Angeles are just a few of the coastal cities that can expect higher sea levels due to faraway ice - sheet melt ( Larour et al. 2017 ) .
A somewhat encouraging finding relates to Thwaites Glacier .
Draining the central West Antarctic Ice Sheet , Thwaites Glacier has the potential to contribute significantly to sea level rise , and this glacier has doubled its ice - loss rate since the 1990s .
An upside of ice loss , though , is that reduction in the overlying weight causes the bedrock to rebound , slowing further glacier flow .
Benefits of rebounding bedrock wo n't become apparent in the coming century , but by the year 2350 , the rebounding rock could reduce the glacier 's contribution to rising sea level by more than 25 percent ( Larour et al. 2019 , Steig 2019 ) .

Looking Back at “ SNL ” Films : A Little Bit of Excellent , A Whole Lot of Bogus and Sad
When we learned that the folks at “ Saturday Night Live ” had decided to transform the “ MacGruber ” sketches into a feature - length motion picture , our first reaction was excitement , but it quickly dwindled somewhat when we considered the track record of movies which were inspired by sketches or short films on “ SNL . ”
As the “ MacGruber ” release date grew ever closer , however , we began to do a little more research into the whole “ SNL ” - film phenomenon , and we realized that the chances of getting a legitimately great comedy are actually a little bit better than we thought .
Not that much better , mind you …I mean , after all , you ca n’t just grant a free pass to a franchise that ’s given us “ It ’s Pat ” … but when you factor in the film inspired by the animated adventures of a grumpy , mumbling gentleman named Milton , for a brief moment , you can almost forgive them for “ Superstar . ”
Almost .
Join us now as we take a look back through the mists of time and investigate the 17 motion pictures which made the jump from “ SNL ” sketch to feature film , in a little piece we like to call …
Mr. Mike ’s Mondo Video ( 1979 )
Starring : Michael O’Donoghue
Based on : O’Donoghue ’s “ Mr. Mike ” sketches .
Premise : Rather than use Mr. Mike to teach grueling lessons in life , as was the tendency on “ SNL , ” O’Donoghue used the character in an ostensible tribute to the 1962 documentary “ Mondo Cane , ” having her serve as the link between a mixture of strange vignettes ( some comedic , some strictly eccentric for eccentricity ’s sake ) , found footage , and performances by some decidedly non-commercial musical artists .
“ Mr. Mike ’s Mondo Video ” was originally intended to be a television special that would air on Saturday night when “ SNL ” was scheduled to be in reruns , but after NBC got skittish about some of the content , New Line Cinema bought the rights and gave it a very brief theatrical run before eventually releasing it onto home video , where it developed a cult following .
Reasons to watch :
If you ’re a fan of the late 1970s punk and new wave scene , the performances by Klaus Nomi and Root Boy Slim are pretty awesome ( Sid Vicious ’s performance of “ My Way ” would be , too , if they had n’t been refused the right to include the audio ) , as are Dan Aykroyd ’s contributions to the film , both as himself ( he shows off his webbed toes ) and as the man behind the Mainland Church of the Perfect Wave , where the parishioners worship at the altar of a portrait of Jack Lord .
In fact , pretty much any of the bits with “ SNL ” folks are worth seeing , but the best is a sequence where Gilda Radner , Laraine Newman , Jane Curtin , Debbie Harry , Wendie Malick , and others discuss the merits of creepy men .
Reasons to avoid : The Not Ready for Prime Time Players only appear for a few minutes of the film ’s run time .
Otherwise , it ’s pure , unbridled O’Donoghue , which makes the whole production an acquired taste that will strike the average viewer as being far more odd and disconcerting than funny .
Gilda Live ( 1980 )
Starring : Gilda Radner , Don Novello , Paul Shaffer
Based on : Radner ’s most memorable characters , including Roseanne Roseannadanna , Emily Litella , Candy Slice , Judy Miller , Lisa Loopner , Rhonda Weiss , and more .
Premise : Radner had a relatively successful run on Broadway with her one - woman show , “ Gilda Radner : Live from New York , ” so it seemed like a reasonable enough plan to film the proceedings – with Mike Nichols at the helm , no less – and release it into theaters .
Reasons to watch :
Anyone who lived through the ‘ 70s knows what a wonderful performer Radner was , but her post - “ SNL ” work did n’t do her talent justice .
“ Gilda Live ” sent mixed messages at the time , showing both an interest in taking the spotlight but a reticence to step into something completely new , but looking at it now , it serves as an excellent introduction to Radner ’s abilities as a comedienne , an actress , and even as a singer .
( The songs are great , by the way . )
Plus , you get to spend a few minutes here and there with Father Guido Sarducci , who ’s always a stitch .
Reasons to avoid : Unless you ’re a diehard Radner fan who ’s been waiting to hear her using language she could n’t use on network TV , there ’s nothing here that ’s significantly funnier than what you can already watch on the “ SNL : Best of Gilda Radner ” DVD that came out a few years back .
The Blues Brothers ( 1980 )
Starring : Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , John Candy , Carrie Fisher , Kathleen Freeman , Henry Gibson , Teve Lawrence , Twiggy , Frank Oz , James Brown , Cab Calloway , Ray Charles , Aretha Franklin
Based on : the duo ’s blues - singing alter egos , who performed several times on the show .
Premise : Jake and Elwood Blues ( John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd , respectively ) go on a “ mission from God ” to pay the back taxes on the orphanage in which they were raised .
They decide to get the band back together and put on a benefit concert , while dodging the police , neo - Nazis , and the Good Ol ’ Boys , a country band that they impersonated for quick cash .
Reasons to watch : Um , because it ’s awesome … ?
Not only is the movie stacked with R&B giants ( Aretha Franklin , Ray Charles , Cab Calloway , James Brown , and roughly a dozen others ) , it contains some side - splittingly funny scenes ( the nun and the ruler , a Hell - hath - no - fury Carrie Fisher ) and the greatest car chase in movie history .
Or at the very least , the greatest car crash in movie history .
Reasons to avoid :
There is no reason to avoid this movie , unless you have an aversion to profanity and classic R&B .
Bob Roberts ( 1992 )
Starring : Tim Robbins , Giancarlo Esposito , Alan Rickman , Ray Wise , Brian Murray , Gore Vidal , Rebecca Jenkins , Harry Lennix , Robert Stanton , Kelly Willis , Tom Atkins , David Strathairn , James Spader
Based on : a short segment Robbins did for “ SNL ” when he hosted the show in 1986 .
Premise : A mockumentary about a Conservative Senatorial candidate who also happens to be a folk singer , the film follows Bob Roberts through the race to the Senate as he is perpetually trailed by reporter Bugs Raplin , a man on a mission to reveal Roberts as a fraud .
Reasons to watch : Fans of the Bob Dylan documentary “ Do n’t Look Back ” will have fun trying to pick out the similarities between the films , while political junkies will enjoy examining the characters and playing “ Spot the Real - Life Inspiration , ” but this is a biting satire filled with a lot of laughs … and a lot of great songs , too .
Reasons to avoid :
If you do n’t see anything funny about politics to begin with , then “ Bob Roberts ” will probably just piss you off .
Mr. Saturday Night ( 1992 )
Starring : Billy Crystal , David Paymer , Julie Warner , Helen Hunt , Mary Mara , Jerry Orbach , Ron Silver , Sage Allen , Jason Marsden
Based on : the character of Buddy Young , Jr. , the Las Vegas lounge comedian created by Crystal during his stint at “ SNL . ”
Premise :
The life - story of a once famous , mean - spirited comic from the heyday of old - school lounge comedy , following him through all of his highs and lows .
Reasons to watch :
This film very rarely appears on lists of “ SNL movies . ”
That ’s not only because Billy Crystal ’s schmaltzy - but - vicious comedian character only appeared a few times on the show , but also because it ’s not really a comedy .
It was , in fact , Crystal ’s first stab at film directing in the wake of his massive success with 1989 ’s “ When Harry Met Sally ” and 1991 ’s “ City Slickers ” and was an out - and - out attempt at being taken seriously as a major filmmaker .
Written by Crystal with longtime writing cohorts Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel , “ Mr. Saturday Night ” certainly gets points for boldness in allowing Buddy to mostly be a genuine bastard who , as often as not , deserves his bad luck .
It also features a memorable , justly Oscar - nominated , performance by David Paymer as Young ’s long - suffering brother , as well as turns by three other terrific actors : Jerry Ohrbach , Ron Silver , and Helen Hunt .
Reasons to avoid : Unfortunately , Crystal ’s artistic reach exceeds his grasp here .
Playing down humor in favor of an attempt at a moving character study , he instead makes a rather sentimental but strangely bitter comic drama that left critics cool and audiences confused .
Also , Crystal ’s old - age make - up is a less - than - convincing distraction .
For some reason , the aging process proved more believable on the prematurely bald David Paymer .
Wayne ’s World ( 1992 )
Starring : Mike Myers , Dana Carvey , Rob Lowe , Tia Carrere , Brian Doyle - Murray , Lara Flynn Boyle , Michael DeLuise , Lee Tergesen , Kurt Fuller , Colleen Camp , Donna Dixon
Based on : the “ Wayne ’s World ” sketches , about two guys from Aurora , Illinois , who film a cable access show in their basement .
Premise : Wayne ( Mike Myers ) and Garth ( Dana Carvey ) think they ’ve hit the big time when sleazy producer Benjamin Kane ( Rob Lowe ) buys their show , only to discover that it ’s been gutted of all its personality .
Garth accuses
Wayne of selling out , while Wayne is jealous of Benjamin and is convinced that he is only interested in stealing Wayne ’s girlfriend Cassandra ( Tia Carrere ) .
Reasons to watch :
It ’s one of the few “ SNL ” - related projects that does n’t have the phrase ‘ guilty pleasure ’ joined at its hip .
Myers , with help from “ That ‘ 70s Show ” creators Bonnie and Terry Turner , wrote a script that ’s both sweet and faithful to its characters ’ naivety .
Oh , and there ’s this scene set to the tune of “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” that you may have heard about .
Reasons to avoid :
As rocker babes go , Tia Carrere is , well , a heck of a babe .
Coneheads ( 1993 )
Starring : Dan Aykroyd , Jane Curtin , Michelle Burke , David Spade , Michael McKean , Sinbad , Phil Hartman , Adam Sandler , Chris Farley , Jason Alexander , Lisa Jane Persky
Based on : the “ Coneheads ” sketches , which first debuted in 1977 , making this the longest - gestating “ SNL ” film to date .
Premise : Beldar and Prymatt Conehead ( Aykroyd and Curtin ) are just another immigrant couple from the planet Remulak out to make their fortune in this very new world while avoiding their actual job , which involves destroying it .
Their daughter , Connie ( Michelle Burke ) , is growing up as typical teenage earthling and straining against the quaint traditional customs of her people .
There are also some small problems caused by INS officials wondering if “ Donald R. and Mary Margaret DeCicco ” really are from , you guessed it , France .
Reasons to watch :
The Coneheads are arguably the most sweetly silly recurring characters in the history of SNL and it ’s just great to see them in any form .
Crucially , the most reliable running gags from the bit make a return here , including the truly alien mating and dining habits of the Remulakians ( “ consume mast quantities ” ) , their robotic speech patterns , and fact that hardly anyone seems to notice the Coneheads have actual cone heads .
It also benefits from an extraordinary supporting cast featuring numerous SNL veterans and assorted comedy geniuses , including Phil Hartman , Michael McKean , and original Connie Conehead Laraine Newman .
Written by Aykroyd with SNL veteran scribe Tom Davis and the team of Bonnie and Terry Turner , who ’d shortly go on to create the not entirely dissimilar TV series , “ 3rd Rock from the Sun , ” there ’s a bit of social commentary on the apparently eternal American controversy over immigration here .
Much more important , a good portion of the jokes actually work .
Reasons to avoid :
More of the jokes kinda do n’t work , actually , and the direction by video veteran Steve Barron is n’t anything to be excited about .
To be honest , this film may be best suited to catching in small chunks on cable , perhaps while folding clothes or recovering from a minor illness or hangover .
Wayne ’s World 2 ( 1993 )
Starring : Mike Myers , Dana Carvey , Christopher Walken , Tia Carrere , Chris Farley , Ralph Brown , James Hong , Lee Tergesen
Based on : the characters from the original “ Wayne ’s World ” film .
Premise : After meeting Aerosmith backstage at one of their shows , Wayne has a vision where a naked Indian tells him that he needs to organize a massive music festival .
Cassandra is out of town working on her debut album , and her producer ( Christopher Walken ) persuades her into leaving Wayne behind .
Garth meets a beautiful older woman ( Kim Basinger ) , though her interest in Garth is less than honorable .
Reasons to watch :
While the movie is n’t a complete loss , it is more or less the same as the first , three endings and all .
Perhaps sensing this , they stunt - casted the bejeezus out of it , and one of those cameos literally saves the movie when a gas station employee , who only has one scene but a powerful one , is replaced by Charlton Heston , who proceeds to make Wayne cry with his performance .
The poorly dubbed martial arts battle between Cassandra ’s father and Wayne was also way ahead of the curve in terms of the influence of Asian cinema in America .
Reasons to avoid :
The movie is a lot like a “ Family Guy ” episode : a thin story fleshed out by cut - aways to this or that riff on another pop culture phenomenon , in this case “ The Doors , ” “ The Graduate ” and “ Thelma & Louise , ” to name but a few .
Dana Carvey had left “ SNL ” by the time the movie opened , and the sense of ‘ too little , too late ’ is hard to shake .
It ’s Pat ( 1994 )
Starring : Julia Sweeney , Dave Foley , Charles Rocket , Kathy Griffin , Julie Hayden , Beverly Leech , Kathy Najimy
Based on : the “ Pat ” sketches , which revolved around a sexually - ambiguous character and others ’ attempts to determine her gender .
Premise : Pat Riley ( Sweeney ) is constantly moving from job to job , looking for a definitive walk of life but failing at every turn .
Enter Chris ( Foley ) , who ’s just as gender - indeterminate as Pat .
The two fall in love … do n’t ask who wears the pants in that relationship … but things begin to fall apart when Pat still fails at every attempt at finding a new career .
Meanwhile , Pat ’s neighbor Kyle ( Rocket ) , is on a quest to figure out whether Pat ’s male or female .
But will he succeed …?!?
Reasons to watch : I believe it ’s universally accepted that the only real reasons to watch “ It ’s Pat ” are to see the segments of the film which feature Camille Paglia and Ween , but there ’s also a certain percentage of the population who has watched it in a desperate attempt to pick out any lines which may have come from the pen of Quentin Tarantino .
( He reportedly went over the script – uncredited , naturally – as a favor to Sweeney . )
Additionally , “ Kids in the Hall ” fans may feel obliged to check it out because of Foley ’s participation .
But they really should n’t .
Reasons to avoid : Nathan Rabin of The Onion A.V. Club described the film as “ simultaneously intriguing and repulsive , a would - be cult curio not even the most indulgent cult could love . ”
Is that enough of a reason for you ?
Stuart Saves His Family ( 1994 )
Starring : Al Franken , Laura San Giacomo , Vincent D’Onfrio , Shirley Knight , Harris Yulin , Lesley Boone , John Link Graney , Marjorie Lovett , Walt Robles , Erik Cord , Denver Mattson
Based on : the “ Daily Affirmation With Stuart Smalley ” sketches .
( Well , technically , it ’s based on Franken ’s book , which expanded on the sketches , but the sketches came first . )
Premise : Caring nurturer , member of several 12 - step programs , and fired cable access host Smalley must deal with his multiply dysfunctional family while struggling with his overeating , codependence , and the “ stinkin ’ thinkin ' ” that tells him he really might not be good enough or smart enough .
Reasons to watch : Written by and starring the current junior senator from Minnesota and directed by Harold Ramis ( “ Groundhog Day ” ) , this broad comedy with very serious overtones is better than you might think for the same reason the SNL sketches work : it ’s firmly grounded in reality .
Franken is an open member of Al - Anon — a 12 - step group for family members of addicts — and has proudly noted that “ Stuart Saves his Family ” is used in drug and alcohol treatment programs .
That ’s not to say you have to be immersed in the world of recovery to get the jokes , though it might help .
One big plus is a solid supporting cast , including Laura San Giacomo as Stuart ’s Al - Anon sponsor , Vincent D’Onofrio as his pothead brother , and Harris Yulin as his verbally abusive alcoholic father .
Still , this is Franken ’s show .
As always , his sincerely nutty performance as the goodhearted but occasionally self - loathing T.V. personality with atrocious taste in sweaters and ambiguous sexual preferences is , by our lights , a creation of comic genius .
Reasons to avoid : Al Franken admits that his “ wet dream ” is that his political arch - enemy , Rush Limbaugh , was forced to watch “ Stuart Saves His Family ” during his time in rehab .
Indeed , people who despise the senator for his devoutly liberal political activities , or who simply think he ’s not funny , may consider it a punishment for past sins .
Even if you are a fan , there ’s a reason this woolly film failed badly at the box office and bombed with most critics .
All in all , if you do n’t find the Stuart Smalley sketches completely hilarious , you should probably stay away …unless , of course , you ’re a right - wing radio host recovering from an Oxycontin binge .
Blues Brothers 2000 ( 1998 )
Starring : Dan Aykroyd , John Goodman , Joe Morton , J. Evan Bonifant , Nia Peeples , Aretha Franklin , James Brown , Jonny Lang , Eddie Floyd , Wilson Pickett , Sam Moore , Erykah Badu
Based on : the characters from the original “ Blues Brothers ” film .
Premise : Elwood Blues ( Aykroyd ) gets out of prison and , as he ’s now suddenly a solo act , tries to find his place in the world .
Inevitably , he ends up deciding to get the band back together , finding a new partner in the form of Mighty Mack ( Goodman ) .
There ’s also a subplot involving a 10 - year - old orphan , along with a somewhat nonsensical storyline about Elwood ’s newly discovered semi-brother , Cab ( Morton ) , who turns out to be a Commander in the Illinois State Police .
Reasons to watch :
You would be hard pressed to come up with a more perfect …or more depressing … opening for the film , which plays off the opening of the original .
This time , however , it ’s Elwood Blues who ’s finally getting out of prison , and when he steps outside the gates , there is no Jake to pick him up , leaving him to wait in vain for someone to pick him up .
It seems no one ever told him that his brother died .
Harsh , sure , but talk about your promising beginnings , and while the “ we ’re getting the band back together ” plotline is unabashedly recycled from the first film , it ’s still fun to see where the members of the Blues Brothers Band ended up .
Lastly , you ca n’t have a “ Blues Brothers ” movie without some decent tunes , and Aretha belting out “ Respect ” certainly qualifies , as do Eddie Floyd and Wilson Pickett teaming up on “ 634-5789 , ” a number which now belongs to … sigh … a phone sex line .
Reasons to avoid :
The film does n’t come anywhere close to maintaining the promise of the opening .
For one thing , the desire to make things more appealing to a younger demographic results in such travesties as shoehorning Jonny Lang into the aforementioned performance of “ 634-5789 ” and having Elwood cross paths with John Popper of Blues Traveler , who – shocker !
– just happens to be a huge Blues Brothers fan .
Ultimately , though , the film ’s biggest problem is that no one in the cast can capably fill John Belushi ’s shoes , which leaves Aykroyd floundering and the audience wanting to just go back and watch the original film instead .
A Night at the Roxbury ( 1998 )
Starring : Will Ferrell , Chris Kattan , Loni Anderson , Dan Hedaya , Molly Shannon , Dwayne Hickman , Chazz Palminteri , Colin Quinn , Gigi Rice , Elisa Donovan , Lochlyn Munro , Jennifer Coolidge , Richard Grieco
Based on : the “ Roxbury Guys ” sketches .
Premise : The Butabi brothers – Steve ( Ferrell ) and Doug ( Kattan ) – may sell fake plants at their father ’s store by day , but when the sun goes down , they dance the night away at the hottest nightclubs in town … provided , of course , that they can get in .
Their Holy Grail continues to be the famed Roxbury , but after a chance meeting with former “ 21 Jump Street ” star Richard Grieco , Steve and Doug make it into the club , are introduced to the owner of the Roxbury , Mr. Zadir ( Chazz Palminteri ) , who wants to hear their ideas for their own club .
Unfortunately , they make an enemy of Zadir ’s driver / bodyguard , Dooey ( Colin Quinn ) , who keeps them away from his boss .
Will they ever get the opportunity to pitch their idea , or will they be stuck working for their dad forever ?
Reasons to watch :
The chemistry between Ferrell and Kattan is solid , and it ’s a rare attempt to see Ferrell taking the backseat and letting his co-star take the comedic reigns as often as not .
It should come as no surprise that the dance sequences are well choreographed , but i’s also a very interesting ensemble cast , including Dwayne Hickman ( “ The Many Loves of Dobey Gillis ” ) , Loni Anderson ( “ WKRP in Cincinnati ” ) , and the aforementioned Mr. Grieco .
Reasons to avoid :
If the above premise feels a little thin to hang an entire movie on , go with that feeling .
Of all the sketches that could ’ve been turned into feature - length films , this is one that invariably leaves people shaking their heads and wondering why they thought it had that kind of potential .
Office Space ( 1999 )
Starring : Ron Livingston , Jennifer Aniston , David Herman , Ajay Nadu , Diedrich Bader , Stephen Root , Gary Cole , Richard Riehle , Alexandra Wentworth , Joe Bays , John C. McGinley , Paul Wilson , Greg Pitts
Based on : the animated “ Milton ” shorts , created by Mike Judge and aired on “ SNL ” in the mid-1990s .
Premise : Peter Gibbons ( Livingston ) is a programmer at Initech , and he ’s bored both at the office and in his romantic relationship .
After an ill - begotten attempt at hypnotherapy with his fiancee , however , Peter finds himself locked into a state of total relaxation , which leads him to tell the truth at every opportunity .
His co-workers Samir ( Nadu ) and Michael ( Herman ) are concerned at his change in personality , but they ’re also a little envious of it , too .
Less thrilled is their boss , Bill Lumberg ( Cole ) , but a pair of visiting efficiency experts – played by McGinley and Wilson – are impressed by Peter ’s frankness and promote him .
Unfortunately , Samir and Michael end up being downsized , leading to a revenge plot against the company .
Oh , hey , we forgot to talk about Milton ( Root ) … but , then , that stands to reason : no one ever remembers Milton .
Reasons to watch :
It ’s a full - fledged comedy classic , the kind where , should you happen upon it while you ’re flipping channels , you ’ll be stuck watching the rest of it .
With a storyline you can relate to and dialogue you ca n’t help but quote back ad nauseum , it ’s one of the best comedies of the 1990s , possibly of all time .
Reasons to avoid :
Are there any ?
Even if you ’ve never worked in a traditional office environment , you can still appreciate the concepts of an obnoxious boss and sketchy co-workers .
Maybe the romantic angle of the film is n’t as compelling as it could be , but even then , you still get to look at Jennifer Aniston , so it ’s hard to complain too much .
Superstar ( 1999 )
Starring : Molly Shannon , Will Ferrell , Elaine Hendrix , Harland Williams , Mark McKinney , Glynis Johns , Jackson Blicker , Gerry Bamman , Emmy Laybourne , Jennifer Irwin , Tom Green , Chuck Campbell
Based on : the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches , about a hyperactive Catholic schoolgirl prone to mood swings .
Premise : Mary Katherine Gallagher ( Shannon ) longs to be a superstar , so that she might get the chance to kiss the elusive Sky Corrigan ( Ferrell ) , and just to make sure she ’s ready when the time comes , she practices on any inanimate object that ’s handy … like , say , a tree .
To try to get in Sky ’s good graces , Mary decides to try out for the school talent show , against the wishes of her grandmother ( Glynis Johns ) .
Will Grandma come around ?
Will Mary finally get to kiss
Sky ?
Reasons to watch :
There ’s a reason why Molly Shannon has been likened to Gilda Radner on countless occasions : she ’s a gifted physical comedienne , and she gets the opportunity to demonstrate her fearlessness on several occasions during the film .
There are also quite a few funny jabs at Catholicism … but , then , if you ’re Catholic , that probably would n’t be in the “ pro ” column .
Reasons to avoid : Mary Katherine is a strange , creepy character who is n’t nearly funny enough to sustain a film .
Even an 81 - minute run time filled with an excess of Catholic schoolgirl uniforms can’t make this worth watching .
The Ladies Man ( 2000 )
Starring : Tim Meadows , Karyn Parsons , Billy Dee Williams , John Witherspoon , Jill Talley , Lee Evans , Will Ferrell , Sofia Milos , Eugene Levy , Ken Hudson Campbell , Kevin McDonald , Tamala Jones , Julianne Moore
Based on : the “ Ladies Man ” sketches , about the sex therapy call - in show hosted by Leon Phelps .
Premise : When Leon Phelps ( Meadows ) is fired from his radio talk show , his dedicated producer , Julie ( Parsons ) , quits in protest , and the two go on a quest to find new jobs .
At the same time , however , there grows a large group of disgruntled husbands and boyfriends whose significant others have fallen prey to Leon ’s charms , if you take my meaning .
Will Leon find a new job before he ’s strung up for his crimes against fidelity ?
And how long will it take for him to realize that he and Julie would make a cute couple ?
Reasons to watch : First and foremost , the film ’s framing device involves Leon pouring his heart out to a kindly bartender played by the one and only Billy Dee Williams .
Also , though they may be easy jokes , you still ca n’t help but laugh at gags like Leon ’s place of residence ( the Skank - tuary ) and his decidedly retro fashion sense .
And dig that classic R&B soundtrack .
Mmmm-mmmm , that sure sounds sweet to me …
Reasons to avoid :
It tends toward being just as lowbrow as you ’d expect from a film about an amateur sex therapist , occasionally going even lower than that .
And , seriously , how the hell did Julianne Moore end up in here ?
Bloopie the Clown , indeed .
Harold ( 2008 )
Starring : Spencer Breslin , Cuba Gooding Jr. , Ally Sheedy , Stella Maeve , Nikki Blonsky , Rachel Dratch , Elizabeth Gillies , Nicola Peltz , Fred Willard
Based on : a one - off sketch about a teenage boy who suffers from early - onset male pattern baldness .
Premise : Harold ( Spencer Breslin ) , the aforementioned teenage boy , has managed not only to survive in his hometown of Douglasville but , indeed , to thrive amongst the populace .
Unfortunately , his mother ( Ally Sheedy ) has gotten a new job which necessitates a move to the city of Fredericksburg , and …well , let ’s just say that the folks there are n’t nearly as used to the sight of a 14 - year - old with the hairline ( and temperament ) of a man in his early 50s .
Although he finds himself somewhat of an outcast in school , banished to the table in the lunchroom inhabited by nerds , fat kids , and foreign students , Harold finds that Fredericksburg ’s unfamiliarity with his appearance can help him to win friends – at least temporarily , anyway – by buying them beer .
With a little additional assistance from a kindly janitor ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , Harold attempts to take the school by storm and win the hearts of his classmates … and if that does n’t work , then he can always try to win the upcoming go - kart race .
Reasons to watch : Sure , it ’s ridiculous , but it ’s sweet at heart , and the occasional knowing wink at the audience makes it go down more smoothly .
Cuba Gooding , Jr. is actually pretty funny ( sometimes you almost forget that he ’s got it in him ) , and Elizabeth Gillies – now starring in Nickelodeon ’s “ Victorious ” – will remind every guy of an ill - advised crush of their own : you know it ’s never going to work out , but her complete cuteness shorts out your common sense .
Reasons to avoid : Like so many of the “ SNL ” films that have preceded it , the one - joke premise – he ’s young , but he looks and acts like he ’s old !
– is pretty thin when stretched to the length of a feature film .
There ’s also the fact that , even with male - pattern baldness , only the dumbest person alive would think that Harold was a middle - aged man .
While that might let out the convenience store cashier who sells him beer , there ai n’t enough suspension of disbelief on the planet to accept that a doctor would ever reach the point of performing a prostate exam on him .
No , not even one played by Fred Willard .

By using entire islands as experimental laboratories , two Dartmouth biologists have performed one of the largest manipulations of natural selection ever conducted in a wild animal population .
Their results , published online on May 9 by the journal Nature , show that competition among lizards is more important than predation by birds and snakes when it comes to survival of the fittest lizard .
" When Tennyson wrote that nature is 'red in tooth and claw ' , I think the image in his head was something like a Discovery Channel version of a lion chasing down a gazelle " said Ryan Calsbeek , an assistant professor of biology at Dartmouth College and a co-author of the study .
" While that may often be the case , intense natural selection can also arise through competition .
Sometimes , death by competitor can be more important than death by predator . "
To show this effect , the researchers covered multiple small islands in the Bahamas with bird - proof netting to keep predatory birds at bay .
Other islands were left open to bird predators , and on still other islands , the researchers added predatory snakes to expose the lizards to both bird and snake predators .
Next , they tracked the lizards over the summer to record which lizards lived and which died on the different islands .
" We found repeated evidence that death by predators occurred at random with respect to traits like body size and running ability " said Robert Cox , a post - doctoral researcher at Dartmouth and Calsbeek 's co-author .
" But we also found that increasing the density of lizards on an island consistently created strong natural selection favoring larger size and better running ability . "
Calsbeek and Cox explain that in high - density populations , the intensity of competition for food , space , and other resources is likely to increase .
In turn , this increased competition favors the biggest , toughest lizards on the island .
" The lizards play for keeps , " said Calsbeek , " and there 's no room for the meek when times get tough . "
Though the researchers note that competition will not always be more important than predation in other species or in different environments , they emphasize that their study has broad social implications because it demonstrates the ability to conduct evolutionary experiments in natural animal populations .
" Many people are skeptical of evolutionary biology because they perceive it as a purely historical science that can't be tested experimentally .
Here , we 're providing a real experimental test of natural selection as it happens in the wild .
That 's an exciting way for us to advance the public 's perception of evolution " said Calsbeek .

So awhile ago I mentioned that I was trying to add a new shared - memory cache for the next version of the KDE platform .
It ’s almost done now , and has been submitted for review ( both old - skool on kde - core - devel , and all Web 2.0 - style on our review board ) .
Given the number of things I had to think about while implementing it ( and I promise you that even still it ’s not fully as thought - out as it could be ) , I decided that I could probably make a half - decent , if very technical series of posts about the implementation process .
I ’ve got a basic outline set out , but without further ado , I ’ll go over in this post what exactly a shared - memory cache is , why KDE has one now , and why I ’m trying to make a different one .
Why a shared - memory cache ?
Most of the programmer types are already familiar with the idea of a cache :
You have some input that is n’t particularly helpful right now , you have a function to turn that non-helpful input into something you can use , but that function takes awhile to run .
So , you save the output of that function ( the value ) once , somewhere where you can refer to it later ( by a key ) if you need it .
The idea is to trade some extra memory usage for reduced time requirements .
Caching is used everywhere , in your CPU , in your Web browser , the operating system , and more .
Now , the shared - memory part allows this cache to be shared between running processes ( if you do n’t know what a process is , just think of it as an instance of a running program .
Each different instance , even of the same program , would be a different process ) .
The operating system normally does a very good job of making sure that different processes can’t interfere with each other , but there are times when it makes sense to open a couple of gateways between them to let them share the burden .
In KDE ’s case , many of the icons used by a standard KDE application will be used unchanged by other KDE programs , so it makes sense for us to cache generated icons for use by other KDE program .
We could simply write the icons out to disk where other programs could read them , but putting them into shared memory allows for the near - immediate transfer of that data without any disk I/O .
I ’d like to find examples of current shared - memory caches ( besides our current KPixmapCache ) , but the only ones I can find are the fully distributed type like memcached .
Cairo has a cache for glyphs , but that seems to be done per-process .
GTK + has a cache which is designed to be read in directly using mmap ( 2 ) , but not necessarily to be accessed via shared memory .
Let me know if you find any though !
So again , in our case we use a shared - memory cache in large part to handle icon loading and Plasma themes ( both potentially heavy users of SVG icons ) .
This gives us two speedups : 1 ) We do n’t always have to re-generate a pixmap from the source data ( a very big speedup when the source is an SVG ) , and 2 ) If one process generates a pixmap , every other KDE process can get access to the results nearly instantly .
What KDE currently does
My interest in shared - memory caching came about from looking into some bugs reported against our current cache , KPixmapCache , which was developed in conjunction with the lead - up to KDE 4.0 to allow the new Plasma subsystem and the existing icon subsystem to use the fancy SVG graphics without taking forever .
In addition , KPixmapCache had a feature where not only could it cache the image data ( the 0’s and 1 ’s that make up the image itself ) , but also the resulting QPixmap handle to the image as it exists in “ the graphics memory ” ( I ’ll gloss over the distinction for now , it will be important in a future part ) .
KPixmapCache is implemented by hosting two different files in a known location , one ending in .index and the other ending in .data .
Respectively these files hold the index metadata needed for the cache to work , and the actual image data .
Anytime you talk about shared resources , you also need to think about how to protect access to those shared resources to keep everything consistent .
KPixmapCache uses the trusty KLockFile to protect against concurrent access ( this has the benefit of being safe if the partition is mounted on NFS , although I think the reason is more because that ’s what already existed in kdelibs ) .
From there , KPixmapCache uses a sorted binary tree ( sorted by the hash code ) to manage the index , and treats the .data file as a simple block of memory .
Every time a new item is entered into the cache , a new chunk of free space is allocated from the .data file , even if there already exists empty space .
Likewise , if a new index entry is required to insert an item , it is always added at the end of the index ( with one exception , when overwriting an existing index entry due to a hash collision ) .
I said the index was sorted earlier , but that might seem incompatible with always adding new entries at the end .
What the implementer did to solve this problem is hold pointers to the actual children and parent in each index item , that way a virtual hierarchy could be arranged .
The binary tree is never re-arranged ( like in AVL trees or red - black trees ) , so the initial root node is always the root node .
The overall structure looks like this figure :
One disadvantage to this architecture is that it is difficult and inefficient to delete entries that should be expired out of the cache .
Properly removing an entry would require possibly having to move entries in the data file in order to minimize fragmentation .
This alone would n’t be a large deal ( I end up having to do the same thing in KSharedDataCache ) , but updating the .index file is even harder , since it requires updating information for both parent and children ( although again , not impossible by any means ) .
Avoiding fragmentation in the index would require either moving nodes around in the index file ( possibly recursively ) , or having to scan for the first free node when adding items .
None of these are big problems , but it does make the implementation more annoying .
KPixmapCache worked around all of this by punting the problem :
No entries ever got removed until the cache filled up .
At this point the entries would be ranked by whatever the expiration policy in effect was ( i.e. least recently used preferred , newest preferred , etc. ) , a new ( smaller ) cache would be constructed holding the most - desired entries , and the old cache would be deleted .
Although infrequent , this could possibly take a not - insignificant amount of time when it did happen .
So why a new implementation ?
Probably the one thing that led to me starting from a different architecture however , was the interface to KPixmapCache :
It is designed to be subclassed , and to allow subclasses access to both the index and individual data items through a QDataStream ( see KIconCache for an example usage ) .
Doing this meant the internal code had to use a QIODevice to interface to the data and index , and so what ends up happening is that even though KPixmapCache tries to place all of the data in shared memory , it always ends up accessing it like it was a disk file anyways ( even though a memory - to - QIODevice adapter is used ) .
Having to support subclassing ( in the public API no less ) makes changing many of the implementation details a journey fraught with hazard , and it ’s bad enough that any little problem in KPixmapCache seemingly guarantees a crash .
Since KPixmapCache is used in very core desktop platform code ( Plasma and KIconLoader ) I knew I wanted to go a different direction .
So , I started work on a “ KIconCache ” .
However all the work I was doing was hardly specific to icons , and when I ’d heard of a developer that was abusing KPixmapCache to hold non-image - data somehow , I decided to make a generic shared - memory cache , KSharedDataCache .
Next post I ’ll try to explain the direction I decided to take with KSharedDataCache .
After a disturbing post - apocalyptic ( or was it simply apocalyptic ? ) week , we ’re bringing you a throwback tale of simpler times when the highlight of your year is when the Muni driver let you in on a few secrets .
Today ’s podcast episode was brought to you by rider Tara , who caught a Muni driver in a bit of a casual mood and fun ensues .
Yes , a Muni ride that was actually …fun !
I hurry over to a bus , after seeing it parked at the stop I needed .
No need to hurry , though .
The driver jogged up behind me , asked where I was headed , and if I wanted a ride .
I naturally assume this is driver humor ; Haha !
A ride , I get it .
On the bus that I was trying to get on , that ’s going to the very neighborhood I needed ?
Ha !
I guess it was n’t really a joke .
I walked over to the doors as he unlocked them , and saw the number for a line I totally did n’t want .
At this point , Woman Reflex kicked in .
Is this the worst kind of Muni Loony , the kind who beat up or killed a real Muni driver and stole his bus and outfit , and is now giving “ rides ” to women walking around alone ?
Instead of overreacting , I asked him what line this was .
He told me what it was , but said he was just coming off his shift , and was going to be dropping it off at a Muni lot near ( ish ) where I was going .
My intuition is pretty good , it was n’t an odd hour , and I needed to get to where I was going ASAP .
Also , I knew I could deal a pretty hefty kick in the nuts if I needed to , and it was pretty clear that he did n’t have a gun in his Muni outfit .
My intuition served me well , because he was indeed harmless .
He strapped himself in the driver ’s seat right away , limiting any no - goodnik - mobility , so I relaxed some .
Oh , and I got to change the side and front banners to “ Not in Service . ”
That ’s right .
Did you miss it ?
I got to change the banners to say “ Not in Service . ”
It ’s a pretty simple task on the older buses .
Unlike the digital ones that can probably be changed with a couple stabs at a button , these signs move if you flick a switch that scrolls through all the different Muni numbers .
Indicators from the inside of the bus tell you what it says on the outside , so I stopped once it got to what I wanted .
Easy .
And awesome .
As the Lib - Dems agonise over which way to jump , a fascinating development this afternoon might make them think even harder about accepting David Cameron 's offer .
Alex Salmond , the SNP leader , has urged the Lib - Dems to join in a progressive alliance with Labour , the SNP and Plaid Cymru to bring in electoral reform .
This may seem strange , since on Friday Alex Salmond was telling the BBC's Election programme that he was not going to be part of any coalition .
But what Salmond has now realised is that the numbers are just about there to bring in PR , if all those who want it get together .
Salmond is still not suggesting a formal coalition .
But his intervention gives the lie to one of the most persuasive arguments for the Lib - Dems to join with the Conservative : the maths .
Supporters of a Lib - Dem / Conservative deal argue that the maths do n't add up for anything else .
Labour and the Lib - Dems together would only muster 315 seats , still short of the magic 326 needed for a Commons majority .
Now that Salmond is offering SNP and Plaid Cymru support – even if it is only to bring in PR – that 's another 9 MPs , bringing the numbers to 324 .
Caroline Lucas , the sole Green MP could be expected to join them too – 325 .
Then there are 3 SDLP MPs , or the 1 Alliance MP from Northern Ireland who may lend support and bingo – the once in a lifetime chance to change the electoral system .
As Nick Clegg is discovering today , his party members are far more reluctant to embrace a deal with the Conservatives than he and some of his colleagues .
Interestingly , some Conservatives too are starting to voice their concern about the odd marriage of convenience .
Alex Salmond 's intervention could be critical at this stage – giving Clegg the reason he needs to reject the Tory offer , and to give his party the chance of electoral reform that has been the holy grail for so many years .

McLaren has praised the ' exceptional ' behaviour of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button in being able to fight wheel - to - wheel without colliding .
After a Turkish Grand Prix where Red Bull Racing threw away a 1 - 2 finish when Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel collided , McLaren duo Hamilton and Button raced closely themselves for the lead before cruising home , even though they made contact when fighting for first place .
And McLaren 's chief engineer Tim Goss says the events of the afternoon show how strong McLaren is , and how well Hamilton and Button get on .
" Both our drivers are very , very sensible , " said Goss .
" They both handled themselves particularly well on the circuit and with the media .
" We employ them to be aggressive racing drivers .
They like to fight ; they are both world champions and out to prove they 're the best .
But the way they have handled themselves on the circuit has been absolutely exceptional so far this year .
" There has been more than one occasion when they have been close to one another like that , and the two of them can race and avoid each other - unlike our next - door neighbours [ Red Bull Racing ] who clearly threw an easy one - two away . "
Although Red Bull Racing has enjoyed a car advantage so far this season , it has not been able to stamp its authority on the world championship standings .
Goss believes the situation shows that success in F1 is not just about a good chassis design - it is about how a team works and how its drivers get on .
" You 've got to have a quick car and you have to get it to the finish , " he said .
" In this race Red Bull Racing did not deliver , and they 've not delivered because their two drivers are racing .
Our two drivers were racing , but I think that just shows how well our two drivers can manage themselves on the circuit . "
When asked for his opinion on the Red Bull Racing accident , Goss said : " I 've only read that neither driver says they are to blame .
There is some good footage of the incident , and you just have to look at it and make your own mind up .
But I think Vettel had enough room on the track . "
Which is the worst managed team in the NHL ?
According to this exercise done by Tyler of Mc79hockey , the Edmonton Oilers own that distinction , which he explains using a formula based off of a baseball measure of front office efficiency called Marginal Payroll / Marginal Wins ( adapted to Marginal Payroll / Marginal Points ) :
The Marginal Payroll / Marginal Wins ( MP / MW ) system evaluates the efficiency of a club ’s front office by comparing its payroll and record to the performance it could expect to attain by fielding a roster of replacement - level players , all of whom are paid the major league minimum salary .
The formula is : ( club payroll - ( 28 x major league minimum ) / ( ( winning percentage - .300 ) x 162 )
I think that there ’s a reasonable argument to be made that a replacement level NHL team would play .250 hockey - 41 points , with another couple of points earned through OTL - call it 45 points .
The minimum salary in 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 was $ 450 K and it bumped up to $ 475 K for the past two seasons ; assuming 23 players , that ’s a minimum payroll of $ 10.35 MM in 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 and $ 10.925 MM during the past two seasons .
Tyler has ranked the NHL's thirty teams in terms of dollars spent per marginal point over the past four years to determine which teams have spent their money most efficiently .
The teams that spend less dollars per point are at the top and the teams that spend the most , towards the bottom .
Predictably , the Flames fall somewhere in the middle : not terrible at spending their money , but not terribly efficient either , and by the looks of things , getting worse .
They spend to the cap and achieve decent results , much like the teams around them -- Montreal , New York , and Ottawa .
When I calculated their Marginal $ / Marginal Points for this season alone , it came to a whopping $ 1,013,822 per marginal point , which would put them near the bottom of this chart , just behind the Kings , if it was based on this season alone .
What 's more , the Flames have dropped from 12th in the league by this metric at the end of last season to 14th , signifying that Flames management has gotten worse at spending their money efficiently ; not exactly a small feat after last season 's cap fiasco , when the only thing that saved them from falling any farther down the list was the fact that they had more points than this year 's squad .
Vancouver , Washington , Pittsburgh , Chicago , and Phoenix are all amongst the teams that improved by this metric this season while Nashville , Detroit , San Jose , and New Jersey are amongst the teams that have remained atop the list .
I view this as sort of a double - edged sword .
Teams that have rebuilt since the lockout like Chicago , Pittsburgh , and Washington are now forced to spend more under the cap to retain the talent they 've drafted and remain competitive and teams like Nashville that are forced to shed salary almost every off season and are still able to ice a competitive team through bargain free agent signings and replacement - level players drafted and brought up through the organization .
Tyler goes on to elaborate on his thoughts on Oilers management :
Since Lowe got his budget increase in the summer of 2007 , we ’ve basically witnessed incontrovertible evidence that he has zero idea about how to do things efficiently when he ’s not forced to .
He - and the rest of the hockey people - see a budget as an amount of money that you ’re allowed to spend , rather than an amount that you have available to invest in players who will generate a certain level of return .
The problem with Oilers ’ management , I think , lies with the thought process and approach that they take .
I ’ve basically laid out a case here for the past four years that they are n’t good at recognizing value , they do n’t understand how the CBA works or how to use it to their advantage and that they completely fail to understand the idea that today ’s NHL is an efficiency contest that requires a cold blooded , ruthless analysis of how to spend your dollars and make use of the assets that you have .
This is the area that I 'm most concerned about in relation to Flames management going forward .
Sutter has presented us with ample evidence that he has struggled to understand the rules of the CBA or how the cap works , particularly after his mismanagement of the cap last season prevented the team from dressing a full roster when it was struck by a series of injuries .
It 's become apparent that Sutter prefers to allocate the majority of his dollars to older players who fit his criteria of " experience " and " leadership " and fill the remaining roster slots on the cheap ; this would be fine if the former performed to the level implied by their contracts and if Flames management were better at assessing and retaining young talent .
For every Mark Giordano , Curtis Glencross , or Rene Bourque in Sutter 's good - value stable there 's a Marcus Nilson , Wayne Primeau , or Ales Kotalik , not to mention the albatross that is Steve Staios -- the most recent affront to good value and perhaps the best current example of how not to spend your money efficiently in the cap era when you have an abundance of defensive prospects making league minimum waiting in the wings .
The problem with recognizing value is that it often occurs in hindsight .
GMs have to assign a dollar figure to a player based on the market for that type of player versus a set of expectations for what that player will bring to the team -- how many points they will produce , if they 're a powerplay specialist , if they 're a checking forward in a shutdown role , etc -- which results in so many players being overpayed .
GMs rarely sign a player expecting that he will outperform his contract ; most expect that the player will play to his contract , and anything less is considered a bust .
That 's why we can look at Curtis Glencross and Mark Giordano and Rene Bouque , his new contract nonwithstanding , and say that they 're good value .
Same goes for players like Mikael Samuelsson and Alex Burrows , whereas we can say that Olli Jokinen was not good value and based on their production this year , Jay Bouwmeester , Jarome Iginla and Daymond Langkow were not good value .
Robyn Regehr 's contract , which seemed like good value at the time , now appears to be a problem as the soon - to - be thirty year old defenceman 's injury history catches up with him and unless Kiprusoff follows up his vezina - calibre season next year , it 's safe to assume he will likely follow suit .
Recognizing value in trades is even more difficult because you 're giving up something and taking on a new salary based on expectations of what the player in question is going to bring to the team and that it will make up for or exceed the contribution of the player you parted ways with , unless say , you 're trading Dustin Boyd for a fourth round pick .
Dion Phaneuf was no longer full value compared to his salary so he was traded .
What remains to be seen is if Stajan , Hagman , and specifically White can provide better value for their deals than the old # 3 after an underwhelming twenty - something games for all but the latter , who may not even be wearing Flames colours next season .
Sutter 's carefree doling out of pricey long - term deals and no-movement clauses in the name of loyalty looks poised to hurt the Flames in near future .
He 's spent to the cap or close to it with confidence and for the most part , without consequence , since its inception with fairly average results , and it remains to be seen whether or not he will be able to wiggle himself out of the latest crunch .
I 'm not about to compare Flames management to the team that has run the Oilers into the ground over the past four years after one playoff - less season , but Sutter is gradually heading in their general direction and the remainder of management looks to be along for the ride .
San Francisco wins the title of America's " least wasteful " city , followed by Seattle , New York , Portland , Ore. , and Boston , according to a survey of the 25 largest cities .
The rankings are based on 23 weighted questions that 3,750 people in these cities answered about their living habits , from recycling to using public transportation to turning off the lights when they leave a room .
" Overall , Americans living in the country 's largest cities are making slight improvements to be less wasteful , " finds the second annual survey , conducted by research firm Greenfield Online , for Nalgene , a company that produces BPA - free bottles .
As the 40th anniversary of Earth Day approaches this Thursday , the survey aims to raising awareness about how simple measures can reduce waste and pollution .
The most wasteful U.S. city ?
Houston , followed by Cleveland , Atlanta , Tampa and Indianapolis .

The researchers fitted tags , weighing 0.66g , to 91 Swainson 's thrushes
Even a small urban forest can help migrating birds , a study has said .
US researchers found that birds used the patches of greenery to rest and refuel in the middle of their journey between winter and breeding sites .
The scientists gathered the data by fitting tiny tags to thrushes , which recorded the birds ' movements .
Writing in the journal Landscape Ecology , they added the findings were important because the world was becoming increasingly urbanised .
" With the expansion of urban areas worldwide , migrating songbirds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes where habitat patches are embedded in an urban matrix , " wrote co-authors Stephen Matthews and Paul Rodewald , landscape ecologists at Ohio State University in the US .
" Yet , how migrating birds respond to urbanisation is poorly understood . "
Unique data
In order to learn more , the pair attached small tags to more than 100 Swainson 's thrushes ( Catharus ustulatus ) and managed to gather data on the movements of 91 birds during the four - year study .
SWAINSON'S THRUSHES Scientific name : Catharus ustulatus
Adult length : 16-18cm
Breeding habitat : coniferous and deciduous woodlands
Migrate from breeding sites in Canada and northern US states to Mexico and South America
Diet : insects , fruit and berries
As with all thrush species , they forage on the ground
Research suggests that the bird " splits " its brain during migration ; one half sleeps while the other half remains awake
" The tags provided us with a unique data - set on migration during a stopover , " Dr Matthews told BBC News .
" We were able to record how long the birds were staying , and we found that it was not necessarily the forest size that was influencing the birds .
" Instead , they were responding to internal factors , such as [ the amount of ] fat reserves they had . "
He added that the importance of the urban tree cover was highlighted when they examined the area the birds were using to forage for food .
" We started to see the importance of these smaller forest patches .
" The birds ability to search around was limited by the extent of these forested areas . "
The study examined seven urban forests , the smallest of which was an arboretum that covered less than one hectare .
" It seemed that the birds were able to utilise these small forest patches during their stopover , " Dr Matthews observed .
" In five of the sites , the birds never left the forest patch ... and were not exploring in folks ' backyards . "
The team collected the data by using radio - transmitter tags .
" The tags were very small , weighing an average of 0.66g , and we glued them to the back feathers of the birds using a very mild adhesive , " he explained .
" The battery life only lasted a couple of weeks , so the transmitter just fell off after a short while . "
Dr Matthews said the tiny tags emitted a signal that they could pick up via a hand - held receiver and record the birds ' locations .
" We recorded the GPS location , and then we would go back and do the analysis [ of the birds ' movements ] later .
It would have been nice if it was all automated , but there was a little bit of fieldwork involved .
The researchers said that migration had been identified as a critical period in the annual cycle of migratory birds .
" Within migration , land birds spend up to 90 % of their time resting and regaining energy at stopover sites , making habitat a key component , " they explained .
" This information is necessary to evaluate the conservation importance of urban habitats for stopover migrants . "
" These findings suggest that remnant forests within urban areas have conservation value for Swainson 's thrushes and , potentially , other migrant land birds , " Professor Rodewald said .
" Obviously , larger forest patches are better , but even smaller ones are worth saving . "

Then you walk through the creek while I sit on your back .
Split / Second - I will honor them by maintaining the slash - is an incredibly solid product .
You can play the demo as many times as I did , which ( between you and me ) could well be described as a fuck - ton , and emerge from it with a sense that you have a firm handle on its bombast and can therefore skip the final release .
It will be more of this , you might say to yourself .
You ’d be wrong ; I certainly was .
Would you be surprised to learn that the demo map might be the least ridiculous one on offer ?
Or that its got alternate gameplay modes that split the difference between balls - out racing and bullet - hell shmups ?
They maintain that demo polish throughout the experience with frankly amazing UI work , amazing car design , and everything refined down into an infinitely suckable lozenge .
Alright , the joy portion of the presentation is over .
I am as angry as I could possibly be at Blur , as a videogame , and at its black womb Bizarre Creations .
The last time I saw a product this unstable was with Rainbow Six : Raven Shield and Pandora Tomorrow - their server browsers ( remember those ? ) would crash one - hundred percent of the time if populated with more than a certain number of hosts .
Before that it was Tribes 2 , a noble game , but delivered in such ruins that ( as I have said ) they once released a patch that removed the previous patch .
Once we ’d obtained sufficient level to take part in Blur ’s Team Racing modes , things went desperately awry .
Blur might crash three times in an hour , hard locks that necessitate manual shutdown .
I have often said that , more often than not , fond wishes for improvement between the “ beta ” phase and the retail shelf are misspent .
This is n’t something that happens a statistically significant percentage of the time .
This , however , is something new : a retail release that appends to its previously smooth contours row upon row of toxic barbs .
I ’ve always felt like I understood something about Bizarre Creations games , that their thesis was one with which I was perhaps uniquely resonant : the joy of a perfect run , pegged somewhere between mastery and the Zen moment .
There ’s definitely something to like about Blur , and we put up with it for a few nights .
In an effort to wring some juice out of my purchase I plowed myself into the ordinary , reliable part of the game , the single player , finding it ordinary and reliable - something had happened .
Some quality previously held by Blur had evaporated , and like Modern Warfare 2 , the urge to continue moving my hands on the controller in the interim period between these betrayals was gone .
I ’m incredibly ashamed to have recommended it .

For that dubious distinction , we pay a high price .
The obese are more likely to be depressed , to miss school or work , to feel suicidal , to earn less , and to find it difficult to marry .
And their health care costs a lot .
Obese Americans spend about 42 percent more than healthy - weight people on medical care each year .
Improper weight and diet strongly correlate with chronic diseases , which account for three - fourths of all health - care spending .
Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading drivers of rising costs for Medicare patients , and 60 percent of cases result directly from weight gain .
In short , even as the nation is convulsed by a political struggle to “ reform ” health care , no effort to contain its costs is likely to succeed if we ca n’t beat obesity .
The good news , if you can call it that , is that the rate of increase in obesity in the United States seems to be slowing .
The bad news is that no one knows exactly why .
And the debate on how to deal with obesity remains frozen .
On one side are the proponents of individual responsibility , who believe that fat people suffer from a surplus of self - indulgence and a shortage of willpower .
On the other are people who believe that Americans are getting fatter because of powerful environmental factors like cheap corn , fast food , and unscrupulous advertising .
Each side is held in political check by the other , and both have advocated unrealistic solutions : diets and exercise programs and miracle drugs that do n’t work versus massive , and in many cases punitive , government interventions that are politically impossible .
I ’m intimately acquainted with the struggle against fat .
I may have been skinny as a child — my family used to joke about putting meat on my bones — and I played sports in school , but by the time I was bar mitzvahed , I was overweight .
In my 20s , I spent hundreds of hours with personal trainers and diet doctors , and tried virtually every popular diet at least once .
Lots of money in the pockets of the gurus ; no joy for me .
Approaching the age of 30 , I passed the nebulous but generally accepted clinical threshold separating the merely overweight from the obese : a ratio of weight ( in kilograms ) to the square of height ( in meters ) of 30 or more .
( A body - mass index , or BMI , of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered “ normal ” ; from 25 to 29.9 is considered “ overweight . ” )
I also developed severe diabetes and sleep apnea .
My aching back was the least of my problems .
Perhaps my own losing struggle with weight reflects a failure of willpower .
That seems more plausible to me than the argument that I was a helpless victim of Arby ’s .
But most fat people are n’t like me : as an upper - middle - class professional , I could draw on plenty of resources in my battle against weight .
The people most vulnerable to obesity , however , do not have access to healthy food , to role models , to solid health - care and community infrastructures , to accurate information , to effective treatments , and even to the time necessary to change their relationship with food .
And if that is true for fat adults , it is even more true for fat children , many of whose choices are made for them .
Their vulnerability to obesity is much more the result of societal inequalities than of any character flaw .
Indeed , for all the attention paid to fat ’s economic costs , the epidemic ’s toll on children is a stark reminder of its moral dimension .
Without some form of intervention , researchers worry , large numbers of black and Hispanic children in the United States will grow up overweight or obese and lead shorter , less fulfilling lives .
Is that a legacy we want to live with ?
Trapped in traffic on Interstate 694 last Monday , Terry Green had time to think about the important things in life .
Like the idiots trying to cut in front of her .
She was stuck in a single lane of cars nearing a construction zone .
But in the open lane next to her , drivers occasionally zipped past , assuming someone would let them in at the end .
She ’d never do that .
“ People would think I ’m a jerk , ” said Green , who lives in Woodbury .
But it turns out that the idiots are doing the right thing — according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation .
Traffic engineers believe Minnesota Nice becomes Minnesota Nincompoop when two lanes are marked to merge into one and that “ good manners ” cause gridlock .
“ It drives me crazy when I see that , ” said Kent Barnard , spokesman for MnDOT ’s metro district .
“ Simple physics will tell you it ’s better to use both lanes up to the merge point . ”
MnDOT is working on a campaign to teach drivers to forget about perceived politeness — and fill lanes whenever they are open .
“ We are brainstorming about it , ” Barnard said .
“ We are trying to come up with a catchy slogan . ”
So far , they ’ve only been able to describe the correct way of driving as “ Late Merge , ” which is n’t exactly poetic .
Minnesota drivers tend to line up in a single lane far before a construction zone — which greatly slows traffic .
Barnard calls the preferred method the “ zipper , ” in which cars fill both lanes and then alternate at the point of merger like the teeth of a zipper to form one line .
Various studies have shown the method speeds traffic by 20 percent and slashes the length of traffic back - ups by 35 percent .
The idea of forming a single - file line when there are two lanes open may be well - intentioned , Barnard said .
“ But it defies logic .
There are two lanes for a reason . ”
But to drivers , it ’s not just a traffic jam — it ’s social interaction .
When one driver passes another , it triggers a cascade of emotions slathered in psychology , self - worth , social expectations and ideas of what it means to be Minnesotan .
Passive - aggressive drivers waiting in line see themselves as virtuous and polite .
When they are passed , they feel inferior or stupid .
That ’s when Minnesota Nice becomes Minnesota Knife - in - Your - Back .
Barnard said fights often break out at merger points .
Accidents and even fatalities are common at construction sites , many attributable to angry drivers .
Insulted drivers often retaliate .
In a MnDOT poll , 15 percent of drivers admitted to swerving out of their lane to block what they see as “ rude drivers ” passing them .
Near construction on Interstate 694 in Oakdale , trucks have swerved out of the stagnant right lane into the empty left lane — to block the passers .
Two of what Barnard calls “ rolling roadblocks ” were performed during one rush hour .
Minnesotans consider the late mergers akin to someone cutting in line in a supermarket — rude and unfair .
It ’s a lousy analogy , Barnard explained .
At a supermarket , when someone cuts in line , everyone else has to wait longer .
But when a driver in a stagnant line of cars swerves into a passing lane , everyone behind moves up one car - length — and the line gets shorter .
Then , when it ’s time for the two lanes to merge , the rhythmic back - and - forth of alternating cars gets traffic in the single lane more quickly .
Without rules , drivers have to negotiate each merge with hand waves , honking horns or obscene gestures — which is a halting , stop - and - start way to merge .
Jason Douglas is one driver who gets it .
He commutes from Hopkins 20 minutes to his job in Minneapolis .
He always uses open lanes , passes long lines of cars , and then takes his turn at the merger point .
It does n’t make him popular .
He sees plenty of signs of anger , including hand waving , horn honking and middle - finger salutes .
“ But I am not bothered by it , ” he shrugged .
“ It ’s faster . ”
In a traffic jam May 10 , in the pouring rain , Green , of Woodbury , patiently waited in a single - file line on southbound I -694 in Oakdale .
The mile - long line blocked an exit and entrance ramp and delayed traffic by about 25 minutes .
Almost all the cars were in the right lane with Green , leaving the left lane largely unused .
Green knew that was inefficient .
“ We should be filling up the left lane , too , ” she mused , over the beating of her windshield wipers .
“ But it ’s a psychological problem .
We are afraid we wo n’t get in .
And we are afraid of people thinking we are jerks .
“ Is this Minnesota Nice ? ”

Four - way stops should be simple , too .
But …
The meekness of Minnesota drivers also causes problems at four - way stops .
In busy times , with cars waiting at four stop signs , traffic can be maddeningly slow .
The culprit is ignorance about basic rules of driving , said Minnesota Department of Transportation spokesman Kent Barnard .
Drivers are unsure whether an oncoming car turning in front of them has the right - of - way , or in what order cars should proceed .
So drivers often wave or flash lights to yield to another car , leading to the herky - jerky start - stop of uncertain drivers .
Barnard said the rule is simple — the last to the intersection is the last to leave .
When you pull up at a four - way stop , look at the other three drivers .
Each of them should proceed — then you .
In the unlikely event that two drivers arrive next to each other at exactly the same moment , the one on the right has right - of - way .
“ But people do n’t remember that , ” Barnard said .
“ Just wait until all three go , then it ’s your turn . ”

BIG DADDY : William Shatner will reportedly play the title character in the new comedy series based on the Twitter account S**t My Dad Says .
Hollywood will look for inspiration anywhere but a Twitter account being turned into a television show might just be a first .
American television network CBS has announced it has given the green light to a show based on the popular Twitter account @shitmydadsays .
The premise for the Twitter feed is simple , a twenty - something guy moved in with his outspoken elderly father and started tweeting the 74 - year - old 's ribald wisdom and comments .
Examples include :
" I did n't say you were ugly .
I said your girlfriend is better looking than you , and standing next to her , you look ugly . "
" A parent 's only as good as their dumbest kid .
If one wins a Nobel Prize but the other gets robbed by a hooker , you failed . "
The author of the feed , Justin Halpern , has only tweeted just over 100 times but has already turned his popular feed ( more than one million followers ) into a novel that has made the New York Times bestseller list for non-fiction .
Boston Legal star William Shatner will play the father in the new TV series .
Appropriately Shatner shared the news on his Twitter feed , " I 'm on CBS this fall .
I just heard so I 'm passing it on to you !
My best , Bill " .
The comedy is tentatively titled Bleep My Dad Says .
United States President Barack Obama said Friday that he ' strongly ' opposed efforts to single out Israel on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and would oppose actions that jeopardize Israel 's national security .

" We strongly oppose efforts to single out Israel , and will oppose actions that jeopardize Israels national security , " Obama said , adding that " the greatest threat to proliferation in the Middle East , and to the NPT , is Irans failure to live up to its NPT obligations . "
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty review conference adopted Friday a declaration upholding principles of disarmament and calling for an international conference in 2012 with the aim to establish a nuclear - weapon - free Middle East .
The 189 NPT parties also decided to address North Korea in the final declaration , calling on that country to return to negotiations to settle the dispute over its nuclear activities .
The 28 - page declaration was adopted by consensus , closing a month of debate that began on May 3 .
It contains a 22 - point action plan .
U.S. National Security Adviser General James L. Jones also deplored the decision to single out Israel , calling the move " gratuitous " .
" The failure of the resolution to mention Iran , a nation in longstanding violation of the NPT and UN Security Council Resolutions which poses the greatest threat of nuclear proliferation in the region and to the integrity of the NPT , is also deplorable , " Jones said .
Under the NPT 's action plan , the five recognized nuclear - weapon states - the United States , Russia , Britain , France and China - commit to speed up arms reductions , take other steps to diminish the importance of atomic weapons , and report back on progress by 2014 .
The NPT is intended to stop the spread of atomic weapons , though it allowed the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia to keep their arsenals while calling on them to negotiate on disarmament .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the adoption of the declaration and its plan of action .
" A strong spirit of compromise and cooperation has delivered a significant agreement to build a safer and more secure world , " Ban said in a statement .
The action plan " lays the solid foundation to further strengthen the treaty and address the challenges ahead , " Ban said .
He welcomed the nuclear - weapon - states to commit themselves to actions to eliminate nuclear weapons .
Nuclear - weapons - free zones around the world and talks on nuclear disarmament are part of the NPT , which entered into force in 1970 , but has so far failed to get the world 's five nuclear powers to agree on a legal timetable for a total elimination of nuclear weapons .
Those powers - the United States , Russia , France , China and Britain - still resist pressure by other NPT parties to impose such a timeline .
The NPT conference chairman , Philippine Ambassador Libran Cabactulan , has said that the revised draft declaration was " carefully balanced " to reflect demands by all parties .
He said adoption of the declaration would allow " all the seeds of hope planted throughout the conference would bear fruit . "
The declaration called on the UN secretary general , the US , Russia and Britain to designate a facilitator to organize the conference in 2012 to be attended by " all " Middle East nations .
Those three countries co-sponsored a resolution calling for a nuclear - weapons - free Middle East when the NPT met in 1995 .
It said that resolution must be implemented in order to help the peace process in the Middle East region .
It called on Israel to sign the NPT and to place " all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . "
The document called for the total elimination of nuclear weapons , weapons of mass destruction , and chemical and biological weapons in the Middle East .
Sticking Points
The creation of a WMD - free zone would eventually force Israel to declare and abandon its atomic bombs .
U.S. officials say such a zone could not be created without Mideast peace .
Israel , which like nuclear - armed India and Pakistan never signed the NPT , is presumed to have a sizable nuclear arsenal but neither confirms nor denies its existence .
The Obama administration changed U.S. policy by joining Britain , France , Russia and China in backing a Mideast nuclear conference while encouraging Israel to participate .
" We 've got a strong draft that would strengthen all three pillars of the NPT - disarmament , non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy , " a diplomat said .
Britain's chief delegate , Ambassador John Duncan , told Reuters the draft text was " unprecedented " in its scope .
The 2005 NPT review collapsed after participants could not agree on a WMD - free zone in the Middle East and in the face developing nations ' annoyance with the United States for failing to meet previous disarmament pledges .
The creation of such a zone could ultimately force Israel to sign the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and abandon any nuclear weapons it has .
But U.S. officials say this could not happen until there was peace in the region .
( CNN ) -- BP 's CEO said Sunday he 's sorry for the largest oil spill in U.S. history and the " massive disruption " it has caused the Gulf Coast , telling reporters the company hopes to corral most of the crude offshore .
" The first thing to say is I 'm sorry , " Tony Hayward said when asked what he would tell people in Louisiana , where heavy oil has already reached parts of the state 's southeastern marshes .
" We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives .
There 's no one who wants this over more than I do .
I would like my life back . "
Hayward said the company is doing " everything we can to contain the oil offshore , " but , " as far as I 'm concerned , a cup of oil on the beach is a failure . "
Full coverage of oil spill
He said the company now has about 30 aircraft searching for signs of oil and has moved more than 300 people of offshore " floatels " to speed up its response time .
" What we 're not faced with is a complete line of oil coming at us .
It 's more like guerilla insurgency , if I can use military jargon , " he said .
" And what we need to do is have a rapid response capability to get it as we identify it , rather than have it come onto the shore or onto the marsh . "
In other developments late Sunday , a fisherman who was hospitalized after becoming ill while cleaning up oil in the Gulf has filed a temporary restraining order in federal court , asking BP to give the workers masks and not harass workers who publicly voice their health concerns .
Watch :
Are oil booms working ?
BP said it will strengthen its efforts to stop the flow of oil and protect the coastline after the most recent attempt to stop the Gulf oil spill failed .
" We 're disappointed the oil is going to flow for a while and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches , " BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
The most recent setback was the failure of the so - called " top kill " method of pumping mud to plug the leak .
" There was just too much flow , " Dudley said .
Dudley gave some details about the new option : A custom - built cap will be fitted over a piece of equipment called the " lower marine riser package . "
The process will involve a clean cut of the lower marine riser package , where a cap will then be lowered .
The company will circulate warm water around the area to prevent the freezing that hindered a previous dome - cap effort , Dudley said .
BP does not expect to see a large increase , if any , in the volume of oil from cutting the equipment to create a clean surface to cap , he said , though the result will not be a pressure - tight seal .
The long - term solution is the drilling of a relief well that will be in place by August .
BP reported well control problems in March , e-mails show
" If we can contain the flow of the well between now and August and keep it out of the ocean , that 's also a good outcome , " Dudley said .
" And then , if we can shut it off completely with a relief well , that 's not a bad outcome compared to where we are today . "
On Sunday , the Obama administration questioned BP 's oil spill numbers .
On NBC's " Meet the Press , " Carol Browner , Obama 's assistant on energy and climate change , said BP may have had an ulterior motive for underestimating the amount of oil leaking .
Read more about numbers dispute
" BP has a financial interest in these numbers .
They will pay a penalty based on the number of barrels per day , " she said .
BP had originally said about 5,000 barrels of oil per day were leaking .
The latest estimate , Browner said , is between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels per day .
" This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we 've ever faced in this country , " she said .
More oil is leaking into the Gulf of Mexico than any other time in U.S. history , including the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill .
A lot of systems are in place to manage and decrease the amount of oil coming on shore , Browner said .
Controlled burns of oil effective so far , though they have been limited because of weather conditions , she said .
As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , all deepwater operations in the Gulf have been shut down for now , including operating wells , Browner said .
" At the end of the day we will make the right decisions ensuring that our environment is protected , " she said .
Rescuers plan to release a group of birds Sunday that workers washed and rehabilitated after finding them covered with crude , officials said .
A northern gannet and brown pelicans rescued in Louisiana will be transported to a refuge at the mouth of Tampa Bay , Florida , and released Sunday , a statement from the oil spill cleanup command said .
Watch : Marine animals in danger
But officials say more wildlife are at risk as up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil daily continue gushing from an underwater well that engineers have been unable to cap for more than a month .
Top BP executives said Saturday that engineers and scientists had decided to try a new technique of stopping the flow after three attempts to pump mud and 16 tries to stuff solid material into the well failed .
That option : placing a custom - built cap to fit over the " lower marine riser package , " BP chief operation officer Doug Suttles said .
BP crews were already at work Saturday to ready the materials for that method , he said .
" We have not been able to stop the flow , " a somber Suttles told reporters .
" Repeated pumping , we do n't believe , will achieve success , so we will move on to the next option . "
i Report : Track the oil spill
Suttles and other officials said that the " top kill " attempt to stop the flow did so -- but only as long as they were pumping .
When the pumping stopped , the oil resumed its escape .
Suttles said the lower marine riser package cap , which will be ready in four to seven days , " should be able to capture most of the oil " that has fed what is now the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
But , he cautioned , the new cap will not provide a " tight mechanical seal . "
" We 're confident the job will work , but obviously we cannot guarantee success at this time , " he said .
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said that BP would resume using undersea dispersants for the new attempt to trap the oil .
Landry said officials were disappointed by Saturday 's announcement , but noted that the immediate efforts to stop the flow were never intended to be permanent .
" The real solution , the end state , is a relief well , " she said .
BP currently is working on two relief wells , but they are not expected to be ready until August , Suttles said .
Earlier , Suttles said that BP engineers would try to place a second blowout preventer -- the piece of equipment that failed when the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 -- should the lower marine riser package fail .
The failed blowout preventer is a 48 - foot - tall , 450 - ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater .
Suttles and Landry praised the clean - up efforts , however , in light of the failure of the " top kill " attempt to stop the flow .
" It 's a tribute to everybody that we only have 107 miles of shoreline oiled and only 32 acres of marsh , " Landry said .
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser told CNN
Saturday night that BP needed to " step up to the plate tonight to save our wetlands " by using its might to create sand barriers to prevent the oil from moving into the marshes .
The silent environmental crisis
" BP needs to say it will pay to move those dredges and pump that sand berm , " he said .
" We are gonna die a slow death if we do n't get that berm .
We 've got to have that barrier island . "
Sen . Mary Landrieu , a Democrat from Louisiana , echoed the call to bolster barrier islands in a statement Saturday night .
She said BP should immediately invest $ 1 billion to protect marshes , wetlands and estuaries -- giving half the money to short - term projects protecting the Louisiana coast and half to other Gulf Coast states " based on the immediate threat posed by oil spewing from the well . "
President Obama , who toured the area Friday , said federal officials were prepared to authorize moving forward with " a portion of " an idea proposed by local officials , who want the Army Corps of Engineers to build a " sand boom " offshore to keep the water from getting into the fragile marshlands .
But Nungesser said the marshes could n't wait and that the effort needed to start immediately to save the Louisiana wetlands .
A team of oil spill experts were on standby in the United Arab Emirates , ready to help in the Gulf of Mexico cleanup efforts if called to do so , officials in the Middle Eastern country told CNN Sunday .

The United Arab Emirates originally made the offer two weeks ago .
" Basically , it 's an offer made on behalf of the government in recognition of this environmental issue .
It is an offer of support , " said Craig Buckingham of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company .

Thomas Connor ( left ) was pictured on an Angel Delight packet as a child A former child model and his friend have been jailed for life for murdering a doctor in a robbery in a London park .
Nadim Gulamhuseinwala , 32 , was attacked in the early hours of 25 July last year as he walked home through Green Park .
He was hit with a 10kg cast iron fence pole and his face was stamped on , the Old Bailey heard .
He died later .
Angel Delight model Thomas Connor and William Paton , both 20 and from Orpington , Kent , will serve minimum terms of 25 and 23 years respectively .
Both were given concurrent terms of 10 years ' detention for robbery .
Taken cocaine
The trial heard how Dr Gulamhuseinwala had been for a drink after work with a friend in the Funky Buddha nightclub .
He was walking home at about 0400 BST when he stopped near railings in Queen 's Walk , in Green Park , central London , to phone his girlfriend Rebecca Bott .
He was then attacked .
Dr Gulamhuseinwala died in hospital two weeks later from a severe head injury .
The jury heard how Paton and Connor had taken cocaine and had been drinking in a club called the Strawberry Moons that night .
Connor withdrew £ 90 from a cash machine , but was later robbed in Soho .
We will remember him as a unique , loving son
Dr Gulamhuseinwala's father " This seems to have driven him into a towering rage , " said Mr Andrew Edis QC .
" He was angry . "
The pair walked through the alleyways of St James 's to Queen 's Walk .
They sat on a park bench and when they saw Dr Gulamhuseinwala they ran 100 m towards him .
Connor picked up the post and threw it at him .
The money they stole from him was spent on prostitutes .
Judge Stephen Kramer described the doctor as an " admirable and fine man " .
He told the defendants : " You emerged from the shadows with your weapon , you attacked him by throwing it at his head and felled him to the ground . "
The court was told that Connor was " teased and tormented " when children at school found out he was the face of Angel Delight which had " scarred him " .
Dr Gulamhuseinwala's brother Imran told the court in an impact statement : " He was on the verge of an exciting future , full of promise and happiness .
Our lives have been changed forever . "
Outside court , the doctor 's father Vajiuddin Gulamhuseinwala , 73 , from Ealing , west London , said : " He lived for 32 years but achieved twice as much as most people would in 64 years .
" We will remember him as a unique , loving son . "

Conservative Senator Nancy Ruth told a meeting of international women 's equality rights groups Monday morning that it would be best for them to " shut the f -- k up " about their concerns over the government 's maternal health initiative .
Ruth sponsored the meeting on Parliament Hill , in which groups such as the Association for Women 's Rights in Development , Action Aid International and Action Canada for Population and Development participated in a panel discussion questioning Canada 's leadership in the promotion of gender equality and women 's rights .
With the recent controversy about the government 's plans to omit funding for abortion from its maternal health policy for developing countries , the panelists said it was an issue they could n't ignore .
However , during the question and answer period , Ruth advised the room that pushing the abortion issue was not the right strategy if they really wanted progress on the maternal health issue .
Her comments were caught on tape by the Toronto Star .
P.O.V. : G8 abortion debate : Should it be on the agenda ?
" We 've got five weeks or whatever left until the G8 starts .
Shut the f--k up on this issue , " she said .
" If you push it , there 'll be more backlash .
This is now a political football .
This is not about women 's health in this country . "
She went on to say , " Canada is still a country with free and accessible abortion .
Leave it there .
Do n't make this an election issue . "
Afterward , Ruth was asked about her comments .
" I 'm not going to repeat them in front of microphones .
You gotta be crazy . "
She explained that people are more worried about jobs and mortgages .
" To deal with more altruistic things , even though I think we should , is perhaps not relative and not a seller right now . "
" I think it is a mistake to make a public debate about abortion for the G8 . "
' Time to speak out is now '
Liberal MP Dr. Carolyn Bennett said Ruth 's comments shocked the room .
Bennett said she thinks
Ruth 's advice exposes something the government has denied — that for those who speak out against the government , there will be repercussions .
Funding cuts are one example of a repercussion the groups fear .
But the activists say they wo n't be taking Ruth up on her suggestion to keep quiet .
Katherine McDonald is executive director of Action Canada for Population and Development .
" The time to speak out is now .
If we had n't spoken out over the last three months , contraception would not be part of this initiative . "
McDonald is referring to the government 's reversal on its initial announcement that family planning would not be part of the maternal health plan .
Bennett echoed another panelist at the meeting , saying that women in the world did n't achieve what they have over the years by " shutting up . "
You wo n't find many people who think Strikeforce welterweight champion Nick Diaz is a better mixed martial artist than UFC welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre .
But Diaz thinks he 's better than GSP -- and better than every other fighter in the sport as well .
Asked what he wants Japanese fans to see when he fights in Japan on Saturday , Diaz answered , " I 'd like them to see that I 'm the best mixed martial arts fighter pound for pound in the world .
" Asked specifically if he can beat St. Pierre , Diaz answered , Yeah , I think it 's a good fight for me , Georges St - Pierre . "
And he said that his own tenure in the UFC ( Diaz went 6 - 4 in 10 UFC fights ) could have just as easily gone the same way that St. Pierre 's career has gone .
" I was actually in line to do the same stuff he did , " Diaz said .
" I made it to the UFC before him but I was just really young and inexperienced when I got there .
" Noting that all four of his UFC losses were by decision , Diaz maintains that bad judging is the only thing standing between himself and the UFC welterweight title .
" So all those fights that I did n't win , I actually think that I won and on account of that I would have been in line to fight GSP now and I think that I would be in his position , " Diaz said .
" That 's my opinion .
" I do n't know too many MMA fans who agree with that opinion , but I do believe that Diaz is the one welterweight in the world who would have the best chance of defeating St. Pierre .
The UFC is n't particularly interested in signing Diaz because of the headaches he causes outside the cage , but I hope that fight happens some day -- even if I 'm not quite as sold on Diaz as he is on himself .
OTTAWA – Aid experts alarmed by Canada ’s new anti-abortion stand in foreign policy have received some raw political advice from a Conservative senator : “ shut the f --- up ” or it could get worse .
“ We ’ve got five weeks or whatever left until G - 8 starts .
Shut the f--- up on this issue , ” Conservative Senator Nancy Ruth told a group of international - development advocates who gathered on Parliament Hill on Monday to sound the alarm about Canada ’s hard - right stand against abortion in foreign aid .
“ If you push it , there will be more backlash , ” said Ruth , who fears that outrage will push her boss , Prime Minister Stephen Harper , to take further measures against abortion and family planning – abroad , or maybe even in Canada .
“ This is now a political football .
This is not about women ’s health in this country . ”
Last week , Harper ’s government announced that it would no longer be supporting abortion as any part of its foreign - aid focus on maternal health , even though abortion is legal in Canada .
It was a surprise measure from a Conservative prime minister who has so far veered his government away from any overt social conservatism and may haunt Harper into a future election campaign .
Ruth ’s remarks , intended more as friendly advice than a warning , were met with gasps of disbelief and even anger among the approximately 80 aid representatives who converged on Parliament Hill to condemn what they see as a gathering storm against women ’s rights in Canadian aid policy .
Ruth explained that she attends Conservative caucus , understands the current political dynamics and is sympathetic to the cause of women upset by the anti-abortion announcement – “ I just want them to be quiet for five weeks , ” she told reporters .
But few of the advocates appeared inclined to take her counsel .
“ We have shut the f --- up .
That ’ s the issue here , ” said Joanna Kerr , the newly named chief executive of Action Aid International , based in South Africa .
“ There ’s a real chill in Ottawa on speaking out , ” said Betty Plewes , a development consultant and chairperson of Monday ’s meeting , organized around the question of “ where is Canada ’s leadership in the promotion of gender equality and women ’s rights ? ”
One international aid advocate , Lydia Alpizar Duran , from the Association of Women ’s Rights in Development , vowed that Canadian women would have help from other countries if they want to start making noise here .
“ I do n’t remember any women ’s rights ever gained by staying silent , ” she said .
At Monday ’s meeting , Kerr laid out a variety of measures which she says point to a worrying pattern in Canada ’s attention to women ’s rights abroad .
Just days ago , for instance , a 34 - year - old Canadian aid organization devoted to gender equality , Match International , was notified that its funding was being cut .
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae slammed the Conservatives in the Commons on Monday for the Match cuts , asking : “ Just what kind of a grudge does the government have for the women 's organizations around this country that are working so hard for women ? ”
Green Party leader Elizabeth May , who was also on Parliament Hill on Monday to add her voice to the rising chorus against the anti-abortion stand in foreign policy and the cuts to Match , said : “ These are very dark days for women or for any Canadian citizen who looks at our place in the world and wonders : ‘ what are we saying to the rest of the world about what we care about ’ ? ”
Ruth is convinced that the final communiqué of the G8 meeting in Canada in June will include a mention of this country ’s support for family planning , but fears that ongoing furor over abortion could harden the Conservative government ’s stand even more .
And just as her Conservative colleagues have warned repeatedly , she said that Canada does not need a reopened abortion debate .
“ I hope I ’m not proven wrong but I have every confidence that it ( the communiqué ) will include family planning , ” Ruth said .
“ Canada is still a country with free and accessible abortion .
Leave it there .
Do n’t make it into an election issue . ”
Harper ’s announced ban on abortion in foreign - aid programs is an echo of a similar ban that former president George W. Bush also enacted during his eight years in office .
But Harper and his Conservatives say they are simply following the lead of the House of Commons , where a Liberal vote to support “ the full range ” of family - planning options in foreign aid was defeated in March .

The Liberals ’ status - of - women critic , Anita Neville , was in the room as well when Ruth made her comments on Monday and spoke out against any further “ chill ” among people inclined to be critical of Harper ’s decision .
Neville says there ’s enough of that in Ottawa already .
“ I think women have been told too often to be quiet , be good and then you 'll get what you want .
I think that she was saying do n't push the issue or you 'll get the Prime Minister 's back up even further and you wo n't get what you want , ” Neville told reporters later .
“ There was a bit of a shock in the room .
I do n't know that there was anybody in the room that agreed with her .
I think people appreciated her sentiments were well intended but not well received . ”

Scientists at Cornell University , New York , found that people could not predict what the person talking into the mobile would say next - because they had not heard the last words from the person on the other end of the phone .
The standards of refereeing in Formula 1 has been a hotly - disputed topic in recent years after a catalogue of controversial judgements .
For the first time this year experienced racing drivers have been brought in to advise the stewards .
At the same time , the role of permanent steward previously occupied by Alan Donnelly has been abolished .
On the evidence so far this seems to have coincided with a badly - needed outbreak of calm and common sense .
Relying on reprimands
Over the first four races we ’ve seen the stewards avoid using the strongest punishments available to them , opting instead for reprimands .
Here ’s a summary of the major decisions they ’ve taken so far ( ignoring speeding fines and yellow flag infractions outside of the race ) :
Round Driver Infringement Penalty Australia Pedro de la Rosa Impeded another driver in practice Reprimand Australia Mark Webber Collided with Lewis Hamilton Reprimand Malaysia Lewis Hamilton Weaving in front of Vitaly Petrov Black and white flag Malaysia Sebastian Vettel Overtook Jarno Trulli under yellow flags None China Fernando Alonso Jumped start Drive - through China Lewis Hamilton Dangerous driving in pit lane Reprimand China Sebastian Vettel Dangerous driving in pit lane Reprimand
In the case of Webber ’s collision with Hamilton at Australia , this sort of thing has been penalised in the past – for example , when Heikki Kovalainen hit Webber at Spa in 2008 .
Should a failed overtaking attempt that leads to a collision automatically incur a penalty ?
I ’m not convinced it should , and if this is a new interpretation it ’s one I ’m entirely happy with .
Reprimands were also issued for Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel ’s driving in the pit lane at Shanghai , which attracted a huge amount of debate .
First , let ’s clear up the facts : McLaren released Hamilton only fractionally later than Red Bull let Vettel go , certainly not late enough for them to get a penalty for an ‘ unsafe release ’ .
Hamilton ended up side - by - side with Vettel because he got out of his pit box more slowly than the Red Bull driver did .
Hamilton should have eased off the throttle and let Vettel go , but he did n’t , so he got a reprimand .
Vettel should not have edged Hamilton towards the ( vacant ) pit boxes of other teams , but he did , so he also got a reprimand .
I suggest we can only judge whether the stewards got this one right if their decision stops it happening again – because dangerous driving in the pit lane such as this clearly cannot be allowed .
Does a reprimand set a limit of what a driver can get away with ?
If so , then they ’ve been too soft – it ’s no different to giving no penalty .
But if these reprimands mean “ if anyone does that again they ’ll be punished ” , then I think the stewards have laid down some useful markers .
We shall see .
The Hamilton - Petrov incident at Sepang was discussed at length here : Drivers as stewards make presence felt as Hamilton gets black - and - white flag
Bias
It was inevitable that bringing in people with recent F1 experience to the stewards ’ office was going to lead to accusations that they favour teams they used to work for and drivers they liked .
So far the drivers ’ representatives have been chosen well .
Alain Prost , Tom Kristensen , Johnny Herbert and Alexander Wurz cannot be accused of being short on experience ( though I do wonder what Prost ’s take would be one someone knocking their rival off the track to win a world championship ) .
Nor do they have any obvious axes to grind , or particular vested interests that should disqualify them from the job .
Whereas putting someone like Keke Rosberg or Ron Dennis in the room – however knowledgeable and impartial they are – would send out the wrong message given their closeness to particular drivers and teams .
The suggestion from some quarters that Wurz might be inclined towards McLaren because he worked for them five years ago cannot be taken seriously .
It ’s not as if that was his last job , after all , he ’s raced for Williams since then .
And tellingly , no - one suggested it might be a conflict of interest before Wurz was asked to take any of his decisions ( see here : Alexander Wurz joins Chinese GP stewards ) .
Weighed against the alternative – a return to the days of having decisions taken exclusively by people without top - line motor racing experience – the current solution is clearly preferable .
So far , so good
In recent seasons we could n’t trust the stewards to stay out of even the most innocuous incidents , and swingeing penalties were often handed down with little rationale or consistency .
Fernando Alonso ( Monza ’06 ) , Lewis Hamilton ( Spa ’08 ) , Sebastien Bourdais ( Fuji ’08 ) and others all received punishments that there totally out of proportion with their supposed infringements .
Others got away with tactics indistinguishable from ones their rivals had been punished for .
The decision not to penalise Vettel for passing Trulli under yellow flags in Sepang is a good example of sensible stewarding .
Had they dogmatically stuck to the rules , Vettel might have lost a deserved win .
But they had the sense to see how much he ’d slowed down by and made the right call .
It ’s still early days – we ’ve not yet seen how they handle a call on a driver going off - track and gaining an advantage – an area which has seen many dubious and controversial calls .
And it remains to be seen whether some of these ‘ reprimands ’ will be open to abuse in the future .
But I ’m optimistic that F1 is heading in the right direction .
Do you think the standard of stewarding has improved in F1 this year ?
Have your say in the comments .
Stewarding in F1
Compared to their neighbours south of the border , Canadians live longer , healthier lives .
Research published in BioMed Central 's open access journal Population Health Metrics has found this disparity between the two countries , suggesting that America 's lack of universal health care and lower levels of social and economic equality are to blame .
David Feeny , from Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research , Oregon , USA , worked with a team of American researchers to study data from the Joint Canada / United States Survey of Health 2002/03 .
He said , " Canada and the US share a common border and enjoy very similar standards of living , yet life expectancy in Canada is higher than in the US .
There are two distinct potential explanations for the gap : differences in access to health care and in the prevalence of poverty " .
Canadians have a universal ' prenatal to grave ' health service , which is free at point of care , while Americans ' access to health insurance is typically based on employment , income ( Medicaid ) , or age ( Medicare ) , and is not universal .
The degree of social inequality is also more pronounced in the US .
The researchers found that Canadians can expect 2.7 more years of ' perfect health ' than Americans - more than half of the gap found between the richest and poorest people in Canada .
Speaking about the results ,
Feeny said , " The difference in health between the two countries seems to be associated with substantial differences in access to care as well as substantial differences in social and economic inequality .
Yet distinguishing among the potential explanations for the differences in health between the two countries would require longitudinal data .
Perhaps it is time for Canada and the US to contemplate a joint longitudinal survey . "

LimeWire has been tied up in court over copyright infringement claims for years , but LimeWire , CEO Mark Gorton , and the Lime Group are all feeling especially sour today — the recording industry has won a major victory in federal court .
Judge Kimba
Wood has just granted summary judgment against LimeWire , agreeing with the labels that the peer - to - peer company was liable for inducing copyright infringement .
Turns out that asking LimeWire downloaders to check a box marked " I will not use LimeWire for copyright infringement " before proceeding does n't count as " meaningful efforts to mitigate infringement . "
Secondary liability
Did LimeWire 's users infringe copyrights ?
With a vengeance — and even the most ardent RIAA - hater knows it .
But just to make the point , labels hired Dr. Richard Waterman , a statistics professor at Penn 's Wharton School .
Waterman looked at a random sample of 1,800 LimeWire files and concluded that 93 percent were copyrighted and unlikely to be licensed for download through LimeWire .
" Dr. Waterman next logged the number of times LimeWire users sought to download each of the files in the sample , " wrote Judge Wood in her ruling .
" Based on these results , Dr. Waterman estimated that 98.8 percent of the files requested for download through LimeWire are copyright protected or highly likely copyright protected , and thus not authorized for free distribution . "
So the real question before the judge was about LimeWire 's role , if any , in all this downloading .
Had it " induced " people to infringe ?
Wood said yes , citing numerous internal LimeWire documents showing a knowledge of all the infringement taking place through LimeWire 's software and little done to stop it .
" For example , a draft of a LW Offering Memorandum , created in 2001 , states that LimeWire ' allows people to exchange copyrighted mp3 files , ' " she wrote .
" A September 2002 statement of LW ’s goals acknowledges that : ' Currently , the most common use of the Gnutella Network is the sharing of music files , many of them copyrighted . '
Other LW documents state that ' the only information being shared on peer networks are media files , ' a category composed primarily of copyrighted digital recordings . "
In addition , LimeWire employees maintained an internal file called " Knowledge of Infringement . "
The program 's built - in genre categories , like Classic Rock , " relate specifically to popular music and inevitably guide users to copyrighted recordings . "
Finally , " In addition to ensuring that users can obtain unauthorized copies of recordings through LimeWire , LW has actively assisted LimeWire users in committing infringement .
The record reveals several online communications between LW employees and LimeWire users that plainly relate to unauthorized sharing of digital recordings through LimeWire . "
Not lifting a finger
With this knowledge of infringement , LimeWire still might have been okay if it had taken steps to mitigate the problem .
But " the evidence reveals that LW has not implemented in a meaningful way any of the technological barriers and design choices that are available to diminish infringement through file - sharing programs , such as hash - based filtering , acoustic fingerprinting , filtering based on other digital metadata , and aggressive user education . "
The company did roll out its own hash - based filter in 2006 , but the default setting was " off . "
When LimeWire opened its own digital music store , it also employed filtering to " prevent LimeWire users from sharing digital recordings purchased from the LimeWire online store " — but not from sharing anything else .
In Wood 's view , this all adds up to a business model knowingly built on copyright infringement , and it continued with no attempt to address the massive problem .
As the main LimeWire owner , Wood also held CEO Mark Gorton personally liable for the same set of claims .
No penalties have yet been handed down , but a status conference on June 1 will lay out the schedule for moving forward .
( A few issues remain unresolved by the ruling , as Wood decided that the facts were unclear . )
The RIAA asked for an injunction against LimeWire and a host of damages in its complaint , and a spokesperson tells
Ars that those issues will likely be discussed on June 1 .
Winners and losers
In 2008 , a coalition including the EFF , Public Knowledge , the Consumer Electronics Association , and others filed an amicus brief with the court .
The document did n't take sides in the case , but it did warn that some music industry arguments could gut the key rulings from Sony 's Betamax case and the much more recent MGM v. Grokster case .
" Relying on certain of Plaintiffs ' arguments would replace the limiting principles set out in those cases with broad , ill - defined substitutes that would chill innovation in multi-use technologies , to the detriment of at least three constituencies , " said the brief .
" First , the technology industry would be denied the opportunity to develop and market technologies that form an increasingly important segment of the global economy .
Second , consumers would be denied the legitimate , non-infringing benefits that multi-use technologies offer .
And third , copyright owners who are eager to take advantage of opportunities made possible by these new technologies would be stymied ...
" Regardless of the outcome in this case , the legal standards the Court enunciates will be persuasive precedent in future cases . "
What the drafters did n't know at the time was that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) would also try to export secondary liability around the world , though without the same judicial precedents ( like Sony and Grokster ) that shape it here in the US .
We may see more judges around the world wrestling with issues like contributory and vicarious infringement in the next decades if ACTA passes , making verdicts like this one possible in more places .
That may be scary for software and device makers who create multi-use tools , but it 's music to ears of the recording industry , which celebrated this decision .
" LimeWire is one of the largest remaining commercial peer - to - peer services , " said the RIAA 's Mitch Bainwol .
" Unlike other P2P services that negotiated licenses , imposed filters or otherwise chose to discontinue their illegal conduct following the Supreme Court 's decision in the Grokster case , LimeWire instead thumbed its nose at the law and creators .
The court ’s decision is an important milestone in the creative community ’s fight to reclaim the Internet as a platform for legitimate commerce .
By finding LimeWire 's CEO personally liable , in addition to his company , the court has sent a clear signal to those who think they can devise and profit from a piracy scheme that will escape accountability . "
LimeWire issued a brief statement of its own : " LimeWire strongly opposes the Court ’s recent decision .
LimeWire remains committed to developing innovative products and services for the end - user and to working with the entire music industry , including the major labels , to achieve this mission .
We look forward to our June 1 meeting with Judge Wood . "
Fear of a free planet
The arguments that come from statists , that is to say , people who believe in government as a legitimate organization , are almost all based on fear .
Occasionally one might come across a positive argument for government intervention here and there , but those are quite rare these days .
But even those are usually based around removing a source of fear .
“ Once program X goes into effect , we wo n’t have to worry about Y anymore ! ”
The “ liberal ” wing of statism will harp on fear of unfettered plutocracy , though they are themselves all plutocrats .
They just want to make plutocracy “ safe ” .
The modern liberal / progressive program is essentially and inescapably plutocratic , though many of the rank and file do n’t ever connect the dots that way .
Any society with central banking and heavy levels of regulation can only survive economically if those few who can afford to own capital under such a system are protected from failure , with captive markets and practically guaranteed perpetual profit for those who make it to the “ club ” .
The “ conservative ” wing will talk about fear of foreign threats or cultural degradation , even though they are by and large in favor of threatening other countries and undermining their cultures .
They just want us to do it to “ them ” before “ they ” do it to us .
And they will invent an endless series of “ them ” to keep up the excuse for more police intervention , more military intervention , and more militarization of society in general .
So there are these endless fears which statists use to call for government intervention .
But all of this relies on a belief that there is something magical about the organizations known as “ government ” that somehow makes them capable of doing things that any other organization ca n’t or wo n’t do .
The anarchist position is simply that this magical veneer is an illusion .
We want roads and electricity and running water and peaceful cities and friendly neighbors too .
We just do n’t believe that there are things which are so difficult for mere mortals to do that the only way to accomplish them is for one group of special people to assault everyone else in order to make it happen .
There are many possible arguments one might hear from a statist against anarchy in the form of “ Well what if X happens ? ”
To me , the proper answer is “ Well what if it happens now ?
Someone will do something about it , is what . ”
In fact , the someone will most likely be in a much better position to do something about it because they wo n’t be hindered by a limited number of legislated solutions to any problem X which may arise .
Often times this answer will not satisfy the statist .
They want a guarantee .
But of course , the response to that is simply that the “ government ” ca n’t ( and wo n’t ) guarantee a damn thing .
How ’s that war on drugs coming along ?
Oh boy , it ’s a good thing we ca n’t buy those evil drugs anymore , is n’t it ?
To argue that bad things will happen under anarchy as some sort of argument for the state is laughable , considering how many bad things already happen , and so many of them as a * direct result * of one state action or another .
What will be different is that those bad things will not be systematic and predictable .
Which can be scary to those who are on the trigger side of the statist gun .
The statist position , if it is at all consistent , sees the human race as a bunch of corrupt and destructive losers , except for a small elite who somehow have their act together .
And this elite can somehow rise to power without being totally corrupted by it , or driven out by obsessive sociopaths .
The elite are able to somehow then impose their will and their incredibly complex , yet functional plans on everyone else who happen to be corrupt and destructive losers .
Of course most statists would never see their position in a consistent clear way .
This is evidenced by the fact that they will change their arguments around when one fails .
One is tempted of course to ask , “ What is the real , actual reason you believe in having a government ?
Not an excuse , but the actual reason you want all this intervention . ”
There usually is no one reason they can articulate because the reason is fear .
A blind fear of their neighbors that overwhelms the understanding that everything they fear about The Other is even more reason to fear the government .
Because that thought would be unbearable .
In such a world there is no escape , and all is lost already .
Of course , this all depends on who we ’re talking to .
We by and large are living in the elite centers of power , and we are probably benefiting from intervention in a lot of ways .
Those benefits would be gone under anarchy .
So for many of us , things might not be “ better ” at least for a few years until the society retooled itself .
Many people in the first world may indeed have more to fear right now from freedom than from their government , who works to destroy other people in order to feed and protect them .
Yet the moral argument says “ so be it ” .
If we have sown the wind , let us reap the whirlwind .
Better us than the billions of people who would finally find hope that they never had before , in a society that allowed them to begin building their own prosperity .

You may have heard about this already , but the video just went up on Youtube , so : LCD Soundsystem closed their concerts at Manhattan ’s Terminal 5 Thursday , Friday , Saturday and last night by incorporating the chorus of Jay - Z and Alicia Keys ’ triumphant anthem “ Empire State of Mind ” into the beautiful but normally less entirely triumphant anthem “ New York I Love You , But You ’re Bringing Me Down . ”

The show was killer all the way through - the full - band arrangements of leader James Murphy ’s studio creations , which always sound so solipsistic on records , were much more powerful than I would have guessed they would be .
And Murphy sang great - full - voiced , full - hearted , operatically , even , like Morrissey .
But the end , this song , was the best .
It was one of those moments that reminds you why you live in the city .
( To lapse into more doofiness . )
Why you put up with the stress and the vermin and the annoyance and the loneliness .
Why you ’re still glad , even though it brings you down so often , that you live here .
Why you would n’t choose to live anywhere else .
It ’s because you have n’t found another place where so many different sorts people are doing so many different sorts of things and you like watching and listening and tasting ( smelling , not always so much , especially not on East Broadway now that we ’re getting towards summer ) the wonderful variety of results .
And balloons .
Dogen ( 道厳 Dōgen ) was a member of the Others and master of the Temple .
He was drowned in the spring by Sayid , who was persuaded to do so by the Man in Black .
Dogen preferred to speak in Japanese with the aid of his translator , Lennon , who indicated that Dogen was the only person capable of keeping the Man in Black out of the Temple .
Once Dogen was murdered , the Man in Black entered the Temple as a pillar of smoke and massacred the Others who chose to keep their allegiance with Jacob .

Before the Island
According to Dogen , he was a very successful banker in Osaka before coming to the Island .
He had a family , including a son .
One day , Dogen received a promotion at work .
He and his friends went out to celebrate , but Dogen drank too much .
Under the influence , Dogen picked up his son from playing baseball , and got into a terrible car accident .
Though he himself survived , his son was seriously injured and in critical condition .
While his son was in the hospital , an individual named Jacob approached Dogen and said that he would heal his son if Dogen came to the Island to work for him .
Dogen accepted this offer , but never saw his son again .
Leaving Osaka forever , Dogen took his son's baseball with him as a keepsake .
( " Sundown " )
On the Island
2007 ( Season 6 )
When Jack , Kate , Hurley , Jin , and the injured Sayid arrived at the Temple , Dogen ordered them to be shot for trespassing .
But when Hurley announced that Jacob sent them , Dogen hesitated .
To prove what he said was true , Hurley gave the guitar case to Dogen ; Dogen opened it to see an ankh in the guitar case .
Immediately and heedless of Hurley 's protests , he smashed the wooden ankh in two and pulled a list from it .
Looking at the list , he asked the names of the group members , and also several others not present .
Dogen then gave instructions for Sayid to be brought to a spring within the Temple .
Sayid was pronounced dead by Dogen after they were unable to revive him .
In a separate room within the Temple , which appeared to be his office , Dogen received the news from Hurley that Jacob had died .
Dogen swiftly ordered the Others to get into position and to protect the Temple from the Man in Black .
( " LA X , Part 2 " )
Note that some of items shown in this room include balancing scales , a mortar and pestle , a baseball , black and white stones -- all of which are the same as or similar to items shown in the Cliffside cave .
Later , Lennon informed Dogen that Sayid had come back to life .
In response , Dogen summoned Sayid to that same room , where he began to torture him under the eventual pretext that it had been a test .
After Sayid returned to his friends and told them about his ordeal , Jack angrily demanded to know why Sayid had been tortured .
Dogen denied having done so , and asked Jack to give Sayid a pill which would , according to him , heal Sayid of his infection .
Jack refused to do so without first knowing what was in the pill , and attempted to swallow the pill himself , but Dogen stopped him , forcing him to cough it back up .
Dogen then reluctantly revealed that the pill 's contents were poison .
There was a darkness , he told Jack , spreading throughout Sayid 's body , and once it reached his heart , he would be forever changed .
Dogen went on to reveal that this same thing had afflicted Jack 's sister , Claire .

Dogen confronts
Hurley in the tunnels , unaware of Jacob 's presence . ( " Lighthouse " )
Later , Dogen caught Hurley poking around in a tunnel .
He told him to return to the courtyard .
Hurley , under the guidance of Jacob 's spirit , told Dogen that he was a candidate , so he could do what he wanted .
He told Dogen to go back to the courtyard .
With this , Dogen said something in Japanese , ( Translation : " You 're lucky that I have to protect you .
Otherwise I 'd have cut your head off . " ) and left .
( " Lighthouse " )
Dogen joined Jack who was wandering outside the Temple and said that he was afraid Jack had left .
Jack asked whether leaving was an option to which Dogen replied that " everything is an option " .
He afterwards asked Jack whether his friends were coming back and Jack answered that they were probably not .
Once alone , Sayid confronted Dogen with questions .
Dogen explained the nature of the machine as something that gauged the morality of an individual ( whether they were good or evil ) .
Dogen explained that Sayid was evil and would be better off dead .
The hostility between the two sparked into a fight .
Dogen had the opportunity to kill Sayid , but seeing his son's baseball made him stop .
Dogen banished Sayid and told him to leave the Temple at once .
Dogen explains the relevance of the baseball to Sayid , moments before his death . ( " Sundown " )
However , everything changed for Dogen when Claire mysteriously returned to the Temple with a message from the Man in Black .
Claire explained that the Monster wanted to speak with Dogen , who refused .
Claire suggested that he send someone that the Monster would not kill , so Dogen revoked Sayid 's banishment and sent him in his stead .
After Sayid 's meeting with the Man in Black , he returned with yet another message : everyone was to leave the Temple by sundown or die .
Sayid later confronted Dogen at the pool .
He asked Dogen why he spared his life earlier that day .
Staring at the baseball that he was holding in his hand , Dogen did not answer the question directly , but explained the circumstances that brought him to the Island .
Dogen concluded by asking Sayid if he would stay in the Temple or leave with the Man in Black .
Sayid chose to stay , but unexpectedly attacked and killed Dogen by drowning him in the pool .
When Lennon arrived to discover that Dogen was dead , he panicked and told Sayid that Dogen was the only thing keeping the Monster out of the Temple .
Sayid already knew this and killed Lennon as well .
The Monster then attacked the temple unhindered .
( " Sundown " )
Post - death
Ben found Sayid with the bodies of Dogen and Lennon during the massacre and fled in fear , later informing Ilana , Sun , Miles and Frank of the deaths .

Dogen was present in Los Angeles in 2004 , alongside his son , with whom he appeared to have a good relationship .
He and his son attended David Shephard 's piano recital at Williams Conservatory , and praised David 's abilities .
He saw Jack there , and told him it is hard to have children with that kind of talent .

Name reference
Dōgen was the name of a prominent Japanese Buddhist philosopher , who founded the Sōtō Zen tradition .
He was , for much of his life , the head of a monastery , Eihei - ji ( which roughly translates to " the temple of eternal peace " ) .
The historical Dōgen died on September 22 , 1253 , the same calendar date as the original Oceanic Flight 815 crash .
Lindelof and Cuse revealed in a podcast that this coincidence was not intentional .
Despite being written as " Dogen " using the Roman alphabet , the official name is written in Japanese using different characters than those of the name of the Japanese Buddhist philosopher .
" Do " itself is written the same way ( 道 ) as written in the name of many martial arts ( Aiki-dō , Karate - dō , Ju-dō , Ken-dō ) and means " the way / path of . "
It is also featured in such Japanese concepts as shodō , the " way of writing " ( calligraphy ) , kadō , the " way of flowers " ( ikebana or flower arranging ) and Shintō , the " way of the gods " ( sometimes called Shintoism in English ) .
Interestingly , in Japanese Buddhism / Shintō divinities ( which are at times malicious or evil and at times benevolent ) are often said to have manifest themselves in our world in human form .
The do or dō in Dōgen is also the character that is read in Chinese as Dao ( or Tao ) , which is the root of the English word Daoism ( or Taoism ) .
This may connect with Lost 's featuring of Chinese ideas ( yin/yang ) that are loosely related to Daoism .
Furthermore , according the producers [ 1 ] the character plays a role which has both dignity and delicacy as well ( this actually refers to the " - gen " part on the name ) .

The " gen " part of his name according to sources from a Japanese LOST website [ 2 ] , is 厳 which alone means " strict , rigid , or stern " , although it is supposed to be derived from the word 威厳 ( igen ) which means : dignity ; majesty ; solemnity ; gravity .
, is 厳 which alone means " strict , rigid , or stern " , although it is supposed to be derived from the word 威厳 ( igen ) which means : dignity ; majesty ; solemnity ; gravity .
Dōgen , the Japanese monk credited with founding Sōtō Zen , wrote about time or temporality in his masterpiece , Shōbōgenzō .
He attempted to conceptualize a unity of process and event , becoming and being .
The argument is something along these lines : a given moment is from one perspective particular , limited , and by nature suffused with delusion , but from another perspective it is simultaneously universal , a complete manifestation of the eternal , and suffused with awakening .
To put the basic theory in a nutshell and in Buddhist terms : everything is Buddha and every time is Buddha , we just do not generally recognize this .

His name may also be a reference to the dogan in Stephen King 's The Dark Tower books , as all the writers have expressed that they are major Stephen King fans , with Lindelof in particular referring to the series as his favorite books .
Zhou Daguan is a Chinese diplomat who gave early accounts of the Temple of Angkor Wat and other temples of the Khmer region , which are similar in architecture to the Island Temple .
Angkor
Wat is located on a mountain and may have been a funerary temple .
The design of the temple also includes an inner pond .

Stefan Otto ( Bug Stomper ) completed these plans in 2002 after having seen reference pictures from Minnesota 's Planet Hollywood .
They were done completely in CAD after having superimposed the pictures into the CAD system .
Unknown measurements were created from known measurements on found objects .
Despite being over 10 years old , these plans are still among the most accurate ones to date .
Proton Gun Plans
Sometime after the pack plans were released , these 1:1 scale Proton Gun plans came out .
A fully documented set of plans has not been completed .
These are the closest thing avaiable .
Measurements can be taken after plans have been printed out .
Ghost Trap Plans
Stefan has released Ghost Trap plans to the same extent as the Proton Gun Plans ( above ) .
There are no measurements , but they can be obtained by printing out and taking the measurements from there .
The pedal is 1:1 scale , but the trap is 1:2 scale .

Intel 's new low - power Moorestown Chip is very power efficient and packs enough computational muscle to enable features such as video conferencing and HD video .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Intel will be releasing their new ultra - low - power Atom base processor designed specifically for mobile devices .
The chip package is based on Intel ’s 45 - nanometer process and packs over 140 million transistors .
Intel ’s chip , codename “ Moorestown ” , is highly power efficient and is capable of running three programs simultaneously , including a very high quality movie clip .
This was demonstrated at the 2010 CES show by Pankaj Kedia of Intel ’s Ultra Mobility Group using the new LG smartphone .
The Moorestown system - on - chip includes the Intel Atom Processor Z6xx Series ( system - on - chip ) , the Intel Platform Controller Hub MP20 , and a dedicated Mixed Signal IC ( MSIC ) .
The Intel Atom Z6xx processor combines the CPU core with 3 - D graphics , video encode and decode , as well as memory and display controllers .
It also includes the MP20 Platform Controller Hub which supports a range of system - level functions and I /O blocks .
Additionally , a dedicated MSIC integrates power delivery and battery charging , and consolidates a range of analog and digital components .
The new Moorestown chip will support clock speeds up to 1.5 GHz for high - end smartphones as compared to 1 GHz used by Qualcomm ’s Snapdragon processors .
Intel will also have a 1.9 GHz chip that will be used in tablet PC ’s and other handheld devices .
Combined these chips use only 1.75 % the power of current Atom chips , in the idle state .
Instead of the 1.2 Watts drawn by current Atom CPUs , the new Moorestown chips will draw just 21 milliwatts .
According to Intel these power saving features translate to more than 10 days of standby time , up to 2 days of audio playback and 4 to 5 hours of browsing and video battery life .
PC like experience is also combined with 1.5 - 3 x higher compute performance , 2 - 4 x richer graphics , > 4 x higher JavaScript performance , and support for full HD 1080 p high - profile video decoding and 720 p HD video recording .
Intel is already producing these chips and consumers can expect them in mobile devices later this year .
The company has n’t announced any smartphone models that will use the new low - power Moorestown chip ; however the company demonstrated the use of the new Atom processors in a phone produced by LG at the 2010 CES .

Kim Zetter :
Police closed in on the man who found and sold a prototype 4G iPhone after his roommate called an Apple security official and turned him in , according to a newly unsealed document in the ongoing police investigation .
The tip sent police racing to the home of 21 - year - old Brian Hogan , and began a strange scavenger hunt for evidence that a friend of Hogan ’s had scattered around the Silicon Valley community of Redwood City .
Police recovered a desktop computer stashed inside an area church , a thumb drive hidden in a bush alongside the road , and the iPhone ’s serial number stickers from the parking lot of a gas station .
Good luck with the argument that they did n’t know the phone was stolen .
It ’s funny that his roommate knew how to contact Apple Security .
Perhaps Hogan should have asked her for help with the telephone while ostensibly trying to return the phone .
Like I ’ve said , these guys are like characters out of a Coen brothers movie .
Asked the value of the phone , Apple told the police “ it was invaluable . ”
Ought to make for an interesting civil case against Gawker Media .

I have noticed that since I ’ve started using the envelope system , I ’m spending about $ 60 less per two - week period than when I used a debit card .
I think it ’s because when I lay three $ 20s down for groceries , it hurts !
When I paid with debit , it did n’t really register with me .
— My Total Money Makeover member mgtyjoe
What is Dave Ramsey ’s “ Envelope System ? ”
Glad you asked .
It ’s a simple and effective way to budget by using envelopes to organize your cash .
The envelope system has no doubt been popularized by financial expert , Dave Ramsey , but he will be the first to let you know he did n’t invent it .
Dave says , “ I found out that Grandma ’s way to handle money still works .
People used to always use cash envelopes to control their monthly spending , but very few do in today ’s card swiping culture . ”
I first learned about the envelope system in 2005 from a couple from my church who were successful business owners .
I later completed Financial Peace University with my wife where we learned even more about the power of paying cash versus using a card .
Here is how to get started :
1. Review Current Expenses
If you already track your expenses , this part will be easy .
If not , you can pull up your online banking and do your best to categorize your expenses over the last three months .
Once you ’ve done that you will have a better idea how much money to allocate for each category going forward .
Click here for a printable budgeting worksheet .
2. Find Out How Much Cash to Withdraw
Before you go to the bank and cash your paycheck you need to know how much cash to withdraw .
When you first start using the envelope system your goal is to pay cash wherever possible and practical .
It ’s more practical to pay certain bills online every month ( i.e. cell phone , rent , car insurance and life insurance ) .
So leave enough funds in your bank to cover for these .
After you subtract the amount you need in your bank from your net pay then you know how much cash to take out .
For example , if your net pay was $ 3,000 , rent was $ 1,000 , cell phone $ 80 , car insurance $ 100 and life insurance $ 35 ; then you would withdraw $ 1,785 cash .
3. Create Envelopes
Now the fun part .
Take a marker and label your envelopes .
Here is a list of the most common budget categories :
Tithe ( 10 % of gross income )
Offering ( you decide )
Gifts ( i.e. Birthday , Christmas , Anniversary )
Food
Gas
Vehicle Maintenance
Clothing
Coffee
Personal Care ( toiletries , makeup , etc. )
Home Supplies
Entertainment
Books / Music / DVDs
Blow Money
4. Fill the Envelopes
Now refer back to your last three months of expenses .
On average , how much did you spend on food , gas , coffee and so on ?
When you fill your envelopes , be realistic .
If you ’re spending $ 500 on food you may be able to get by on $ 300 if you do n’t eat out as much .
But do you think you can really go from $ 500 to $ 100 / month ?
5 . When an Envelope is Empty …
You guessed it – it means you are done spending in that category until payday .
If you want to go to the movies but realize your entertainment envelope is empty it does n’t mean you steal from your food envelope .
It means you get to stay home and read a book or play some board games with friends .
I know , you have it rough now .
Benefits of Using the Envelope System
So why go through the trouble of stuffing a bunch of envelopes with cash ?
I ’m glad you asked .
And no the answer is n’t Because Dave Ramsey says to .
There are several benefits to using the envelope system :
Psychologists have found that people spend less when they spend cash rather than use a card .
You will have cash leftover .
It ’s common to forget that you put cash in an envelope only to realize a few months later , Hey , I have $ 80 in clothing .
Time to go shopping !
It works .
Your financial situation will improve if you stick to this for at least six months .
If it does n’t , what have you really lost ?
No more waiting for the waitress to return your card at restaurants .
Just pay and leave .
You get better deals .
Many businesses give discounts when you pay cash .
Sometimes they advertise it and other times you just need to ask , “ Hey , do you guys give a discount if I pay with cash ? ”
Get Started Today
If you ’re ready to get started then just keep on reading about some of the wallet options that you can use – though they are NOT necessary and envelopes for budgeting will work just fine .
4 Great Cash Envelope System Wallets
Carrying around a bunch of envelopes can be cumbersome , to say the least .
Also , since my sister - in - law once threw a large sum of cash into the garbage thinking she was throwing away an empty envelope , my husband has his hesitations about the system .
We ’ve used the system anyway .
Paper clipping bills together and labeling with a sticky note helps .
But then , what do you do with the change ?
And who wants to be in the checkout line behind someone trying to juggle paper clips and sticky notes with their wallet and their bags of stuff ?
Not me , and I consider myself a pretty patient person .
Enter the Envelope System Wallet . . .
Recently , I discovered the envelope system wallet .
Now I have an organized way to , once again , implement this budgeting system without all the obstacles .
An envelope system wallet is designed to be used with the cash envelope system of budgeting .
Here are four great envelope system wallets I ’ve found …
4 Envelope System Wallets
1. Dave Ramsey ’s Envelope System
Personally , I do n’t care for Dave Ramsey ’s Designer Envelope System .
I prefer natural materials like leather or fabric and his wallets are vinyl .
I also cannot appreciate the huge Financial Peace University logo embossed on the outside .
But since I know that a lot of readers are Dave Ramsey groupies , I ’ve included it .
Actually , he has several envelope systems to choose from , plus a coupon organizer and they are all reasonably priced .
2. SavvyCents
If you want your wallet to stand out in the crowd , choose one from SavvyCents .
These envelope systems come in black , pink , or polka dotted patent leather or zebra stripes .
However , if you ’re a firm believer in the idea that it ’s the inside that counts , SavvyCents wallets have the goods .
Inside the zippered wallet are an accordion - style file system , six debit / credit card slots , and room for your checkbook .
Included are pre-printed and blank labels for the tabs on the accordion sections .
SavvyCents wallets measure 8 ” x4 ” and sell for $ 28 .
3. Etsy
A search on Etsy for “ cash envelope wallets ” returned over 300 hits .
Ranging in price from $ 12 to $ 76 , most of the wallets featured are for women .
At least my man would n’t carry any of them .
I did see one labeled “ Man Organization Wallet Carhart . ”
The fabric on the exterior resembles a Carhartt® coat .
One other is made of camouflage fabric and is more like a zip - shut bank bag with fabric envelopes inside .
I think it would be something a man would keep in the glove box of his car , but not carry around in his pocket .
Two crafters ’ wallets were my favorites .
CitrusDesigns makes the camo one already mentioned and another style made of vinyl .
Her design looks less bulky than those with zippers on all the pockets ; plus I really like her choice of fabrics .
TheLaughingHouse is the other crafter .
Her accordion design is my absolute favorite because you do n’t have the bulk of a bunch of envelopes to contend with .
4 . Make your own !
For those of you with a creative touch , or at least a little sewing / crafting know - how , make your own wallet .
Craftsy.com sells a great pattern for a wallet that includes six zipper - shut pockets , slots for credit / debit cards , and a place for your checkbook .
The pattern sells for $ 1.61 and you can choose any fabric in the store to make it out of — even zebra-striped .
If you enjoy crafting , but not sewing , consider modifying a wallet you already own .
Kelleigh Ratzlaff is a work - at - home mom that designs papercraft templates to sell .
On her blog , she has a free template and tutorial for making your own envelope insert that will fit into a standard - sized wallet .
She also has an Etsy store where she sells pre-made envelope sets for your cash budget system .
I ’m excited about this wallet discovery because , honestly , I ’ve gotten a little lax with the use of my debit card lately .
Now , I have a true reason to go shopping — with cash , of course .
Do you use the cash envelope system of budgeting ?
What do you carry your cash in ?
I ’d love to hear about it in the comments .
Is it an invasion of privacy to film an animal in its burrow ?
Or a whale as it exhibits its penis in a courtship display ?
Or to use a remote camera to film a bear giving birth in its den ?
According to a film studies lecturer from the University of East Anglia , it could be .
If an animal retreats to its burrow , it obviously does n't want to be seen , he claims .
Unlike the inhabitants of the Big Brother house , these creatures have not given consent .
These assertions are a step further along the line from a cautionary ethical approach towards taking care not to disrupt wild behaviour .
Instead , Brett Mills appears to be claiming that human emotions can be assumed within animals as well .
It was not the first time this week that recognisable human emotions have been assumed within animal species .
A video accompanying a report in the journal Current Biology was released that seemed to demonstrate incontrovertibly a group of chimpanzees exhibiting grief .
Anyone who has seen the video would have to have a hard heart not to have been moved .
It showed the chimps apparently mourning the death of Pansy , an elderly member of the troop .
The chimps gathered around her , moving her bedding gently and checking her breathing .
Last year an equally striking image showed chimpanzees gathering to watch as the body of Dorothy , a group matriarch , was carried off .
The chimps stood silently , their arms around each other 's shoulders .
Both images have received widespread media coverage , most of it sympathetic to the idea that animals , especially primates , share human emotions such as grief , sadness , and even empathy .
ITN news framed its report with the claim that " dignity in death may be just as important to chimpanzees as it is to humans " .
Much of the coverage referred to the growing body of " evidence " for this .
The reports mentioned Professor Marc Bekoff 's claim to have witnessed a magpie " funeral " , where a group of magpies brought pieces of grass to the body of one of their members killed by a bike , and the accounts of how elephants often gather around a dead or dying animal .
I welcome the interest in this subject .
For many years I have wanted to see an end to claims of human superiority based on the belief that animals , even if they feel , do not have the " higher " emotions of humans based on the capacity for symbolisation and self - awareness .
This attitude derives from Judeo - Christian assumptions of human superiority , where it is believed that God created the universe and all life within it for man .
It is man 's use of language and symbolisation ( " The Word was God " ) that marks humanity out from the animals , beliefs that have justified dominance , exploitation and abuse of animals .
The increasing interest in animal emotions seems like an important first step in changing consciousness about our relationship with other species .
But this does not necessarily mean that we should resign our critical faculties or fail to interrogate flaws in how the evidence is presented .
The popular media have taken the chimp pictures as " scientific " proof of animal emotions .
Yet the interpretation lacks substantial data to back it up .
Dr Stuart Semple is a reader in evolutionary anthropology at Roehampton University who has been involved in the study of animal behaviour .
He is concerned about the dangers of presenting speculation as science .
To him , the grieving chimps video is " a classic case of anthropomorphism , the projection of human feelings on to animals , which is made easier because of their physiological resemblance to humans " .
Looking at the Daily Mail coverage , it 's hard not to see his point .
In one photo , a chimp with a rather ambiguous expression is shown sitting holding a banana .
The caption reads : " Chippy the chimp looks downcast while clutching a banana in an enclosure . "
It does n't take a semiotician to point out that we'd see something totally different if the caption was changed to : " Candy sits in his enclosure clutching his stolen banana . "
Anthropomorphism is , of course , a term of insult and one of the key ways in which the human species has been able to disregard the abuse we have inflicted on animals .
In the past , those who have shouted anthropomorphism most loudly have been those who have disregarded animal welfare issues and have promoted a resolutely " human- centred " version of the universe .
Nevertheless , Semple is right to suggest caution .
The real issue , he thinks , is less a dispute about the existence of animal emotions , and more a matter of establishing what exactly it is animals might be feeling .
" I do n't have a problem , " he says , " with the idea that we share emotions .
It 's very likely that we do , since we share the same neurocircuitry .
But it 's a matter of investigating what emotions they might have and how they might feel , not about making assumptions of direct equivalence with humans . "
Semple points to recent research that measured stress and social responses in baboons who had lost close relatives .
Bereaved baboons showed an increase in stress hormones and in levels of social grooming : very similar responses to humans .
" This kind of evidence is more compelling , " says Semple .
" It 's rigorous and scientific .
It allows us to speculate on what they are feeling or not . "
Nowhere is this assumption of direct human equivalence writ more large than in the article by Mills about invading the privacy of animals by wildlife filmmaking .
He writes : " Many species could be read as desiring not to be seen ; animals in burrows and nests have constructed a living space which equates with the human concept of the home , and commonly do this in locations which are , by their very nature , explicitly hidden , often for practical purposes . "
" Often for practical purposes " would seem to be the important part of this comment .
Is the creature in the burrow hiding for reasons of " privacy " understood in human terms ?
Or is the burrow a practical response to self - protection ?
Without a rigorous study of the whole social behaviour and life cycle of the creature of the kind advocated by Semple , any interpretation is likely to be just speculation .
Why is this distinction between speculative observation and more rigorous study important ?
It 's not because it would allow us to turn our back on animal welfare issues .
Being cautious about conflating animal and human emotions does n't mean assuming the absence of emotions .
Professor Marion Dawkins , regarded as the world 's leading advocate of the scientific approach to animal emotions , nevertheless advocates pragmatism .
In the absence of certainty about what animal emotions are , we should behave towards animals as if they do share emotions .
The main reason this distinction is important is in case we go to the opposite extreme .
If we assume animals have identical emotions to humans , perhaps we will insist on treating them as human .
But until we know what animals really feel and what those feelings are , then treating them as identical to humans might be just as cruel as ignoring their feelings .
If we take Mills ' argument to its logical conclusion , would it mean that we should observe the privacy of a burrowing animal and never film it ?
What if that study revealed the animal 's dependency on a species of plant or the need for conditions that were threatened elsewhere ?
If we failed to study , to film and to observe , we might lose that creature altogether .
All of which suggests that investigating what exactly animals are feeling is one of the most pressing areas of contemporary research .
Sketch of a UFO spotted in Hemsworth , West Yorkshire , on 25 March 1988
The Ministry of Defence has closed its UFO unit after more than 50 years of investigating reported UK sightings .
A hotline and e-mail address for the public to report possible sightings was shut on 1 December because it had no " defence value " , the MoD said .
The officer handling reports has moved to another post , saving £ 44,000 a year .
The MoD said the unit had received thousands of reports , although none had yielded proof of aliens or any security threat to the UK .
' Afghanistan priority '
In a statement , the MoD said it had " no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra- terrestrial life " .
It went on : " In over 50 years , no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom .
" The MoD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings .
There is no defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources . "
An MoD spokesman added that resources were being " focused on the top priority - the front line in Afghanistan " .
He added : " Any legitimate threat to the UK 's airspace will be spotted by our 24/7 radar checks and dealt with by RAF fighter aircraft . "
Congressional Democrats are working on regulations that should help reduce the chance of another financial collapse like we went through in 2008 .
One of the ideas on the table will setup a fund paid for by banks that will be ready in case the regulations fail and banks need future bailouts .
The current FDIC Chairwoman , Sheila Blair says the ideas will do the trick and make future bailouts impossible :
Would this bill perpetuate bailouts ?
SHEILA BAIR : The status quo is bailouts .
That ’s what we have now .
If you do n’t do anything , you are going to keep having bailouts .
Bankruptcy does n’t work — we saw that with Lehman Brothers .
But does this bill stop them from happening ?
BAIR : It makes them impossible and it should .
We worked really hard to squeeze bailout language out of this bill .
Needless to say , Republicans are opposed ( it ’s a Democratic idea after all ) and are willing to – as always – to employ bald - faced lies to achieve a political victory :
The Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , criticized the Democrats ’ plans to regulate Wall Street [ … ]
“ We cannot allow endless taxpayer - funded bailouts , ” Mr. McConnell said in a floor speech .
“ That ’s why we must not pass the financial reform bill that ’s about to hit the floor .
The fact is this bill would n’t solve the problems that led to the financial crisis .
It would make them worse . ”
I have to give credit to Mitch McConnel .
It takes some balls to come out and say 2+2=5 .
( It also takes some stones to pretend like he ’s a big opponent of bailouts when he supported them in 2008 . )
Leaving that aside , let ’s rewind back to February and explore the source of this lie , Republican strategist Frank Luntz :
In a 17 - page memo titled , “ The Language of Financial Reform , ” Luntz urged opponents of reform to frame the final product as filled with bank bailouts , lobbyist loopholes , and additional layers of complicated government bureaucracy .
Sounds familiar right ?
But why are Republicans so willing to defend the status quo which as well all know allowed the collapse and bailouts of 2008 ?
It ’s about the campaign money !
Mitch McConnel , the leading Senate Republican , and John Boehner , the leading House Republican have gone to Wall Street banks and pledged to defeat Obama ’s plans for regulations in return to campaign contributions .
Read it and weep .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Oljeselskapet BP innrømmer i dag at langt mindre olje fanges opp fra oljeutslippet i Mexicogolfen enn først rapportert , samtidig som dyretragediens omfang i økende blir synlig og ødeleggende langs kysten .
Sist torsdag meldte selskapet at et kateter de har ført inn i lekkasjen suger opp 5000 fat olje per dag .
I helgen ble tallet nedjustert til 2200 fat , og mandag kom BP med et estimat om at de så langt har klart å fange opp mellom 1360 og 3000 fat om dagen den siste uken , skriver NTB .
President Barack Obama advarer nå BP mot alvorlige konsekvenser og opplyser at de kan bli « bli skjøvet ut til siden » om de ikke rydder opp .
Indreminister Ken Salazar sier de har bommet på « deadline etter deadline » i arbeidet for å stanse lekkasjene , melder BBC .
Pelikaner dør-
Om vi finner ut at de ikke gjør det de skal , skyver vi dem ut av veien , sier Salazar etter et besøk hos BPs hovedkvarter i USA .

Også Cuba frykter at de rammes , og eksperter sier til Dagbladet at oljesølet i verste fall kan merkes helt opp til den amerikanske delstaten Nord - Carolina .
- Oljen kan potensielt føres langt ut i Atlanterhavet , sier oseanografiprofessor Joseph Henry LaCasce ved Universitetet i Oslo til Dagbladet .
En stor bekymring er store mengder olje som ikke har kommet til overflaten , og dermed ikke vises fra fly eller satellitter .
Det finnes ingen effektive måter å spore spredningen av denne , noe som også hindrer forebyggende arbeid i truede områder .
Mange frykter dermed at det egentlige omfanget av oljekatastrofen , som truer med å bli det største siden Exxon Valdez - ulykken i 1989 , først blir klart når døde dyr flyter opp til overflaten i stort antall , sier LaCasce .

With plummeting poll ratings and dismal local election results , French President Nicolas Sarkozy seems to have been dumped by many of the voters who fell in love with him in 2007 .
Emma Jane Kirby in Paris asks what went wrong .
Reports of marital problems were based on unconfirmed rumours Last week , my 80 - year - old Aunty Barbara , who rarely misses a trick , called me from Ilkley in West Yorkshire , England , excited by reports she had read in the British press that President Sarkozy 's marriage was on its last legs .
" Is it true that his pop star wife Carla Bruni has run off with another musician and that he 's seeing one of his own ministers ? " she asked me .
" People are talking about it in our bookshop . "
However in Parisian bookshops , known as librairies , no - one is talking about such rumours .
Not just because strict privacy laws prevent the French press from writing too much about politician 's private lives , nor because the scandal emanated from a hoax by an internet blogger .
They 're not talking about their president 's alleged marital disputes because they 're concerned about a much bigger affair - his infidelity to them .
' Sweet nothings '
When he was elected two - and - a - half years ago , President Sarkozy made certain vows to his electorate .
He promised ordinary French people they would become richer and that their country would become more competitive .
But with unemployment now standing at more than 10 % , its highest level in a decade , and with France 's bank books showing screaming red deficits , many here feel those bold promises were little more than whispered sweet nothings .
That sense of betrayal can be seen clearly in the popularity polls .
The French leader has sunk to his lowest rating yet , 36 % .
And it 's not as if the French have even fallen for someone else
And the stinging defeat his governing right wing UMP party suffered in the first round of the regional elections on Sunday - largely because so few people bothered to vote - would seem to suggest that President Sarkozy has now been well and truly dumped by a significant number of his supporters .
And it 's not as if the French have even fallen for someone else .
While it 's true that the opposition Socialists have done spectacularly well in the regional elections , they still cannot agree on an attractive candidate for the next race to the Elysee in 2012 .
The white - suited charm of Segolene Royal , the defeated candidate in the last presidential election , has greyed a little over the years .
Dominique Strauss Kahn , who might be in the running , currently leads the IMF - which might not sit too comfortably with his Leftist party constituency .
Some newspapers here have recently been talking up the Merkellian characteristics of the current Socialist leader , Martine Aubry .
The French people ... might need a little more convincing that he's not just stringing them along for the ride
But the only real similarities between her and the German chancellor which editors seem able to stand up , are that both women are a little frumpy and have pudding - basin haircuts .
But as a group , there 's no doubt the Socialists are wooing both voters and political partners .
Not only have they formed an alliance with other Leftist parties , they 've also convinced Europe Ecologie - the Greens - to join their block for this Sunday 's vote .
It 's a double date that can't fail to win .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's party on the other hand is standing alone .
The UMP has been spurned by former political allies and is entering these elections distinctly celibataire ( single ) .
So what has put people off President Sarkozy and his party ?
Heavy flirting Flirting too heavily with the far right has certainly alienated many voters .
Last year 's controversial debate on national identity sparked accusations of racism , while hard - line immigration and law and order policies , designed to steal voters away from the National Front , have made traditional supporters look elsewhere .
A plan ( now abandoned ) to install his son Jean Sarkozy as head of the agency in charge of Paris 's business district , was also met with outrage .
Jean Sarkozy 's planned job triggered accusations of nepotism Critics say the president spent far too much time sniping and squabbling in his own cabinet when he should have been focusing on France .
And yet when he did get down to work , that was n't good enough either - his planned reforms of regional governments , pensions and the judicial system have all proved to be deeply divisive .
Yes , he was put in the Elysee to change France , admit those who elected him , but in the grip of an economic crisis , could n't the president have broken the bad news a bit more gently ?
In an attempt to make it up to the French people perhaps , President Sarkozy has now suggested he 'll slow down the pace of his reforms .
Despite his bravado in saying that the results of the regional elections mean nothing nationally , he 'll be hurt by his party 's low score and by a recent poll which suggests his old supporters would now prefer to see his prime minister , Francois Fillon , sitting in the Elysee Palace .
So can the French ever be persuaded to take Nicolas Sarkozy back into their affections ?
In an interview last week , Carla Bruni insisted she could always trust her husband .
The French people , and others watching , like those in Aunty Barbara 's Ilkley bookshop , might need a little more convincing that he 's not just stringing them along for the ride .

Trapped air in the shells of rare octopuses is the key to their survival in the deep sea , say scientists .
Females of the argonaut family ( Argonautidae ) release trapped air from their shells to control very precisely their movement through the water .
This ability has puzzled naturalists for over 2,000 years , dating back to observations made by Aristotle in 300 BC .
Research published in the Royal Society journal , Proceedings B , finally explains why it may have evolved .
The Australian researchers describe how the mechanism enables the creatures to conserve energy , avoid predators and protect eggs during the brooding stage .
The study , led by Dr Julian Finn of Museum Victoria in Melbourne , is the first to observe directly how this unique species of octopus captures air at the sea surface and uses it to its advantage .
" It was n't until I actually got an argonaut in the water that I really saw the true marvel of these animals , " said Dr Finn .
Unlike any other species of octopus , the female argonaut , which can be up to 50 cm ( 20 inches ) in length , makes itself a paper - thin shell .
It secretes this shell , made of calcium carbonate , from two web structures on the sides of its body .
The males are much smaller , typically only a centimetre in length , and do not produce shells .
Mythical Creatures
Air pockets have been observed before within the shells of both wild and captive argonauts , also known as " paper nautiluses " , but their origin and purpose has until now been a mystery .
" This mythical story began around the time of Aristotle that the argonaut female actually lived in the shell and raised those webs as sails as she sailed across the ocean , " explained Dr Finn .
The new findings show that the female argonaut takes in air at the sea surface through a funnel as it rotates its shell anti-clockwise .
It then seals off an air pocket in the top , or apex , of the shell using a second webbed pair of tentacles .
As it dives to depths of up to 750 m ( almost half a mile ) below the surface , it adjusts the amount of air in its shell to match its own density with that of the seawater , keeping it " neutrally buoyant " and enabling it to swim effortlessly .
This contrasts with most other cephalopods - the class of animals that includes octopuses , squid and cuttlefish - which expend vast amounts of energy to maintain their position .
Underwater Control
The female argonaut can also counteract the considerable weight of its eggs , which it releases into its shell during the reproductive period , to carefully avoid bumping them on the sea floor .
By keeping a safe position in mid-water , argonauts can also steer clear of disturbance by surface waves and predators from above , such as birds .
Once believed to hinder the females , it is now thought that argonauts evolved this remarkable mechanism from ancestors that lived on the seafloor , allowing the species to expand its range into mid-depths .
" The female argonaut knows exactly what she was doing .
Underwater she was completely in control , " added Dr Finn .
The most recent documentation is now on the wiki
EEPROMs , such as flash memory , store data in electronic devices like cell phones , smart cards , SD cards , and solid - state drives .
This type of memory can only endure a limited number of writes , it will eventually wear out and it wo n’t store new data .
The Flash Destroyer explores that limit by writing and verifying a common EEPROM chip , rated for 1 million writes , until it burns out .
How long will it take to complete a million write - verify cycles ?
The Flash Destroyer ’s current top speed is about 736 cycles per minute , or 22 hours to complete 1 million writes .
Back that off to one write per second ( 11days ) or per 10 seconds ( 110 days ) and the time increases dramatically .
The Flash Destroyer has several alternative firmwares with different write speeds that can be loaded over USB .
Obviously the chip is n’t intended for this type of abuse .
A million cycle ‘ limitation ’ is n’t bad at the user scale .
The EEPROM inside a common SLE4442 smart card , often used in copy shops , has similar limitations .
The life span is adequate because even one write per minute , every minute , gives it a 2 year lifespan – that ’s a lot of copies .
Applications that need to write data more frequently use a different type of memory like SRAM .
How many writes an EEPROM will actually endure is anyone ’s guess .
Like an overclocked CPU , some will go way over the rated minimum , some will go a little over the minimum , but all should endure at least the rated number of writes .
The Flash Destroyer on the live feed is running at about 408 writes per minute .
It started at 08:11 GMT May 25 , and should reach a million on Wednesday night ( May 26 ) , and two million on Friday afternoon ( May 28 ) .
Can you guess the final count ?
Preorder the Flash Destroyer ‘ I like to solder ’ kit for $ 30 , including worldwide shipping .
When you ’re ready to destroy some flash , follow us after the break .
Concept Overview
A PIC 18F2550 fills an EEPROM with values , and then verifies the content .
Each successful write - verify cycle adds one to the counter display .
When the EEPROM starts to have read verification errors , the writing stops and the number of successful write - cycles is displayed .
This project was inspired by endless Slashdot discussions about solid - state storage .
There are n’t any tubes or moving parts in the EEPROM that deteriorate , yet in a not - unreasonable amount of time the chip will cease to work .
We find it fascinating and want to witness it first hand .
Technically this is an EEPROM Destroyer .
Flash memory is a type of EEPROM that is slightly different than the memory in the 24AA01 .
Flash Destroyer just sounds cooler .
Hardware

We used the freeware version of Cadsoft Eagle to make the circuit and PCB .
Download the latest files from the project Google Code page .
Microcontroller
A Microchip PIC 18F2550 microcontroller ( IC2 ) communicates with the EEPROM chip and drives the multiplexed display .
The 18F2550 comes in through - hole and surface mount packages , we used the through - hole DIP version for this kit .
The DIP package turns out to be a lot harder to get than the surface mount version , that drives up the price of the kit a bit because Seeed has to import chips from the US to China .
The PIC runs on 5volts .
The supply pin gets a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C1 ) .
A 20MHz crystal ( Q1 ) and two 27 pF capacitors ( C5 , C6 ) provide a clock source .
The 18F2550 with USB is overkill for this design , but the USB peripheral makes it easy to upgrade the firmware without a PIC programmer .
Currently USB is only used for firmware upgrades .
The USB peripheral has an internal 3.3 volt regulator that needs 0.22 uF of capacitance on the VUSB pin .
We used two 0.1 uF caps ( C2 , C3 ) on the prototype but the kits should ship with one 0.22 uF capacitor .
A standard USB B connector ( J2 ) is used because it ’s the most widely - available through - hole USB socket .
The PIC MCLR / VPP pin requires special handling .
The MCLR function measures the power supply and resets the PIC when the voltage is too low to operate reliably .
MCLR must be connected to the supply voltage through a current - limiting resistor ( R1 ) .
13volts are applied to the MCLR / VPP pin to put the PIC into programming mode .
This voltage could leak back through resistor R1 into the power supply and damage sensitive components on the PCB .
A small diode ( D1 ) keeps the programming voltage out of the power supply .
The 5 pin ICSP header provides access to the PIC programming pins .
Since all 21 available PIC I/O pins are used for the display and EEPROM , the programming pins are shared with the common cathode controls of two display segments ( read more about the display below ) .
We usually avoid sharing the programming pins with anything , but the cathode transistors do n’t use a lot of current and did n’t interfere with programming or debugging during development .
EEPROM
EEPROM is a type of data storage chip with a limited number of write cycles .
The Flash Destroyer tests the number times an EEPROM can be written before it stops correctly saving new values .
We used a Microchip 24AA01 - I/ P 128 byte I2C EEPROM ( IC2 ) , rated for 1 million write cycles .
Other voltages ( 24LC /24AA ) , brands , and sizes of I2C EEPROMs can be tested with a minor firmware upgrade .
The EEPROM is socketed so it ’s easy to swap in a new chip .
The EEPROM runs from the 5volt power supply , the power pin requires a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C4 ) .
Data goes in and out of the EEPROM on a two wire communication bus called I2C .
Devices on an I2C bus have open collector outputs – they can pull the signal low to make a 0 , but they do n’t output a high level to make a 1 .
Instead of the pins outputting a voltage , pull - up resistors hold the bus high .
Two 2K2 resistors ( R18 , R19 ) hold the I2C bus high , the devices on the I2C bus just pull the signals low as needed .
Some EEPROMs have a write protect pin and a configurable I2C address .
We grounded all four standard control pins so EEPROMs with these functions will be properly configured .
Display
Seven numeric LED blocks ( DISP1 - 7 ) display the number of successful EEPROM writes and any error status messages .
The seven blocks can count 9,999,999 successful writes .
If needed , the most significant digits of larger values could be shown using the decimal points on each block .
Directly driving the display would take more than 50 PIC pins , or a bunch of output expanders .
Instead , we use multiplexing to control all seven blocks with only 15 PIC pins .
Multiplexing is a technique that lights each block briefly in quick succession , giving the appearance that the blocks are always on .
Read more about multiplexed displays here and here .
Each block contains 8 LEDs , one for each segment and the decimal point .
The anode (+ ) side of each LED is brought to a pin .
Each block also has a ground pin that ’s connected internally to all the LED cathodes ( - ) .
A positive voltage applied to an anode pin lights an LED segment in the block .
The anodes of each block are connected to the same pin of the other blocks .
Each string of segments is connected one PIC pin through a current - limiting resistor ( R10 - R17 ) .
Segments in our block are rated for 25 mA continuous current , but are rated for a 150 mA pulse current when lit briefly in a multiplexed configuration .
We used a 120 ohm resistor for ~ 20 mA current because that ’s the maximum a PIC pin can output .
If the anodes were switched with something that can handle higher currents , smaller resistors could be used ( > 22 ohms ) to make the display much brighter .
Multiplexing requires a way to light each block briefly while the others stay off .
We do that by enabling the common cathode of each block while the correct anode pins are powered .
The current from a fully - lit block could be 160 mA or more , while a PIC pin can only sink about 20 mA .
We use a NPN transistor ( Q2 - Q8 ) to switch the heavier load , a 10 K base resistor ( R3 - R9 ) limits the amount of current the transistor draws from the PIC pin .

Button
A 6 mm tactile switch ( S1 ) connects to a PIC pin for user input .
A 10 K pull - up resistor ( R2 ) holds the PIC pin high when there ’s no input , a button press pulls the PIC pin low .
Power supply
The circuit is powered by 5volts .
A standard 7805 voltage regulator ( IC3 ) converts an external 7 - 10 volt supply to 5volts .
The supply voltage is provided through a 2.1 mm DC connector , center positive ( J1 ) .
The regulator has a 0.33 uF input capacitor ( C8 ) and a 0.1 uF output capacitor ( c7 ) .
It would probably be good to use an additional 10uF capacitor on both pins too , but the current arrangement is consistent with the 7805 datasheet .
PCB
We used the freeware version of Cadsoft Eagle to make the schematic and PCB for this project .

Building it
This is our first through - hole , ‘ I like to solder ’ kit .
It ’s a kit for people who like to solder , and it delivers with more than 100 action - packed pins .
We start soldering with the shortest components and work our way up :
First we solder the resistors , diodes , and capacitors .
Next the button , voltage regulator ( do n’t forget to bend it first ) , and transistors .
Finally we place the chunky tall stuff : the LED blocks , IC sockets , crystal , and jacks .
It ’s a good idea to power up the board and measure the supply voltage before putting the PIC or EEPROM chips in the sockets .
Probably the easiest way to test the supply voltage is to measure between pin 2 ( +5 volts ) and 3 ( ground ) of the ICSP header .
The supply should read 5 volts .
Firmware
The latest firmware download is on the project Google Code page .
The code is written in C , and is compiled with the Microchip C18 demonstration compiler .
The firmware has two primary tasks that are performed in a loop :
Write and verify the EEPROM with the PIC hardware I2C module .
Cycle through the LED blocks and display the correct number on each .
There are also occasional tasks , such as :
Save the current count to the PIC ’s internal EEPROM .
Detect errors and halt the write - verify process .
The USB connection is currently only used for firmware upgrades .
It is possible to add your own USB functions to the firmware , but there is currently NO USB functionality .
I2C EEPROM write and verify
A simple write - verify routine tests the EEPROM for write failures :
Fill the chip with the value 0x55 ( 01010101 in binary ) .
Read the chip and verify that all values match 0x55 .
If the values match , repeat with the XOR of the previous write value ( 0xaa , or 10101010 in binary ) .
Eventually the EEPROM will wear out , and the read value wo n’t match the write value .
When an error is detected , the Flash Destroyer saves the current write count to the PIC ’s internal EEPROM and stops the write - verify process .
The write and verify routine also detects a number of I2C bus errors , such as an EEPROM that stops responding .
On an I2C error the Flash Destroyer will also save the current count and halt testing .
We use the PIC hardware I2C module to communicate with the EEPROM .
The hardware module is somewhat faster than doing it via software .
For maximum flexibility , the source code also includes software I2C routines from the Bus Pirate that can be enabled with a #define switch .
In the next two sections we ’ll walk though the EEPROM write - verify process .
Logic analyzer output from a Saleae Logic illustrates each step .
The Logic is a great piece of kit with beautiful output .
This article was prepared well in advance , or we would have used the Open Logic Sniffer and SUMP to capture the waveforms instead .
Write the EEPROM
The PIC talks to the EEPROM over a two - wire I2C bus .
One wire carries data ( SDA ) , the other carries clock ticks ( SCL ) that tell devices when to read or write the data wire .
Here ’s a good overview of I2C .
The storage space inside the EEPROM is broken into pages .
Pages are usually between 8 and 256 bytes longs , depending on the size of the chip .
Only one page can be written at a time , then we have to give the EEPROM a chance to save the data before we can read or write again .
Our task is to fill the entire EEPROM with the same value and then verify the contents .
Writing the entire chip takes a bunch of small write operations , each separated by a delay while the chip completes the write .
Our EEPROM has 128 bytes of storage , organized into 8 byte pages , so takes 16 write - wait cycles to fill the whole chip .
Here ’s an overview of the EEPROM write process :
Send a start bit , 7bit address , write bit , and check for ACK Send the write pointer start address ( increments by page size each time ) , check for ACK Send one page of data to write , check each ACK .
End with a stop bit Send the I2C address until the EEPROM finishes saving and responds with an ACK .
Repeat steps 1 - 4 until the entire chip is filled .
Each step is explained and illustrated below .
Step 1 – Send a start bit , 7bit address , write bit , and check for ACK
All I2C transactions begin with a start bit .
The PIC pulls the data line ( SDA ) from high to low while the clock ( SCL ) is high .
Normally SDA does n’t change while the clock is high , and this ‘ illegal ’ state resets all the chips listening to the I2C bus .
After the start bit , the PIC sends the EEPROM ’s 7 bit I2C address , and the read or write bit .
For common Microchip EEPROMs the 7bit address is 0x50 ( 1010000 ) .
The eight bit tells the EEPROM if we want to read ( 1 ) or write ( 0 ) .
We want to write the chip , so the complete address to send is 10100000 ( 0xa0 ) .
We superimposed the bit value over each clock tick in the logic analyzer output above .
After the 8 data bits are sent , the PIC releases control of the SDA line and sends one more clock tick ( yellow highlighted area ) .
This ninth bit is a receive confirmation built into the I2C protocol .
The EEPROM ACKnowledges ( ACKs ) the address was received by pulling the SDA low .
If the chip was missing or the address incorrect , there would be no ACK and the bus would stay high because of the pull - up resistors .
The yellow area highlights where the EEPROM controls SDA and holds it low , this is the ACK .
Step 2 – Send the write start address ( increments by page size each time )
The second byte we send determines where the data is saved in the EEPROM ’s storage space .
Our little 128 byte EEPROM uses a single byte value to set an internal address pointer to one of the 128 bytes of internal storage .
Larger EEPROMs use two bytes to address more than 256 bytes of space .
The EEPROM ACKs the byte by holding SDA low ( yellow highlighted area ) .
The EEPROM can only write one page at a time , so we use multiple write operations to fill the whole chip .
Each time the write pointer is incremented by the page size until the entire chip is filled .
Our chip has 8 byte pages , so the address increments by 8 each time we write to the EEPROM .
First we write 8 bytes starting at data location 0 , then 8 bytes starting at location 8 , then at 16 , and so on , until the entire chip is filled .
Step 3 – Send one page of data to write , end with a stop bit
The PIC firmware alternates between filling the chip with 0x55 ( 01010101 ) and 0xaa ( 10101010 ) .
This alternating pattern of 1 and 0 should help detect ‘ stuck ’ bits or bytes that never change .
In this output 0x55 is being sent to the EEPROM .
Each byte we send is ACKed by the EEPROM pulling SDA low for the ninth clock bit ( yellow area ) .
After sending a full page ( 8 bytes ) , the I2C transaction is ended with an I2C stop bit .
A stop bit is an ‘ illegal ’ operation like the start bit , it is the only time the data signal changes from low to high while the clock is already high .
Step 4 – Send the I2C address until the EEPROM responds with an ACK
The EEPROM is not immediately ready for another write or read operation , it takes some time to save the page of data .
The EEPROM wo n’t respond to it ’s address while a write is in progress , so we can tell when a write is finished by sending the EEPROM ’s address until it ACKs .
The top logic capture shows the EEPROM ignoring its address while a write is in progress .
It leaves the SDA line high during the ACK bit ( top yellow highlight ) .
The bottom capture shows the first time the chip responds after the save is complete , the EEPROM holds SDA low during the ACK bit ( bottom yellow highlight ) .
Steps 1 - 4 are repeated , writing one page each time , until the entire chip is filled .
Read the EEPROM
Reading is a lot easier than writing .
EEPROM reads are not limited to a single page , we can read the entire chip in one operation instead of lots of segments .
The read operation goes like this :
Reset the address pointer to the beginning with a partial write operation Send a start bit , 7bit address , read bit , and check for ACK Read data , PIC ACKs each byte this time NACK the last byte to end the read , send a stop bit
Each step is explained and illustrated below .
Step 1 – Reset the address pointer to the beginning with a write operation
Unlike write operations , there ’s no opportunity to set the address pointer with the read command .
The read starts wherever the pointer is currently set .
Before we start reading from the EEPROM we need to tell it where we want to read from .
This is done with a partial write operation .
This command only sets the internal write address pointer , it does n’t contain any data so it does n’t change anything on the chip .
First we address the EEPROM and make sure it ’s responding .
A start bit resets the I2C bus , the 7 bit EEPROM address ( 0x50 ) and write bit ( 1 ) are sent , and the EEPROM ACKs ( yellow highlight ) .
This is the same as step 1 of the EEPROM write routine .
We want to start reading from the beginning of the EEPROM , so we send 0 to set the write pointer to the first byte .
The EEPROM responds with an ACK ( yellow highlight ) .
This is similar to step 2 of the EEPROM write routine , except the transaction is ended immediately with a stop bit .
No data follows , and nothing is actually written .
All we did was set the internal address pointer to the first location in the EEPROM .
Step 2 – Send a start bit , 7bit address , read bit , and check for ACK
The address pointer is set to the beginning of the chip , now we can use the chip ’s read address to fetch the data .
A start bit resets the I2C bus before the read .
Next , we send the 7 bit EEPROM address ( 1010000 ) and the read bit ( 1 ) .
Previously we sent a write bit ( 0 ) with the address , but this time we use the read bit ( 1 ) to tell the EEPROM we want to read from it .
The complete read address is 10100001 ( 0xa1 ) .
The EEPROM ACKs the read address ( shown in yellow ) , and will now output data onto the SDA pin each time the PIC raises and lowers the clock pin .
Step 3 – Read the chip , ACK each byte
Every 8 clock ticks from the PIC read one byte of data from the EEPROM .
The yellow highlighted area in the output is where the EEPROM manipulates SDA , the PIC always controls SCL .
On every ninth bit the EEPROM releases SDA , and it ’s the PIC ’s turn to ACKnowledge the data by pulling SDA low ( non-highlighted 9th bit ) .
Each byte read from the EEPROM is compared to the value we wrote in the previous step ( 0x55 or 0xaa ) .
A mismatch triggers the error handler which saves the current count and flashes an error message on the display .
Step 4 – NACK the last byte to end the read , send a stop bit
When we ’re done reading , we must Not ACKnowdlege ( NACK ) the last byte by leaving SDA high during the ACK bit .
NACK is very important because without it the EEPROM will continue to output data and ignore any further start or stop bits .
After NACKing a read we can end the transaction with an I2C stop bit .
If the contents of the EEPROM match the value written earlier , the counter shown on the display increments .
The counter is stored as a 32 bit unsigned long variable , with a maximum value of 4,294,967,295 before rolling over to 0 again .
After a successful write - verify cycle , the loop continues at the beginning .
Display driver
The display driver runs the multiplexed display .
It lights each 7 segment block briefly in quick succession , giving the appearance that the blocks are always on .
A timer in the PIC generates an interrupt a few hundred times per second .
When the timer interrupt triggers , the PIC runs a piece of code that disables the current 7 - segment block and sets the output pins for the next segment .
Save current value
The PIC saves the current write - verify count to its internal EEPROM when button S1 is pressed .
This EEPROM is inside the PIC , and separate from the EEPROM in IC2 .
This is handy if you need to power down the Flash Destroyer but want to save the current write count .
The count is saved with a simple checksum .
When the board is powered , the PIC reads the value in the EEPROM and the checksum .
If the checksum is good the count continues with the saved value .
If the checksum is bad , for example on a blank chip , the count starts from 0 .
Bootloader
For easy firmware updates we included our port of the Diolan USB bootloader from the USB IR Toy .
Hold button S1 down and then connect power to activate the bootloader .
The bootloader appears as an USB HID device on a computer , and does n’t require any drivers .
We use this bootloader a lot , so look for a comprehensive guide shortly .
The firmware can be updated with any of the Diolan utilities for Windows , Linux , Mac , BSD , etc .
The Flash Destroyer is not configured to be USB powered , and it requires an external power supply during firmware updates .
Using it
The Flash Destroyer requires a 7 - 10 volt DC external power supply with a common 2.1 mm DC connector ( center pin is positive ) .
‘ Flash ’ and ‘ destroy ’ are displayed briefly after power is connected .
Then the Flash Destroyer starts to write and verify the EEPROM .
Each time the chip is successfully verified the counter on the display increments .
Save current count
The counter value can be saved to the PIC ’s internal memory by pushing the button ( S1 ) .
The display will show ‘ save ’ .
This is handy if you need to unplug the Flash Destroyer but do n’t want to lose the current count .
To erase the saved value :
Press the button while the display shows ‘ destroy ’ after power is connected
The display will show ‘ erase ’ to confirm
Hold the button down the entire time ‘ erase ’ is on the display , or release the button now to cancel
The display will show ‘ erased ’ and the count will reset
Errors detected
The Flash Destroyer writes and then verifies the EEPROM until it detects an error .
The current firmware detects two error types :
Verify error ( dead )
I2C error ( I2C Err )
A verify error means that the Flash Destroyer wrote one value to the EEPROM , but read something different .
This is the primary failure the Flash Destroyer is designed to detect .
After enough writes the EEPROM will no longer hold new values , and will be ‘ stuck ’ at a previous value .
When a verify error is detected the current count is saved internally and the verification process stops .
The display alternates between the success count , and the verify error message ( dead ) .
Additional verification steps could be added to a future firmware .
I2C errors are related to random electrical problems or other potential defects .
I2C errors probably are n’t related to flash failure , but we thought it was good to catch them anyways .
An I2C error also aborts the verification process and automatically saves the current count .
The display alternates ‘ I2C Err ’ and the current count .
Speed
How long will it take for an EEPROM to burn out ?
The EEPROM is rated for a minimum of 1 million write cycles , but it could be many times that before there ’s an error .
At top speed we counted 736 write - verify cycles per minute , or 22hours to reach the minimum rated number of writes .
Since some users might not want their Flash Destroyer to burn out so quickly , we created multiple firmwares with different write frequencies :
Fast – continuous writing at maximum speed , reaches 1 million writes in one day .
Medium – writes every 1 second , reaches 1 million in 12 days .
Slow – writes every 1 minute , reaches 1 million in 2 years .
Load your preferred firmware using the USB bootloader .
Flash Destroyer kits ship with the fast firmware installed .
Taking it further
The first version of the Flash Destroyer firmware has pretty basic functionality .
We ’re already thinking of new features to add :
Menu of options ( speed , EEPROM type , etc )
Auto save on certain ‘ milestone ’ values
Verify read errors , I2C errors
Show larger values with decimals if needed .
USB connectivity for main firmware
Additional power supply capacitors on updated hardware

The amazing video of a father taking the brunt of an out - of - control car smashing into him and his tiny baby son has just been released .
The incident occurred in 2008 .
Then they heard screeching tires .
" I said to my old man that it was probably just another young pup doing a burn - out , " Mr Leach told " I was thinking I can take the hit .
I can repair but there 's no way my son is going to repair .
I thought if I get hit from behind then maybe I 'll break a leg .
" After , I pulled myself out and the little bloke out and then looked around for mum and dad - and I thought the worst . "
An 82 - year - old woman was driving the out - of - control car .
She went through a red traffic light , smashed into a parked car , and crossed a T - junction before she went over the sidewalk where the Leaches were walking .
It was believed that she had had a heart attack at the time of the incident .
Andrew 's parents , Caroline and David Leach , were seriously injured in the crash , but have recovered .
Andrew suffered a broken leg , while his baby son Haydn escaped without even a scratch .
Andrew said : " That day is the worst in my life - that moment is the first thing I think about every morning . "
The accident was captured on CCTV video in 2008 at an estate agent's in Penrith , Australia , but the amazing footage was just released now .
It shows the car hitting the elderly Leach couple who went flying into the air , as well as smashing into Andrew and pinning him against the storefront 's windows .
Estate agent Michael Ball said : " It 's amazing that he did not let go of his child .
The whole time he kept his child in his hands and he did not let go . "

" Sack tapping " is the new painful craze sweeping the nation 's teen boys .
That is : punching each other in the balls .
One child had his right ball amputated because he was punched so hard in it .
Prepare to wince .
" Sack tapping . "
It is a silly name for a deadly serious practice .
ABC
News describes it as " chicken of the groin , " which , again , does not make it sound serious at all .
" Chicken of the groin " might be a good name for a brand of canned pork product , but it is actually " the newest fad in schoolyard violence . "
Teenage boys are running around high schools punching each other in the testicles !
And that 's not all :
They are uploading videos of this to the Internet :
A search on YouTube reveals hundreds of videos of young boys , teens , and even members of the U.S. Navy , catching a friend unaware with a quick punch or slap to the genitals .
There 's even a " Judge Judy " mock court case involving a 12 - year - old " sack tapper " posted to the site .
Sack tapping is not some faceless virtual scourge .
It is a human tragedy .
Take the eye - watering tale of 14 year - old David Gibbons of Crosby , Minn .
He had to have his right testicle removed after being punched , but the worst part is probably the fact that he had to go on the local news and talk about his missing ball while sitting between his parents on a couch .
How is it that someone gets punched in the balls and they 're the one whose Google results are ruined for life ?
He 's going to show up at his first job interview and see the HR manager and her secretary giggling over this video :

But is sack tapping actually " the newest fad in schoolyard violence ? "
When I was in high school , sacks were tapped on a regular basis .
For weeks halls echoed with the distinctive slap produced by the back of the hand on the front of the groin .
Yet we never heard of balls being amputated ; there were no Judge Judy episodes about our antics .
What changed ?
The key difference between the sack taps of yore and the new , ball - killing breed is that the game we used to play was bounded by strict rules .
Basically , you were only tappable if the tapper flashed an upside - down " OK " sign with their hands and got you to look .
Tapping is groin - based , so you had to flash the sign below the belt .
Boys would walk around in the halls with a hand folded into the ball tap sign resting on their thigh .
If others were stupid enough to drop their gaze , they were punched in the groin .
Eventually the game died out , as the male student body learned quickly to fix their gaze around shoulder - level .
Sack tapping ( we called it " ball tagging " ) was self - limiting ; the clear rules guaranteed it would disappear before things got out of hand .
Today , sack tapping has changed from the elegant Darwinist exercise it once was .
These kids are just going around , willy - nilly , punching each other in the balls and then uploading this to YouTube as a badge of honor !
Clearly , sack tapping is suffering from the same breakdown of social order that scuttled bowling clubs and Elks lodges in an earlier era .
Teens are retreating further into a digital womb , where a sack is truly tapped only when it has been uploaded to YouTube and tweeted , MySpaced and Foursqaured to all of their friends .
Age - old social cues ( the ball - tap sign ) are forgotten .
And the chaos is reflected in the scrambled right ball of poor David Gibbons .

We 've already noted that Stan Lee would like to see a Doctor Strange movie .
But at Wizard World Anaheim , Smiling Stan hinted that the Sorcerer Supreme was next on the docket .

At a panel with Avi Arad to promote his new manga Ultimo , Lee mentioned that he would like to see a Doctor Strange film , and that " they will [ get to it ] pretty soon . "
When Lee later spoke with Superhero Hype at WWA , he made equally telling comments about the good doctor 's silver screen prospects :
I 'd like to see a great movie come out of it .
Doctor Strange is somewhat different from all the others .
With the nightmares and the other conventions , it 'll give them a chance to have some great special effects and a slightly different type of hero .

Lee 's been a proponent of a Doctor Strange movie for a while now , but is this a sign that Stephen Strange is next line for the celluloid treatment ?
Of course , Stan has been just as vocal for his support of an Ant - Man film ( he 's met with Scott Pilgrim director Edgar Wright , who 's been tied Ant - Man ) , but he 's said nothing like this about that project .

( Health.com ) -- Children in Grades 3 through 6 who are obese are more likely to be bullied than their normal - weight peers , a new study has found .
No one who has attended grade school -- or who has even the slightest familiarity with children -- will be surprised by these findings .
What is surprising , however , is that obese children are bullied more often even if they possess qualities that can discourage bullies , such as having good social skills or doing well in school .
" When we started this study , I really suspected that we might find that the obesity or overweight might not be the driving force , " says the lead author of the study , Julie Lumeng , M.D. , a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan , in Ann Arbor .
" What we found is that it did n't matter .
No matter how good your social skills , if you were overweight or obese you were more likely to be bullied . "
In the study , which appears this week in the journal Pediatrics , Lumeng and her colleagues followed more than 800 children -- all born in 1991 -- from 10 cities across the U.S.
When the children were in the third , fifth , and sixth grades , the researchers surveyed teachers , mothers , and the children themselves about whether they were bullied , and also surveyed the adults about the children 's social skills .
They then compared these responses with the children 's body mass index , a simple ratio of height and weight .
Overall , kids who were obese were 65 percent more likely to be bullied than their peers of normal weight ; overweight kids were 13 percent more likely to be bullied , although that finding was not statistically significant , the study notes .
This pattern persisted even when the researchers took into account other factors that are associated with both obesity and being bullied , such as coming from a low - income family or doing poorly in school .
Health.com : 10 habits of healthy families
Still , the findings do n't rule out the possibility that being overweight and being bullied share a common , underlying cause , says Matthew N. Davis , M.D. , a primary care physician and the director of the C.S. Mott Children 's Hospital National Poll on Children 's Health .
" There 's always been the question in the back of people 's minds about whether there was another factor involved which was related to both bullying and obesity , " says Davis , who was not involved in Lumeng 's study .
Sylvia Rimm , Ph.D. , a clinical professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine , in Cleveland , Ohio , suggests that the low self - esteem of overweight children may make them targets for their peers .
Rimm , who was n't involved in the study , surveyed thousands of middle - school children for a 2004 book , " Rescuing the Emotional Lives of Overweight Kids . "
" Kids who considered themselves very overweight not only were bullied , but ... indicated more loneliness , saw themselves as troublemakers , and saw themselves as sad , fearful , and wimpy , " she says .
" They really have huge struggles . "
One reason that children might be more apt to pick on their overweight classmates is that they are taking after adults , says Davis .
" Children pick up behaviors from adults , so we always have to keep in mind how we 're modeling respect for others around multiple issues , including weight , " he says .
" Imagine how many signals kids get about weight just by hearing conversations by adults or seeing advertisements on TV .
The messages are everywhere in terms of trying to control weight and be a different size than you are right now . "
Wendy Craig , Ph.D. , a professor of psychology at Queens University in Kingston , Ontario , says that bullying and obesity are both major public health concerns that teachers and schools -- and not just parents -- need to address .

Teachers " are like social architects , " says Craig , who has studied bullying for more than a decade but was n't involved in the current study .
" They set the tone for what 's acceptable .
Teachers reinforce these messages every day in their classroom when they interact with kids . "
In fact , positive interactions with parents may help prevent bullying in the first place , according to another new study , presented today at the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies in Vancouver , B.C .
In that study , researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center analyzed data from the 2007 National Survey of Children 's Health , which included more than 45,000 parents of children between the ages of 10 and 17 .
Children whose parents shared ideas and talked often with them were about 40 percent less likely to bully other children compared to the children of parents who said they did n't do those things regularly .
On the other hand , the children of parents who said they are often angry with them or who feel bothered by them were up to three times more likely to be bullies , according to the study .
Interestingly , previous studies have suggested that obese children are more likely to bully others , in addition to being the victims of bullying .
One possible explanation for this , Lumeng says , is that children who have difficulty staying calm and controlling their impulses to lash out at others may also have a hard time regulating their eating , and may eat for emotional reasons rather than out of hunger .

Is it baby fat or obesity ?
Overweight children are caught in a vicious circle of self - destructive behavior , Rimm says .
" They 're inactive , and they 're sad kids , and they use eating as gratification , " she says .
" Of course , the effect is that continued eating is almost their only source of satisfaction , and so it 's a terrible cycle . "
Protecting overweight kids -- socially and physically -- requires helping them break this cycle , Rimm adds .
" A key thing is to discover their strengths and get them involved and active in extracurricular activities , " she says .
" If they concentrate only on their weight , they 're not going to build confidence . "
BANGKOK , May 19 ( Reuters ) - The Thai stock exchange was on fire and parts of Bangkok were hit by power blackouts on Wednesday as violence continued , even though anti-government protest leaders surrendered and troops said they were in control .
The stock exchange building was on fire , the exchange ’s president told Reuters , while witnesses said major tourist hotels had lost power as black smoke billowed around buildings in the Thai capital .
The stock market had closed early due to the violence .
Thai Defence Minister General Pravit Wongsuwan said a curfew may be imposed on Bangkok to deal with continued unrest after troops dispersed anti-government protesters in a major offensive that killed at least four people and wounded 50 others .

Immense ice sheets have grown and shrunk many times ( Image : Ashley Cooper / SpecialistStock / SplashdownDirect / Rex Features )
Ice age timeline
BACK in 1993 , a boy playing football near Nanjing , China , suddenly fell through the ground .
He had inadvertently found a new cave , later named Hulu , which has turned out to be a scientific treasure chest .
Besides two Homo erectus skeletons , it contains stalagmites that have helped solve one of the greatest mysteries in climate science : why the ice ages came and went when they did .
For more than 2 million years , Earth ’s climate has been oscillating wildly .
Immense ice sheets slowly advance across northern lands , then suddenly melt away to leave the planet basking in a relatively brief period of warmth before the ice creeps back again .
Climate scientists have long suspected that these glacial cycles are triggered by changes in our planet ’s orbit .
Yet while this theory has had many successes , it fails to explain one critical fact : why the ice ages end every 100,000 years or so .
“ It ’s a big problem , ” says Larry Edwards of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis .
Edwards is part of a group of researchers who may finally have the answer , thanks to Hulu and other nearby caves .
If their conclusions are right , then the greatest ice sheets of the past were remarkably vulnerable , melting away when there was just a glimmer of extra sunlight .
But what have stalagmites in China got to do with the vast ice sheets that covered much of Europe and Siberia , and North America ?
By the middle of the 19th century , it was clear that there had once been a “ Great Ice Age ” …
After an 18 year hiatus , AutoCAD appears to be headed back to the Mac platform , according to screen shots of a new beta posted on an Italian Mac forum .
The screen shots , appearing on Italiamac depict the installation screens and interface for an upcoming Autodesk AutoCAD 64 - bit early beta release for Mac OS X called " Sledgehammer . "
The last time Autodesk 's AutoCAD drafting software was made available for the Mac was in 1992 , with Release 12 .
The current 2011 version , available only for Windows , is designated Release 25 .
Object recognition is one of the core topics in computer vision research :
After all , a computer that can see is n’t much use if it has no idea what it ’s looking at .
Researchers at MIT , working with colleagues at the University of California , Los Angeles , have developed new techniques that should make object recognition systems much easier to build and should enable them use computer memory more efficiently .
A conventional object recognition system , when trying to discern a particular type of object in a digital image , will generally begin by looking for the object ’s salient features .
A system built to recognize faces , for instance , might look for things resembling eyes , noses and mouths and then determine whether they have the right spatial relationships with each other .
The design of such systems , however , usually requires human intuition : A programmer decides which parts of the objects are the right ones to key in on .
That means that for each new object added to the system ’s repertoire , the programmer has to start from scratch , determining which of the object ’s parts are the most important .
It also means that a system designed to recognize millions of different types of objects would become unmanageably large .
Each object would have its own , unique set of three or four parts , but the parts would look different from different perspectives , and cataloguing all those perspectives would take an enormous amount of computer memory .
In a paper that they ’ll present at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ’ Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in June , postdoc Long ( Leo ) Zhu and Professors Bill Freeman and Antonio Torralba , all of MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , and Yuanhao Chen and Alan Yuille of UCLA describe an approach that solves both of these problems at once .
Like most object - recognition systems , their system learns to recognize new objects by being “ trained ” with digital images of labeled objects .
But it does n’t need to know in advance which of the objects ’ features it should look for .
For each labeled object , it first identifies the smallest features it can — often just short line segments .
Then it looks for instances in which these low - level features are connected to each other , forming slightly more sophisticated shapes .
Then it looks for instances in which these more sophisticated shapes are connected to each other , and so on , until it ’s assembled a hierarchical catalogue of increasingly complex parts whose top layer is a model of the whole object .
Economies of scale
Once the system has assembled its catalogue from the bottom up , it goes through it from the top down , winnowing out all the redundancies .
In the parts catalogue for a horse seen in profile , for instance , the second layer from the top might include two different representations of the horse ’s rear :
One could include the rump , one rear leg and part of the belly ; the other might include the rump and both rear legs .
But it could turn out that in the vast majority of cases where the system identifies one of these “ parts , ” it identifies the other as well .
So it will simply cut one of them out of its hierarchy .
Even though the hierarchical approach adds new layers of information about digitally depicted objects , it ends up saving memory because different objects can share parts .
That is , at several different layers , the parts catalogues for a horse and a deer could end up having shapes in common ; to some extent , the same probably holds true for horses and cars .
Wherever a shape is shared between two or more catalogues , the system needs to store it only once .
In their new paper , the researchers show that , as they add the ability to recognize more objects to their system , the average number of parts per object steadily declines .
Although the researchers ’ work promises more efficient use of computer memory and programmers ’ time , “ it is far more important than just a better way to do object recognition , ” says Tai Sing Lee , an associate professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University .
“ This work is important partly because I feel it speaks to a couple scientific mysteries in the brain . ”
Lee points out that visual processing in humans seems to involve five to seven distinct brain regions , but no one is quite sure what they do .
The researchers ’ new object recognition system does n’t specify the number of layers in each hierarchical model ; the system simply assembles as many layers as it needs .
“ What kind of stunned me is that [ the ] system typically learns five to seven layers , ” Lee says .
That , he says , suggests that it may perform the same types of visual processing that takes place in the brain .
In their paper , the MIT and UCLA researchers report that , in tests , their system performed as well as existing object - recognition systems .
But that ’s still nowhere near as well as the human brain .
Lee says that the researchers ’ system currently focuses chiefly on detecting the edges of two - dimensional depictions of objects ; to approach the performance of the human brain , it will have to incorporate a lot of additional information about surface textures and three - dimensional contours , as the brain does .
Zhu adds that he and his colleagues are also pursuing other applications of their technology .
For instance , their hierarchical models naturally lend themselves not only to automatic object recognition — determining what an object is — but also automatic object segmentation — labeling an object ’s constituent parts .

Fined for dropping chips
Kyle Russell , 12 , had just bought his lunch and was standing at his school gates when the aggressive bird flew down to steal a chip .
He dropped the bag in fright , but was spotted by a plain - clothes litter enforcement officer who issued the £ 50 fine .

The Glasgow City Council official ignored the tearful schoolboy ’s attempts to explain his actions .
Now the youngster , who recently received a good behaviour award from teachers , faces the possibility of being referred to the Children ’s Panel after furious mum Michelle , 43 , refused to pay up .
Mrs Russell , a catering manager at Knightswood Secondary , where her son is a first - year pupil , yesterday attacked the warden ’s actions .
She said : “ My son is not a rule breaker .
He knows the importance of not dropping litter , but it was a split - second reaction .
“ He immediately apologised to the council officer . ” Campaign group Big Brother Watch condemned the move and offered to take up the mother ’s legal battle .
Alex Deane , its director , said : “ This could only happen in a target - driven , bureaucratic culture of overpowered jobsworths like ours today .
“ The council has acted with no common sense or human feeling and should be ashamed .
“ It should drop the fine and apologise and the petty warden who issued the fixed penalty notice should be fired . ”
Last year Big Brother Watch gave legal advice to Vanessa Kelly , 26 , from Oldbury , West Midlands , who was fined £ 75 by a council worker for feeding ducks with her 17 - month - old son Harry .
She forced the council to back down after an outcry over the petty fine .
Glasgow City Council , which has increased plain - clothes patrols outside the school , began enforcing littering fixed penalty notices for under - 16s in 2008 as part of a £ 5 million initiative to clean up the city .
It has issued 244 fixed penalty notices to young people between the age of 12 and 16 since February 2008 , when the scheme began .
Councils have the right to impose fixed penalty notices on anyone over eight years old , the age of criminal responsibility .
Anyone issued with the ticket can pay the fine or take part in a clean - up event .
But if neither of these options are taken up the child may appear before a Children ’s Panel .
To date , no youngsters under the age of 16 have been referred for littering .
Last night a spokesman for Glasgow City Council said it had not received an appeal against the ticket .
With his decision to boost defense spending , President Obama is continuing the process of re-inflating the Pentagon that began in late 1998 — fully three years before the 9/11 attacks on America .
The FY 2011 budget marks a milestone , however :
The inflation - adjusted rise in spending since 1998 will probably exceed 100 percent in real terms by the end of the fiscal year .
Taking the new budget into account , the Defense Department has been granted about $ 7.2 trillion since 1998 , when the post - Cold War decline in defense spending ended .
The rise in spending since 1998 is unprecedented over a 48 - year period .
In real percentage terms , it ’s as large as the Kennedy - Johnson surge ( 43 percent ) and the Reagan increases ( 57 percent ) combined .
Whether one looks at the entire Pentagon budget or just that part not related to the wars , current spending is above the peak years of the Vietnam War era and the Reagan years .
And it ’s set to remain there .
Looking forward , the Obama administration plans to spend more on the Pentagon over the next eight years than any administration since World War II .
Why should the Pentagon budget rise so much , so fast ?
Why should it be exempted from the recently announced discretionary spending freeze ?
And why should it be stabilizing at levels above the highest years of the Cold War ?
The most ready explanation is that the War on Terrorism , and especially military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , are the cause .
But these activities presently claim less than 20 percent of the Pentagon ’s budget .
For the period 1998 - 2011 , overseas contingency operations have consumed less than 17 percent of all funding .
Take today ’s wars out of the picture entirely and the rise since 1998 is still 54 percent in real terms .
Why More Than the Cold War ?
Our recent study of the post -1998 defense spending surge , An Undisciplined Defense , set out to identify the factors driving Pentagon costs upward .
Much of the post -1998 surge can be attributed to a mix of policy choices and policy failures .
And this belies the notion that today ’s high level of spending simply reflects hard and fast security " requirements . "
In short : If America ’s leaders can find the will , then there is a way to substantial savings .
Four features of post - Cold War U.S. security policy have been especially important in driving putative " requirements " upward — and all admit alternative action .
Beginning in the 1990s , successive U.S. administrations have adopted goals and missions for the armed forces that are vaguer and more ambitious than those of the Cold War period .
Military modernization efforts have suffered from especially weak prioritization and poor integration .
They have been distinctly undisciplined , leading to higher research , development , and equipment procurement costs .
Planned efforts at defense reform have been insufficient and weakly prosecuted .
Thus , the savings they achieved fell far short of what was needed and possible .
The United States has undertaken and persevered in protracted wars of a type for which the U.S. military was ill - suited and improperly equipped .
Goal Inflation and Discordant Modernization
Following the collapse of Soviet power , America ’s leaders set more ambitious goals for the U.S. military , despite its smaller size .
This entailed requiring the armed services to sustain and extend their continuous global presence , improving their readiness and speed , increasing peacetime engagement activities , and preparing to conduct more types of missions quickly and in more areas .
Recent U.S. strategy has looked beyond the traditional goals of defense and deterrence , seeking to use military power to actually prevent the emergence of threats and to " shape " the international environment .
U.S. defense planners also elevated the importance of lesser and hypothetical threats , thus requiring the military to prepare for many more lower - probability contingencies .
These ambitions have led to the rise in Pentagon operations and maintenance ( O&M ) expenditures , as well as a larger - than - necessary force structure and greater equipment requirements .
One ongoing goal of the Pentagon has been to modernize forces .
This ambitious modernization between 1990 and today has reflected three different imperatives or directions , and these have been poorly integrated .
Big - ticket " legacy " programs conceived during the Cold War and enjoying considerable institutional momentum ; New programs , like Predator drones , reflecting the potential of information and other emerging technologies ; and " Adaptive " programs like mine - resistant armored vehicles , which correspond to new mission requirements , such as counterinsurgency .
The Pentagon has failed to adequately integrate these trends or prioritize among them .
Instead , they have all gone forward in parallel , competing for funds .
This situation puts unrelenting upward pressure on the budget .
Legacy programs , which tend to be backward - looking , have predominated .
Thus , despite the Pentagon ’s spending $ 2.5 trillion on modernization between 1989 and 2003 , there was a lack of preparedness for counterinsurgency and counterterrorism tasks after 2001 .
Notably , the decisions to pacify Iraq and Afghanistan by military means entailed a new wave of equipment purchases .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has promised to impose stricter priorities on defense acquisition .
But this is n’t the first time an administration announced a " get tough " policy in this area .
For instance , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also vowed to tackle the dysfunctional acquisition process , lopping off the Army ’s Crusader artillery system and Comanche helicopter program along the way .
This latest reform cycle will not likely accomplish more than swapping out a few disfavored systems for a few favored ones .
No actual savings will leave the Pentagon orbit .
Shortfalls in Defense Reform
Reforming the post - Cold War military was supposed to enable it to " do more for less . "
Preserving the " peace dividend " — a reduction in the military budget and the application of the savings to other pressing needs — depended on it .
Structural reform also was necessary because the military suffered a decrease in efficiency when it got smaller .
This was due to some loss in economies of scale in support and acquisition activities .
Options for reform were plentiful .
These included reducing service redundancies , streamlining command structures , and consolidating a range of support and training functions .
Other worthwhile targets of reform were the Pentagon ’s acquisition , logistics , and financial management systems .
But reform efforts fell short of their promise , due to institutional resistance and bureaucratic inertia .
Only two initiatives — competitive sourcing and military base closures — were pursued vigorously enough to yield significant annual savings .
And these savings have amounted to less than 4 percent of the current defense budget — clearly not enough to save the " peace dividend . "
The difficulty of defense reform goes to the heart of governance problems in the defense area .
There is an imbalance between effective civilian and military authority , between " joint " and individual service authority , and between public and special interests .
In some respects , the system is a feudalistic one .
Its functioning normally depends on largesse and a fair amount of deference to " subordinate " offices .
Civilian authorities might challenge and alter this configuration , but that would entail considerable political risk .
Increased Labor Costs
Why have today ’s wars been so inordinately expensive in relative terms ?
Measured in 2010 dollars , the Korean War cost $ 393,000 per year for every person deployed .
And the Vietnam conflict cost $ 256,000 .
By contrast , the Iraq and Afghanistan commitments have cost $ 792,000 per year per person .
This is due partly to America ’s reliance on high - cost " volunteer " ( professional ) military labor , which began after the Vietnam War .
This type of military is susceptible to steep increases in personnel costs if it gets bogged down in large - scale , protracted , labor - intensive wars of occupation and counterinsurgency .
Combat pay , retention bonuses , and recruitment costs soar .
Overall , military personnel costs rose 50 percent in real terms between 2001 and 2010 , although the military labor pool grew by less than 2 percent .
This dramatic increase in labor costs calls into question any potential large - scale counterinsurgency operations , which require more , not fewer boots on the ground — unless , of course , cost is no object .
Because of the costs involved , the Pentagon has been reluctant to permanently increase the number of full - time military personnel , despite high levels of activity even before the current wars .
Thus , increases in ground troops have been largely counterbalanced by reductions in Navy and Air Force personnel .
Instead , the Pentagon has turned increasingly to private contractors , whose employees have assumed many of the support functions previously performed by Pentagon personnel .
Since 1989 , the pool of Pentagon military and civilian employees has shrunk by more than 30 percent , while the number of contract workers has probably grown by 40 percent .
As a result , the total Pentagon workforce may have been re-inflated to its Cold War size , but with contract labor playing a much bigger role .
Contract labor is generally cheaper than Pentagon in - house labor , military or civilian .
However , a problem routinely noted by the Government Accountability Office is that Pentagon ’s financial management of contracts is weak .
At any rate , whatever savings have been realized by replacing in - house labor with contract labor has been overshadowed by the overall increase in the Pentagon ’s total workforce .
The re-inflation of the workforce partly registers in the budget as an unusually steep increase in operations and maintenance spending , because this account covers much of contract labor .
Calculated in inflation - adjusted per person terms , operations and maintenance expenditures are 2.5 times higher today than in 1989 .
In absolute terms ( also corrected for inflation ) , O&M spending has risen 75 percent since the Reagan years .
The Primacy of U.S. Military Spending
The factors outlined above have converged to give America a historically unique predominance in military spending .
The United States today is responsible for nearly half of all military expenditure worldwide .
In 1986 , it claimed only 28 percent .
Especially notable is the changed balance between U.S. spending and the total amount spent by potential adversary states .
The United States has gone from spending one - third less than its adversaries in 1986 to spending 150 percent more than potential adversary states in 1986 .
Had Ronald Reagan sought to achieve the ratio between U.S. and adversary spending that existed in 2006 , he would have had to nearly quadruple his defense budgets .
And , of course , the 2006 Pentagon ’s budget has n’t receded but instead grown by another 20 percent in real terms .
These calculations suggest that the United States ’ recent levels of defense expenditure are largely detached from other nations ’ efforts to build military power .
And the wars explain only a small part of the difference .
Instead , the divergence points to a change in what the US defense establishment hopes to accomplish by means of military power , how fast , and how far afield .
Can We Roll Back Pentagon Spending ?
America ’s singular investment in the means of war has n’t purchased clear and sure progress toward a more secure and stable world .
Nor has it purchased an efficient military closely adapted to the current security environment .
That the nation should persist down this road for more than a decade suggests a lapse in attention to the strategic costs and benefits associated with its chosen defense posture .
It ’s as though the nation had trillions to burn .
The road not taken during the past 15 years would have involved a more forceful and thorough - going approach to defense reform .
A more sensible Pentagon strategy would take a more disciplined approach to equipment acquisition that better integrated the various trends and service plans , and tailored them more closely to new conditions .
And the United States as a whole would have demonstrated greater restraint and greater specificity in defining post - Cold War military goals and missions .
A permissive spending environment has been a necessary precondition for Pentagon bloat , which several political realities have helped generate and sustain .
First , and obviously , the September 2001 attacks overrode any tendencies to suggest economizing on defense .
Curiously , though , Gallup polls show that public support for increased defense spending was higher in the two years prior to the attacks than in the two years after .
Support has receded significantly since then , but this has n’t spurred a serious re-evaluation of the budget .
At present , both Democratic and Republican leaders are disinclined — each for their own reasons — to press for Pentagon budget reform and restraint .
There is little political gain in it , and much political risk .
In this calculation , the balance of raw public opinion is less important than the capacity of the contending parties to excite and mobilize it .
Emerging fiscal realities may soon focus more critical attention on how the nation allocates its resources among competing goals , military and non-military .
And the recent freeze on most discretionary spending suggests the contours of the coming battle :
It will be the Pentagon versus everything else .
In this light , our most important finding is that much of the surge in Pentagon spending since 1998 has been a matter of choice and will , not a matter of national security " requirements . "
This puts the ball back in the political court , where it belongs .
If there is to be progress in rebalancing our budget , it will depend on pressuring the administration and Congress to deliver real change that matters .

The UK has just passed a far - reaching " Digital Economy " bill that gets the judiciary into the website - blocking business and orders ISPs to pass on copyright notices from media companies .
It also makes it easy to expand into throttling and Internet disconnections a year from now .
The moves are explicitly done to help the UK 's music and movie industries .
This " help the rightsholders ! " thinking has taken such hold in the government that an " IP address " can now be defined as an " Intellectual Property ( IP ) address " rather than an " Internet Protocol address " in official government correspondence — and no one bats an eye .
A reader from the UK wrote us with the unintentionally hilarious details .
After the reader sent a letter of concern to his own MP , the letter was forwarded to the Department for Business , Innovation , & Skills , which backed the Digital Economy bill .
The Department replied with a letter of its own , describing how rightsholders can find suspected infringers .
Rightsholders can " seek to download a copy of that material and in doing so capture information about the source , " said the government letter , " including the Intellectual Property ( IP ) address along with a date and time stamp . "
From the BIS letter
Sure , it 's just a funny mistake on a single letter .
But given the context of the entire debate , it looks like an unintentionally revealing peek into the government 's collective mind on this issue .
What 's the main use for the basic plumbing of the Internet ?
Why , hunting down copyright infringers , of course !

When Baugur began buying up the British high street in 2004 the Icelandic outfit , led by its handsome executive chairman Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson , was hailed as a new breed of Viking raider .
The Icelander with the shoulder - length blond hair and black designer clothes behaved more like a rock star than a sober businessman , throwing champagne - fuelled parties and seducing business associates with trips by private jet to Reykjavík to sample a thriving 24 - hour party scene as the small island nation reinvented itself as a banking hothouse .
On the London circuit Jóhannesson , a paper billionaire at one time , was feted as the new kingmaker of British retail , in league with tycoons such as Sir Philip Green as he poured hundreds of millions of pounds into an acquisition spree that swallowed up retailers from swanky jeweller Mappin & Webb to House of Fraser and no-frills food chain Iceland .
At the height of its powers , the Baugur empire had a turnover of £ 5 bn .
But six years on the party is over and the mother of all hangovers has set in .
Last week Jóhannesson , along with a number of former directors of collapsed Icelandic bank Glitnir , were hit with a $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) US lawsuit that accuses them of a " sweeping conspiracy " to seize control of the bank and , latterly , drain cash out of it – actions that contributed to its eventual collapse .
Steinunn Gubjartsdóttir , who heads Glitnir 's winding - up committee and is behind the US legal action , gives a bald assessment of what the team of forensic accountants from Kroll , who have spent the last year combing through its books , found : " There is evidence supporting the allegation that Glitnir Bank was robbed from the inside . "
The 80 - page filing lodged at New York 's supreme court last week reads like the plot of a movie .
It even comes with a compelling title – " Project Tornado " – which , it is claimed , was the shorthand used by the men , who include Thorsteinn Jonsson and Lárus Welding , Glitnir 's former chairman and chief executive , to describe their plan to gain control of the bank .
The lawsuit paints a picture of a bank that became a personal fiefdom .
The documents allege that Jóhannesson , whose father started one of Iceland 's biggest retail chains , discount supermarket Bónus , was the " ringleader " of a " cabal of businessmen " who worked together to " wrest control of Glitnir and fraudulently drain over $ 2bn out of the bank to fill their pockets and prop up their own failing companies " .
And in another damning development for the reputation of auditors , the suit also accuses PricewaterhouseCoopers , the world 's largest accountancy firm , of malpractice and negligence .
Jóhannesson 's glamorous wife Ingibjörg Pálmadóttir is also one of the defendants .
The couple sought to add to their trophies – which include two apartments in New York worth an estimated $ 25 m and a 144ft yacht named Viking – by opening a boutique hotel in Reykjavík .
The $ 30.8 m borrowed to open 101 Hotel has not been repaid .
The sensational lawsuit adds to mounting pressure on the disgraced elite who controlled Iceland 's three main banks – Glitnir , Kaupthing and Landsbanki – and led the island 's transformation from fishing economy to financial superpower in the debt - fuelled spending boom that preceded the credit crunch .
The uncomfortable verdict that has emerged from Iceland 's official post - mortem into the crisis – which forced the fiercely independent nation to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help – was that its financial system was shot through with corruption .
The truth commission report , published last month , also claimed Iceland 's three biggest banks were in the thrall of their major shareholders .
And , after more than a year of piecing together the evidence , the reckoning has now begun for the country 's disgraced former banking bosses .
Last week prosecutors arrested and detained Kaupthing 's former chief executive , Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson , on suspicion of offences including embezzlement and falsifying documents .
In another dramatic development , Kaupthing 's erstwhile chairman , Sigurdur Einarsson , has been put on Interpol 's wanted list .
Height : 1.8 m , weight : 251lbs , hair : bald , says the description alongside the mugshot .
Lawyers acting for Glitnir allege the men created a web of companies that enabled Jóhannesson to circumvent the Icelandic financial regulator and ultimately speak for nearly 40 % of Glitnir 's shares and 33 % of the voting rights .
They say he " stacked " Glitnir 's board with individuals connected to his other interests and " hand selected " an inexperienced candidate – Lárus Welding – to replace its chief executive .
Indeed , one email uncovered by investigators acknowledges the reality of two men's relationship , with Welding complaining that Jóhannesson treated him " more like a branch manager " than a chief executive .
How much money the Icelandic authorities can realistically hope to claw back is debatable , as estimates of Jóhannesson 's personal wealth fall far short of the £ 1.3 bn taken out in loans between April 2007 and February 2008 that is the focus of the legal claim .
Baugur collapsed like a house of cards in the credit crunch with any investments that were worth anything seized by the administrators of the defunct Icelandic banks ..
Lawyers acting for Glitnir have won a court order to freeze Jóhannesson 's assets around the world .
He has been liquidating assets and they estimate he made $ 85 m ( £ 57 m ) from the sale of offshore assets last year .
There are also his New York apartments to consider ; it is understood Jóhannesson was served with the court papers at his apartment in the exclusive Manhattan enclave of Gramercy Park .
Jóhannesson denies the allegations , arguing that they are politically motivated and a new iteration of a long - running vendetta against him .
He was quoted last week as saying " it 's just politics " and that he had " proof " to account for his actions .
Glitnir has chosen to sue in New York because central to its case is a $ 1bn US bond sale in September 2007 where the true state of the bank 's finances were obfuscated – with the help , it is claimed , of PwC .
" The defendants … used their control of the bank and funds raised in US financial markets to issue massive ' loans ' to , and fund a series of equity transactions with , companies Jóhannesson controlled in an effort to stave off their eventual collapse and enhance the value of their publicly traded stock , " the court filing alleges .
PwC says its opinion was based on " information and data the accountants had access to at that time " .
The case is expected to take more than a year to come to trial .
The Swiss wanted to rear cattle in Tanzania and in so doing completely disturbed the ecosystem : the example of the Mkwaja Ranch shows how dependant agriculture is on a functioning ecosystem .
And what a serious effect its encroachment can have on a sensitive balance .
Giraffes and other African hoofed animals are only slowly returning to the former grounds of the Mkwaja Ranch ( picture : Judith Sitters / ETH Zurich ) ( more pictures )
After the Second World War a practical experiment was carried out in Tanzania , which provided deep insights into the diversity of ecosystems .
The Mkwaja Ranch was founded in the 1950s by the Anglo - Swiss sisal producer Amboni .
Here , in the savannah of western Tanzania , the company wanted to rear cattle in order to be able to provide the workers on their sisal plantations with good meat .
The ranch was built near the coast over an area of 400 square kilometres .
Using native Zebu cows and Boran bulls from Kenya , Swiss farmers bred fast growing and robust high - performance cattle .
In contrast to the European standard of breeding , the animals were initially reared in the African manner .
They were allowed to graze during the day and spent the night in protective enclosures , so - called bomas or kraals .
Tsetse flies out of control
The experiment started successfully , the cattle thrived and the ranch management was satisfied .
Then , however , the cattle started to be affected by diseases which were transmitted by ticks and tsetse flies .
The farmers tried , unsuccessfully , to get the fly situation under control by using fly barriers and sterilised males , and for decades they concentrated on medical treatment and prophylaxis .
While the ranch management were busily concentrating on fighting the diseases , they overlooked the beginning of a subtle and disastrous development : bushes were growing on the grassland .
The appearance of bushes became the biggest problem of this practical experiment .
It was the reason why the experiment ultimately failed .
The general economic and political conditions of Amboni also changed , sisal production was no longer profitable for them and as a result they gave up the ranch in 2000 .
The land was turned into a national park .

Even in the early 70s , the farm management had already realised that the situation was in danger of running out of control and got help from ETH Zurich .
In 1973 Frank Kloetzli , a titular professor emeritus for plant sociology and botany , began to work out a scientific basis for a change of strategy by the management .
He found out that the redistribution of nutrients , which was being caused by the large amounts of manure in the bomas , could be reduced by rotational grazing .
Kloetzli used goats to prevent the growth of bushes , a measure which was successful for a while .
The wide range of problems caused by the interventions in the complex savannah ecosystem , however , eventually became too much for the farm management .
" The cultivation of the ranch was becoming increasingly expensive , " explains Peter Edwards , Professor of Plant Ecology at ETH " and so it had to be closed in the end . "
From 1998 onwards Edwards has continued research on the ranch .
To date he has led three research projects to discover what influence cattle breeding has on the savannah ecosystem .
Chain - reaction of cattle breeding
In the first phase the plant ecologist and his team examined what effects cattle rearing had on the ecosystem of the ranch area .
At its peak , there were some 15,000 cattle here .
They displaced the local wildlife such as antelopes and giraffes , which used to shape the vegetation through their grazing .
Without the grazing of native wildlife the original savannah with its open grassland and permeable tree population changed , with tall grassy vegetation arising in its place .
And instead of trees , which were unable to stand the grazing pressure of the cows , bushes grew .
This finding was linked with another : the redistribution of nutrients in the ground due to the high amount of livestock made the animals more susceptible to diseases .
In addition some invasive plant types took root , spreading quickly across the area which was rich in nutrients .
It is not fully clear whether biodiversity suffered over the 50 years of cattle grazing , says Edwards .
" We can say for sure that the quality of the biodiversity is worse and therefore that the ecosystem has been damaged .
It is , however , virtually impossible to measure whether the overall biodiversity has worsened . "
But the ecosystem itself has suffered severely .
" Due to the loss of natural hoofed animals , the area cannot even be called a real savannah anymore " says the biologist .
And the displaced wildlife is only slowly moving back to the area , as Edwards and his team were forced to recognise in a second research project .
The transition from an area used for cattle - grazing to a natural ecosystem will therefore take a while .

Edward 's latest research project , which he is carrying out together with the wildlife biologist Werner Suter from the Swiss Federal Research Institute for Forests , Snow and Agriculture ( WSL ) , should now show what effect the returning wildlife is having on the ecosystem .
It is still too early for specific results , says Edwards .
A few conclusions can , however , already be drawn : " We observed very diverse feeding behaviour amongst the different hoofed animals . "
For example some , such as the bushbuck , a small antelope , feed very selectively and on a small area .
" This produces a positive reaction , as on this area the vegetation is changing and the quality of nutrition for this species is therefore improving .
The animals thereby create conditions in which they are able to live . "
An ecosystem without animals
What findings can be deduced from this practical experiment in Tanzania for other ecosystems ?
According to Edwards ,
" We are getting a much better understanding of how the savannah system functions .
Here we can see quite clearly , what an important role hoofed animals play . "
We can also see from this example that recreating an ecosystem is not easy .
" The example of the Mkwaja Ranch also clearly shows that the ecosystem is completely different without animals , " continues Edwards .
Specific measures are probably going to be necessary to get the wildlife to return within a useful period .
The findings from Edward 's research are very helpful , particularly for Africa , as poaching has severely reduced wildlife stocks in many savannah areas , and the relocation of wild animals is problematic .
Edwards : " Bringing an ecosystem back to life without animals is a great challenge . "
” The evidence we have from these academic studies is that quite often [ viewers ] take away different attitudes toward things like how many children they want , what is acceptable behavior for a husband toward his wife , what is the breakdown in a household of responsibilities over things like finances , should we be sending girls to school , ” says Charles Kenny , an economist at the World Bank who has written about global television habits , and the author of a forthcoming book on development .
” All of these seem to be generated by watching some soap operas . ”
Soaps , it turns out , are shaping behavior in ways that are subtle , profound and , from the standpoint of global development experts , positive .
A team of economists credits Brazilian TV ” novelas ” for helping to dramatically lower a fertility rate that in 1960 was above six births per woman .
Others have found that in India — where soaps dominate the airwaves — villages where people watch more TV give more responsibilities and rights to women and girls .
Researchers in Rwanda have found that radio soap operas there can help defuse the country ’s dangerous ethnic tensions .
Turkish soap operas have set off a public debate about women ’s roles in the Middle East .
And research in the United States has found that health tips tucked into soaps have greater sticking power than with just about any other mode of transmission .
In a surprising number of ways , soap operas are improving lives around the world .
The possibility , therefore , that people might be modeling themselves after characters on soaps might seem both farfetched and frightening .
A spate of recent research , however , suggests that , all over the world , that ’s exactly what ’s happening .
What ’s more , we should be happy about it .
Thankfully , no one lives in Oakdale , no one real .
It is the fictional town where ” As the World Turns , ” America ’s longest - running current soap opera , has tumultuously unfolded for over half a century ( this season will be its last ) .
And while the Gomorrhic dysfunction of places like the fictionalized Oakdale , Ill. , or Port Charles , N.Y. ( ” General Hospital ” ) or Pine Valley , Pa. ( ” All My Children ” ) is what makes them so entertaining to their loyal fans , few would describe these as places where people live exemplary lives .
Soap operas , after all , are entertainment at its least believable and least nutritious .
On most measures of the strength of a community ’s social fabric , the town of Oakdale would score poorly .
There ’s the high divorce rate and appallingly low incidence of marital fidelity , the off - the - charts frequency of assault , murder , rape , and arson ; the overlapping epidemics of kidnapping , identity theft , fraud , and wedding - day bridal abandonment .
And there is a local justice system seemingly bent on imprisoning the innocent , leaving it up to intrepid family members and lovers to bring the truth to light .
What they found was that , in region after region , when Rede Globo and its novelas arrived , births went down .
And the researchers found another change , too : in those same regions , the children who were born were disproportionately named after characters on novelas .
Young potential parents were n’t just watching television , they were watching novelas , and identifying strongly with the characters .
For all of their contrivances , the novelas work as entertainment , La Ferrara points out , because their viewers see the characters as members of their own familiar , actual lives , and that makes behaviors from the shows contagious with their viewers .
La Ferrara , along with Alberto Chong and Suzanne Duryea of the Inter - American Development Bank , set out to see whether novelas did indeed help drive this large demographic change .
The researchers used historical data , tracing the entry of Rede Globo — the network that creates the majority of Brazilian novelas — into different regional markets and matching that up with census data on births .
If it seems unlikely that soap operas could have this much influence , consider that in Brazil , serial television dramas are a national obsession : the most popular have big budgets , far better writing and production values than American soaps , and can draw upwards of 80 million viewers in a nation of 190 million .
Marquee soccer matches are scheduled so that they do n’t overlap with the prime - time novelas .
A few years ago , reading anthropological research , Eliana La Ferrara , a developmental economist at Italy ’s Bocconi University , noticed accounts from poor Brazilian women about how they decided how many children to have .
One of the reasons caught her attention : they said they wanted their families to be more like the smaller ( and wealthier ) families they saw on Brazil ’s popular soap operas .
The question was why it had happened .
Whereas China , for example , had resorted to a strict one - child policy to accomplish a similar reduction , Brazil ’s government had been deeply resistant to measures to lower birth rates .
For years , experts on Brazil struggled with a riddle : throughout the second half of the 20th century , the number of babies being born to Brazilian mothers dropped far faster than traditional explanations suggest they should have , from 6.3 in 1960 to 2.3 in 2000 .
This was widely seen as a good thing — fewer children per family meant more resources per child , and it eased the entry of young women into the workforce and political life .
Intrigued and buoyed by findings like these , researchers and public health and international aid organizations are looking at how to design soaps that might more effectively spread information and change attitudes about everything from tribal tensions to HIV to petty corruption .
Lurid though they are , the denizens of the world ’s Oakdales may have something important to teach us .
And not everyone might see the changes the researchers recorded were as positive .
For example , in Brazil , exposure to Rede Globo and its novelas seemed to lead to an increase in the divorce rate among viewers .
For women who might previously have stayed in an abusive relationship , that can be a good thing .
But policymakers and scholars concerned about family stability are n’t likely to see higher divorce rates as an encouraging sign .
Oster and La Ferrara both readily concede that their work only measures a tiny sliver of the potential changes in attitudes and behavior that soap opera viewers might exhibit — and that not all of those other changes might be healthy ones .
Soap operas and novelas are full of all sorts of louche , antisocial behavior , even on the part of the heroes : a dangerous susceptibility to erotic impulses , a predilection for vigilante justice , an openness to being fooled , at least initially , by villainous suitors and step - parents .
There ’s no research to determine whether viewers are in some small way absorbing these tendencies , as well .
” There are differences between urban and rural areas in India in their attitudes toward women , ” Oster says , ” and our estimates suggest that giving people TV in rural areas moves them between 50 and 70 percent of the way from rural to urban attitudes . ”
And while the study did n’t look specifically at what viewers watched , Oster points out that soap operas are overwhelmingly the most popular programming on Indian television .
As in Brazil , they tend to portray lives that are urban and upper - middle class , in which the female characters often work outside the house and manage their own affairs — lives that , to many Indian women , are becoming something to aspire to .
Researchers have found a similar effect on the other side of the world , in rural India .
Two economists , Emily Oster at the University of Chicago and Robert Jensen at UCLA , looked at surveys on a range of social attitudes in five Indian states from 2001 to 2003 , a time of rapid expansion in access to cable TV .
As with Brazil ’s Rede Globo , Oster and Jensen found that the spread of cable brought down the fertility rate , but they found other changes as well : Women with cable access were less approving of the idea that a husband could justifiably beat his wife , and reported having more autonomy and more of a role in household financial matters .
Their daughters were more likely to be enrolled in school .
The effect was not overwhelming , La Ferrara emphasizes , but it was significant .
More educated women generally have fewer children than less educated women , and she calculates the novela effect as comparable to giving a woman two extra years of education .
” You put something in a show and it ’s as if people were talking to their friends , they tend to be a little more inclined to see these things as part of life as opposed to a message or teaching or whatever , ” La Ferrara says .
It ’s no surprise that the behavioral impact of soap operas can be ambiguous .
The shows are created to entertain , and to do so shamelessly .
But activists , sometimes with the aid of media scholars and psychologists , are beginning to look at ways to focus the power of soaps , using them to deliver more specific messages .
To mitigate ethnic tension and fight corruption in Africa , the conflict - resolution organization Search for Common Ground has created a soap opera franchise called ” The Team ” about the trials of an ethnically and religiously diverse professional soccer club .
Locally produced versions in Kenya , Cote d’Ivoire , and Morocco have proved popular — nearly a quarter of Moroccans watch it .
The BBC World Service has , since the mid-1990s , broadcast a radio soap opera in Afghanistan called ” New Home , New Life . ”
A huge hit , the serial narrative about village life introduced Afghan audiences to the concept of the cliffhanger ending —
Afghans were originally frustrated that the installments ended right when things were getting most interesting — and is used to deliver practical information about everything from animal husbandry and landmine safety to civics .
Here in the United States , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , working with an organization called Hollywood , Health & Society , helped ” The Bold and the Beautiful ” — a soap opera about a family and its fashion empire — craft a storyline about HIV .
The CDC wanted to reach minority women , who make up a disproportionately large segment of both soap opera viewers and new HIV infections .
In a study HH&S commissioned afterward , those episodes , which included a public service announcement near the end listing the number of the national AIDS hotline , were found to have triggered more hotline calls than any other television public information campaign that year .
Still , hard data on the efficacy of such so - called ” edutainment ” is thin .
One of the exceptions is work that Elizabeth Levy Paluck , a psychologist at Princeton University , has done on the Rwandan radio soap opera ” New Dawn . ”
Created and broadcast by a Rwandan nongovernmental organization , it ’s a story of star - crossed lovers from feuding tribes .
The particulars — a land shortage , government favoritism of one tribe over the other , building resentment among the less favored — work as a parable of the nation ’s historic Hutu - Tutsi fissures without explicitly mentioning them .
The Romeo - and - Juliet tale ends not with soliloquies and double suicide , though , but with the young lovers starting a youth peace movement to agitate against the authorities .
Paluck found that the show did change listeners ’ beliefs , but not in all the ways it hoped to .
Listeners did n’t change their views on the roots of mass violence , for example , nor did they come around to the idea , emphasized in the show , that bystanders were complicit in violent acts if they did nothing .
But the show did seem to change people ’s understanding of social norms .
In particular , it seemed to get them to see political dissent and intergroup marriage as more acceptable .
Essentially , Paluck suggests , because characters on the show defended an idea , listeners were more likely to think members of their own community did , too .
To Paluck , this finding is heartening .
It ’s social norms more than personal beliefs that drive group behavior , she points out , and in Rwanda in particular changing those — rather than trying to change individual minds — may be the key to preventing tensions from breaking out into violence .
” You ’re going to do what ’s acceptable in a certain situation , even if it ’s not what you think , ” she says .
It remains to be seen , though , how healthy soap operas can be made before they lose their hold on viewers .
Different audiences have different demands , of course , but the reason soaps ” work ” — the reason they become so entwined in people ’s lives — is n’t because they promise self - improvement , but something like its opposite .
They promise indulgence : the taste of vicarious debasement , the mindless escape from real - world concerns and responsibilities .
The world ’s edutainers should probably keep that in mind .
Even when soaps are doing good , they need to feel a little bad .

ELLEN DEGENERES
leaves no opportunity untapped , not even a few seconds of chat on “ American Idol . ”
Casey James , this season ’s golden - haired heartthrob , was waiting for Ms. DeGeneres , the newest judge on “ American Idol , ” to assess his performance of the Rolling Stones hit “ It ’s All Over Now . ” Ms. DeGeneres began with his good looks  and her own public persona .
“ Casey , for most women , their hearts are going to start racing just looking at you , right , but then , for people like me ... ”
She paused , holding the beat while judges and audience members tittered over the implied allusion to her being a lesbian .
As the laughter swelled , Ms. DeGeneres held up a finger , prolonging the joke .
Then , with a knowing grin , she delivered the punch line : “ ... blondes ... ”
Ms. DeGeneres , one of America ’s most popular female comedians and talk - show hosts , is also one of its most beloved gay entertainers  and one of the few who markets herself as such .
And she finds a way to remind audiences of her sexual status on almost every episode of “ American Idol . ”
More than in any other of her ventures , Ms. DeGeneres ’s performance on America ’s favorite television show suggests how hard she works to seem effortlessly funny and how determined she is to be openly but unthreateningly gay .
She does n’t need the work , but she appears to want the demographic  “ Idol ” is her chance to expand her reach to a younger , more pop-obsessed audience , the Hulu Generation of viewers , who prefer to download their entertainment rather than press the remote .
And Ms. DeGeneres , funny , irreverent and also quite cautious onstage , is setting herself up as the Jon Stewart figure on “ Idol ” that people under 30 can trust .
She already has their parents .
Her syndicated talk show , “ The Ellen DeGeneres Show , ” was an instant hit when it went on the air in 2003 , reviving a career that had faltered after she came out as a lesbian in 1997 .
She is now a leading candidate for Oprah Winfrey ’s throne when “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” closes down next year .
And that ’s just her daytime realm .
She has punched every ticket to mainstream success : she was a fish in the Disney - Pixar animated film “ Finding Nemo , ” she has hosted the Emmys and the Oscars , and currently she stars in ads for American Express , Vitaminwater Zero and Simply Ageless cosmetics for Olay and CoverGirl  a coup for a lesbian in her 50s best known for a tomboyish , no - makeup look .
UC Davis physics student Austin Sendek has proposed that the prefix “ hella - ” be used as a standard prefix for 10 ^ 27th power .
If that sentence does n’t make much sense to you , you ’re in luck – there ’s an explanation in Part 1 below .
If you could parse the sentence but think it ’s a rather lame joke , do n’t make up your mind quite yet – I ’ll lay out the surprising history of some units that might make you reconsider in Part 2 .
Part 1 : Giga - what , giga - who ?
Most of the time you and I can get by with some pretty small numbers .
I might buy a 5 - pound bag of flour or ask you to lend me 20 dollars , and there ’s nothing wrong with that .
But if you work in science , engineering , economics , or other similar fields you inevitably need to count or measure things that are really , really big , and you do n’t want your readers to spend all their time counting digits rather than appreciating your brilliant prose .
This is why we have the International System of Units ( SI ) and its prefixes .
When Doc Brown is pouring pilfered plutonium into a DeLorean to send it to the future , rather than wrapping Marty ’s head around 1,210,000,000 watts he can simply exclaim , “ 1.21 gigawatts ! ”
When Commander Data is downloading MP3s , he can say he ’s got 100 petabytes to fill , rather than boring Geordi with 100,000,000,000,000,000 .
But what happens when you get past peta- ( 10^15 ) , exa- ( 10^18 ) , zetta- ( 10^21 ) and yotta ( 10^24 ) ?
Right now you ’re stuck .
At this point we ’re in the range of some ridiculously big numbers , but the universe is ridiculously big .
The mass of the Earth is about 5,980,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 grams , or 5,980 yottagrams – but who ’s got time for thousands of yottagrams ?
Sendek has a solution – add a new prefix , hella - .
Now we can say that the Earth ’s mass is about 6 hellagrams .
Is n’t that better ?
If you like , you can join the petition at Facebook .
If you ’re not from California you might not recognize the term “ hella . ”
No worries , I ’m originally from Cleveland , where the only person who ever said “ hella ” was Mr. T in A - Team reruns , so it took me a while to catch on too .
“ Hella ” may have started as a contraction of “ a hell of a ” , as in “ we had a hell of a good time , ” but has evolved to serve as both an intensifier and a quantifier .
For example :
That particular flavor of ice cream is hella delicious .
Let ’s go to that other heladeria , they have hella flavors .
You can read more scholarly research by Bucholtz , Bermudez , Fung , Edwards , and Vargas in the Journal of English Linguistics .
Part 2 : Hella is n’t as crazy as you might think
“ Hella ” is regional slang , and Sendek ’s petition is a bit tongue - in - cheek , so why do n’t we just dismiss this as a stupid joke ?
Well , it turns out that not all current SI units – though very impressive and scientific - sounding – have very scientific origins .
Let ’s take giga- , for example .
From Wikipedia , we learn :
According to the American writer Kevin Self , a German committee member of the International Electrotechnical Commission proposed giga as a prefix for 10^9 in the 1920s , drawing on a verse by the humorous poet Christian Morgenstern that appeared in the third ( 1908 ) edition of Galgenlieder ( Gallows Songs ) .
This suggests that a hard German [ ? ] was originally intended as the pronunciation .
Self was unable to ascertain at what point the alternative pronunciation came into occasional use , but claimed that as of 1995 it had died out .
As a non-German I was completely ignorant of Galgenlieder , so I poked around a bit to learn more about the source of our very scientific prefix .
It turns out this is a book of literary nonsense poetry , and includes this verse ( translated to English ) :
The Winglewangle phlutters
through widowadowood ,
the crimson Fingoor splutters
and scary screaks the Scrood .
So yeah .
Given this precedent , it ’s safe to say we can pull SI prefixes from whatever source we want .
We can continue up the chain .
Tera- comes from the Greek for “ monster ” , meaning every time some programmer talks about terabytes they might as well be saying “ it ’s like monster - bytes big , yo ! ” Prefixes come from German , Greek , Italian , even Danish .
Given the many contributions to science and engineering by the United States , is n’t it time for a prefix of peculiarly American English origin ?
Bonus Part 3 : Get a load of this
I ’m not quite done yet .
Some of our least official - sounding vernacular units actually have extensive literary and historical backing .
I ’m talking , of course , about the assload .
How many times have you heard phrases like , “ I have an assload of homework , ” or “ I have to get this assload of parrots to the recycling center ? ”
Well it turns out that this unit of measure has a long , established history .
In fact , it ’s biblical .
From Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible ( 2000 ) , Page 1375 :
The homer serves as the standard expression of dry capacity in the OT [ Old Testament ] .
The word “ homer ” is cognate to “ ass ” and serves as an approximation to the normal load carried by this animal .
The reason you do n’t remember it from Sunday school is that it ’s usually imprecisely translated as “ measure ” in the King James Version .
It shows up in Exodus 16:35 and Ezekial 45:11 and probably other places , but those KJV guys took a lot of artistic license in translating units to “ a measure . ”
Sewing up the argument hella tight
In a sense , this all boils down to prescriptivism vs. descriptivism .
Measures used to all be descriptivist like the assload , but now we need prescriptive precision .
“ Hella ” is a prescriptivist ’s nightmare , but most modern linguists are descriptivists , so why not ?
And do n’t even get me started on the units that journalists tend to use on TV , where you ’re more likely to encounter “ football fields ” as a measure of area than square meters .
So we have historical precedent for the “ hella - ” prefix and we ’ve incidentally proven that “ assload ” deserves its spot in the lexicon of quantification .
So sign the petition , and if you happen to know any members of the SI committee , please pass this along so we can get this matter settled quickly .

Germany ' wants plan to slash deficits in euro nations '
( BERLIN ) - Germany plans to propose a deficit - reduction programme for countries using the euro , a magazine reported Saturday , with the currency weakening in the face of a spiralling debt crisis .
" The German government wants to soon present an initiative in favour of a common European deficit reduction plan in the eurozone , " German weekly Der Spiegel reported on its website .
Such a plan would be aimed at " repairing damaged confidence in the single currency , " it said .
The proposal would be advanced by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble at upcoming meetings of his counterparts from the eurozone , the magazine reported .
The next such meeting is Monday in Brussels .
Germany 's deficit - reduction plan follows a European Commission proposal on Wednesday to pre-vet member states ' budgets from next year .
The European Commission plan drew decidedly mixed reactions from Germany , Europe 's biggest economy , and France .
Battered by persistent concerns about the eurozone 's spiralling debt crisis , the euro fell on Friday to an 18 - month low against the dollar .
The euro 's decline has come despite a massive rescue package unveiled Monday amid fears that the perilous debt crisis in European Union member Greece could spread to other countries in the 16 - nation eurozone .

Most Dangerous Sports & Human Nature
Humans have a unique trend which is built - in their nature .
Some opportunities exaggerate them adversely in extremes of good and bad just like most dangerous sports , and some refine their personality to differentiate between love and hate , selflessness and selfishness , it is noticed that the more developed societies are adopting extreme positions in their lifestyles .
The less fortunate societies generally prefer midway options or have no choice at all .
The Old and Modern Sports : People had less mechanization and communication facilities and therefore less leisure .
The sports encouraged fair play and had well - defined safety standards .
The basic idea behind was to promote physical fitness and a healthy body for all age groups .
Latter more competitions induced professional players .
The games then lost their calm atmosphere .
Today some most advanced societies are encouraging very rough , most dangerous sports and pain inflicting trends in their most popular sports and games that kill hundreds of participants every year .
We must THINK to find the causes and again THINK how to reduce these damaging trends .
The modern space and computer age have increased the development pace faster than the societies , as a whole , can really adjust to or fully understand its utilization , accept a few .
The new technologies are promoting tremendous convenience in our lifestyles .
The priority goals are being achieved much quicker , than a century earlier such as a house , stable handsome income , distant traveling in no time , ample leisure time and all worldly enjoyments that are accessible to all including wealth , women and wine .
Fulfillment of basic needs leaves nothing more to be desired in the developed world .
The human nature is also designed to promote self - prominence , self - respect , to be ranked top class , to lead others , to race ahead of others and to achieve the ultimate feats that stay recorded unbeaten for long .
More recently devilish selfish trends have propped up To DICTATE and ACQUIRE , what is desired by ‘ Hook or by Crook ’ .
This attains personal satisfaction and is the result of the increasing leisure time that keeps the mind VACANT for long and renders it devils ’ playground .
The devil knows all intricate tricks to fool us and leads us to our self - destruction .
The Japanese have an increasing trend of committing suicides .
Having satisfied all the worldly desires and nothing more to achieve , they consider it the bravest act .
Most dangerous sports and life - risking exposures of ourselves to the extremes for the sake of momentary pleasures and “ CHANGE ” , means the same .
We have nothing more to achieve , so who cares what happens .
Nothing else but most dangerous sports can bring this zeal and zest to our lives and make us daring and courageous to tackle the risky and puzzling situations in life .
Usually , all sports and athletic activities count a lot and produce a very healthy influence on both body and mind , but most dangerous sports are really very much thrilling and inspire the players and viewers with such vigor and fervor as to be required to meet the real dangers of life .
Again , sports are also of various categories demanding different levels of physical and mental involvement both on the part of the players and the viewers .
Some sports and games are regular and everyone can play them according to the defined rules and regulations rather than most dangerous sports .
Such sports and games are very popular all over the world and their players and good performers are recognized and awarded at all levels .
Besides , these sports carry equal weight in all the countries of the world .
Someone interested in most dangerous sports in the world should think very carefully before engaging in activities

What happens when a doctor 's conscience tells him the life of a non-viable fetus is more important than the life of the pregnant woman and what is the responsibility of the state ?
A woman died , because the doctors were afraid she could miscarry and refused to examine her .
Whether Poland violated a patient ’s right to life or freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment by making her suffer – these are the questions put forward by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
When a doctor refuses to carry out a medical service , invoking his or her objections on the ground of conscience , because he or she is afraid of endangering the life of the fetus – in such a case does Poland provide a woman with assistance of another doctor – the Court asks the Polish government .
A 25 - year - old pregnant woman from Piła died in 2004 of septic shock before being fully examined by a doctor .
Seeking justice in Polish courts proved to be ineffective , so her mother turned to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and is currently an applicant before the Court represented by two women lawyers , members of the Network of Lawyers of the Federation for Women and Family Planning in collaboration with the Center for Reproductive Rights .
In May 2004 , the woman was informed that she was between 4 and 5 weeks pregnant .
Prior to or early during her pregnancy she developed ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .
She was admitted repeatedly – 11 times –to a number of different hospitals ( in Piła , Poznań and Łódź ) .
Certain examinations such as a colonoscopy and full endoscopy , which would have made it possible to gather more information on the location and extent of the problem , were not performed because the doctors were afraid of endangering the life of the fetus .
She was given pharmacological treatment ( for example , intravenous and oral administration of steroids and antibiotics ) .
In July she was diagnosed with an abscess .
Three operations to remove it were performed .

Abortion .
Parenthood .

During her stay at the M. Pierogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Łódź in August 2004 , the doctor refused to perform a full endoscopy .
He stated that “ my conscience does not allow me to do this , ” but did not formalize his objection or direct the patient to another doctor .
The doctor justified not performing a full endoscopy by referring to his fear of endangering the life of the fetus .
At the end of August 2004 mother of the woman and the woman ’s fiancée urged the doctor at the clinic in Łódź to commence any necessary treatment , irrespective of the consequences for the life of the fetus , to save the woman ’s life .
This was in vain .
Why ?
Because the doctors were more concerned about the fetus .
The woman lost the fetus on 5 September 2004 .
It was removed and the doctors removed an abscess .
But then it was too late for intervention to help her .
On 29 September 2004 she died of septic shock caused by sepsis .
The woman ’s mother asked the Łódź District Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings into the circumstances of the applicant ’s daughter ’s death , in September 2008 the District Court discontinued the proceedings .
In June 2005 the Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters instituted disciplinary proceedings against the doctors who had treated the woman .
After consulting several experts and hearing witnesses , it concluded that there was no evidence of medical malpractice .
In September 2007 the woman ’s mother brought a compensation claim in the Łódź District Court against the M. Pierogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Łódź .
The civil proceedings are still pending .
In September 2008 , with the assistance of the Center for Reproductive Rights , Polish Federation for Women and Family Planning and the Warsaw University Law Clinic a lawsuit against Poland on behalf of the deceased woman ’s mother was filed to the European Court of Human Rights .
The case asserts that medical care that disregards the health of the pregnant woman in favor of that of her fetus violates the woman ’s rights to life ( Article 2 of ECHR ) , to freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment ( Article 3 ) , right to private and family life ( Article 8 ) and to non-discrimination ( Article 14 ) .
The case also seeks to clarify international guidelines for conscientious objection .
The Polish woman was denied timely and proper care that could have saved her life and allowed her to have a safe pregnancy because Poland failed to regulate doctors ’ right to refuse care on moral or religious grounds .
Under section 39 of the Polish Medical Profession Act , a doctor may refuse to carry out a medical service , invoking his or her objections on the ground of conscience .
He or she is obliged to inform the patient where the medical service in question can be obtained and to enter a note concerning the refusal in the patient ’s medical records .
Doctors employed in health - care institutions are also obliged to inform their supervisors in writing about the refusal .
The case aims to ensure that the Polish government guarantees an adequate number of healthcare workers who are willing to provide all legal services and that patients receive timely referrals to these workers .
It also asks the court to affirm that conscientious objection may not be invoked by institutions such as hospitals , nor be used to deny patients information or emergency care .
The tragedy of that young woman moved public opinion in Poland .
Letters were sent to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Justice .
They were signed within a period of three days by more than 400 people and 30 non-governmental organizations .
A special commission was established by the Minister of Health , but regrettably it did not complete its work before the new elections were held and a new government was appointed .
Justice remains unserved .
These are the facts , as they were agreed to by the perpetrators .
After a long night of drinking , Scott Doody , Timothy Hird , Joshua Spears , Anton Kloeden , and Glen Swain left a casino at 6 am in the morning of 25 July 2009 .
They ranged in age from 18 – 23 .
Most of them were drunk , but Kloeden , the driver , was not .
Kloeden , in the words of Chief Justice Martin , then thought it would be fun to ‘ take on the challenge of driving along the Todd River bed to the Telegraph Station ’ .
Even more fun , Kloeden then ‘ made the offensive and stupid decision to harass the Aboriginal people camped in the riverbed ’ , nearby Schwarz Crescent causeway .
They drove towards a group of at least six campers .
The campers fled to trees for safety , except for an elderly Aboriginal person , who was too elderly to respond with adequate speed .
Kloeden drove within a metre of him , with the intention of terrifying him by narrowly missing him .
Having driven away Kloeden turned the car back to the camp due to a fenced off exit .
Kloeden had not yet had enough fun for the night : he drove over the elderly man ’s swag as they passed the camp again .
One female camper , who saw the young men coming , threw a small log at their car .
Some of the men got out of the car and ‘ yelled abuse ’ at the Aboriginal campers .
The form of this abuse was not recorded .
The night , now morning , was not yet over .
Kloeden thought there was more fun to be had , so he drove at another Aboriginal camping group .
The three Aboriginal people were sleeping .
They were woken up by the car speeding towards them , and fled for their lives .
Kloeden parked near the campers , and again ‘ words were exchanged ’ .
The sort of words exchanged is not yet on the public record .
After this , the group decided to return to the home of Hird and Swain .
Fun was still to be had .
Once there , the group picked up more alcohol , Hird ’s gun and blank ammunition .
They drove along and Hird shot his gun , though at one point it jammed .
As they approached Schwarz Crescent causeway , they stopped the car so that Hird could fix his gun .
Having fixed it , he shot it again .
Justice Martin noted that the car was intentionally stopped so that Hird would be able to ‘ scare the Aboriginal occupants ’ of the first camp they had terrorised previously .
This goal was achieved .
As Swain testified to the police , the campers began running , and obviously ‘ feared for their lives ’ , according to the judge ’s rendition of Swain .
Hird plainly contributed to this by holding the pistol outside the car in the direction of the camp .
An Aboriginal man , Kwementyaye Ryder , was one of the campers who had been terrorised by Kloeden ’s driving in the first instance .
He responded this time by throwing a bottle , which hit the side of the car .
Kloeden immediately executed a sudden u-turn .
He stopped so close to Ryder that Ryder could grab the bullbar .
All four passengers raced out of the car , with Hird the first one out .
Without checking the damage to the car , they chased Ryder , who tripped and fell .
Confronted with a man ‘ lying defenceless and incapable of posing any threat to any of the offenders ’ , they repeatedly kicked him in the head , and Spears struck his head with a bottle .
They told him ‘ Do n’t fuck with us ’ .
Swain , who had kicked Ryder in the head twice , noticed he was lying motionless , and that something was plainly wrong .
He called out ‘ Let ’s go ’ , considering that the most appropriate reaction .
They got into the car .
Kloeden had n’t gotten out of the car because he was executing a three - point - turn .
Apparently untroubled by what he saw , Kloeden was ‘ seen to drive away at a leisurely , normal pace ’ .
The men proceeded to lie to the police over the course of a week .
Swain and Kloeden lied to the police , saying they had gone by themselves to a racecourse and fallen asleep there .
Hird lied to the police , saying that he had gone to the casino with Doody and had n’t seen Swain or Kloeden .
Justice Martin did not comment on it , but the matching alibis point to some collusion among the defendants .
Justice Martin noted to the defendants that it was apparent they ‘ would inevitably be caught ’ , which may help explain why Swain offered a full confession within a week .
Out of the group of five , Swain was the ‘ only person who made a full and frank confession to the police and who gave them every assistance possible ’ .
Those are the facts .
Justice Martin then had the task of interpreting them .
He concluded that this ‘ crime is toward the lower end of the scale of seriousness for crimes of manslaughter ’ .
Not enough violence was inflicted , and the defendants supposedly could not have foreseen a serious risk of death from their violent attack .
Repeatedly kicking someone in the head and hitting him with a bottle and then fleeing when the victim was motionless is apparently not recklessness , but negligence to Justice Martin .
Justice Martin then considered the possible value of inflicting a heavier sentence for deterrence value .
He dismissed this too .
His grounds for this are particularly striking : the violence ‘ arose out of an angry and aggressive reaction to a perceived insult ’ .
Plainly , there could be no value in deterrence with a mere crime of violence perpetrated by intoxicated youths responding to a perceived insult .
What did n’t feature in his discussion of deterrence was what he acknowledged repeatedly was the ‘ atmosphere of antagonism towards Aboriginal persons ’ manifested by the defendants .
Nor was this mentioned as an aggravating feature .
Which goes much of the way towards explaining his lenient sentencing : Doody , who did not physically strike Ryder , was sentenced to four years imprisonment to be suspended after 12 months .
Hird , Kloeden and Spears were sentenced to six years imprisonment , with a non-parole period of 4 years .
Swain had half a year taken off both measures , on account of his confession .
Yet there is one other factor which played a crucial role in Justice Martin ’s sentencing , and is arguably the most appalling part of his decision .
Justice Martin went out of his way to provide character references for every single defendant .
Doody is ‘ a person of positive good character ’ .
Hird is a ‘ solid , hard - working young man of good character ’ .
Kloeden has an ‘ underlying good character ’.
Spears is a ‘ person of very good character ’ .
Swain , like Kloeden , was a ‘ person of underlying good character ’ .
These men of good character repeatedly terrorised Aboriginal people for being Aboriginal , before getting a gun to terrorise them further , ending the night by beating a man to death , and then casually driving away without checking if their victim was okay .
Justice Martin ’s grounds for these conclusions are astonishing .
He notes character references in their favour , proving that many of them have friends and employers who think nice things about them .
This hardly balances out what they did .
He then scrapes the barrel in special pleading on their behalf , holding , for example , that Spears had never previously ‘ come into contact with the criminal law ’ .
Considering he was 18 at the time , this is hardly such an achievement .
Hird , Kloeden , and Swain , on the other hand , despite their youth had previously had difficulties with the law .
Yet Justice Martin was able to claim that this was ‘ totally out of character ’ for all of them , and also that they were ‘ genuinely sorry ’ .
Presumably he was able to judge their tremendous remorse from how they casually left the scene of the motionless man who soon died from their beating .
This too was in their character .
Or perhaps their remorse was manifested in the lies they worked on together to tell the cops .
Or perhaps he judged their remorse in the fact that four out of five of them did n’t cooperate with the police at all , and the only one did when it was already apparent that they would be caught .
What was missing from Justice Martin ’s sentencing remarks , and sentence , was a sense of revulsion at what happened .
The five young men engaged in recreational activities that would n’t be out of place in a gathering of Klansmen .
This disgusting crime was not just an attack on Ryder .
It was an attack on Aboriginal people in Australia .
It – and Martin ’s judgement – was an attack on our decency as a people .
I am appalled as a human being to live in a country where such a terrible crime can take place , where the media and public intellectuals – with the honourable exception of National Indigenous Times Chris Graham , who gave me the judgement on Friday – have reacted with complete indifference .
I am horrified as a Jewish person to live in a country where a member of a small , vulnerable minority can be victimised in such a shocking manner , and the perpetrators can still be described as basically good people .
And I am ashamed as an Australian that this is the country I live in .

Update :
And a week later ( Thursday night , the decision was Friday last week ) , there have been no op - eds run in any paper .
NIT , I ’ve been told , will cover it .
No one has seen anything significant in the decision .
There were a few news stories – none of them describing the facts at the length given here – and I found one blog which discussed it ( it ’s a blog devoted to casinos ) .
No one has seen fit to analyse the decision , and the media does n’t care .
Update 2 : The first op - ed I ’ve found in several weeks to even mention the issue .
It says an Aboriginal man ‘ was killed ’ after five young white men went ‘ hooning ’ .
It mentions the white guys kicked and struck the victim whilst he was on the ground .
This paragraph is the most that has yet been written by any commentator : no one , as yet , has deplored the judgement .
Ms Hudson describes this case as ‘ tragic ’ , not outrageous .
Update 3 : Chris Graham writes about the case in the latest NIT ( ‘ Deep South justice in the Red Centre ’ May 13 2010 ) .
Graham is also very critical of Chief Justice Martin ’s comments , but largely takes up different points .
Also , I noted in what I wrote that the words ‘ exchanged ’ between the campers and the five white men were not recorded in the judgement .
Graham writes :
‘ The words that were “ exchanged ” are not mentioned in the summation .
For the record , it was racial abuse .
And for the record , it was n’t just by Kloeden . ’
I urge everyone to read the article ( and I also recommend subscribing to NIT , which in my view is just about Australia ’s only paper worth reading ) .
This may be the end of the issue , unless we take it up .
So , dear reader , now that you know the facts , what are you going to do about it ?
Yesterday , Electronic
Arts reported its annual results , posting a net loss of $ 677 million for the year ended March 31 , 2010 .
While that was a substantial improvement over the $ 1.09 billion loss it posted for the previous year , it was n't enough to please investors .
Electronic
Arts has a lot going for it , but analysts are starting to tire of its inability to capitalize .
EA shares exchanged hands at more than three times the daily average today , with the sell - off driving the price of the publisher 's stocks down nearly 6 percent , shedding $ 1.09 to close Tuesday 's trading at $ 17.71 .
Some analysts were similarly unsatisfied with the publisher 's report , but more for its forecast for the coming year ( between $ 0.85 and $ 1.15 per share ) than its latest losses .
FBR Capital Markets released a note to investors today , noting that EA " continues to struggle to build the kind of margin expanding franchises necessary to really build the bottom line …
In order to meet its targets for the year , the company is going to have to see stronger results in efforts to launch / relaunch franchises like Medal of Honor , Dragon Age , and Dead Space against an extremely competitive environment . "
Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter was more upbeat on Electronic Arts , maintaining his " Outperform " rating on the stock and suggesting its forecast for the coming year was " realistically conservative . "
However , he stated in no uncertain terms that he has misjudged EA 's prospects before .
" We have been wrong about this stock for almost five years , " Pachter wrote .
" Either we 're stupid , stubborn , or unlucky , but we 've been wrong .
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again , each time hoping for a different result .
This time , while we are again hoping for a different result , EA 's Q4 report provided some evidence that the company is not doing the same things over and over again : lower headcount in cheaper locations , fewer facilities , fewer games , and a growing digital business .
This time , we think that EA is on the right path . "
On May 18 , the FCC denied a Petition for Reconsideration filed by Glen Zook , K9STH , that asked for changes in Part 97 regarding how often amateurs must identify themselves on the air .
This action follows the Commission ’s denial of Zook ’s April 2009 Petition for Rulemaking requesting that the Commission amend Section 97.119 ( a ) to change how often amateur stations must identify themselves , specifically “ to require that an amateur station transmit its call sign during the first transmission of any communication or series of transmissions , and to allow an amateur station to not transmit its call sign at the end of a communication when the communication or series of transmissions lasts less than three minutes . ”
In denying Zook ’s 2009 Petition , the FCC noted that in May 2006 , Zook had filed another Petition requesting that the Commission amend Section 97.119 ( a ) to require that call signs be transmitted at the beginning of each transmission or series of transmissions :
“ In response , the Commission received approximately one hundred comments , generally opposing the petition .
In 2007 , the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau 's Mobility Division dismissed this petition , concluding that the requested rule changes were not necessary and were not supported by the Amateur Radio community , and noting that the commenters believed that the current station identification rule properly balances the burden of requiring the station to transmit its call sign with the convenience of those receiving the transmissions to determine the identity of the station making the transmissions . ”
The FCC said that Zook ’s 2009 request “ does not assert or demonstrate that circumstances have changed since 2007 with respect to the adequacy of the current station identification rule , ” and the FCC concluded that it does not present grounds for the Commission to propose amending Section 97.119 ( a ) :
“ Your current proposal , like your previous petition , does not demonstrate that revising the station identification requirement as requested would address the concern that many Amateur Radio operators do not identify their station timely or at all , or that the problem of station operators not complying with the present rule cannot be addressed by enforcement of the present rule rather than a rule change . ”
After the FCC denied Zook ’s Petition , he filed a Petition for Reconsideration two days later .
The Commission noted in its May 2010 action that it had dismissed Zook ’s 2009 Petition “ on the grounds that it did not present evidence meriting a rule change , because it did not assert or demonstrate that circumstances had changed since the Division dismissed a previous petition that you filed proposing to amend Section 97.119 ( a ) to incorporate certain portions of the Commission ’s former station identification rule , ” but that in his Petition for Reconsideration , Zook “ disagree [d ] that circumstances have not changed since 2007 , arguing that your 2009 petition proposed narrower changes than your 2006 petition , and again expressing the concern that many amateur operators do not properly identify their communications . ”
The FCC Denied Zook ’s Petition for Reconsideration , concluding that it , “ like your previous petitions , does not demonstrate that the current station identification rule is inadequate or that revising the station identification requirement as requested would address the concern that many amateur radio operators do not identify their station timely or at all .
We also note that , in response to your 2006 petition , commenters believed that the current station identification rule properly balances the burden of requiring the station to transmit its call sign with the convenience of those receiving the transmissions to determine the identity of the station making the transmissions . ”

Advertisement A newborn baby has become the first in the world to receive xenon gas treatment , pioneered in Bristol in a bid to prevent brain injury .
Riley Joyce had no pulse and was not breathing when he was first delivered by emergency Caesarean section at the Royal United Hospital , Bath .
He had a 50:50 chance of permanent brain injury and was transferred to St Michael 's Hospital , Bristol .
His parents agreed to the experimental treatment and Riley is now doing well .
' Cooling babies '
Every year in the UK more than 1,000 otherwise healthy babies born at full term die or suffer brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen or blood supply at birth .
The xenon technique was developed by Marianne Thoreson , professor of neonatal neuroscience at the University of Bristol , and Dr John Dingley , consultant anaesthetist at Swansea University 's School of Medicine .
Professor Thoreson said : " After seven days , Riley was alert , able to look at his mother 's face , hold up his head and begin to take milk . "
We faced the challenge of how to safely and effectively deliver this rare and extremely expensive gas to newborn babies .
Professor Marianne Thoreson
The professor has pioneered new treatments at the hospital since 1998 when she began cooling babies to reduce damage in the newborn brain .
However , cooling only partly reduces disability and does not prevent it in all babies .
She said : " Over the past eight years , we have shown in the laboratory that xenon doubles the protective effect of cooling on the brain .
" However we faced the challenge of how to safely and effectively deliver this rare and extremely expensive gas to newborn babies . "
Dr Dingley , who invented a machine to deliver the gas , said : " A key design feature of this machine is that it is very efficient , using less than 200 ml of xenon per hour - less than the volume of a soft drinks can .
" Xenon is a precious and finite resource and difficult to extract so it can cost up to £ 30 a litre .
We are extremely grateful that we were given this opportunity
Dave and Sarah Joyce , Riley 's parents " As ventilated newborns breathe many litres of air per minute , any xenon - based treatment would be impossibly expensive without an economical delivery method . "
The device is now authorised for clinical trials and will be used on a minimum of 12 babies over the coming months in a feasibility trial before it can be used on a larger scale .
Twelve - day - old Riley 's parents , Dave and Sarah Joyce , said : " We are delighted that Riley is doing so well and we are extremely grateful that we were given this opportunity .
" Marianne was so passionate about the treatment and we truly believe that she had and still has the best interests of Riley in mind .
" It was traumatic to see our baby not breathing , but seeing the ambulance coming to collect Riley to take him to Bristol gave us hope that something could be done to help him . "
The study is being funded by Sparks , the children 's medical research charity , which has committed almost £ 800,000 to the team 's work .

Departing Discovery leaves station stocked with supplies
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : April 17 , 2010
The Discovery astronauts bid their station counterparts farewell early Saturday , sharing a final round of hugs and handshakes before moving back aboard the shuttle and undocking from the lab complex .
Separation occurred at 8:52 a.m. EDT as the two spacecraft sailed 220 miles above Papua , New Guinea .
Credit : NASA
" Houston and station , Discovery , physical separation , " shuttle commander Alan Poindexter radioed as the docking systems disengaged .
" Discovery , departing , " Expedition 23 flight engineer Soichi Noguchi called out , ringing the ship 's bell in the lab 's Harmony module .
" Dex you and your crew were excellent guests , we loved having you here , you helped us leave the station in a better place than when you got here , " flight engineer Timothy Creamer radioed a moment later .
" We 'll miss you .
Come back soon . "
" Thanks , T.J. , we enjoyed every minute of it , " Poindexter replied .
" Thanks for the great hospitality .
We 'll talk to you soon . "
With shuttle pilot James Dutton at the controls on Discovery 's aft flight deck , Discovery pulled straight away in front of the station before beginning a 360 - degree photo - documentation fly around .
Once back at the starting point in front of the outpost , Dutton will fire Discovery 's maneuvering rockets and depart the area .
" The pilot 's big moment of glory is getting to do the fly around of the space station , " Dutton said in a NASA interview .
" So we 'll undock , back away around 400 to 450 feet in front of the space station and then begin to fly a maneuver over the top in front of the space station , essentially complete a 360 - degree arc around the space station .
Then we 'll continue to maneuver to essentially break out of our orbit with the station , so we 'll get a real panoramic view .
As big as the station is now , I can't really imagine how breathtaking that will be , getting to see it from every perspective . "
But the public will have to wait until Discovery lands to fully share that perspective .
While occasional still photos from the shuttle are possible using the shuttle 's S - band communications system , the failure of the orbiter 's Ku-band antenna earlier in the mission will prevent routine live television from the shuttle for the remainder of its mission .
The combined 13 - member shuttle - station crew gathered in the forward Harmony module earlier Saturday for a brief farewell ceremony .
" This is time when we have to say goodbye to our friends and colleagues , " said Expedition 23 commander Oleg Kotov , one of three Russians on the station crew .
" It was an excellent crew , shuttle Discovery flight 19A did excellent job , we enjoyed working with them and it's really , really sad to let them go , but it 's time .
Let me say again , thank you very much , we 're really grateful for your help and your job you did for us .
Thanks a lot . "
Poindexter thanked the station crew for help with " a very successful docked mission and that is in large part due to the preparation that you did ahead of time . "
" You treated us with just the utmost hospitality and we felt welcome the whole time , " he said .
" We hope we did n't tear up your house too much .
We tried to do a good job of cleaning when we left .
It was a great docked mission , very successful , we had three just outstanding EVAs and a lot of great robotics .
The transfer team was just fantastic .
" Again , I want to thank you and your crew for all the help you gave us with transfer , " Poindexter said .
" It was just great .
We 're sorry to go .
I know we'd all like to stay much longer , but we have to let you guys get back to your normal routine and get ready for ( the next shuttle visit ) .
So with that , we want to say thanks again and we hope to see you soon back home .
Take care . "
The two crews then exchanged embraces and handshakes and the shuttle crew floated back aboard the orbiter for the last time .
Hatches were closed around 6:30 a.m. to set the stage for undocking .
Poindexter and his crewmates face a relatively light schedule for the rest of the day .
A final heat shield inspection , normally carried out just after undocking , was performed Friday so the crew could use the station 's Ku-band communications system to downlink the laser scans and video .
On Sunday , Poindexter , Dutton and flight engineer Dottie Metcalf - Lindenburger will test Discovery 's re-entry systems while their crewmates pack up and rig the ship for entry .
Landing back at the Kennedy Space Center is targeted for 8:51 a.m. Monday , but the weather could cause problems .
The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston is predicting showers within 30 miles of the Kennedy Space Center at landing time Monday with a slight chance of showers Tuesday .
The forecast for Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , calls for good weather Monday and Tuesday .
Weather permitting , Discovery 's re-entry trajectory will carry the orbiter above the heartland of America during its descent to the Kennedy Space Center , possibly the last time viewers in the continental United States will have a chance to witness the fiery streak of a shuttle entry .

In the minutes after a cascade of gas explosions crippled the Deepwater Horizon on April 20 , confusion reigned on the drilling platform .
Flames were spreading rapidly , power was out , and terrified workers were leaping into the dark , oil - coated sea .
Capt .
Curt Kuchta , the vessel 's commander , huddled on the bridge with about 10 other managers and crew members .
Andrea Fleytas , a 23 - year - old worker who helped operate the rig 's sophisticated navigation machinery , suddenly noticed a glaring oversight :
No one had issued a distress signal to the outside world , she recalls in an interview .
Ms. Fleytas grabbed the radio and began calling over a signal monitored by the Coast Guard and other vessels .
" Mayday , Mayday .
This is Deepwater Horizon .
We have an uncontrollable fire . "
When Capt . Kuchta realized what she had done , he reprimanded her , she says .
" I did n't give you authority to do that , " he said , according to Ms. Fleytas , who says she responded : " I 'm sorry . "
This is a thing that comes up periodically : what happens is , someone says , " Jesus fuck , could there be one comic in which all the women do n't have their tits sticking out all the fucking time ? "
Advertisement
Inevitably , at least one person responds to these criticisms with the following argument ( and occasionally a few supplemental ones ) :
" Comics have always been an exaggerated ideal , just like in movies and other forms of media , and besides , they exaggerate men and women equally , so it 's not sexist . "
Advertisement
Refuting this argument is a long and exhausting process , so , to save time , I 'm just going to do it here and leave it up so I can link to it when someone ( inevitably ) says it again .
Okay .
The problem with this argument is n't just that it 's wrong .
The problem is that it 's SO WRONG that it 's baffling to any but the most thorough refutation .
Peculiarly , these particular ideas are all brought together with the idea that they support each other , despite the fact that the argument would fall apart if even one of these things not true .
But !
NOT ONLY is there one part that is false , ALL OF THE PARTS are actually false .
And , not only that !
Even if all of the parts were TRUE , the argument would still be false .
You can see the problems I might have dealing with it .
So , let 's break it down .

Comics Have Always Been Like That
Is it True ?
No .
Here is a picture of Star Sapphire from 1962 .
Advertisement
Here is a picture of what Star Sapphire looks like now :
Advertisement
This one 's tame ; sometimes she has no pants .
Notice any differences ?
( Hint : her neckline goes down to her vagina . )
If you 'd like , we can get some more examples , but I think the point is clear .
Whether or not repressing women 's sexuality is good , the fact of the matter is that media , up until recently , often went out of its way to DE - sexualize both women and men .
Especially the comics , which , under the Comics Code , were probably prevented from showing nipples and labias everywhere .
The hyper - sexualization of women in comics is actually a relatively recent phenomenon ; it 's concomitant with , though probably not caused by , the rise in superhero comics .
More likely it 's a latent tendency which spandex and thongs permitted .
New advancements in colorization , new lapses in restrictions on content , new changes in social mores have all permitted female characters to have bigger boobs , bendier spines , improbably long legs , and constantly shiny skin .
Advertisement
Would It Matter If It Were True ?
Also no .
We did a lot of stupid things in the old days .
Even assuming that tits and ass were somehow some " traditional " part of the comic book style - like naked boobs everywhere were some kind of legacy handed down to us by our grandfathers that we were obligated to preserve - we would still not be obligated to preserve it .
Just because guys did it in Olde Timey days does n't mean we have to do it now ; I mean , have you seen the way our grandfathers portrayed black people in comics ?
Was that okay , just because they did it in the 50s ?
Advertisement
All Other Media Does It , Too
Is It True ?
Nope .
It turns out that women can have parts in television shows , for example , without being all tarted up like porn stars .
I think I 've mentioned my affection for actresses like :
Advertisement
Kathryn Erbe
Advertisement
Gina Torres
Advertisement
Mary McCormack
Are they attractive actresses ?
Yes , sure .
But the argument - that media always expresses " the ideal " , and therefore every woman that appears should be as supremely sexy as possible - is grossly flawed .
The media can , and does , present women in ways such that they matter for reasons besides their sexiness - that their physical attractiveness is substantially less important than the nature of their characters .
Which is why Mary McCormack 's character always puts her hair up before the goes on a raid in In Plain Sight - just because she 's a woman does n't mean she needs to have the sexiest possible hair at all times .
Advertisement
Would It Matter If It Were True ?
What , the " everyone else is doing it " argument ?
Well , here 's a serious question : if everyone else was jumping off a bridge , would you do it ?
I do n't know if you learned this in school or what , but just because everyone else is doing it DOES NOT MEAN IT'S OKAY .
All Women In Comics Are Like That
Advertisement
Is It True ?
Well , presumably this just means " All women in good comics " are like that .
And , even if we discount the fact that Frank Quitely 's women are invariably not sexy AT ALL , due to pervasive use of the fish lips technique , it 's STILL not true .

Look here :

Jenny Sparks is awesome EVEN WHEN DRESSED LIKE MURPHY BROWN
Advertisement
Boom - Boom was even SUPPOSED to be the hot one .
Advertisement
Can you like Crazy Jane if you can't see her tits ?
It turns out , a female character does n't need her ass cheeks sticking out around her thong , or her boobs spilling out of some improbable spandex , to be a compelling character .
Would It Matter If It Were True ?
Advertisement
Still no , largely for the reasons stated above .
Especially look : if the socially responsible thing is eventually going to happen , SOMEONE has to start doing it .
It might as well be you , right ?
Comics Do The Same Thing With Men
Is It True ?
At first glance , you could be forgiven for thinking so .
Generally in the comics all the men have broad shoulders and huge arms and square jaws and , yeah , they probably give young boys body dysmorphia , too .
But there are some subtle differences , if you keep your eyes open .
Look at my favorite character , Wolverine :
Advertisement
Notice how hairy and scruffy he is ?
He 's also usually short and kind of weird shaped .
Now , who would you say was the female equivalent ?
The one who , say , does n't shave her armpits ?
Yeah , I can't think of one , either .
Definitely no one on the X - Men team .
Hey , now that I think about it , is n't it weird how almost all of the standard X - Women are exactly the same height ?
Here 's another test : go through your favorite DC heroes .
Now , think of your favorite DC heroes that do n't wear pants .
How many of those pantsless heroes are women ?
Think about Superman for a second : what if he started going without pants ?
Would you think that was weird ?
Superman does n't need pants , after all , he 's invulnerable .
You would think it was weird , obviously , and why ?
Because it would seem a little gay to you to look at a guy 's naked legs while you 're reading your comics .
Because you sexualize naked legs .
Advertisement
Let 's take a look at one more picture :
Advertisement
Ew , gross !
But let 's notice some things , shall we ?
First of all , you 'll notice how , despite being cannibalized , the Wasp still manages to have her tits sticking directly out at the viewer .
That 's pretty impressive , and a hallmark of the " tits - out " way that women are drawn in comics - but I 'm sure you 've noticed the same is not necessarily true with men .
Every picture of Captain America does n't have his crotch thrust directly out to the viewer .
But notice something else : the Blob .
The Blob is hideous , and fat , and covered with warts !
And he's not the only hideous and ugly villain - or even the only hideous and ugly character in comics at all .
So , let 's do an imaginary tally : of all the ugly characters in Marvel comics ( and this includes characters that , like the Beast , just do n't happen to look like people ) how many are male ?
How many are female ?
They 're mostly male , are n't they .
Why do you suppose that is ?
Advertisement
It is because , far from being a particular aesthetic imperative of comics that is devoid of relation to social norms , the style of comics reflects a social double standard - men , because they are relevant despite their physical attractiveness , can be ugly in media ; women are so intricately associated with how attractive they are that they can not be .
Would It Matter If It Were True ?
No , not really .
It 's only fair to treat things the same if they are actually the same .
If two things are different , it 's actually UNFAIR to treat them as though they are the same .
So , even if comics equally idealized and sexualized both men and women , the fact that women have a very different experience , and are subject to very different social norms , and are the recipients of very different historical expectations means it 's not necessarily appropriate .
Pretending centuries of misogyny and oppression did n't occur , and are n't still a pervasive problem in our society , is not the same thing as " equality . "
Advertisement
The problem is that , to make this defense , you have to treat any given comic book or piece of comic book art as an isolated incident - independent of history and context .
But there is , of course , no such thing as an isolated incident .
Everything is the product of history and context .
Some Supplemental Arugments :
Who Cares , They 're Just Comics ; Who Cares , People Like to See Tits ; Who Cares , They Are n't Supposed to Be Realistic ; Who Cares As Long As It 's Successful ?
Advertisement
These are all bullshit positions :
It Is n't Proust , I Just Wanted to See Some Tits , You 're Talking About Realism , and Everyone Shut Up and Let Buying Decide , respectively .
I have answered them already , and they can be discarded out of hand .
If You Want to Complain About THIS You Have to Complain about Decades Worth of Misogyny
Advertisement
Okay , I 'll just do that , then .
Consider that this current criticism also INCLUDES criticism of all previous instances of misogyny .
Contrary to popular belief , I am not omniscient , and can't immediately know when women are being misrepresented in any particular medium .
The fact that I did n't criticize Lady Death when the series ran SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO when I was TWELVE is not a tacit endorsement for Lady Death .
If It 's What People Are Buying , Marvel Has to Put Tits Everywhere
Shame on you for suggesting that the free market is a binary system ; what , everything that 's successful is 100 % precisely calibrated to the specific tastes of the maximum number of potential consumers ?
The free market is a complex and adaptive system , with flexibility and tolerances , capable of absorbing small and incremental changes , and permitting the recalibration of social norms through that .
For fuck 's sake , where the hell did you study economics ?
Advertisement
If There Are All These Examples of Good Portrayals of Women , Then There Must Not Really Be A Problem
Hahah , you almost had me there with your pedantic sophistry .
But no , again we 're not talking about a binary situation : EITHER women are misrepresented in comics OR women are n't .
I 'm talking about a general trend , and using specific examples from a small subset to show that the trend is n't inevitable , and thus that we do n't need the fatalistic position of " Well , if they want tits , we 've got to give them tits . "
People Know That Comics Are n't Real / Girls Don't Look to Comics for Body Image Perspectives
Advertisement
No ( and that 's a problem that the major comic companies are struggling with , is n't it ? ) , but boys do .
And boys grow up to be men ( well , to be older boys , at least ) who are then responsible for making decisions about comic books , television shows , movies .
They have daughters .
Their expectations about what is normal , what is acceptable , what is sexy , are absorbed into the aggregate collective of societal norms .
Women being insecure about their breasts is a product of men wanting women with big boobs , and men wanting big boobs is a product of …what , precisely ?
Are you going to say their parents ?
You were n't going to say that , were you , that PARENTS should be responsible for raising kids to think this is unacceptable ?
Let me offer up a little thought experiment , for you : when YOU decided that you were going to be attracted to big boobs , was it because of a conversation that you had with your dad ?
Or was it …wait , whoah , did you learn to behave in society by absorbing images , ideas , and information from that society ?
Through the many MEDIA that society uses to convey that information ?
Did you pick up ideas from your peers , who ALSO picked up images from those same MEDIA ?
Advertisement
I know , weird , right ?
If we could n't convey anything through art - and if we could n't affect people with it - why would we have it in the first place ?
Finally : Credit Where It Is Due :
It 's probably an accident of self - interest and the need for young women readers , but whatever - good things , even if they come from selfish reasons , are still good .
So , good job on DC for bringing Gail Simone back for Birds of Prey .
Good job on Marvel for Girl Comics and Her-oes ( despite their terrible names ) .
Good job on Avatar Press for consistently publishing titles with strong female leads .
Great work Faith Erin Hicks , and all of the other women who are struggling to work in an industry that has the deck stacked against them a bit , and to the women creators working outside the industry ( Molly Crabapple , Carla Speed McNeil ) .
Advertisement
I will admit that I like to look at pictures of sexy women , I wo n't lie about that .
Hey , I do n't even dislike J. Scott Campbell ; I found Gen 13 to be extremely titillating , especially when I was fifteen .
But I recognize that the industry needs to change , that there are more important things in the world than my personal tastes , and that , perhaps most importantly , I 'm also fully capable of enjoying things that are n't just tits and ass sticking out all the time .

Allowing the Auditor General to oversee his parliamentary budgets makes Gilles Duceppe Parliamentarian of the Month , says Rex .
Read the transcript of this Rex Murphy episode
Rex Murphy
May 13 , 2010
Three Cheers for Gilles Duceppe .
It 's a strange time when the honour of the Canadian Parliament is defended solely by the one political leader who has no time for the Canadian Parliament .
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois has been the only party leader in the House of Commons who has both the sense and decency to give easy consent to Shelia Fraser 's request to oversee the parliamentary budgets of MPs and Senators .
The Auditor General can examine expenses in virtually every other domain of government .
She is Parliament 's very own officer for doing so .
But , the MPs who make up that Parliament , who give her that terrific power over everyone else ’s government spending --- do n't allow her to look into theirs .
In fact they ’ve confirmed , by press release , that they are off - limits to her , as of 5:00 today .
Who is advising them ?
Messing around with office and constituency expenses has a very powerful history recently .
In Britain a gigantic scandal emerged after it was revealed that legions of MPs in the Mother of Parliaments were claiming expenses for the most outré projects – the most famous being the cleaning of the private moat of one aristocrat , Vicount Hogg ( that ’s ‘ Hogg ’ with two ‘ g ’s ) a close runner - up was expensing a house for a family duck .
In Newfoundland the MHAs of all three provincial parties were entoiled in a horrendous saga of expenses abuse – with claims vastly exceeding what was legitimately allowed – accompanied by an hilarious scam of nearly 2.6 million dollars spent on " non-existent " key chains , lapel pins and fridge magnets .
Back home the traffic in fridge magnets is bigger than the seal hunt .
Nova Scotia has had its own slightly less inventive version of the same , with one MLA claiming , I found this one rather touching , Dance Dance Revolution for an X - Box 360 .
In each case the public response was outrage and an inevitable tsunami of the wildest cynicism towards politics and politicians .
One would think with all the barking about " transparency " and " accountability " in the Afghan detainee issue , not to mention the ferocious posturing about " influence peddling " and lobbying in the desperate melodrama of the Jaffer - Guergis story , that the crowd in Ottawa would be pleading with the Auditor General to come in to show how clean and rigorous about their own budgets they are .
But , of course not .
Our MPs are as the driven snow , and while it is under their authority that the Auditor General scrutinizes , reviews , investigates and challenges the spending of every other operation of government --- it is not be thought she should be let loose to monitor the spending of those who authorize the spending of everyone else .
Mr. Layton hems and haws , Mr. Ignatieff temporizes , and Mr. Harper maintains that charming silence which he applies to nearly every situation that threatens a 1 % shift in the polls .
Only Gilles Duceppe , separatist , has no problem with the Auditor General of Canada .
Gilles Duceppe : Parliamentarian of the Month .
For the National , I ’m Rex Murphy .

It was supposed to be a quick trip to relaunch the career of one of the most successful hip - hop bands in Africa .
Daara J , from Senegal , have headlined at Womad , won a BBC World Music award and performed alongside Wyclef Jean .
Now a duo , renamed Daara J Family , and with a new album to promote , they were scheduled to play at the Jazz Cafe in London on Tuesday night before appearing on Radio 4's Midweek the following morning .
Instead , N'Dongo D and Faada Freddy found themselves in Paris , unable to board the Eurostar to London , because they had been refused entry to the UK by the UK Border Agency .
They had visas to enter Europe , but not to cross the Channel .
It was n't through want of effort : their attempt to get to the UK had involved a trip from their home town of Dakar to Banjul in the Gambia , where they waited for three days at the British High Commission before being refused a visa .
Faada Freddy is confused and upset .
" In Senegal , we were told there was no one to see us , " he says , " so we had to travel to the Gambia to get our UK visas .
There we were told that the people who were organising our London concert were supposed to have £ 800 in their account for us .
So I asked them if they could ring the Jazz Cafe to check , but they refused .
It 's crazy . "
Back in the UK , their record company is furious .
" They are making it as hard as they can for black Africans , " complains Ian Ashbridge of Wrasse Records .
" And now Daara J's UK career is in tatters , and their album launch here is in the toilet . "
He 's not alone in complaining about the problems foreign musicians have in getting visas .
Jah Wobble says he has n't performed live for nearly two years because he is so furious at the treatment of the Chinese artists in his Chinese Dub project , one of the highlights of the 2008 Womad festival .
" I wanted to bring them back in for more shows , " he says , " but the British consulate in China turned them down .
They thought they were going to stay in the UK , even though some have careers in Chinese opera . "
Nick Page of the Ethiopian fusion band Dub Colossus warns that " the world music scene will soon consist entirely of EU passport - holding musicians . "
Over the past year , there has been a reform in the way that the Home Office issues visas to musicians .
Like other foreign workers , musicians now need a " sponsor " , often an agent or a concert promoter , who has been vetted by the Home Office and is charged £ 400 for a sponsor licence .
The sponsors check on musicians while they are here , pay their expenses in the UK if they encounter problems , and are given sponsorship certificates to pass on to the musicians they want to bring in .
According to one sponsor , David Flowers , an agent who looks after Tinariwen and the Buena Vista Social Club : " It 's an instant system , no questions are asked , and in effect it replaces work permits . "
The sponsorship certificate , though , is only the first step to getting a visa .
Under the new points - based system for issuing visas , musicians must get 40 points .
The sponsorship certificate wins them 30 points , and they get the final 10 if they can show that their sponsors will cover " maintenance requirements " in the UK .
That is where Daara J came unstuck .
Looking through their " refusal of entry " papers from Banjul , it 's clear that they were awarded 30 points for sponsorship , but nothing for maintenance ( hence that demand that £ 800 be available ) .
So had a box been left unticked on the form ?
For its part , the Home Office says : " Musicians ' applications often fail because they have n't supplied enough evidence with the application form , and often they leave it too late before applying . "
The system has its critics – not least because of its complexity .
Nevertheless , some of the main sponsors responsible for bringing artists into the UK say there are benefits to this points system .
David Jones , of the promotion and production group Serious , who is a member of the Home Office task force looking at visa problems , says : " It 's now easier 50 % of the time , though there are still problems . "
The biggest of those problems is the UK 's move to biometric passports .
Once , musicians could send their agents across borders to get visas , but now they have to apply in person , every time they ask for a visa , so they can be photographed and fingerprinted .
But in west Africa alone , there are no facilities to issue such visas in Mali , and the service in Senegal is slow , so applicants are advised to go to the Gambia , which is now the regional biometric processing centre ( that is why Daara J were sent there ) .
One popular alternative for those performing in Europe is to get a " Schengen " visa that covers the continent ( but not the UK ) , and then apply for a UK visa in Paris – but again that can be a time - consuming and costly process , and it means musicians have to book their UK gigs and then hope they can get a visa when they reach Europe .
But does all this really matter to British music fans ?
Yes .
The situation may have improved , but it 's clearly still not fully understood by many musicians or their sponsors – in the case of Daara J , someone seems not to have realised that by not ticking the maintenance box , they were wrecking the band 's chance of getting a visa .
And now many African musicians have to travel to other countries to get visas , and then spend money waiting around in foreign cities , there 's a danger that some will simply not bother to come here .
Why go through the hassle and expense of getting a UK visa when it 's easier to get a Schengen visa and play across mainland Europe ?
There are signs that is happening already .
David Flowers points out : " Malian stars like the Rail Band now refuse to play in the UK because it 's so complicated " .
And despite the enthusiasm of some sponsors , there are concerns that the expense and bureaucracy involved might deter others .
" Without maverick small operators , audiences will no longer get the chance to discover exciting unknown groups from the non-EU world , " argues Page .
Ashbridge agrees .
" Would major African stars be here now if this system existed in the past ? "
And as for Jah Wobble ?
" I had to do Chinese Dub myself , " he says , " because no one else would touch it with a bargepole .
This new system hits the small operator .
I did n't become a bass player to be an unpaid civil servant . "
SINCE 1949 , Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty has bound NATO members to a solemn vow : an armed attack on one of the alliance shall be treated as an attack against all .
With international markets closed to Greece , and contagion threatening Portugal and Spain , European Union leaders agreed to a similar pledge after a pair of gruelling , late - night meetings on May 7th and 9th .
From now on , they in effect declared , markets betting against one member of the euro zone would meet a swift response from all 16 .
Emergency finance would be channelled to vulnerable governments from an array of fighting funds of up to € 750 billion ( $ 950 billion ) variously loaned or guaranteed by EU countries , euro - zone members and the IMF ( see article ) .
Markets rallied , for a day or two at least .
There was shock in Germany , where critics in the press and parliament accused Chancellor Angela Merkel of allowing the EU to become a “ transfer union ” , in which countries that stuck to EU rules would find their cash siphoned to the profligate .
From France there was crowing .
President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed credit for a plan that he called “ 95 % ” French .
He hailed the emergence of a new decision - making body at the EU 's inner core , made up of leaders from the 16 euro - zone countries .
Such a “ council of the euro zone ” , as he called it , is not found in any EU treaty , but has been a French dream for years .
In Britain a scandalised press claimed the country could pay out anything between £ 10 billion ( $ 15 billion ) and £ 43 billion to prop up a single currency it did not even use .
( The outgoing chancellor , Alistair Darling , said the real sum was £ 8 billion at most . )
This much is clear : the €750 billion plan is only a temporary fix .
The scheme is designed to protect weak links in the euro zone for the next three years , buying them the breathing space to shore up public finances , clean up banks and retool uncompetitive economies so they can grow again and pay off their debts .
“ If we do n't succeed in restoring sound fundamentals in most of the euro zone , this crisis will come back , ” admits a senior European politician .
What the scheme is not is a giant leap towards a common economic government , with the power to siphon huge sums from rich to poor bits of the union .
It looks more like a mutual defence pact : an attack on one euro - zone member is now an attack on all .
Countries that sign up to NATO 's Article 5 make a serious commitment .
They are asked to send troops for joint training , spend a certain amount on defence and so on .
But their pact does not mean there is a single NATO army .
Nevertheless , the rules of the euro zone — supposedly based on a Germanic vision of budgetary discipline and an independent European Central Bank ( ECB ) — are clearly in flux .
The ECB started buying government bonds on the financial markets on May 10th : precisely the step urged on it by EU politicians and big banks .
Allies of the ECB 's boss , Jean - Claude Trichet , insist he was reacting to market pressures , not assaults on his independence .
But the episode caused angst in Germany , and beyond .
EU leaders agreed to a € 60 billion facility controlled by the European Commission , funded by borrowing against the EU 's central budget , and so ultimately guaranteed by all 27 members of the EU .
The legal basis was a bit of the Lisbon treaty that empowers the commission to send emergency money to countries hit by natural disasters or other “ exceptional ” crises .
But leaders resisted a second , much more ambitious move by the commission : to use the same treaty clause to create a stabilisation fund of unlimited size that it would also control , this time borrowing against loan guarantees from national governments .
Instead , at the insistence of Germany and allies like the Netherlands and Finland , the largest part of the euro - zone defence system , a war chest of up to €440 billion , will be run as a “ special purpose vehicle ” controlled by national governments .
It will not be controlled by the commission , and will issue money only under tough conditions set by the IMF .
Are you with us , Dave ?
Yet if the new euro - zone scheme has not centralised power , it is an open question whether power is flowing to the euro countries , creating an “ inner core ” of 16 at the expense of outliers like Britain .
On the one hand , Germany remains wary of a powerful euro zone , fearing that the French want to build up a political body with the clout to bully the ECB .
Basically , sighs a senior figure , the French still think of Mr Trichet as “ a civil servant , appointed by the French government ” .
Moreover , although Germany and France may both talk about enhanced economic governance , they mean very different things by it : for France , interventionism ; for Germany , the harmonisation of rigour .
On the other hand , there is much grumbling about Britain 's refusal to join the larger € 440 billion defence scheme , when British banks are heavily exposed in places like Spain and Ireland , through cross-ownership and debt holdings ( and when Poland and Sweden , which like Britain do not use the euro , will join in ) .
On May 9th a “ furious ” Christine Lagarde , the French finance minister , confronted Mr Darling , sources say .
Other finance ministers asked aloud whether Britain could expect EU solidarity if the pound came under attack .
If Gordon Brown had stayed on as prime minister , it is said , he might have joined the euro - zone defence scheme , though Britain 's Treasury was opposed .
To David Cameron 's new government , even with the pro-European Liberal Democrats on board , the very idea may sound fantastical .
But it is not : if contagion hits Spain , for instance , Britain will face calls for EU solidarity .
Mr Cameron says he wants to avoid distracting Euro - rows as he takes office .
He may not be able to avoid them .

When it comes to mastering our mindset , most of us harbor negative thoughts .
In fact , most of our approximately 60,000 - 70,000 thoughts each day may be negative and the same as the previous day .
It ’s not by chance that half of the 10 quotes I chose relate to mastering your mindset .
Your thoughts and your mindset determine your outward actions .

Take Action …
8 ) “ The real risk is doing NOTHING ”
- Denis Whitley
9 ) “ We must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it – but we must sail , and not drift , nor lie at anchor ”
- Oliver Wendell Holmes
It ’s so easy to flail in the wind , but you can take action right now to change how you look and feel .
Believe In Your Potential
10 ) “ In every block of marble I see a statue as plain as though it stood before me , shaped and perfect in attitude and action .
I have only to hew away the rough walls that imprison the lovely apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it . ”
- Michelangelo
I really love this last quote , because when I look at someone who has fallen off the proverbial wagon , I see a lean , confident , and energetic person just waiting to be revealed .
Wow , I LOVE these quotations !
Reading over these quotes frequently can be a life changer .
It ’s so hard for me to choose a favorite quote , but I would have to go with Michelangelo , because it encapsulates what I do for a living .
Do you have a favorite quote either from this list , or another that has helped keep you motivated ?
If so , leave a comment below !

Governor Schwarzenegger said he did not want to risk a California oil spill
California 's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has withdrawn his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off the state 's coast .
He said the spill in the Gulf of Mexico had changed his mind about the safety of oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean .
Last year he pushed for more oil drilling off California 's coastline .
But he said after seeing television pictures of the Gulf of Mexico spill he asked himself : " Why would we want to take that kind of risk ? "
The state already knows the dangers of offshore drilling .
In 1969 a leak from an undersea well just six miles ( 9.6 km ) off the coast of Santa Barbara coated pristine beaches with oil and killed thousands of animals .
It led to a ban on new offshore development and helped galvanise the state 's environmental lobby into the powerful voice it is today .
Governor Schwarzenegger - who has championed the green economy and environmental protection - angered many when he proposed new exploration as a way to raise $ 100 m ( £ 65.6 m ) towards the huge state budget deficit .
Now he says he would rather find another way to make up the money .
California was not part of President Barack Obama 's recent proposal to increase offshore exploration .
And Governor Schwarzenegger 's change of heart almost ensures no new drilling will be allowed in the state 's waters .

Stygichthys typhlops reemerges from the dark
An incredibly rare blind fish that lives underground in Brazil has been rediscovered by scientists .
A number of individual fish have been found almost 50 years after the only known specimen was collected and then described by American experts .
Biologists cannot be sure , but they suspect the fish may be a living relict that has survived deep under the ground while its relatives above went extinct .
Details of the discovery are published in the Journal of Fish Biology .
It could represent the last remaining fish of an extinct group
Dr Cristiano Moreira , University of Sao Paulo
A team of Brazil - based researchers led by ichthyologist Dr Cristiano Moreira of the Federal University of Sao Paulo undertook an expedition to rediscover the fish , named Stygichthys typhlops .
The first and only known specimen was caught in 1962 from a communal water well used by inhabitants of the city of Jaiba , in Minas Gerais , Brazil .
The fish was taken to American ecologist Dr Joseph Tosi Jr who was in the region at the time , and then described by specialists back in the US .
" This was the most enigmatic species of the order Characiformes , a group of freshwater fishes that includes piranhas and tetras , " says Dr Moreira .
Blind relative of the piranha
Not only did the fish come from underground , but it was blind , whereas most characiforms live above ground and have good eyesight .
" Because it was never collected since , it was assumed that is was an endangered species .
However , no one knew .
There was no information of its distribution , abundance , anything . "
To find the fish , the expedition team interviewed local people around Jaiba , who reported they had seen the fish swimming in open wells .
But because the region is so dry , the people there rely heavily on underground water .
That has caused water levels in most aquifiers to drop considerbly since the 1980s .
" This was one of the problems we encountered to find this fish , since most of the open wells we could access to collect or put traps were dry , " Dr Moreira told the BBC .
Eventually , the team found two wet wells .
In both , they could see fish swimming , which turned out to be the elusive S. typhlops .
Overall , the team collected 34 specimens , which have allowed them to find out more about this strange species .
As well as being blind , the fish lacks pigmentation , a common trait in organisms that live underground where there is little or no light .
However , " morphologically , Stygichthys is very different from any species in the group , so much so that we are still not able to say to which species it is more related , " says Dr Moreira .
Fishing for a lost species
One other characiform fish lives underground , a blind tetra called Astyanax fasciatus .
But only some of the species have reduced eyes and pigmentation and live underground in caves .
Other populations of the same species continue to live above ground , without these adaptations .
But that does not appear to be the case for S. typhlops .
" It could represent the last remaining fish of an extinct group in the Characiformes , what we would call a relict species , " says Dr Moreira .
" The surface species of this group could have gone through extinction , while Stygichthys because of its habitat was spared .
But this is only speculation . "
What is certain is that the fish 's survival is threatened .

" This species seems to be the most threatened underground fish species in Brazil , " says Dr Moreira .
It appears to be restricted to a specific 25 km - long aquifier that runs underground in the region .
" The fact that most of the wells in the region are drying is very worrying .
" The excess withdrawal of water from that aquifier will certainly lead to the extinction of the species . "
This week , I will be boarding one of several ships that are part of a flotilla sailing to Gaza .
The Israeli government ’s recent decision to deny internationally renowned scholar Noam Chomsky entrance into the occupied territories suggests we , too , might be refused entry .
Nevertheless , we will set sail with the intent of delivering food , water , medical supplies and reconstruction materials to communities in Gaza that are in need of humanitarian relief .
Normally , such a goodwill mission would seem entirely innocuous .
But in this case the crisis afflicting Palestinian civilians has been created by foreign policy :
It is a product of Israel ’s decision to besiege Gaza in defiance of international law and of United States support for this blockade .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Israeli government ’s siege of the Gaza Strip stretches back to 2005 , and it has been rigorously enforced since the Israeli military offensive of late 2008 and early 2009 , which left more than 1,400 people dead and 14,000 homes damaged or destroyed .
Israel argues its military offensive and tightening of the siege are a response to Palestinian rocket fire , ordered by a Hamas government whose legitimacy it does not recognize .
However , as leading watchdogs such as Human Rights Watch have repeatedly documented , the Israeli military response has been overwhelmingly disproportionate .
The ongoing siege does nothing to target Palestinian militants but instead violates international norms by holding all responsible for the actions of a few .
A report published by Amnesty International , Oxfam , Save the Children , and CARE stated that , “ The humanitarian crisis [ in Gaza ] is a direct result of ongoing collective punishment of ordinary men , women and children and is illegal under international law . ”
As a result of the siege , civilians in Gaza , including children and other innocent bystanders who are caught in the middle of this conflict , do not have clean water to drink because authorities cannot rebuild water treatment plants destroyed by the Israeli attacks .
Air strikes that damaged basic civilian infrastructure , coupled with curtailed imports , have left many in Gaza without the food and medicine needed to lead healthy lives .
Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) , who has visited Gaza on repeated occasions since the Israeli military offensive , has stated , “ The personal stories of children being killed in their homes or schools , entire families wiped out , and relief workers prevented from evacuating the wounded are heart wrenching — what went on here , and what is continuing to go on , is shocking and troubling beyond words . ”
Those of us taking this voyage are of course concerned for our safety .
In the past , some boats attempting to bring much needed supplies to Gazans have been violently harassed by Israeli forces .
On Dec. 30 , 2008 , the vessel Dignity was carrying volunteer surgeons and three tons of medical supplies when it was attacked without warning by an Israeli naval ship , which rammed the boat three times in international waters roughly 90 miles from Gaza ’s coast .
Passengers and crew feared for their lives as their boat quickly took on water and Israeli troops threatened to open fire .
I am joining the effort , nonetheless , because I believe resolutely non-violent actions that call attention to the blockade are vital in educating the public about what is taking place .
Simply put , there is no decent justification for preventing shipments of humanitarian aid from reaching a people in crisis .

Despite President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE ’s recent highly publicized disagreement with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the fact remains that the U.S. is still an active supporter of and the top military donor to the Israeli government .
Our lawmakers have tremendous sway in demanding that humanitarian channels to Gaza be opened , that people receive food and medical supplies and that Israel make a more concerted effort to protect innocent civilians .
While the Obama administration has at times pressured Israel ’s government to lift the blockade , as with a May 2009 diplomatic note objecting to the policy , it has not followed up on its politely worded statements with resolute attempts to force change .
While I have been moved to put aside my daily obligations in order to join the humanitarian voyage , I recognize that many people do not have the ability of doing this .
Fortunately , not everyone has to board a ship to make a meaningful contribution to addressing the crisis in Gaza .
We simply have to demand that our elected officials step forward to protest Israel ’s shameful violation of human rights .

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has gone public with his quest to acquire LeBron James .
In an interview this week posted on CNNMoney.com , Cuban expressed his interest in James as a free agent and said that the NBA star needs to play in a place where he trusts the organization .
If James does not reach an agreement with the Cavaliers by July 1 , he would become an unrestricted free agent .
" Come July 1st , yeah , of course , anybody would be interested in LeBron James , and if he leaves via free agency , then it 's going to be tough , " Cuban said .
" If he does like I 'm guessing , hoping he will , which is say , ' I 'm not going to leave the Cavs high and dry , ' if he decides to leave -- there 's still a better chance he stays -- then he 'll try to force a sign - and - trade , and that gives us a chance . "
Cuban 's comments could fall under the NBA 's tampering rules , although he dismissed that notion Thursday .
In 2008 , the league sent a memo to the 30 NBA teams detailing specific guidelines when discussing potential free agents with the media .
The memo read : " If a member of your organization is asked by the media about a potential free agent prior to the July 1 following the last season covered by the player 's contract , or about any other person under contract with another NBA team , the only proper response is to decline comment . "
Penalties outlined in the memo could include suspension , prohibition of the offending team from hiring the person being tampered with , forfeiture of draft picks and individual and / or team fines of up to $ 5 million .
Asked if he believes James will stay in Cleveland or sign with New York or elsewhere , Cuban said :
" I do n't know , do n't know .
What I do know about LeBron in the minimal time I 've spent talking to him is he just wants to win .
Money 's not his issue .
He needs to be some place where he trusts the organization .
And look , [ owner ]
Dan Gilbert in Cleveland did everything he possibly could , that 's just the way the game works .
If there was a template that we all could follow , we 'd all have championship rings . "
Cuban said Thursday that he is not concerned that his comments could be construed as tampering by the league .
" No .
It 's not tampering .
Not even close , " Cuban replied via e-mail .
NBA spokesperson Tim Frank said Thursday that the league is looking into Cuban 's comments .
Dallas ' interest in pursuing a sign - and - trade deal for James has been the subject of speculation for months , but Cuban 's comments are believed to be his first public acknowledgment of that plan .

If there is one thing guaranteed to vex Benoît Assou - Ekotto , it is hypocrisy .
The trouble is , as the Tottenham Hotspur defender acknowledges , his working environment , the parallel universe that is the Premier League , is bogged down in the stuff .
It is evident in so many areas but the one that he chooses to highlight involves the interviews that players give to television .
Assou - Ekotto has seen it time and time again .
Players that he knows to express one view in private , usually strident and expletive - laden , switch to bland when the camera rolls .
" I say : ' Come on , you have two personalities ? ' "
Assou - Ekotto says .
" I can't listen to people when they speak like that .
I know that they lie , and I hate lies .
Me , I am not like that .
I am honest all of the time , although the truth is not always good to say . "
Assou - Ekotto is the top - level footballer who cuts through the hypocrisy to break what his peers may consider as taboos .
The Premier League , he feels , is a shallow and bizarre world , in which friendships are transitory and the hangers - on , particularly the kiss - and - tell girls , are dangerous .
He says what plenty of people think .
But it is when he discusses his motivation for being a professional that his honesty hits home .
To him , football is little more than a job and the driving force has always been the money .
" If I play football with my friends back in France , I can love football , " he says .
" But if I come to England , where I knew nobody and I did n't speak English … why did I come here ?
For a job .
A career is only 10 , 15 years .
It 's only a job .
Yes , it 's a good , good job and I do n't say that I hate football but it 's not my passion .
" I arrive in the morning at the training ground at 10.30 and I start to be professional .
I finish at one o'clock and I do n't play football afterwards .
When I am at work , I do my job 100 % .
But after , I am like a tourist in London .
I have my Oyster card and I take the tube .
I eat .
" I do n't understand why everybody lies .
The president of my former club Lens , Gervais Martel , said I left because I got more money in England , that I did n't care about the shirt .
I said : ' Is there one player in the world who signs for a club and says , Oh , I love your shirt ? '
Your shirt is red .
I love it .
He does n't care .
The first thing that you speak about is the money .
" Martel said I go to England for the money but why do players come to his club ?
Because they look nice ?
All people , everyone , when they go to a job , it 's for the money .
So I do n't understand why , when I said I play for the money , people were shocked .
Oh , he 's a mercenary .
Every player is like that . "
Assou - Ekotto describes life in the Premier League as following the plot lines to a film .
" You read the paper , it 's like a movie , " he says .
The 26 - year - old is referring to the more scurrilous stories on the news pages .
" Very bizarre … only in England .
That 's why football is not my passion because when you are professional , the world of football is not good .
There are people around you only because you play football ; the girls , the same .
I have my girlfriend , who I met when I was 18 , 19 , and I do not want to lose her because when you are a footballer it 's not good to meet a new girl at 26 . "
What of his relationship with Tottenham team - mates ?
" I have a good feeling with [ Aaron ] Lennon and [ Jermain ]
Defoe , more these two players but I have a feeling with everybody .
I have a problem with nobody .
But I have nobody on the phone , except [ Adel ] Taarabt , who is on loan at QPR and I know from Lens .
I only call him .
I do n't call footballers in my team .
I do n't believe in friendships in football . "
Assou - Ekotto's father , David , introduced him to the game .
He had come from Cameroon to France as a 16 - year - old to play professionally for Nice and when later he became the coach of Roclincourt & Beaurin , an amateur team , Assou - Ekotto followed them every weekend .
It was as much the fear , however , of a modestly paid life within the four walls of an office that drove him to make the sacrifices to become a footballer .
" I knew for a fact that I did n't like school and I also knew that I did n't want to work in an office where I would be paid € 1,500 - a - month and , at the end of my career , be able to buy a little suburban apartment or something , " he says .
" Where it became definitive for me was at 16 , when I was expelled from school because I was no longer paying attention .
I had nothing to fall back on and this forms part of my attitude to football .
I give it my very best , being as efficient and professional as possible , because it 's all that I have . "
Assou - Ekotto argues that his attitude to the job ought not to concern Tottenham 's fans because he always switches on his total commitment in matches and training .
" Whatever attitude you bring to it , it does n't matter as long as you are 100 % professional , the coach can say : ' He is good enough , ' and you are prepared to lose a tooth or an eye for the club , which I am , " he says .
Assou - Ekotto has thrived under Harry Redknapp but things were more difficult under previous Tottenham managers Martin Jol and Juande Ramos , with whom he had problems .
He also lost any respect for Damien Comolli , the club 's ex-sporting director , who brought him from Lens in June 2006 .
" Comolli , oh la la , la la , " Assou - Ekotto says , having let out a long , low whistle .
" I have one simple rule ; try to be a man all your life .
I said to Comolli that I had a problem with Jol but he said it was all in my head .
But then , after Jol left , he said : ' Yes , there was a problem . '
Try to be a man !
" With Jol , he had a hierarchy within the team , everybody did n't have the same starting point .
He also said to me that I did n't smile a lot .
Ramos was always picking little fights .
He told me that I was too aggressive in training .
I said , ' We do n't do tennis , we play football .
You think that we are in Spain but we are in England , my friend ' .
" With Harry , it 's cool .
We do n't speak a lot and he does n't care if I smile or if I know who the next team we play is .
If I do my job well , it 's OK .
He is doing simple things that the previous two managers could n't even think of .
He is straightforward and he does n't play games . "
Assou - Ekotto is beginning to look ahead to the World Cup finals with Cameroon .
Although he was born in France and has a French mother , there has never been any issue over his allegiance .
Like many young people in France born to an immigrant parent or parents , he feels that " the country does not want us to be part of this new France .
So we identify ourselves more with our roots .
" Me playing for Cameroon was a natural and normal thing .
I have no feeling for the France national team ; it just does n't exist .
When people ask of my generation in France , ' Where are you from ? ' , they will reply Morocco , Algeria , Cameroon or wherever .
But what has amazed me in England is that when I ask the same question of people like Lennon and Defoe , they 'll say : ' I 'm English . '
That 's one of the things that I love about life here . "
Before South Africa Assou - Ekotto is on the brink of history with Tottenham .
They entertain Bolton Wanderers this afternoon , with a place in next season 's Champions League within their grasp .
" It would be good for the team , the club and the supporters … they 'd enjoy it , " he says .
" But for me , it would be just another set of games .
When we play Liverpool and Chelsea , it 's like the Champions League anyway so for me … "
Assou - Ekotto shrugs .
It is only a job .
Assou - Ekotto is among the African players to feature at the More Human exhibition at Ozwald Boateng , 30 Savile Row , W1 , which celebrates the impact of African players on the Premier League .
A rare exhibition of North Korean art is taking place in Vienna 's MAK Museum .
The museum says it is the first time major paintings from the Korean Art Gallery in Pyongyang have been shown abroad .
North Korea , in this exhibition , is a land of smiles .
More than 100 oils , water colours and traditional Korean ink paintings , dating from the 1960s to the present day , have been brought from Pyongyang to Vienna 's MAK Museum for Applied Arts and Contemporary Art for the show , called Flowers for Kim Il Sung ; Art and Architecture from the Democratic People 's Republic of North Korea .
The works show beaming farm women feeding geese and ducks , or plump , rosy - cheeked children wandering through fields of flowers .
There is also a soldier lying in the snow , grinning as he looks up from his gun , untroubled by cold or fear .
' Heroic daily life '
And then there are the benevolent smiles in the pictures which have a special status in North Korea : the portraits of the Great Leaders , Kim Il Sung and his successor Kim Jong
Il , shown hugging children , encouraging construction workers , and visiting peasants .
These portraits , which are cordoned off , have titles like " President Kim Il Sung is always with us " , and " We are the happiest children in the world " .
Of course the art is very clearly related to the ideology , but it is not true that it is more propaganda than art .
They are really very good works Bettina Busse , Exhibition curator , MAK Museum
Speaking at the opening of the exhibition , the director of the Korean Art Gallery in Pyongyang , Han Chang Gyu , says he hopes these artworks " with their depiction of the heroic daily life of our people " and their " lively reproductions of our beautiful scenery " , would lead to a " better understanding " of North Korea .
A few of the pictures on display seem to escape overt politics - some landscapes , and a still life of the ingredients for kimchi - Korean pickled cabbage - done in the traditional Chonsonhwa brush and ink technique .
But most of the works , with their brilliant , almost fluorescent colours , are a reminder that in North Korea , art has a social function , one that is subordinate to the revolutionary process - what many in the West would call propaganda .
Image caption Noon time , by Yang Myong Ryong , 1963
All the artists represented are state employees , whose task is to communicate the " correct attitudes and values " .
The curator of the exhibition , Bettina Busse , says that does not diminish the pictures as works of art .
" Of course the art is very clearly related to the ideology , but it is not true that it is more propaganda than art .
They are really very good works .
We want people to be a bit open - minded . "
But the exhibition has caused controversy .
Most reviewers were concerned by what one critic called " the moral dilemma " of dealing with the North Korean dictatorship and by whether criticism of its human rights record was being stifled in order to avoid upsetting Korean officials .
' No freedom '
Gerald Matt , the director of another Vienna museum , the Kunsthalle Wien , organised a photo exhibition in North Korea a few years ago , and says the restrictions imposed by the North Korean authorities are considerable .
" It is a totalitarian country and their art serves the glorification of the leader and the system . "
" There is no freedom for the arts " in North Korea , he says , and " no freedom to do a show or to decide what you take in that show or what not " .
Image caption Kim Jong
Il , the supreme commander of the KPA , deeply concerned over the soldiers ' diet , by Ri Chol , 2000
" The question is : can you do something like this without commenting , without discussing the background ? " Mr Matt says .
" That is something I doubt . "
The director of MAK , Peter Noever , says he understands people 's concerns about the project , but that he hopes the exhibit , which took four years to get off the ground , will lead to a better mutual understanding .
" Art knows no borders , " he says .
" Art wo n't change anything .
It wo n't change the political situation - but nevertheless through art , maybe you get a slightly different view or a new view or you understand things in a different way . "
One painting of Kim Jong
Il inspecting an army kitchen is called " Kim Jong Il , the Supreme Commander of the KPA , deeply concerned over the soldiers ' diet " .
This and other pictures of conspicuously well - fed women and children may strike Western viewers , who remember the devastating famines in North Korea , as cynical .
Others , like one of two children lying in the grass watching tiny kites flying in a clear blue sky , are more poignant , despite their kitschiness .
It is a dream , perhaps , of a kinder world that is out of reach .
This is my view from the edge of nowhere , that 's right , I 'm living on the edge man .

The Federal Government 's $ 23.8 m ISP - level internet filtering initiative will not block encrypted content or web applications and can be circumvented legally , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has admitted .
In an official response to parliamentary questions on notice released yesterday , Senator Conroy said he had attended an hour - long demonstration of filter circumvention on 5 June 2009 .
He was shown how to get around the ISP - level filter using free proxy network TOR and Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) techniques at the Enex TestLab in Victoria .
Although Enex expected " technically competent " users to be able to circumvent the filter , Conroy said monitoring circumvention attempts would not be required by the Government .
" ISPs will not be required to block circumvention attempts by their customers or end users , " he said .
While he said it would be " irresponsible " of the Government to publish circumvention techniques , the Government took no measures to prevent other organisations from doing so .
Euthanasia advocacy group Exit International held a " hacking masterclass " for senior citizens last month , and Electronic Frontiers Australia planned to make public as much information about the filter as possible .
When asked if an ISP would be held responsible for knowingly allowing customers to bypass the filter , Conroy reiterated that ISPs would not be required to block circumvention attempts .
He said the same to whether ISPs would be allowed to offer a service or product that enabled circumvention .
" The capacity of filters to detect and provide warnings on circumvention was not tested during the pilot as none of the filtering solutions provided such granular controls including monitoring and alerting , and it is not a requirement of the Government 's policy , " he said .
Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) CEO Peter Coroneos was sceptical of the filter 's effectiveness .
" While we support many of the Government 's efforts in the online security sphere , we are n't convinced that it [ the filter ] will have anything more than symbolic value , " he told iTnews .
While the IIA did not believe that the internet should be " unregulated and unrestricted in all ways " , Coroneos said the filter would only give families a false belief that their children could not access unsavoury material .
" It remains our concern that much of the worst of the worst content will escape the filter and people are given a false sense of security , " he said .
" The reality is , access to this content remains unaddressed and really could only be addressed by the families themselves . "
Last week , Conroy 's Department for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy said filter legislation would not be introduced to parliament until " later this year " .
Greens Senator Scott Ludlam , whose questions on notice prompted Conroy 's current response , urged the Government to abandon its net filter plan completely .
" The Government needs to clearly indicate that it 's going to scrap the idea completely and work on a new policy in collaboration with all stakeholders , " Ludlam said in a statement last Thursday .
" Opposition against the internet filter is widespread because it will do precisely nothing to curb the distribution of illegal material online , while establishing the architecture for greater government censorship in the future . "
The picture with King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan , surrounded by women almost all with bare faces who took part in the National Dialogue Forum , is worth a thousand words .
Gender segregation is become the battleground between modernisers and conservatives .
Riyadh ( AsiaNews ) –
As the saying goes , a picture is worth a thousand words , which is what the Khaleej Times , a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates , tried to explain to its readers as it analysed the impact on Saudi public opinion of a photo showing Saudi King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan surrounded by a group of some 40 women , most showing their faces .
The significance of the picture lies less in the fact that female faces were bared than in the break with the kingdom ’s traditionally rigid separation of the sexes .
Since it was published , the picture has become a talking point on blogs , Internet forums , shisha cafes , newsrooms and the corridors of power .
The women surrounding king and prince took part last month in the National Dialogue Forum where they were invited to express their views .
They later travelled to the Royal Court in Riyadh to meet the king and the crown prince to brief them about the discussions .
At the end of the meeting , a group picture was taken by the royal photographer , with each participant eventually getting a copy .
“ Many people are saying the photo has a symbolic message for the nation , ” suggesting “ that the time has come for women to be recognised , ” wrote Siraj Wahab , a senior editor with Arab News .
Under Saudi law , a woman cannot leave home without a male “ guardian ” ( father , husband or brother ) to whom she is legally subordinated .
Women cannot drive a car , nor can they have any contacts with unrelated men .
She can not even pray in a mosque .
The situation has important economic repercussions on female employment and foreign investments because gender segregation applies to the workplace and foreign companies .
Cautiously , King Abdullah has been moving things along .
Recently , Ahmed al - Ghamdi , director of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice ( Haia ) in Makkah , said that men and women could pray together and meet freely albeit only in public .
The conservatives ’ reaction was immediate ( one even called for al - Ghamdi ’s death ) .
The Commission fired its Makkah chief , a move that it was eventually forced to cancel , Saudi Arabia ’s official news agency SPA reported , because of the alleged intervention by the government .
Justice Minister Muhammad Al - Eissa said that people should not confuse situations in which unrelated men and women mingle in public , which is allowed in Islam , and gender mixing in private ( ikhtilat ) , which is banned .
This photo “ sent a message to the people that it is OK to work with women and be side by side with women , and that there 's nothing wrong with that , ” said Maha Muneef , a prominent physician and advisor to the governmental Shura council in Riyadh .
Basmah Al Omair , who runs a centre that lobbies for greater rights for women , agrees .
“ The whole point of ( Abdullah ’s ) taking photos with women is to get people comfortable with the idea of men and women mixing , " she said .
Indeed , gender segregation is becoming “ the ” battleground for Saudi Arabia ’s various factions of Islamic scholars to fight over the country ’s future .
Against those who have lined up behind the king , there is a large and strong contingent of conservatives who have support with the royal family .
One conservative scholar , Abdul Rahman Al - Barrak , wrote to Justice Minister Al - Eissa , urging him not to support “ modernists . ”
In his letter , he said , “ Do n’t be the keys for evil ” to pervade “ among the Ummah ( the Islamic community ) by belittling and underestimating that which the enemies of God . . . want in terms of changing the condition of this beloved Kingdom . ”

I recently heard a top cable exec argue that the current cable TV business model is sound , robust , and primed for the future .
His bullish rationale was that the dual revenue stream works great for everyone .
Content providers get carriage fees and advertising revenue , while cable double dips with subscription fees and advertising revenue too .
Yes , it is a cozy little relationship , is n’t it .
But he left out one very important constituency – the customer .
And history shows that when technology enables customers to get what they want , how they want it , for less , inevitably they get their way .
The internet is all about unbundling .
Newspapers and magazines have been unbundled – why pay for the whole thing , when you can just read the articles you want online for free ?
Music has been unbundled – why buy a CD with 11 crappy songs for 15 bucks when you can just buy the good one for 99 cents ?
Even TV shows are unbundling .
Why suffer through the whole show when you can just catch Letterman ’s top 10 list at CBS.com , or the funny bits of Saturday Night Live on Hulu or YouTube ?
Cable TV is next .
Why should I pay $ 75 or more for 500 live channels when I only watch around 15 regularly ?
That works out to around $ 5 a channel , a month , by the way , a princely sum that only ESPN , HBO and Showtime meet or exceed from cable ops – and ultimately customers .
But I pay for those 500 channels via affiliate fees , meaning I support ESPN , Comedy , Disney and Nickelodeon – which I ’m happy to pay for – along with Hallmark , FoxNews , Animal Planet , and 482 others I could n’t care less about .
And that unbundling is already starting , especially among the millennial audience we target here at Revision3 .
Many are cutting the cord , and moving to an on - demand ala - carte world , enabled by new types of devices and services .
I just did a round - up of over these new over - the - top boxes for a panel at the most recent Ad:tech , and the progress has been amazing .
Roku ’s steller $ 99 box now offers a wide range of independent channels ( including Revision3 ) , along with Netflix , Amazon and sports channels from baseball ’s MLB and basketball ’s NBA .
I also had a chance to preview upcoming set - tops from Boxee and Syabas as well , and they are equally impressive – adding in support for YouTube , CNN and many other mainstream channels and services .
I ’m already saving more than a hundred dollars , and getting more to boot , by dropping just one premium service and going ‘ net .
I used to pay more than $ 200 annually to DirecTV so I could watch 3 - 4 NY Mets games at home in San Francsico ( I know , I ’m a masochist ) .
But with the MLB ’s new on - demand streaming service – coupled with a simple yet effective channel app on either Boxee and Roku – I now can stream every Mets game each week in full HD .
It looks amazing on my 52 ” LCD TV – only a purist would notice the very slight quality downgrade compared to DirecTV ’s heavily stepped on signal .
And this is just the beginning .
Just as magazines and newspapers are embracing the new App World , TV networks will begin to do so as well .
What ’s keeping HBO , Showtime or Epix , for instance , from creating their own Netflix - like channel , complete with a paid subscription model ?
I ’ll wager a princely sum that programmers inside each of those organizations are feverishly coding up apps that work across those platforms .
And if they work there , you know they ’ll be modified for the iPad , iPhone , Android and elsewhere .
Because in the end , apps and pipes are the future of content .
Consumers do n’t need cable .
They will pay for content – but only enough to support what they really want .
We ’re moving to a “ best screen available ” model , where consumers are going to want to watch what they want , when they want , on whatever screen is around right NOW .
And programmers will have to adapt or become marginalized .
In five years we ’ll be installing apps from our favorite content providers that work across big- screen TVs ( via Roku , Boxee , Syabas , or some sort of embedded TV client ) , our computers , tablets and smart phones .
Heck , it could even be delivered via the old - fashioned 750 Mhz cable plant – more than one multi-channel service is readying an app store for their set - top boxes that could take the place of today ’s bundles .
We ’ll also be paying for some sort of transmission , whether it ’s broadband at home and 4G on the go – or some sort of bundled WiMax service that does it all .
We ’ll buy programming from the providers directly , and pipes and plumbing from someone else .
And that ’s the future of cable companies .
They can optimize for delivery , and build out a best - of - breed network that delivers high bandwidth to the home , and high availability on the go .
They can snap up programmers that have a proven ability to deliver both high quality programming and compelling applications .
Or they can do both .
They just ca n’t continue to rely on a business model that ’s built on scarcity when that scarcity no longer exists .

Matthew 28:18-20
Jesus said , “ All power is given unto me in heaven and earth .
Go you therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost :
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world .
Amen
What are you waiting for ?
To know this and to say that you have been reborn , how does it hold that Christians and pastors do nothing ?
You might say , what do you mean , do nothing ?
We send some money to the missions , we have wonderful committee meetings , we give food to the local pantry , we are involved in all the mercy ministries .
Yes do the mercy ministries , but to know what to do and not do it , is it not said to be a sin by God .
As children ’s souls are at risk of going to hell for eternity and children are murdered daily , do you think that it will be a good idea to hang on to the thought that you will tell Jesus you fed the hungry , and clothed the naked , while children went to hell ?
Will Jesus tell many sleeping Christians to go over with the goats ,
He does not know you ?
I judge none of your hearts , Jesus has given me a gift to love you , but you must judge yourself , before Jesus does .
I do judge out of love , your actions or lack of .
Look around you , do you not understand the times at all ?
Are you willing to hear a prophetic warning , or do you just want your best life now ?
Do you want the truth , or just to feel good .
Every pastor and priest that does not tell his flock to get their children out of the government schools is sinning and putting themselves at risk of going to hell for eternity .
Every elder that does not warn the pastor and the people about getting out of the government schools is sinning and putting themselves at risk of going to hell for eternity .
Every Christian sitting in the pews that does not warn the pastor and elders and the people setting in the pews to get their children out of the government schools is putting themselves at risk of going to hell for eternity .
The government school , yes government , because they are no longer public , as they indoctrinate the children in an ungodly and pagan environment full of lies , and socializing them to be good little comrades .
Even though it was never meant biblically to put our children into a public school , at one time they at least tried to keep God a strong part of the education of the child so that they could recognize the counterfeit leaders we have in our government today , and would quickly put them out of service to the people .
Jesus told you to “ Seek first HIS kingdom ” and those going to His kingdom will love God with all their hearts , minds , souls , and strength , and love their neighbor as themselves .
Do not say that you love Jesus if you are putting the children at risk for eternity in an indoctrination system that is against God , family , and country .
Please pastors , elders , and Christians do not deceive yourselves , your children are at great risk when attending a government k- 12 and a government college .
I know that many have made this Sacred Cow an Idol , and those that understand the urgency for the children must pray for those with strongholds that keep them from seeing and hearing .
Love and prayers in Christ to each of you ***

The New Face of Autism Therapy
With one in 110 children diagnosed with autism , and therapists in short supply , researchers are developing humanoids to fill the gaps .
But can robots help patients forge stronger bonds with people ?
Of course , it had to be the Daleks .
When the BBC first conceived of the Doctor Who Adventures , its ambitious series of four downloadable computer games , these tenacious beings must have been at the top of the essential features list .
And on 5 June , they will return , terrorising the planet right in City of the Daleks , the opening instalment .
Commissioned by BBC Wales in conjunction with BBC Online , and developed by Sheffield - based games studio Sumo Digital , the series is certainly getting off to an explosive start .
The Daleks have altered time to invade Earth in the year 1963 ( intriguingly , the year Doctor Who first aired ) .
When the Tardis arrives , swinging London has been utterly destroyed and the last living human is sheltering in Charing Cross underground station .
Amy and the Doctor must now repair the continuum to prevent the invasion , or the Doctor 's new assistant will fade out of existence .
The problem is , the task will require a dangerous trip to Skaro , the Dalek home planet , and more specifically the looming metropolis at the core of their empire .
Hence , the title .
Featuring impressive likenesses of Matt Smith and Karen Gillan ( who also voice all the dialogue ) the game is essentially a very polished , very intuitive action adventure , designed with families very much in mind .
" We felt that Doctor Who was perfect for a game – the TV series has so many parallels with games , " says Ian Tweedale , editor of interactive at BBC Wales .
" Also , although the game is great for young people who are already game players , we wanted to bring in a mass TV audience , people who may not play games , and introduce them to what games are about , and maybe whet their appetite to try more . "
The start point of City of the Daleks is an impressively destroyed Trafalgar Square , all collapsed monuments , smoking buildings and deep chasms leading to the fractured underground train lines below .
You move the doctor by controlling his direction with the mouse and clicking the right button to walk .
But watch out , there are Daleks all over the place .
And here is where the development team faced a significant hurdle , more - or - less unheard of in game production – the Doctor is a devout pacifist .
There will be no AK47 gunfights , no frag grenades .
As Sean Millard , creative director at Sumo , puts it : " The Doctor saves humanity and solves all the problems of the universe through the power of negotiation and clever quips – which in themselves do n't make for great gameplay .
It would be brilliant if he had a lightsaber , or twin guns , but he has n't .
There was a lot of design time spent working out how interaction with the baddies could be made fun . "
Consequently , the action sequences are based around a stealth mechanic .
Your first job is to sneak past a group of Daleks patrolling the area – their sphere of vision is shown as a green area , which you 've got to avoid .
Step inside the green and it goes to amber , then red , and they know you 're there – cue first use of the phrase " exterminate " .
From here it's a mix of exploration and environmental puzzles .
You 've got to get through a barricade barring entry to the underground station , and a precariously balanced taxi on a steep incline in front of the barrier would seem to be the solution .
Whenever you approach a relevant scenic item , an icon pops up in the bottom right offering an action – " climb " perhaps , or " talk " .
Clicking the left button carries it out .
Most of the actions are context sensitive so you do n't have to worry about learning lots of moves .
And if you talk to Amy she 'll usually reveal your current objective .
The jokey interplay between these characters has been nicely reproduced , especially in the short movie segments between each playable area .
For example , before the duo arrive in London the Doctor asks Amy which Beatle she 'd most like to meet .
When she replies " John or Paul " , he asks why no one ever says Ringo .
" There 's no such thing as a sexy drummer , " is her damning response .
The Doctor gets a small inventory of items to carry around , and naturally , this includes , the sonic screwdriver , which brought in its own range of problems for the game designers .
" It 's very important in a game to have a strong internal logic , " says co-producer Charles Cecil , a veteran designer of adventure titles like the famed Broken Sword series .
" We spent a lot of time asking what exactly does a sonic screwdriver do ?
In a game players need rules that they can totally understand . "
" I 'm not sure we ever got an answer to that , " adds Millard .
What the device DID mean was that the traditional video game means of barring a player 's progress – the ubiquitous locked door – could n't be used : the sonic screwdriver is a skeleton key .
Instead , players will find that they must often solve logic puzzle - style mini- games to make progress .
These may involve re-arranging circuit boards , or carefully removing sensors from the electrified innards of a Dalek 's head unit .
And these get tougher as the game goes on .
The 3D visuals are hardly cutting edge , but that 's not the point .
The game has been designed to be playable on almost any PC or Mac hardware – the target platform is apparently an entry - level PC from four - years ago ( " We've been testing it on BBC computers , which are , as you 'd expect , the oldest in the world , " deadpans senior BBC Wales Interactive producer , Matt Fidell ) .
Also , there 's a nicely stylised look to the two leads – and much of their character has been captured , right down to Matt 's distinctive loping stride ( the developers spent a day in London filming him just walking about ) .
The environments , meanwhile , have perfectly captured the extravagantly coloured lighting and offbeat steam punk technologies of the series .
Most of the backgrounds are produced as beautifully detailed 2D illustrations , which are mapped around the 3D environment .
It 's a beautiful , slightly retro effect harking back to Cecil 's Broken Sword adventures , and particularly effective when the Doctor reaches Kaalann – the Dalek city .
The planet has not been visited during the reboot of the TV series , and has never been fully visualized before .
That , says Tweedale is the key beauty of developing a game based on the brand .
" There are bits we can do in the game that we just can't do on TV , like having Trafalgar Square smashed up by the Daleks .
We could n't do that on television , even with CGI , it 's just too expensive .
Here , we can go to Skaro , we can envisage all sorts of things we could n't do before . "
The game 's writer , Phil Ford , has scripted episodes of Torchwood , Doctor Who : Dreamland and Sarah Jane Adventures .
He was equally excited about the chance to explore new territories .
" Every episode takes us to somewhere we could n't do on TV .
Everyone was really fired up that we would be able to go to Kaalann .
That 's why I like to do these animated spin - offs – they give you the opportunity to really broaden the Doctor Who canvas . "
A key element of the development process seems to have been the cross pollination of ideas between the Doctor Who team and the game developers .
Usually , when a studio is developing a game tie - in with a major TV or film brand they have to slavishly adhere to the original design vision .
Not here .
For the design of Kaalann for example , the Sumo Digital artists were given just a one word brief by Steven Moffat and his team : brutal .
Their original concept sketches were all sleek high - tech skyscrapers , but , along with the BBC team , they felt the city looked too human .
Someone from the TV series suggested Fritz Lang 's Metropolis as an influence , and Sumo took this in a whole new direction .
The result is a dense Art Deco - style cityscape beneath a raging orange sky .
It 's an impressive creation , and better yet , it has become canon .
If the TV series ever comes to Skaro , the BBC design team will use the version seen in the game .
Indeed , this crossover is already happening .
At some point a scene used in the games will also appear in the current Doctor Who TV series , so the game team were invited on set .
" We thought we were just going there to see what the sets would be like , but it turned out the designers were altering the sets to fit what we wanted in the game , which was a bit of a shock , " says Cecil .
" Right from the beginning we 've worked very closely .
There 's been amazing co-operation . "
Even the actors are getting in on this sense of crossover .
As Nicholas Briggs , the voice of the Daleks , explains : " The red Dalek speaks a lot in the game , whereas in the TV series , in Victory of the Daleks , the red Dalek does n't say anything .
So I had to come up with my red Dalek voice , which I will be using should the red Dalek ever re-appear ! "
The Sumo Digital team reckons there 's around two or three hours of gameplay per episode , if you rush straight through the linear narrative .
However , players who spend a little longer exploring the environments will find a selection of collectible cards featuring Doctors of the past , as well as well - known enemies , allies and differently coloured jelly babies .
Apparently , the each game is a 250 MB file , which is less than downloading an episode of the TV series .
While the first episode is out on 5 June , the others are likely to follow on a monthly basis .
They are all separate stories , but Millard reckons you 'll get a more rounded experience playing them in sequence .
The BBC has no idea what to expect from here .
It 's the first time the corporation has commissioned an interactive project of such size , and it could well open the doors to similar projects with other big brands .
For now though , Doctor Who fans will have a thoroughly enjoyable experience , jumping into the shoes of their favourite Timelord and attempting to outwit the Daleks .
Once they are beaten , the subsequent three adventures are likely to feature more of the Doctor 's classic foes .
Indeed , we 've seen some concept art from another of the games – it features an Arctic science research base and some very familiar giant robots .
Yes , the Cybermen are coming …
• Doctor Who : City of the Daleks will be available from the Doctor Who website on 5 June

GUARDIAN Solves IPTV Forest Access Issue
Our good friends at Idaho Public TV got bullied out of making images in the Frank Church Wilderness by an overzealous Forest Ranger recently and now the Guv is involved in a little matter the GUARDIAN settled years ago .
We sent the following note to Leo Kay , a friendly sounding bureaucrat who is just 8 days into the job as the top voice at the US Forest Service .
Kay was cautious about committing to adopting the GUARDIAN policy , but we expect it will be included in a new policy and we will soon be watching images from the Wilderness on IPTV .
Leo Kay

Washington , D.C .
Leo ,
Appreciated the conversation this morning and gladly share the following which should easily find its way into a national policy for photographing on ANY public lands .
As a professional photographer handling assignments for the likes of TIME , NY TIMES , NEWSWEEK , etc .
I found myself on public lands making photographs for “ commercial use . ”
These days as owner of a large stock photo agency specializing in “ tutorial images ” for textbooks , I have encountered overzealous rangers at locations as diverse as the Capitol Mall in D.C. and the deserts of Utah .
As a “ news ” photographer they backed off .
As a textbook photog , they often as not ordered me to secure a “ camera permit , ” or something else as silly .
Not only did I refuse , but I challenged them to arrest me for taking photos with the clear intent of selling them .
I WON MY ISSUE at the administrative levels and obtained letters from both the Dept. of Agriculture Forest Service and the Dept. of Interior Park Service .
Both letters were in may camera bag that was stolen in France last year , but I have them pretty much committed to memory .
Both letters had text that read essentially as follows :
“ Neither the equipment used nor the intended use of any photographs taken of or on public lands shall be of concern to department personnel . ”
“ Only the impact on the resource and the enjoyment of visitors shall be considered by department personnel with regard to decisions about photographing and filming .
Permits and approval shall be obtained for any activities that disturb the resource , interfere with visitors enjoyment of facilities or require access to areas normally off limits .
These activities would include road closures and any destruction or damage to habitat . ”
“ Not only should we allow filming and photographs on public lands , we should ENCOURAGE such activity as long as it is conducted in a manner consistent with general rules in place . ”
The GUARDIAN notes it would be impossible to enforce prohibitions against teachers , scientists , students , tourists and others from realizing a “ commercial gain ” from photographs taken on or of public lands .

Call them , Urban Counterfeiters !
Two vendors at the Brooklyn Flea have noticed a line of jewelry called “ Waylaid ” from the national retailer Urban Outfitters that is strikingly similar to their own creations .
Lillian Crowe , a 27 - year - old jewelry designer in her first year of business , sells jewelry featuring a rib cage , a spine and the skull of a bull — yet recently discovered shockingly similar knockoffs in the new Urban Outfitters catalog online .
Crowe said she unveiled her designs last March .
The release date of
Urban ’s designs could not be confirmed , but it could not have been earlier than November , 2009 , based on online comments .
To top it off , Crowe noticed three other designs that she said were similar to those of other designers .
One was a shark jaw necklace — on the market since fall 2008 — by a designer who calls her line , “ Species by the Thousands . ”
“ People are bound to have the same ideas , but if it ’s so many different ideas … ” said Crowe , her voice trailing off in her Spartan studio in Bushwick .
“ Maybe someone [ at Urban Outfitters ] took an inspirational day at the Flea . ”
The designer of Species by the Thousands , Erica Bradbury , was skeptical that an Urban Outfitters designer had pulled a blinged - out Jayson Blair .
“ It is tricky and difficult to have ownership on designs that rely on casting found objects — whether its bones or miniature knives , ” said Bradbury , adding , “ Their version of my shark jaw necklace is more stylized . ”
She went on to say that two other independent designers had imitated her shark jaw design in more blatant fashion , and that Urban Outfitters had recently placed a wholesale order with her for a line of rings .
But both young jewelry designers said that whether they were the victims of a copycat or not , it ’s a part of the business .
Crowe ’s originals .
“ Lillian Crowe and I both sell at the Brooklyn Flea where a ton of big designers come through each weekend , ” Bradbury said .
“ It ’s depressing , but inevitable that our designs will be ripped off because we ’re both really creative . ”
Still , Urban Outfitters may be worse than most other corporations .
A source deep inside the jewelry business said that the retailer knows that it has a reputation for ripping off indie designers .
“ When Urban buys something from us , they specifically ask if its ‘ inspired by ’ someone , ” said the source , who dared not go on the record for fear of endangering a potentially lucrative business relationship .
“ They know they have this reputation , and are trying to [ dispel it ] . ”
But this is an industry that depends on creativity — so much so that Crowe said she did a good deal of research before beginning to produce her three bone - themed baubles .
“ I always check to see if anyone has done anything similar before I go into production , ” Crowe said .
“ I had n’t seen any ribcage and spine necklaces back in March of 2009 . ”
But it looks like online shoppers checking out Urban ’s version of the rib cage necklace are n’t too concerned about a possible lack of orginality .
According to the item ’s page , 325 customers think the necklace is “ awesome , ” 126 think it ’s “ unique , ” and 82 describe it as “ badass . ”
The designers of the two other stylish items Crowe noticed were almost identical to Urban ’s line either did not respond to an e-mail or asked not to be included in our diamond - hard coverage .
A spokeswoman for Urban Outfitters did not return our repeated calls before our platinum online deadline .
In the end , Crowe said she could n’t say for sure whether some corporate designer took advantage of her creativity — and consoled herself that imitation is the best form of flattery .
“ It ’s kind of the way the industry works .
I took it as legitimizing , in a way , ” Crowe said .
“ Leave it up to the consumer , I guess . ”
Over the past several years , social scientists have had a field day studying the vast libraries of digital records that are produced as a happy byproduct of society 's increased use of electronic systems .
Anonymized cell phone records have given us new perspectives on human mobility .
Logs from virtual worlds like Everquest and World of Warcraft have powered studies in fields from behavioral psychology to epidemiology .
Today 's issue of Science contains a stark warning that researchers could miss out on what may eventually be an even greater opportunity for access to this sort of data : the smart grid .
Combined , the US and Europe plan to install nearly 300 million smart grid devices within the next decade .
Depending on the precise device used , these will monitor electricity use in homes and offices at time spans of considerably less than an hour and in some cases as short as every minute .
The smartest of these devices can include data about specific appliances in use ; by tracking things like current , phase , and frequency .
Even the dumber ones can provide information about what 's going on when it comes to power use .
That sort of data presents both an incredible opportunity and an incredible risk .
It can provide a great perspective on what 's going on in different areas of a nation or the world , and associate it with all sorts of interesting variables : economic activity , pandemic spread , the weather , etc .
The risk is that , if the data is n't suitably anonymized , the breach of privacy could extend to private activities conducted in the privacy of a person 's home .
The Science Policy Forum was penned by the founder of a public - interest consulting group .
The author is n't so much concerned about the difficulty of crafting a policy for smart grid data sharing that protects privacy ; these earlier studies , plus years of experience with handling patient records in medical studies , provides us with some excellent models of policies that have generally worked .
The problem is that smart grid policies are being crafted right now by organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology , and the research community seems not to be paying attention .
The article points out a number of reasons to think that , without some sort of input from the research community , utilities wo n't necessarily be interested in preserving or sharing smart grid data .
To begin with , from a utility 's perspective , these are simply a modernized form of consumption records , and most of them traditionally purge those records after a period of seven years .
Although the companies that provide electricity to end users have a long history of working with the Department of Energy , they do n't have much experience with working with the sociologists and epidemiologists that might be interested in working with smart grid data .
It seems likely that these research communities will differ from the DOE in a variety of ways , and there might be some serious cultural misunderstandings .
Finally , the article raises the prospect that grid providers might not want some research to be done .
There 's been a lingering fear among the public over potential health impacts of electromagnetic fields , and the utilities are unlikely to want to encourage anyone to perform research that focuses the public 's attention on this .
Still , the author points out that both the utilities and the DOE can greatly benefit from some of the research derived from studying smart grid data .
The questions suggested include , " Are there ways to spot impending electricity outages ?
How does energy usage correlate with current events , appliance standards , and price ?
Which utility programs work best to improve energy efficiency ?
How are appliance efficiencies changing over time ?
How varied is the usage of appliances from person to person , from region to region , and from decade to decade ? "
In the absence of participation from the research community , the author argues , there 's a good chance that any rules regarding access to smart grid data will freeze them out entirely , end up being modified in a haphazard manner , or only open up the data after some of it is lost for good .
And that means everyone — the utilities , the DOE , and the researchers — will lose out on a unique opportunity .

Atlantiswas named after the original exploration sailing vessel of the Woods HoleOceanographic Institute , which brought scientists discoveries in oceanographyand marine biology during its many adventures on the seas .
Living up to itsnamesake , the Atlantis shuttle has ventured into the unknown and returned with trovesof scientific information since its first mission in 1985 .
To prepare for what is expected to be the shuttle 's final mission , here are seven cool things youdid n't know about Atlantis :
1 ) It 's the workhorse ofthe shuttle fleet .
" Atlantis is kind of theunsung underdog of the space shuttle fleet , " said Robert Pearlman , editorof collectSPACE.com , an online publication and community for space history andartifact enthusiasts , and a SPACE.com contributor .
Atlantis is considered the workhorseand the ferry because it has flown so many missions bringing crews to spacestations and equipment into orbit .
Atlantis flew to the Mir spacestation seven times , and will have flown to the International Space Station11 times , including this last mission .
2 ) Atlantis was the firstshuttle to launch an interplanetary probe .
During a four - day mission in1989 , astronauts launched the Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay ofAtlantis .
It was the first time aninterplanetary probe was launched from a space shuttle .
Magellan mapped morethan 98 percent of the surface of Venus , and revealed the planet to be mostlycovered by volcanic materials , dotted with a few impact craters .
3 ) It helped NASA to see acomet smack into a planet .
In October 1989 , the Galileoprobe was launched from Atlantis to study Jupiter .
Galileo captured the firstclose - up images of an asteroid while on its way to the giant planet .
Then , itmade the only direct observations of a comet colliding with a planet when itcaught the 1994 impact of comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 on Jupiter .
" The amount ofinformation we have learned about our inner solar system due to the mission of Atlantis will be one of the long - standing legacies that the space shuttleprogram will take credit for , " Pearlman said .
4 ) It does n't have anextension cord .
Unlike the other shuttles , Atlantis does not have a spacestation to shuttle power system that would allow the shuttle to tap intothe solar - powered electrical system of the space station while docked .
Atlantismust rely solely on the hydrogen - oxygen fuel cells which are carried onboard , and because of this Atlantis missions are limited to a maximum of about 14days .
The other shuttles can stay in space longer .
5 ) Atlantis has a spaceshipclone .
" The shuttle Endeavourexists because of Atlantis , " Pearlman said .
When NASA built Atlantis , theydecided to make a complete set of spare parts , with the idea that if anyshuttle was damaged , it could easily be repaired .
However , after the Challengershuttle was lost in an explosion in 1986 , there was debate about what to do .
Itwas decided , Pearlman said , to build the Endeavour shuttle out of the spareAtlantis parts .
Endeavour is scheduled to fly thelast mission of the space shuttle program in November of this year .
6 ) It was the last shuttleto visit the Hubble Space Telescope .
During a May 2009 mission , the Atlantis crew made 5 space walks to repair and add equipment to the Hubble .
Among the upgrades , the crewinstalled the CosmicOrigins spectrograph , an instrument designed to allow Hubble to peerfarther into the universe in the ultraviolet light spectrum than ever before , and Wide Field Camera 3 , which allows astronomersto better observe galaxy evolution , dark matter and dark energy .
Theconclusion of the mission was the last time that repairs or additions will bemade to the Hubble .
7 ) Atlantis co-starred ina movie with Leonardo DiCaprio .
IMAX cameras made the tripwith the Atlantis crew in 2009 on its mission to upgrade the Hubble SpaceTelescope .
In March of this year , " Hubble 3D " was released , withLeonardo DiCaprio narrating .
Atlantis and its finalastronaut crew , a veteran six - man team , will deliver a new Russian sciencemodule called Rassvet ( Russian for " Dawn " ) to the space station onthe shuttle 's final mission .
Liftoff of Atlantis is currently set for Friday at2:20 p.m. EDT ( 1820 GMT ) from NASA 's Kennedy Space Center .
The mission is NASA 's 132ndspace shuttle flight since the fleet began launching into space in April 1981 .
After this mission , only two more shuttle flights remain , on Discovery and Endeavour , before NASA retires its three - orbiter fleet later this year .

U.S. Subpoenas Times Reporter Over Book on C.I.A. By CHARLIE SAVAGE Published : April 28 , 2010 WASHINGTON 
The Obama administration is seeking to compel a writer to testify about his confidential sources for a 2006 book about the Central Intelligence Agency , a rare step that was authorized by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. The author , James Risen , who is a reporter for The New York Times , received a subpoena on Monday requiring him to provide documents and to testify May 4 before a grand jury in Alexandria , Va. , about his sources for a chapter of his book ,  State of War : The Secret History of the C.I.A. and the Bush Administration .
The chapter largely focuses on problems with a covert C.I.A. effort to disrupt alleged Iranian nuclear weapons research .
... Justice Department was seeking information only about Mr. Risens sources for the ninth chapter , which centers on the C.I.A.s effort to disrupt Iranian nuclear research .
That material did not appear in The Times .
The book describes how the agency sent a Russian nuclear scientist  who had defected to the United States and was secretly working for the C.I.A.  to Vienna in February 2000 to give plans for a nuclear bomb triggering device to an Iranian official under the pretext that he would provide further assistance in exchange for money .
The C.I.A. had hidden a technical flaw in the designs .
STATE OF WAR : THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION James Risen FREE PRESS NEW YORK .
LONDON .
TORONTO .
SYDNEY A NOTE ON SOURCES
Many people have criticized the use of anonymous sources of late .
Yet all reporters know that the very best stories -- the most important , the most sensitive -- rely on them .
This book would not be possible without the cooperation of many current and former officials from the Bush administration , the intelligence community , and other parts of the government .
Many of them were willing to discuss sensitive matters only on the condition of anonymity .
__________ [ Pages 193-218 . ]
Chapter 9 A ROGUE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBABLY done this a dozen times before .
Modern digital technology had made clandestine communications with overseas agents seem routine .
Back in the Cold War , contacting a secret agent in Moscow or Beijing was a dangerous , labor - intensive process that could take days or even weeks to arrange .
But by 2004 , it was possible to send high - speed , encrypted messages directly and instantaneously from CIA headquarters to agents in the field who were equipped with small , covert personal communications devices .
So the officer at CIA headquarters assigned to handle communications with the agency 's spies in I ran probably did n't think twice when she began her latest download .
With a few simple commands , she sent a secret data flow to one of the Iranian agents in the CI A's spy network .
Just like she had done so many times before .
But this time , the ease and speed of the technology betrayed her .
The CIA officer had made a disastrous mistake .
She had sent information to one Iranian agent meant for an entire spy network ; the data could be used to identify virtually every spy the CIA had inside Iran .
Mistake piled on mistake .
As the CIA later learned , the Iranian who received the download was actually a double agent .
The agent quickly turned the data over to Iranian security officials , and it enabled them to " roll up " the CIA 's agent network throughout Iran .
CIA sources say that several of the Iranian agents were arrested and jailed , while the fates of some of the others is still unknown .
This espionage disaster , of course , was not reported in the press .
It left the CIA virtually blind in Iran , unable to provide any significant intelligence on one of the most critical issues facing the United States -- whether Tehran was about to go nuclear .
In fact , just as President Bush and his aides were making the case in 2004 and 2005 that Iran was moving rapidly to develop nuclear weapons , the American intelligence community found itself unable to provide the evidence to back up the administration 's public arguments .
On the heels of the CIA 's failure to provide accurate prewar intelligence on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , the agency was once again clueless in the Middle East .
In the spring of 2005 , in the wake of the CIA 's Iranian disaster , Porter Goss , the CIA 's new director , told President Bush in a White House briefing that the CIA really did n't know how close Iran was to becoming a nuclear power .
The Bush administration has never publicly disclosed the extent to which it is now operating in the blind on Iran .
But deep in the bowels of the CIA , someone must be nervously , but very privately , wondering : Whatever happened to those nuclear blueprints we gave to the Iranians ?
The story dates back to the Clinton administration and February 2000 , when one frightened Russian scientist walked Vienna 's winter streets .
Enveloped by the February cold , he dodged the bright red and white Strassenbahn , the quaint electric tramcars that roll in slow circuits around the city , while he debated whether to go through with his secret mission .
I 'm not a spy , he thought to himself .
I 'm a scientist .
What am I doing here ?
He fingered the package stuffed in his overcoat , making certain the priceless documents were still there and that this crazy job was n't just a bad dream .
The Russian pulled the note out of his pocket , looked at the address one more time , and then plowed ahead , confused .
He knew nothing about Vienna and quickly found himself lost along the operatic city 's broad avenues .
Was he looking for something called Rueppgasse , or was it called Heinestrasse ?
Was he supposed to take Strassenbahn 21 ?
He rode two full circuits on the S - Bahn 21 train , searching in vain for the right stop .
Should he switch to the U - Bahn , Vienna 's subway ?
The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) was n't the easiest office in Vienna to find .
They could have at least given me good directions .
As he stumbled along into Vienna 's north end , in the unglamorous neighborhood surrounding the Praterstern U - Bahn station , the same question pounded in his brain again and again , but he could n't find an answer .
What was the CIA thinking ?
The Russian had good reason to be afraid .
He was walking around Vienna with blueprints for a nuclear bomb .
To be precise , he was carrying technical designs for a TBA 480 high - voltage block , otherwise known as a " firing set , " for a Russian - designed nuclear weapon .
He held in his hands knowledge needed to create a perfect implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain reaction inside a small spherical core .
It was one of the greatest engineering secrets in the world , providing the solution to one of a handful of problems that separated nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia from the rogue countries like Iran that were desperate to join the nuclear club but had so far fallen short .
He still could n't believe the orders he had received from CIA headquarters .
The CIA had given him the nuclear blueprints and then sent him to Vienna to sell them -- or simply give them -- to the Iranian representatives to the IAEA .
With the Russian doing Langley 's bidding , the CIA appeared to be about to help Iran leapfrog one of the last remaining engineering hurdles blocking its path to a nuclear weapon .
The dangerous irony was not lost on the Russian -- the IAEA was an international organization created to restrict the spread of nuclear technology .
The IAEA 's Vienna headquarters , inside the United Nation 's sprawling concrete compound , a jumble of geometric - shaped buildings assembled like a Christmas pile of children 's toys along the Danube River just outside the city center , was the leading forum for international debate over the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology .
It was the place where the United States came to level charges against rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea over their clandestine nuclear programs .
IAEA experts traveled the world to try to police the use of nuclear power , to make certain that peaceful energy - generation programs were n't providing cover for the clandestine development of nuclear weapons .
In 2005 , the IAEA and its chief , Mohamed El Baradei , would win the Nobel Peace Prize for their counter proliferation efforts .
But in 2000 , the CIA was coming to Vienna to stage an operation that could help one of the most dangerous regimes in the world obtain a nuclear weapon .
The Russian stood out like a poor eastern cousin on Vienna 's jeweled cityscape .
He was a nuclear engineer who had defected to the United States years earlier and quietly settled in America .
He went through the CIA 's defector resettlement program and endured long debriefings in which CIA experts and scientists from the national laboratories tried to drain him of everything he knew about the status of Russia 's nuclear weapons program .
Like many other Russian defectors before him , his tiresome complaints about money and status had gained him a reputation within the CIA of being difficult to manage .
But he was too valuable for the CIA to toss away .
One secret CIA report said that the Russian " was a known handling problem due to his demanding and overbearing nature . "
Yet the same report stated that he was also a " sensitive asset " who could be used in a " high - priority covert- action operation . "
So despite their disputes , the CIA had arranged for the Russian to become an American citizen and had kept him on the payroll , to the tune of $ 5,000 a month .
It really did seem like easy money , with few strings attached .
Life was good .
He was happy to be on the CIA gravy tram .
Until now .
The CIA was placing him on the front lines of a plan that seemed to be completely at odds with the interests of the United States , and it had taken a lot of persuading by his CIA case officer to convince him to go through with what appeared to be a rogue operation .
The case officer worked hard to convince him -- even though the officer had doubts about the plan as well .
As he was sweet - talking the Russian into flying to Vienna , the case officer wondered whether he was being set up by CIA management , in some dark political or bureaucratic game that he did n't understand .
Was he involved in an illegal covert action ?
Should he expect to be hauled before a congressional committee and grilled because he was the officer who helped give nuclear blueprints to Iran ?
The code name for this operation was MERLIN ; to the officer , that seemed like a wry tip - off that nothing about this program was what it appeared to be .
He did his best to hide his concerns from his Russian agent .
The Russian 's assignment from the CIA was to pose as an unemployed and greedy scientist who was willing to sell his soul -- and the secrets of the atomic bomb -- to the highest bidder .
By hook or by crook , the CIA told him , he was to get the nuclear blueprints to the Iranians .
They would quickly recognize their value and rush them back to their superiors in Tehran .
The plan had been laid out for the defector during a CIA - financed trip to San Francisco , where he had meetings with CIA officers and nuclear experts mixed in with leisurely wine - tasting trips to Sonoma Country .
In a luxurious San Francisco hotel room , a senior CIA official involved in the operation walked the Russian through the details of the plan .
He brought in experts from one of the national laboratories to go over the blueprints that he was supposed to give the Iranians .
The senior CIA officer could see that the Russian was nervous , and so he tried to downplay the significance of what they were asking him to do .
He told the Russian that the CIA was mounting the operation simply to find out where the Iranians are with their nuclear program .
This was just an intelligence - gathering effort , the CIA officer said , not an illegal attempt to give Iran the bomb .
He suggested that the Iranians already had the technology he was going to hand over to them .
It was all a game .
Nothing too serious .
The Russian reluctantly agreed , but he was still clearly suspicious of the CIA 's motives .
He was afraid because he fully understood the value of the information he was supposed to pass to the Iranians .
He certainly understood it better than did his CIA handlers .
Before he defected , he had worked as an engineer at Arzamas - 16 , the original center of the Soviet nuclear weapons program and the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos , the home of the Manhattan Project .
Founded in 1946 , when Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was rushing to catch up with the Americans and trying to turn the Soviet Union into a nuclear power , Arzamas - 16 had once been so secret that it was known only as the " installation " or the " site . "
Built on the grounds of a czarist - era monastery , about 400 kilometers from Moscow at the old town of Sarova , the complex 's first name was Arzamas - 60 , since it was 60 kilometers from the town of Arzamas ; but the Soviets realized that name was too revealing about its location , so they changed it to Arzamas - 16 .
In 1947 , the entire city of Sarov officially disappeared from Russian maps .
Arzamas - 16 was where the Soviets built their first atomic and hydrogen bombs , and today , 30,000 people still work at nuclear weapons - related facilities located within a restricted area in the heavily guarded Arzamas - 16 district .
It was n't until 1995 that Russian President Boris Yeltsin changed its name back to Sarov .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , the United States feared that poverty - stricken scientists from Arzamas - 16 and other facilities like it would be tempted to work for Iraq , North Korea -- or Iran .
Weapons proliferation really meant the spread of scientific knowledge and the spread of scientists .
The end of the Cold War meant the end of regular paychecks for Russian nuclear scientists , and there was a real danger that Russian technical expertise would spread like a virus to the totalitarian states of the third world .
In the 1990s , in fact , the director of one Russian nuclear institute killed himself , reportedly over the government 's failure to meet his payroll .
There were Russian press accounts of uranium being stolen from Arzamas - 16 .
What was to stop underpaid Russian scientists from walking off with technical expertise , and perhaps the blueprints and even the fissile material needed to help rogue states build a bomb ?
Fortunately , at just the right moment , two centrist American senators , one Democrat and one Republican , saw the danger and came up with one of the most farsighted U.S. foreign relations programs since the Marshall Plan .
In 1991 , Sam Nunn , a Georgia Democrat and the party 's leading voice on national security , and Richard Lugar , a cautious Republican and former mayor of Indianapolis who had turned himself into a foreign affairs specialist in the Senate , crafted legislation that helped prevent a massive drain of nuclear technology out of the former Soviet Union .
Known as the Nunn - Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program , the legislation created joint U.S. - Russian programs to deactivate thousands of nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union , and helped rid the Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Belarus of the nuclear weapons they had inherited at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union .
Equally important was Nunn - Lugar 's impact on the lives of Russian scientists .
Nunn - Lugar helped more than twenty thousand Russian experts involved in Soviet weapons programs find alternative , and more peaceful , forms of research .
Arzamas - 16 even forged new , cooperative ties with Los Alamos .
By 1993 , Los Alamos and Sarov were officially sister cities .
Behind the public face of Nunn - Lugar , the CIA was also doing its part , quietly helping Russian nuclear scientists to defect and resettle in the United States , rather than go to Iran or Iraq , providing them new lives and enough money to keep their talents off the open market .
It was this CIA defector program that brought the Russian to the United States .
But now , the CIA was no longer keeping the Russian engineer off the nuclear market , nor was it keeping Russian know - how under wraps .
The blueprints the Russian was to hand over to the Iranians were originally from the Arzamas complex , brought to the CIA by another defector .
What better way for the CIA to hide its involvement in this operation than to have a veteran of Arzamas personally hand over the Russian nuclear designs ?
His CIA case officer had coached the Russian as best he could on how to make contact with the Iranians .
It was n't easy ; you do n't just look up the address for the covert Iranian nuclear weapons program in the Yellow Pages .
Still , maybe there was a way you could make contact on the Internet .
Maybe it really was as simple as sending out e-mail .
At the case officer 's urging , the Russian started sending messages to Iranian scientists , scholars , and even Iranian diplomats stationed at the IAEA in Vienna .
In his e-mails , he would explain that he had information of great interest to Iran and that he was seeking a meeting with someone who could hear him out .
The messages were designed to be playfully intriguing , but not quite revealing .
Just enough to prompt a response .
He also started attending academic conferences in the United States attended by Iranian - American scientists .
These conferences sometimes attracted scientists visiting from Iran , and they might be good contacts .
The Russian stood out like a sore thumb among the Iranian academics , but that was the point .
He wanted people to notice him .
He was a nuclear salesman , ready for business .
Of course , it was n't unusual for Russian and Iranian scientists to mix , and that was another point the CIA was counting on .
There was a well - established channel of Russian technical support for Iran 's nuclear power generation program .
Moscow had an $ 800 million contract to help Iran build a light water reactor at Bushehr .
The United States had publicly complained that Iran was using Bushehr and the country 's commercial nuclear program to advance its nuclear weapons development efforts .
American officials , in both the Clinton and Bush administrations , consistently asked why Iran needed a nuclear power program when it had so much oil and natural gas ; in one State Department statement , Washington noted that Iran annually flares off more natural gas than Bushehr could produce .
For at least a decade , a key sticking point in U.S. - Russian diplomatic relations has been Russia 's ties to Iran and Moscow 's willingness to view Iran as an eager customer for Russian arms , rather than as a growing strategic threat in the Middle East .
With Tehran serving as a major shopping bazaar for Russia 's post - Cold War arms sales , it certainly was n't unusual to find Russian and Iranian technicians and bureaucrats mingling .
The Russian defector could exploit that tendency to make inroads with the Iranians .
As he mingled with the scientists and other academics , the Russian picked up business cards and e-mail addresses .
The Russian began to e-mail his new contacts , sending intriguing messages explaining that he wanted to talk with them about his ability to provide materials of interest to Iran .
Finally , at one conference , he hit pay dirt when he met a physics professor visiting from Tehran .
After the CIA checked out his background , the agency decided that the contact with the Iranian professor was promising .
The CIA hoped the Iranian academic might serve as the Russian 's entree into the secret world of Tehran 's nuclear program .
At the least , he might be able to put the Russian in contact with the right people in Iran .
The Russian followed up his chance encounter with e-mails to the scientist back at his university in Iran .
The Russian explained that he had information that was extremely important , and he wanted to make an offer .
After some delays , the Iranian finally responded , with a wary message , asking what he had in mind .
That was enough for the CIA .
Now the Russian could tell Iranian officials in Vienna that he had been in touch with a respected scientist in Tehran before he showed up on their doorstep .
The CIA had discovered that a high - ranking Iranian official would be traveling to Vienna and visiting the Iranian mission to the IAEA , and so the agency decided to take the next step and send the Russian to Vienna at the same time .
It was hoped that he could make contact with either the Iranian ambassador to the IAEA or the visitor from Tehran .
The CIA sent him to Vienna without any backup .
Langley did n't want to risk exposure .
The CIA station in Vienna was n't asked to play any role to support the Russian ; this operation was dubbed a " special access program , " and its existence was a tightly held secret .
Only a handful of CIA officers knew of the existence of MERLIN .
Better to let the Russian get lost and fumble his way around town than tell more officers about the operation .
Sending him to Vienna without any minders would also convince anyone watching that he was just what he appeared to be - an amateur at this game , freelancing .
The Russian 's cover story was that he was the go - between for the other Russian scientist who had brought the nuclear blueprints out of Arzamas .
I n truth , he had never met the other defector , but that did n't matter .
The story would help answer any questions the Iranians might have about how he came to acquire the blueprints , which were not easy to access or remove from Arzamas .
The Russian was also told not to try to hide the fact that he now lived in the United States .
His story should be as close to the truth as possible .
Just because he was living in America did n't mean he was working for the CIA .
But now that he was in Vienna , he was playing the role of bumbling scientist too well , unable to find the Iranian mission , uncertain even where to get off the train .
" I spent a lot of time to ask people as I could [ language problem ] and they told me that no streets with this name are around , " the Russian later explained to the CIA , in his imperfect English .
Maybe deep down , he did n't want to get off the tram , and did n't want to find the right office .
He had to find time to think .
He could not stop thinking about his trip to San Francisco , when he had studied the blueprints the CIA had given him .
Within minutes of being handed the designs , he had identified a flaw .
" This is n't right , " he told the CIA officers gathered around the hotel room .
" There is something wrong . "
His comments prompted stony looks , but no straight answers from the CIA men in the room .
No one in the San Francisco meeting seemed surprised by the Russian 's assertion that the blueprints did n't look quite right , but no one wanted to enlighten him further on the matter , either .
In fact , the CIA case officer who was the Russian 's personal handler had been stunned by the Russian 's statement .
During a break , he took the senior CIA officer aside .
" He was n't supposed to know that , " the CIA case officer told his superior .
" He was n't supposed to find a flaw . "
" Do n't worry , " the senior CIA officer calmly replied .
" It does n't matter . "
The CIA case officer could n't believe the senior CIA officer 's answer , but he still managed to keep his fears from the Russian , and he continued to train him for his mission .
After their trip to San Francisco , the case officer handed the Russian a sealed envelope with the nuclear blueprints inside .
The Russian was told not to open the envelope under any circumstances .
He was to follow the CIA 's instructions to find the Iranians and give them the envelope with the documents inside .
Keep it simple , and get out of Vienna safe and alive , the Russian was told .
But the defector was more worried than ever about what kind of game the CIA was getting him into .
And he had his own ideas about how he might play that game .
In Vienna , the Russian went over his options one more time and made a decision .
He unsealed the envelope with the nuclear blueprints and included a personal letter of his own to the Iranians .
No matter what the CIA told him , he was going to hedge his bets .
There was obviously something wrong with these blueprints -- so he decided to mention that fact to the Iranians in his letter .
They would certainly find flaws for themselves , and if he did n't tell them first , they would never want to deal with him again .
In his badly broken English , the Russian addressed the Iranians as if they were academic colleagues .
He later gave a copy of his letter to the CIA .
To University : First , let me introduce myself .
I am a person , who worked for many years in atomic industry .
Please check out next page for my personal info please .
I would like to inform you I have very valuable information about design and production of atomic weapon .
At this time I possess a description of one of key elements of modern system , TEA 480 high - voltage automatic block .
Described device is known as a fire switch which lets to initiate simultaneously all detonators at a weapon core ( spherical charge ) .
I am sure other devices can be available for your review in the future .
I did not contact right people in your country directly because unfortunately I could not find them .
Of course , I tried many other ways to attract attention to this info by telling little bit about what I have but it does not work .
Whole misunderstanding , and accordingly wasting time and disappointing .
So I decided to offer this absolutely real and valuable basic information for free now and you can evaluate that .
Also I sent e-mail to inform [ the Iranian professor ] about this possible event .
Please let him know you have this package .
What is purpose of my offer ?
If you try to create a similar device you will need to ask some practical questions .
No problem .
You will get answers but I expect to be paid for that .
Let 's talk about details later when I see a real interest in it .
Now just take your time for professional study of enclosed documentation .
My contact info on next page .
The Russian was thus warning the Iranians as carefully as he could that there was a flaw somewhere in the nuclear blueprints , and he could help them find it .
At the same time , he was still going through with the CIA 's operation in the only way he thought would work .
The Russian slid his letter in with the blueprints and resealed the envelope .
After his day of floundering around Vienna , the Russian returned to his hotel , near the city 's large Stadtpark .
He did a computer search and found the right street address for the Iranian mission .
His courage bolstered , he decided he would go back and finish the job in the morning .
By 8:00 A.M. , he found 19 Heinstrasse , a five - story office and apartment building with a flat , pale green and beige facade in a quiet . , slightly down - at - the - heels neighborhood in Vienna 's north end .
The street was crowded with tobacco shops , bars , and cafes , a tanning salon , even a strip club .
Now the Russian realized why he had missed it ; there was no sign announcing the Iranian mission .
The only proof that this was the right place was a mail directory , with three rows of tenants ' names on the wall beside the building 's front door .
Amid the list of Austrian tenants , there was one simple line : " PM / Iran . "
The Iranians clearly did n't want publicity .
19 Heinstrasse , Vienna , Austria . Bing.com / maps .
[ Images added by Cryptome . ]
The Russian 's fevered rush of adrenaline as he approached the building suddenly cooled when he realized the Iranian office was closed for the day for some unexplained reason .
Once again , he spent the day walking Vienna , and once again mulling over the CIA 's orders .
He returned to his hotel again that night , still clutching the undelivered documents .
He returned one last time to the Iranian mission early the next morning and stood for a few agonizing minutes on the empty sidewalk outside .
He came back that afternoon , and an Austrian postman finally helped him make up his mind .
As the Russian stood silently by , the postman opened the building door , dropped off the mail , and walked quietly away to complete his neighborhood rounds .
His courage finally reinforced , the Russian decided to follow suit ; he now realized that he could leave his package without actually having to talk to anyone .
He slipped through the front door , and hurriedly shoved his envelope through the inner door slot at the Iranian office .
" At 1:30 P.M. I got a chance to be inside of the gate , " at the entrance to the Iranian mission , the Russian later explained in writing to the CIA .
" They have two mailboxes : one after gate on left side for post mail ( I could not open it without key ) and other one nearby an internal door to the mission .
Last one has easy access to insert mail and also it was locked .
I passed internal door and reached the mission entry door and put a package inside their mailbox on left side of their door .
I cover it old newspaper but if somebody wants that is possible to remove this package from mailbox , in my opinion , I had no choice . "
The Russian fled the mission without being seen .
He was deeply relieved that he had finally made the handoff without ever having to come face to face with a real live Iranian .
He flew back to the United States without being detected by either Austrian security or , more important , by Iranian intelligence .
From its headquarters at Fort Meade , Maryland , the National Security Agency monitors global airline reservation databases , constantly checking on the travel arrangements of foreign officials and others targeted by American intelligence around the world .
In February 2000 , the NSA was also eavesdropping on the telephone lines of the Iranian mission in Vienna .
It could intercept communications between the mission and Tehran .
In addition , the NSA had broken the codes of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security , Iran 's foreign intelligence service .
The Americans had several different ways to track the movements of Iranian officials in and out of Vienna .
Just days after the Russian dropped off his package at the Iranian mission , the NSA reported that an Iranian official in Vienna abruptly changed his schedule and suddenly made airline reservations and flew home to Iran .
The odds were that the nuclear blueprints were now in Tehran .
The Russian scientist 's fears about the operation were well founded .
He was the front man for what may have been one of the most reckless operations in the modern history of the CIA , one that may have helped put nuclear weapons in the hands of a charter member of what President George W. Bush has called the " axis of evil . "
Operation MERLIN has been one of the most closely guarded secrets in the Clinton and Bush administrations .
And it may not be over .
Some officials have suggested that it might be repeated against other countries .
* * * [ Stars in original ] MERLIN was born out of frustration .
For more than a decade , one post - Cold War CIA director after another went before Congress and the nation to vow that America 's spies were now focused on new , gathering threats posed by a set of " hard targets . "
Terrorists .
Rogue nations .
Weapons of mass destruction .
Each new director promised that the CIA was changing rapidly to adapt to this complex new world in which the Soviet Union was no longer the main enemy .
But the CIA has failed in its new mission and has never found out enough about any of these new targets .
Iran 's nuclear program remains one of the most impenetrable of them all .
Even before the disastrous collapse of its Iranian spy network in 2004 , the CIA was able to pick up only fragmentary information about Iran 's nuclear program .
Officials who are critical of the CIA 's efforts say that the agency 's counterproliferation programs have relied far too heavily on intelligence collected from technical methods -- spy satellites , eavesdropping , and code breaking , as well as " measurement and signature " intelligence , which includes the collection and analysis of data from hidden equipment like remote ground sensors .
Lacking definitive answers about Iran 's atomic program , the CIA has instead offered a series of safe and cautious estimates .
Over the years , the agency has repeatedly stated that Iran was within five to ten years of becoming a nuclear power .
Those five to ten years keep stretching and expanding .
The Counterproliferation Division within the CIA 's Directorate of Operations , the agency 's clandestine espionage arm , came up with MERLIN and other clandestine operations as creative , if unorthodox , ways to try to penetrate Tehran 's nuclear development program .
In some cases , the CIA has worked jointly with Israeli intelligence on such operations , according to people familiar with the convert program .
None are known to have worked .
One bizarre plan called for the sabotage of Iran 's electrical grid in areas of the country near its secret nuclear installations .
The CIA conducted tests of the electrical sabotage equipment at the U.S. government 's Nevada nuclear test range .
The plan called for an electromagnetic pulse device that could be smuggled into Iran and then hidden next to large power transmission lines carrying electricity into the country 's nuclear facilities .
The CIA would later remotely detonate the device , which would send a massive electrical pulse down the power lines , shorting out the computer systems inside the Iranian nuclear complex .
The CIA worked with Mossad , Israel 's spy service , on the plan , and Mossad agents volunteered to smuggle the devices into Iran .
The Israelis told the CIA that they had Iranian agents who would carry out the plan on their behalf .
But there were major technical problems that made the plan unworkable .
The electromagnetic devices were so large that they had to be carried in a large truck , and then parked next to the power lines ; the CIA realized that was impossible .
Then there was MERLIN .
On paper , MERLIN was supposed to stunt the development of Tehran 's nuclear program by sending Iran 's weapons experts down the wrong technical path .
The CIA believed that once the Iranians had the blueprints and studied them , they would believe the designs were usable and so would start to build an atom bomb based on the flawed designs .
But Tehran would get a big surprise when its scientists tried to explode their new bomb .
Instead of a mushroom cloud , the Iranian scientists would witness a disappointing fizzle .
The Iranian nuclear program would suffer a humiliating setback , and Tehran 's goal of becoming a nuclear power would have been delayed by several years .
In the meantime , the CIA , by watching Iran 's reaction to the blueprints , would have gained a wealth of information about the status of Iran 's weapons program , which has been shrouded in secrecy .
It 's not clear who originally came up with the idea , but the plan was first approved by President Bill Clinton .
After the Russian scientist 's fateful trip to Vienna , however , the MERLIN operation was endorsed by the Bush administration , possibly with an eye toward repeating it against North Korea or other dangerous states .
The CIA had obtained genuine Russian nuclear weapons blueprints from a Russian scientist and had forwarded them to one of the national laboratories -- almost certainly Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico -- to be scrutinized by American nuclear experts .
Sandia , in Albuquerque , is one of the jewels in the crown of the American nuclear establishment .
Its origins were in the so - called Z Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory during the Manhattan Project .
Z Division conducted the engineering and design work for the nonnuclear portions of the first atomic bomb , including the weapons assembly .
Sandia thus houses the U.S. government 's institutional memory for how a nuclear bomb is put together .
Scientists at the national laboratory were asked to implant flaws into the Russian blueprints .
The flaws were supposed to be so clever and well hidden that no one could detect their presence .
Next , the agency needed to figure out how to get the designs to the Iranians without Tehran realizing that the blueprints were coming from the CIA .
That job was assigned to the CIA 's Counterproliferation Division .
The CPD chose the Russian defector .
That was the idea behind MERLIN , anyway .
But like so many of the CIA 's other recent operations , this one did n't go according to plan .
First , of course , the Russian spotted flaws in the blueprints .
Second , the CIA never maintained adequate controls over the nuclear blueprints -- or over the Russian .
The Russian was supposed to believe that he was handing over genuine nuclear designs .
Instead , his cover letter may have convinced the Iranians to be wary of the blueprints .
Furthermore , the CIA also gave the blueprints to the Iranians without any certain way of monitoring their use by Iranian scientists .
The CIA was flying blind -- dangerously so .
In effect , the CIA asked the Russian to throw the blueprints over the transom , and then the agency just hoped for the best .
Several former CIA officials say that the theory behind MERLIN -- handing over tainted weapons designs to confound one of America 's adversaries -- is a trick that has been used many times in past operations , stretching back to the Cold War .
But in previous cases , such Trojan horse operations involved conventional weapons ; none of the former officials had ever heard of the CIA attempting to conduct this kind of high - risk operation with designs for a nuclear bomb .
The former officials also said these kind of programs must be closely monitored by senior CIA managers in order to control the flow of information to the adversary .
If mishandled , they could easily help an enemy accelerate its weapons development .
That may be what happened with MERLIN .
The CIA case officer was deeply concerned by the ease with which the Russian had discovered flaws in the designs .
He knew that that meant the Iranians could , too , and that they could then fix and make use of the repaired blueprints to help them build a bomb .
If so , the CIA would have assisted the Iranians in joining the nuclear club .
He grew so concerned about whether he had aided the Iranian nuclear program that he went to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to tell congressional investigators about the problems with the program .
But no action was ever taken .
For his part , the Russian never understood why the CIA wanted him to give the Iranians blueprints that contained such obvious mistakes .
It made no sense .
And so he wrote the Iranians his personal letter .
It is not known whether the Russian ever communicated again with the Iranians , or whether they tried to contact him .
But after receiving his letter warning them that they would need further help to make the blueprints useful , it is entirely possible that the Iranians showed the plans to other experts familiar with Russian nuclear designs and thereby identified the defects .
Iran has spent nearly twenty years trying to develop nuclear weapons , and in the process has created a strong base of sophisticated scientists knowledgeable enough to spot flaws in nuclear blueprints .
What 's more , the Iranians have received extensive support for years from Russian and Chinese nuclear experts who could help the Iranians review the material .
In addition , Tehran also obtained nuclear blueprints from the black - market network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan , and so already had workable blueprints against which to compare the designs obtained from the CIA .
Even if the Iranians were interested in using the blueprints provided by the mysterious Russian , they would certainly examine and test the data in the documents before ever actually trying to build a bomb .
Nuclear experts say that they would thus be able to extract valuable information from the blueprints while ignoring the flaws .
" If a country of seventy million inhabitants [ Iran ] , with quite a good scientific and technical community , got [ nuclear documents with supposedly hidden flaws ] , they might learn something , " warned a nuclear weapons expert with the IAEA .
" If [ the flaw ] is bad enough , they will find it quite quickly .
That would be my fear . "
MERLIN has been conducted in the darkest corner of the American national security establishment at one of the most significant moments in the long and bitter history of U.S. - Iran relations .
Iran has bedeviled American presidents since Jimmy Carter and the embassy hostage crisis , and neither Bill Clinton nor George W. Bush have based their policies on an adequate understanding of the volatile political dynamics under way in Iran .
Throughout the late 1990s , the Clinton administration was convinced that political reformers and youthful moderates were ascendant in Iran , and so the White House twisted itself in knots trying to open back - channel talks with Tehran .
But in order to reach out to the Iranians , Clinton had to downplay evidence that Tehran was still the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , that Iran was still an Islamic republic whose security apparatus was controlled by powerful , conservative mullahs who wanted nothing to do with the United States , and that the Iranian regime was eager to become a nuclear power .
Critics say that Clinton and his lieutenants repeatedly tried to ignore intelligence indicating that Iran was linked to the deadly Khobar Towers bombing in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia in June 1996 , which killed nineteen American military personnel .
Saudi Hezbollah , an offshoot of the Lebanese - based extremist group backed by Iran , carried out the attack , and it did so with training and logistical support from Iran .
Senior CIA officials played an important role in the Clinton administration 's efforts to downplay evidence of Iran 's terrorist ties in the late 1990s , according to several CIA sources .
In 1996 or 1997 , a well - placed officer with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security , Iran 's foreign intelligence service , was cooperating with the CIA .
In meetings in Europe , just months after the Khobar attack occurred , the Iranian source provided the CIA with evidence that Iran was behind the bombing , according to CIA officials .
The Iranian told the CIA he had been meeting with several senior Iranian officials after the bombing , and they were celebrating their successful operation .
He also told his CIA contact that sometime after the Khobar bombing , an American government aircraft had secretly landed in Tehran , carrying a senior American official .
Several top Iranian officials went out to the airport to meet the American , the source said .
To the officers working on the CIA 's Iran Task Force handling the reporting from this Iranian source , it appeared that the Clinton administration was cutting a secret deal with Tehran just after nineteen Americans had been murdered by the same regime .
Senior CIA officials responded to this explosive intelligence by suppressing it , according to several CIA sources .
According to one CIA source , reports from the Iranian source were delivered to high - ranking CIA officials , but none of the reports was disseminated throughout the intelligence community , and no record of the reports was distributed inside the CIA .
It is not known whether President Clinton or other top White House officials were ever told about the reports from the Iranian source .
Certainly , then - FBI Director Louis J. Freeh believed that President Clinton and his lieutenants were downplaying intelligence concerning Iran 's involvement in Khobar Towers .
As he has recently detailed in his memoirs , his anger over the way the Khobar case was handled by the Clinton administration was at the heart of his long - running dispute with the White House .
It is not known whether Freeh was ever told about the reports from the source who detailed Iran 's role , however .
It was n't until June 2001 , five years after the bombing , and after Clinton had left office , that the Justice Department issued indictments of fourteen people in the Khobar bombing that alleged that unidentified Iranian officials were behind the terrorist attack .
The indictment notwithstanding , in its first few months , the new Bush team largely ignored Iran while obsessing over Iraq .
It was only after 9/11 that senior Bush administration officials began to pay attention to low - level , back - channel talks with Iran that had been under way in Geneva since the Clinton days .
Through those Geneva meetings , the Bush team discovered that Iran was strongly supportive of the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan because of Tehran 's deep hatred for the ruling Taliban , Sunni Muslims heavily dependent on Pakistani support to retain power in Kabul .
Shia - dominated Iran long feared the Taliban 's radical influence on its own Sunni minority .
Tehran also wanted to retain its influence over western Afghanistan , particularly the trading center of Herat .
In 1998 , Iran and the Taliban had come close to a shooting war .
After nine Iranian diplomats were murdered in Afghanistan and thousands of Shiites were killed following the Taliban seizure of the northern city of Mazar - i- Sharif , Iran massed troops on the border for a military " exercise , " and Pakistan had to step in to calm things down .
At the time , Iran 's leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , made it clear that Iran 's patience with the Taliban was wearing thin .
" I have so far prevented the lighting of a fire in this region which would be hard to extinguish , but all should know that a very great and wide danger is quite near , " he declared , prompting a response from the Taliban that the cleric 's statements reflected his " mental ineptitude . "
Iran had also supported the opposition Northern Alliance against the Taliban , and after 9/11 , Iranian officials at the Geneva meetings were actually impatient with the sluggish start to American military operations in Afghanistan .
Publicly , the Iranians said little about the war and provided little overt support to the Americans , apart from promising to allow rescue operations for any downed pilots over its territory .
But in Geneva , Iranian officials were eager to help and even brought out maps to try to tell the United States the best targets to bomb .
Iran also held some al Qaeda operatives who tried to flee Afghanistan into Iran .
In early 2002 , Iran detained about 290 al Qaeda fighters who had been picked up as they crossed the border .
They were n't willing to turn them over directly to the United States , but they eventually did hand over some to third countries , such as Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan , which were working with the United States .
But by that time , the Bush administration 's attitude toward Iran was changing , hardening .
Iran was now a member of the " axis of evil . "
The Iranians responded to Bush 's axis of evil speech with pique ; Tehran released Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a ruthless Afghan warlord who had been on the CIA payroll during the 1980s but who was now opposed to the American occupation of Afghanistan .
Soon after his release , Hekmatyar 's Hezb - i- Islami forces were battling U.S. troops in Afghanistan , and in May 2002 the CIA launched a missile from an armed Predator drone in a vain effort to try to kill him .
The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq , on Iran 's other border , was met with deep ambivalence in Tehran .
The Iranians were happy that the United States was getting rid of their old enemy Saddam Hussein , opening the door for Iraq 's majority Shia population to gain power , with , of course , the guidance of Iran .
But two consecutive wars in two neighboring countries , first in Afghanistan and now Iraq , had placed thousands of American troops on Iran 's exposed flanks , and so it was not hard to see why the Iranians might be getting a little paranoid about the Bush administration 's intentions .
In May 2003 , one month after the fall of Baghdad , the Iranians approached the United States once again , offering to turn over top al Qaeda lieutenants , including both Saif al - Adel , al Qaeda 's chief of operations , and Saad bin Laden , Osama bin Laden 's son .
This time , the Iranians wanted a trade ; in return for the al Qaeda leaders , Tehran wanted the Americans to hand over members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq ( MEK ) , an Iranian exile terrorist organization that had been supported by Saddam Hussein and based in Iraq since 1986 .
After the fall of Baghdad , the U.S. military had disarmed the MEK 's thousands of fighters and taken custody of the group 's heavy military equipment , more than two thousand tanks , artillery pieces , armored personnel carriers , and other vehicles provided by Saddam Hussein .
But the Bush administration was divided over what to do with the group next .
In a principals committee meeting at the White House in May , the Iranian prisoner exchange proposal was discussed by President Bush and his top advisors .
According to people who were in the meeting , President Bush said that he thought it sounded like a good deal , since the MEK was a terrorist organization .
After all , the MEK had been a puppet of Saddam Hussein , conducting assassinations and sabotage operations inside Iran from its sanctuary in Iraq .
The MEK was officially listed as a foreign terrorist group by the State Department ; back in the 1970s , the group had killed several Americans living in Iran , including CIA officers based there during the shah 's regime .
Before any exchange could be conducted , the United States would need solid assurances from the Iranians that the MEK members would not be executed or tortured ; in the end , that obstacle may have made any such prisoner trade impossible .
But the idea never got that far .
Hard - liners at the Pentagon dug in and ultimately torpedoed any talk of an agreement with the Iranians .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz seemed to think that the MEK could be useful in a future war with Iran , and so they appeared eager to keep the group in place inside Iraq .
CIA and State Department officials were stunned that the Pentagon leadership would so openly flaunt their willingness to cut a deal with the MEK ; they were even more surprised that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz paid no price for their actions .
At the White House , officials soon learned that the Pentagon was dreaming up excuses to avoid following through on any further actions to rein in the MEK .
One argument was that the military was too busy , with too many other responsibilities in Iraq , to devote the manpower to dismantling the MEK .
The Pentagon basically told the White House that " we will get around to it when we get around to it , " noted one former Bush administration official .
" And they got away with it . "
The bottom line was that the United States lost a potential opportunity to get its hands on several top al Qaeda operatives , including Osama bin Laden 's son .
It became clear to frustrated aides that National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was not only failing to curb the Pentagon , but was also allowing decision making on Iran policy to drift .
The MEK 's political arm , the National Council of Resistance of Iran , understands how to gain attention in the West , particularly after watching the prewar success of the Iraqi National Congress , the Iraqi exile group headed by Ahmed Chalabi .
Like Chalabi's group , the Iranian exiles have used the American press to issue claims about Iran 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs in order to build the case for a tougher U.S. policy toward Tehran .
While the war in Iraq has overshadowed the issue and forced the Bush administration to move slowly , some administration officials have been advocating a more forceful policy of pressuring the Iranians to disarm .
The odds of a confrontation between the United States and Iran seemed to increase in the fall and winter of 2004 , when the IAEA reported that Iran was not fully cooperating with international inspectors , and there were new reports that Iran was going ahead with plans to produce enriched uranium despite past assurances to the IAEA that it would freeze such activity .
By 2005 , Iran 's apparent intentions to continue to develop its nuclear program was inevitably leading to a full - fledged diplomatic crisis .
Mit dem Aufwärtstrend ist es erst einmal vorbei .
Bislang schaffte es die Piratenpartei , stetig ihr Wahlergebnis zu verbessern .
Bei der Bundestagswahl 2009 fuhr sie mit zwei Prozent ihr bis dahin bestes Ergebnis ein .
Am Sonntag reichte es bei der nordrhein - westfälischen Landtagswahl nur für 1,5 Prozent .
Die Anfangseuphorie der Politikneulinge , die sich vor allem Themen rund um das Internet widmen , bekam damit einen Dämpfer .
Die Piraten drohen sich in parteiinternen Streitereien zu verlieren , die auch den Bundesparteitag an diesem Wochenende im rheinland - pfälzischen Bingen dominieren dürfen .
Die 2006 gegründete Partei erlebte im vergangenen Jahr ein erstaunliches Wachstum : Die Mitgliederzahlen schnellten von rund 1000 zum Jahresbeginn auf knapp 12.000 zwölf Monate später hoch .
Dabei brachte den Piraten vor allem auch die von der damaligen schwarz - roten Bundesregierung geplante Sperrung von kinderpornografischen Internet - Seiten Zulauf .
Im Gegensatz zu den etablierten Parteien traf die Piratenpartei den Nerv der jungen , bis dahin als weitgehend unpolitisch geltenden Internet - Gemeinde .
Keine andere Splitterpartei bekam auch deshalb vor der Bundestagswahl so viel mediales Interesse .
Seit der Bundestagswahl ist es jedoch merklich ruhiger um die Piraten geworden .
Einigen Anhängern geht die Entwicklung der Partei viel zu langsam voran .
Intern streiten die Mitglieder vor allem um zwei Dinge : die programmatische Ausrichtung und die Einbindung der gewachsenen Anhängerschar , wobei der basisdemokratische Anspruch nicht auf der Strecke bleiben soll .
Parteichef Jens Seipenbusch ( 41 ) sieht die größte Herausforderung darin , sich untereinander nicht zu entzweien .
" Solange wir uns nicht so zerstreiten , dass die Partei zerfällt , werden wir langfristig auch Erfolg haben . "
Die Piraten wollen ihre Augen nun auf die Landtagswahlen richten , die im kommenden Jahr – unter anderem in Baden - Württemberg , Berlin und Rheinland - Pfalz – anstehen .
Die Kernthemen der Piraten drehen sich bislang vor allem um Bürgerrechte im digitalen Zeitalter , Informationsfreiheit , Datenschutz , Urheberrechte und Bildung .
Andere Themen haben – wenn überhaupt – eine nachrangige Bedeutung .
Nach Ansicht von Seipenbusch soll das vorerst auch so bleiben : " Wenn wir die Kernthemen nicht in den Vordergrund stellen , dann stellen wir letztendlich die Existenzfrage für die Piratenpartei . "
Für den Bundesparteitag liegen aber schon zahlreiche Anträge zur Ergänzung des Parteiprogramms vor .
Sie reichen von einem " Recht auf einen selbstbestimmten Tod " über die " Entkriminalisierung von Marihuana " bis hin zur Ablehnung von Auslandseinsätzen der Bundeswehr .
Ohne ein umfassendes Parteiprogramm sehen Politologen wenig Chancen für die Piraten , ihre Wählerbasis zu vergrößern .
Für den Politikwissenschaftler Jens Walther von der Universität Düsseldorf ist die Piratenpartei noch eine Ein-Themen - Partei : " Sie hat kein umfassendes Parteiprogramm und kann deshalb nicht alle Bevölkerungsgruppen ansprechen . "
Sollte sich der thematische Fokus der Partei deutlich verschieben , will Seipenbusch nicht für eine weitere Amtszeit als Vorsitzender antreten .
Er hat bereits einige Gegenkandidaten für das Amt als Parteichef .
Einige Piraten werfen der gegenwärtigen Parteispitze vor allem eine mangelhafte Kommunikation mit der Basis vor .
Über die künftige Organisation der Parteistrukturen wird heiß diskutiert .
Zu dem Parteitag werden rund 1000 Mitglieder erwartet – also etwa zehn Prozent der Mitglieder .
" Das ist natürlich auch organisatorisch und finanziell eine ganz schöne Herausforderung für uns " , sagt Seipenbusch .
Und er glaubt : " Das werden wir bei dem jetzigen Wachstum in den nächsten Jahren nicht so weitermachen können . " ( vbr )
The spheres aim to allow people to hear each other more clearly in a busy pub
Speech bubbles which could provide the answer for people who want to make their voice heard in noisy pubs and clubs are set to go on display .
Product design student Elaine McLuskey invented the " social spheres " to enable people to hold a conversation above the background noise .
The 23 - year - old came up with the idea after she studied hearing impairments .
They will go on show at Edinburgh Napier University 's School of Arts and Creative Industries Degree Show .
Miss McLuskey , from Coatbridge , came up with two designs for the globes .
One is a stationary table top version , which joins pairs or groups of revellers .
The other is a mobile version , which looks like a space helmet for people to wear and " connect " with other users .
McLuskey has also invented a stationary version of the sphere Miss McLuskey said : " My research found that in some cases a person 's environment can be more disabling than a hearing impairment and so , in some respects , we are all hearing impaired on a daily basis .
" The obvious example is that frustrating situation of trying to catch up with a friend in a busy bar .
You want to hear their news and have a proper chat , but you have to shout over the din of music , chatter and clinking glasses .
" I hope the very noticeable and eccentric appearance starts people talking about hearing impairments . "
Richard Firth , head of product design at Edinburgh Napier University , said : " What 's really interesting about Elaine 's design is how she has researched and developed the thought - provoking concept of a hearing impairment and applied it to a person 's everyday environment . "
Other designs which will be on show from 13 to 23 May include a sensory table , flat pack lights , a dinosaur which monitors the amount of time children spend on their computer and a bottle which can be split into a beer and wine glass .

Now people have had a week or so to contemplate the most recent LDS General Conference , and it ’s getting some interesting reviews !
According to the Swearing Elders , the take - home message includes things like “ do n’t wear flip flops . ”
( They went on to explore this deep message with a funny flip - flop photo set .
😉 )
Then Jon treated us to more funny conference images with his LDS leader look - a- likes !
And Andrew reviewed President Uchtdorfs You Are My Hands talk ( and gave it a thumbs - up ! ) .
Not bad , but I ’m starting to think that other LDS World Conference was better .
You know , the one where — instead of praying for a handful of people to get a charitable revelation — personal revelation is open to everybody — and not just to “ confirm ” that your leaders are the ones who are right .
Apparently in this conference they canonized a new revelation for the church ( and it was n’t about flip - flops … ) .
That said , the Utah branch of Mormonism has cultivated some really entertaining culture !
Just check out this vintage book on Jello !
Some of the recipes are unbelievable !
( And do n’t forget scrapbooking ! )
Plus , all of Outer Blogness is abuzz about the new Mormon musical by the creators of South Park !
There are also some cooler local cultural notes :
There ’s a rock - and - roll LadyFest in the planning stages for SLC .
Also , Green Mormon Architect won a Best of Utah award — congrats !!
Then , is it too early to make fun of the tea - baggers again ?
It ’s just that a bunch of funny new stuff turned up this week .
Looks like tea - bagger - gate !
And , to keep this from being too one - sided , check out this serious criticism of Obama .
Plus some Humanists in Idaho are making some crazy spelling mistakes in their signs too ! 😉
NO BULL : Artist Andrew Reilly has started his own paper - making company in Bulls .
For his first trick , he 's making paper from bull manure .
So you think Andrew Reilly is talking crap ?
Not only does he talk about it , but the Rangitikei artist plans to have people writing on it soon .
While Jesus may have turned water into wine , Mr Reilly has gone for a more practical transformation – he 's figured out a way to turn bull dung into paper .
During studies towards his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Whanganui UCOL , Mr Reilly discovered an affinity for paper - making .
In his research , he found different cultures were making paper from many fibrous materials – including kangaroo poo , wombat faeces and elephant manure .
Back in his hometown of Bulls , there was one logical step .
A couple of bull farmers were more than happy for Mr Reilly to clear their paddocks , and he went to work with the pooper scooper .
Figuring out how to turn raw poo into paper took a bit longer – 15 months in fact , for the smooth transformation to be honed .
First Mr Reilly has to rehydrate the bull patties , covering them with litres of water in plastic buckets and leaving them to soak .
" There 's fibre from grass in there , the bull does n't actually process the fibre , " Mr Reilly explained .
" It needs a good couple of weeks to soften up the fibre and start breaking down . "
After a fortnight – during which the mixture is stirred occasionally – he sieves the waste from the fibre .
The mixture is then cooked in a caustic solution , washed , blended , bleached , sieved out onto a wire frame , and set out to dry .
Mr Reilly 's father walks past .
" Is he bamboozling you with the science ? " he asks cheekily .
Most of the paper Mr Reilly manufactures for his business Tenax papers is made from the more conventional material harakeke , or New Zealand flax .
He hopes the bull paper will be a hit with tourists or backpackers , who may be looking for a quirky gift .
It 's also proven popular with those looking for an original , handmade effect .
" I have had people who have bought it not because it 's bullshit , because they think it 's beautiful . "
And if not , at least friends are amused with being able to legitimately call him a " bullshit artist , " he said .
ATLANTA -- Jamal Crawford already got what he wanted most -- a trip to the playoffs .
On Tuesday , he picked up an extra reward for his unselfishness .
After willingly accepting a backup role for the first time in his career , the Atlanta Hawks guard was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in a landslide .
" You have to check your ego at the door , " the 30 - year - old Crawford said .
" It 's all about winning .
You do what you 've got to do . "
He had never been on a winning team until he was traded to Atlanta by the Golden State Warriors last summer .
Of course , the deal came with a caveat : The Hawks wanted Crawford to come off the bench , which was quite a change for someone who had been starting his whole life , from youth leagues to the NBA .
Hawks general manager Rick Sund flew to Crawford 's hometown of Seattle after the deal was made and pulled no punches about the planned role .
" I went right for the jugular , " Sund recalled .
" I told him there was an opportunity here to have tremendous notoriety coming off the bench .
I told him if we were going to take this to the next level , be a championship - caliber team , we needed someone to really make an impact off the bench . "
Crawford did just that .
He averaged 18 points a game in 31.1 minutes , a de facto starter who played a major role in Atlanta winning 53 games and earning the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs .
The Hawks are tied 2 - 2 with the Milwaukee Bucks in the opening round heading into Game 5 on Wednesday night .
Advancing in the playoffs is Crawford 's main goal , though he certainly did n't mind picking up some extra hardware during an off day in the series .
" We 're doing some good things here , " he said .
" It 's not complete yet . "
Crawford won the award going away with 580 of a possible 610 points , including 110 out of 122 first - place votes .
Jason Terry of the Dallas Mavericks , last year 's Sixth Man winner , finished second this time with 220 points .
Anderson Varejao of the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 126 points ) was third .
Until this season , Crawford was known mainly for being a talented player who always wound up on awful teams .
Only two other players in NBA history had played more games than Crawford without making the playoffs until he finally broke through in his 10th season .
He did n't come close to the postseason during stops in Chicago , New York and Golden State -- a run of futility that made him eager to accept whatever role was offered , as long as it gave him a shot at the playoffs .
The Hawks are a team that 's been steadily on the rise since a 13 - 69 debacle six years ago .
They have improved their win total each of the last five seasons , assembling a solid starting five led by Joe Johnson and supported by Josh Smith , Al Horford , Mike Bibby and Marvin Williams .
After reaching the second round of the playoffs last season , Sund knew the team needed a go - to player off the bench .
Golden State was looking to get younger and shed salary , so all it took to get Crawford were two little - used guards , Acie Law and Speedy Claxton .
Crawford was even more valuable since he can play both point and shooting guard , giving the Hawks some flexibility in the backcourt .
" He embraced it , but more importantly the team has embraced it , " Sund said .
" You have to give a lot of credit to Bibby .
Mike Bibby has been one of Jamal 's biggest fans .
Marvin has been a big fan .
They all kind of share who 's going to be out there .
It does n't work if the chemistry is n't good , and chemistry becomes good if they really embrace each other with their basketball abilities . "
Crawford got off to a slow start -- " I did n't want to step on anyone 's toes , " he said -- but he wound up ranking second on the team in scoring even though he never started a game .
He was usually on the court at the end of the game .
" I told Jamal that everyone can't start on this team , " coach Mike Woodson said .
" But it does n't matter who starts -- it 's who finishes . "
Post - I/ O Thoughts
Post - Google I /O , there ’s not much room left to see iPhone - vs .
- Android as anything other than an all - out war .
What we ’ve got here is a good old - fashioned epic rivalry .
It ’s exciting , vicious , fun to watch , and ultimately should prove to be excellent news for consumers .
Competition drives innovation and innovation raises the bar for everyone .
And the bar , for smartphones , is rising quickly .
Like any great rivalry , there are striking differences between the two competitors .
Apple and Google are jostling to shift the comparison between the two platforms to their very different strengths .
Apple ’s strengths : user experience , design , consistency .
Google ’s strengths : the cloud , variety , permissiveness .
The most interesting upcoming Android feature that Google demoed at I/O is a “ cloud - to - device ” messaging API .
Examples of how they ’re going to use it :
Buy an app ( or song , or anything ) from the Android Marketplace using a PC web browser , select one of your Android devices , and the item you just purchased will be pushed directly to that device over the air .
Take the current URL from your PC web browser and push it to your device , over the air .
If it ’s a web page , it ’ll open in the Android web browser ; if it ’s a Google Maps URL , it ’ll open in the Android Maps app .
One area where the iPhone has been far ahead of Android is in terms of backing up and restoring data .
Buy a new iPhone , or install a major OS update , and when you re-sync with iTunes on your desktop , all your apps and data are re-installed .
( After upgrading my 3GS to the iPhone OS 4 developer betas recently , I noticed that even the web pages I ’d left open in MobileSafari were restored . )
Android does n’t have that .
Upgrade to a new Android device , and there is no way to transfer your data from the old device to the new one .
Google is upping the ante on the iPhone here , though , by adding cloud - based data backup for Android applications .
The way it should work : get a new Android device , log in with your Google account , and your apps and data are restored to the device , over the air .
Android has nothing today that competes with the iPad .
But we all know Android - based iPad - like tablets are surely coming .

As I noted in my iPad review , the oddest part of the iPad experience is what happens when you first take it out of the box :
One thing that is very iPhone - like about iPad is that when you first take it out of the box , it wants to be plugged into your Mac or PC via USB and sync with iTunes .
In some ways , that ’s understandable .
USB syncing is how you load your iPad with music and videos and transfer over stuff like your email accounts , and , if you ’re not using MobileMe , your contacts and calendars .
But , on the whole , it feels retrograde .
It creates an impression that the iPad does not stand on its own .
It ’s a child that still needs a parent .
But it ’s not a young child .
It ’s more like a teenager .
It ’s close .
So close that it feels like it ought to be able to stand on its own .
It ’s obvious that iPhone OS and Android devices are paving the way to a post - PC future , where by “ PC ” I mean both Mac and Windows machines .
The simplicity of these mobile devices is their core strength , but it also means that they ca n’t do everything a PC can .
i Phone OS devices rely upon a PC , iTunes , and USB syncing to manage this gap .
Android devices rely upon servers in the cloud .
Relying upon a PC is ipso facto not “ post - PC ” , and the challenge for Apple is that they ’ve never demonstrated the sort of expertise needed to do this via the cloud .
Over - the - air syncing , backup , and system updates need to be something that “ just happens ” .
‘ No Chance ’
The big loser this week , though , was Microsoft .
They ’re simply not even part of the game .
RIM looms large , as BlackBerrys continue to reign as the best - selling smartphones in the U.S. But Microsoft ?
They ’ve got nothing .
No interesting devices , weak sales , and a shrinking user base .
Microsoft ’s irrelevance is taken for granted .
Google ’s competitive focus on the iPhone at I/O was intense and scathing .
But it ’s Microsoft ’s lunch they ’re eating .
Apple ’s and RIM ’s game is selling the integrated whole — their own devices , running their own software .
Google is playing Microsoft ’s game — licensing a platform to many device makers .
The big problem for Microsoft is not that there is n’t , in theory , room for more than one licensed mobile platform , but rather that Microsoft ’s model hinges upon monopoly - sized market share .
Apple could positively thrive with a long - term mobile market share of , say , 20 - 25 percent .
In the PC industry , Apple generates an outsized share of the profits despite selling only 5 percent of the total units worldwide , because all of Apple ’s PCs are in the middle and high price range of the market .
In the phone industry today — all mobile phones , not just smartphones — Nokia sells more than 10 times as many units as Apple , but Apple generates more profit .
Microsoft can’t afford for its mobile platform to account for just a sliver of the industry ’s unit sales .
Their licensing model is all about volume — low per-unit profits multiplied by an enormous number of units .
They ’re not selling $ 400 - 600 phones , they ’re selling $ 8 - 15 licenses for an OS .
But Google lets carriers and handset makers license Android for free .
And not only has Google cut the bottom out of the market price - wise , by the time Windows Phone 7 phones actually come to market , Android will have two complete years of momentum and market share behind it .
Three years ago , just before the original iPhone shipped , here ’s what Steve Ballmer said in an interview with USA Today ’s David Lieberman :
“ There ’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share .
No chance .
It ’s a $ 500 subsidized item .
They may make a lot of money .
But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold , I ’d prefer to have our software in 60 percent or 70 percent or 80 percent of them , than I would to have 2 percent or 3 percent , which is what Apple might get . ”
Not only was he wrong about the iPhone , but he was even more wrong about Windows Mobile .
Three years ago Ballmer was talking about 60 , 70 , 80 percent market share .
This week , Gartner reported that Windows Mobile has dropped to 6.8 percent market share in worldwide smartphone sales , down dramatically from 10.2 percent a year ago .
( The same report puts iPhone OS at 15.2 percent , and Android at 9.6 . )
Microsoft ca n’t undercut Android on price , and it seems increasingly unlikely that they can beat Android in terms of features or experience .
They did n’t warrant even a passing reference from Google at I /O .
No chance , indeed .
Click here to Ask Buddy a question
Yesterday we announced that Steve Google , bastard cousin of Google founder Larry Google , is starting his own search engine .
At the core of the engine – the answerer of all questions – is Chrislip High School sophomore Buddy Fenster .
He ’s shared his wisdom with the Journal before , and you can take a look at his nuggets here .
We thought we ’d start him off with an easy question because it ’s his first day on the Ask Buddy job .
Also , because he ’s a pinhead .
Question : “ I ’m a first - year student at Chrislip College , and I ’m having trouble in my physics class , most notably , in our studies of Einstein ’s theory of relativity .
The professor has explained it , but he did so in very technical terms , and I have trouble understanding it .
Could you explain relativity in layman ’s terms ? ” – G.F. , Chrislip
Answer :
Yes , I do .
Albert Einstein was a famous scientist with cool hair .
He invented relativity in Europe , and it soon spread to Germany , and now it ’s all over the place , including Chrislip .
The main thing Einstein noticed when he got a good look at relativity is that everything is relative .
That should clear everything up for you .
But maybe I can give you an example .
Have you seen the movie Zombie Bloody Zombie ?
It ’s not very good .
When you ’re watching it , time seems to go by really slow , but you still have to watch because you paid for the DVD .
Now let ’s say you ’re watching a really good movie , such as Cheerleaders at Cannibal High .
Time goes by so fast and you get so involved in the movie , especially the parts with the cheerleaders and cannibals , that sometimes you go to the bathroom without even leaving the couch .
There ’s a formula that we use to remember Einstein , which is this : E=MC² .
This stands for “ Einstein is equal to Miley Cyrus , too . ”
It reminds us that even though Einstein was a brilliant scientist who changed the world with his ideas , and Miley is hot and plays Hannah Montana , it does n’t necessarily mean she ’s better than him .
Today , let ’s play Political Kingmaker .
Pretend you ’re the Republican leadership in a smallish state with an open United States Senate seat .
The opposition is running a popular , longtime officeholder whose sense of inevitability was shaken by recent revelations that he had referred to himself as a Vietnam War veteran when he is n’t one .
Your own options are :
A ) A well regarded former congressman who is a decorated Vietnam War veteran .
B ) A political novice who made her fortune building up an entertainment business that specialized in blood , seminaked women and scripted subplots featuring rape , adultery and familial violence .
In which the candidate , her husband and children played themselves .
Also , the family yacht is named Sexy Bitch .
Well , obviously , you go for the yacht owner .
Yes , this week the Connecticut Republican Party chose Linda McMahon , the former C.E.O. of World Wrestling Entertainment , to be their Senate candidate .
Her main opponent , the former Representative Rob Simmons , packed up his war medals and went home .
“ You ca n’t argue with arithmetic , ” he told The New London Day .
The math in question is $ 50 million , the amount McMahon claimed she was prepared to spend on her campaign .
Connecticut has just under two million registered voters , so maybe she ’ll just invite everybody in the state to a nice dinner at Red Lobster .
It may come as news to mainstream media , but spreading the word is now all about networks
How do you decide whether a technological development is significant or not ?
Here 's a simple rule : if the mainstream media — as represented by , say , Daily Mail columnists — are baffled by , or contemptuous of , it then it 's probably worth paying attention to .
Twitter is the latest case study of the decision rule in action .
When it launched in July 2006 , the non-geek world greeted it with incredulity .
I mean to say , what possible use could there be for a service that let you broadcast 140 character updates on what you were doing or thinking at any given time ?
( The fact that text messaging on mobile phones had spread like wildfire despite being restricted to 160 characters seems to have eluded the mainstream sceptics .
But , hey , consistency is a puerile obsession , as Oscar Wilde famously observed ) .
So at first , Twitter was primarily a geek and early - adopter zone .
Geeks loved it because it enabled them to plug into the thoughtstream of their peers , and to seek quick and informed answers to puzzles or problems .
If you wanted to know why your new netbook was n't picking up the Wi-Fi signal , you had two options : you could Google the problem and maybe find an answer after wading through a few pages of results , or you could put out a tweet and receive an informed answer from a real human being in seconds .
Part of the genius of Twitter was that it was n't reciprocal .
So if I chose to make my tweetstream public , there was no way I could stop you from following me — unlike on Facebook where you can only become my " friend " if I agree to become yours .
Twitter 's asymmetry thus meant that one could be part of a sociable discourse without incurring the responsibilities — and the email load — that true dialogue imposes .
This had an unintended consequence which eventually triggered mainstream media interest in the service .
It turned out that some celebrities — Stephen Fry and Jonathan Ross , for example — were on Twitter and in no time at all they had many thousands of " followers " , apparently hanging on their every tweet .
Now this was something that even Jan Moir could understand :
Twitter must be just another social networking service — an anorexic version of Facebook with no pictures or videos , just 140 - character status updates .
One of the most intriguing and useful features in Twitter is the " retweet " facility .
If you see something in your tweetstream that you think might interest others , then you can click a button to make it visible to the people who are following you .
Retweeting has become so commonplace that its conventions have already been the subject of a serious study by the anthropologist Danah Boyd and her colleagues at Microsoft Research .
But it turns out that retweeting is not just interesting in terms of discourse analysis ; it's also the key to understanding why Twitter is a radically different form of social networking .
We know this because of a remarkable study conducted by some researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and published last week at a major academic conference .
They assembled a cluster of 20 PCs , collected the entire contents of Twitter for the month of July 2009 and then set their algorithms to analysing the resulting mountain of data .
One of the researchers ' conjectures concerned the number of " degrees of separation " one would expect between Twitter users .
Ever since Stanley Milgram 's famous " six degrees of separation " experiments of the 1960s in which he showed that any two people on earth were separated by at most six hops from one acquaintance to the next , studies of social networks – both offline and online – have generally confirmed that figure .
Given that only about a fifth of Twitter relationships are reciprocal , the Korean researchers conjectured that the degree of separation among Twitter users would be greater than six .
But what their data showed is exactly the opposite : the average path - length in Twitter is just over four .
If you 're not into network theory , then the difference between six and four may not seem very significant .
But if you 're interested in how news spreads around a network then it 's dynamite .
Next to traditional , few - to - many broadcasting , Twitter is the fastest way to spread news and information .
In fact , it 's the nearest thing the web has to wildfire .
And the key mechanism that enables that is retweeting .
The Korean researchers have found that this single facility generally enables any given message to reach a much bigger audience than those who are followers of the original tweet .
So the moral for those politicians out there who are thinking about the next election is : forget Facebook , think Twitter .
Smoking pot is n’t what it used to be for Joe Lee , a 62 - year - old vintage - record dealer in Rockville .
Back in the late 1960s , as an art student in Baltimore , he kept his landlord in a constant state of suspicion , with clouds of marijuana smoke poorly masked by clouds of incense .
These days , after four decades of regular use , cannabis is a smaller deal .
Lee takes a few hits every other day or so , when he wants to listen to music or laugh with a few friends on the porch .
And he ’s happy to talk about it .
“ There ’s gotten to be greater tolerance , that ’s for sure , ” said Lee , the son of one - time acting Maryland governor Blair Lee III .
“ I know literally hundreds of people my age who smoke .
They are upright citizens , good parents who are holding down jobs .
You take two or three puffs , and you ’re good to go .
I ’m not a Rastafarian ; I do n’t treat this as some holy sacrament .
But pot is fun . ”
A federal survey of Americans ’ drug use shows that Lee and his friends are not the only baby boomers approaching the age of retirement much as they departed the Age of Aquarius — with an occasional case of the munchies .
The government ’s most recent survey showed that the share of marijuana users ages 50 to 59 increased from 5.1 percent in 2002 to almost 10 percent in 2007 .
Some of those users are empty - nesters , returning to the drug decades after their pot habits gave way to raising children and building careers .
Others , like Lee , have kept using pot all along , researchers said .
“ We ’re concerned by the public health impact of this , ” said Peter Delany , who heads the office in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that conducts the survey .
Marijuana could present special problems for older users , he said , including unknown interactions with prescription drugs .
“ Doctors need to be more sensitive to it , ” he said .
“ They may ask older patients about alcohol now but not think to ask about illicit drug use . ”
But some older marijuana users say they are living evidence that smoking pot does not preclude a normal life , and more older smokers seem more comfortable than at any point since their teen years with going public — a tribute , they say , to a big boost in public tolerance of marijuana use .
Mainstreaming marijuana
In parts of California , licensed medical marijuana dispensaries have become as common as In - N - Out Burger stands .
At least 13 other states allow some form of pot use for medicinal purposes , and the Obama administration announced last month that federal prosecutors would no longer go after medical users in those states , a policy shift that activists hailed as a watershed .
Last week , in a reversal , the American Medical Association called for a review of marijuana ’s status as a Schedule 1 hard drug alongside LSD and PCP and for more study of its medicinal potential .
In May , California ’s Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , said it was “ time for a debate ” on the merits of legalizing and taxing the drug .
Nationally , support for legalization has jumped to its highest level in 40 years , up in a Gallup poll from 31 percent in 2000 to 44 percent last month .
In much of American pop culture , the taboo against smoking pot lies largely in ashes — in ubiquitous references in hip - hop music and in TV programs such as Showtime ’s “ Weeds . ”
Even iconic potheads Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong are in vogue again , back on the road with their 22 - city “ Light Up America ” comedy tour .
All of which adds up to what some commentators see as marijuana ’s steady march into the mainstream .
Conservative pundit George
Will recently declared the drug “ essentially legalized ” in California and predicted that the rest of the nation would follow suit .
That shift in atmosphere has encouraged more older users to take their pot habits public .
“ I do n’t think more people in their 50s are smoking marijuana .
I think we are just more comfortable talking about it , ” said Rick Steves , who writes travel guidebooks and hosts a public TV series on travel .
At 54 , the clean - cut guru of mass - market European tourism has begun to present himself as the hard - working , successful face of the longtime smoker .
“ Even my pastor knows I smoke pot , ” said Steves , who was recently named Lutheran activist of the year for his work on international poverty relief .
“ It ’s just not that big a deal anymore .
It ’s another recreational drug , like alcohol . ”
For Steves , the starkest sign of pot ’s growing acceptance is the annual Hempfest , which draws tens of thousands of marijuana enthusiasts each summer to a park in his home town of Seattle .
But he said he has detected a change in more straitlaced cities , including the District , which he visited last week to see his daughter at Georgetown University .
“ When I stepped out of my daughter ’s apartment , a couple of guys were passing a bong on the front stoop , ” Steves said .
“ They were n’t self - conscious at all . ”
Although young users generally go to some lengths to keep their pot use under wraps , those of a certain age — especially those not in danger of being kicked out of school or subjected to workplace drug tests — seem more likely to talk about their usage .
“ It seems the stereotype of the marijuana user as a goofy teenage boy has begun to change , ” said Shelby Sadler , 48 , a freelance editor from Rockville .
She described a wide circle of professional friends in the Washington area , many of them women , who use the drug socially .
“ They are less inclined to hide it now .
The kids are gone , and they no longer have to worry about losing their jobs because they ’re the ones doing the hiring . ”
ad_icon
Sadler , who was journalist Hunter S. Thompson ’s longtime editor and works on books with historian Douglas Brinkley , said she smokes a few times a month , usually with friends .
The only difference now , compared with when she started at Cornell University , is the clothing .
“ Then , it was Crazy Horse crewneck sweaters and oxford shirts , ” said Sadler , who is editing a history of pot by Keith Stroup , founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
“ Now I dress like Hillary Clinton . ”
Police , others disagree
Drug counselors bemoan the softening views on marijuana , saying that it complicates their efforts to steer addicts away from illicit substances .
“ It ’s more of a struggle for us when the parents just see heroin or cocaine as the dangerous drugs and sort of turn their heads with marijuana , ” said Carol Porto , who runs an inpatient drug treatment center in Calvert County .
Most Washington area police departments enforce the laws that make marijuana illegal , officials said .
A Montgomery County police spokesman would not comment other than to say that the department has seen no spike in marijuana use by older residents and is not targeting those users .
One older smoker who does n’t mind outing herself is Florence Siegel , an 88 - year - old artist from New York who has been smoking regularly since her early 50s .
That ’s when the family ’s pediatrician suggested they try marijuana together to see “ what the kids were so excited about . ”
The pediatrician did n’t feel a thing .
Siegel said she never stopped .
Now her routine is to sit in her favorite chair each evening , listen to Bach and take a few hits from one of her many pipes .
Marijuana boosts her creativity and helps with joint pain that has come with aging , she said .
Siegel smokes occasionally with her daughter Loren Siegel , 64 , a recently retired lawyer .
But does her 93 - year - old husband ever join her ?
“ Oh , no , ” she said .
“ Well , only very rarely . ”

With more than 500 general election results in out of 650 , the BBC is predicting a hung Parliament with the Tories as the largest party .
Labour cannot now win a majority , but it is not clear which party will be in a position to form a government .
Tory leader David Cameron said it was " clear that the Labour government has lost its mandate to govern " .
Gordon Brown may start coalition talks with the Lib Dems , who , Nick Clegg admitted , had a " disappointing night " .
The BBC projection suggests David Cameron 's Conservatives will have 306 seats .
If there are 10 Unionists elected in Northern Ireland then Mr Cameron might be able to command 316 - probably still slightly too few for him to be sure of winning a Queen 's Speech .
But Labour and the Lib Dems together would have 317 seats , according to the BBC figures , which even with three SDLP MPs would still leave them at 320 - again probably just a few votes short .
' Be patient ' Senior Labour figures have said that under the rules of Britain 's constitution , the sitting prime minister in a hung parliament makes the first attempt at forming a ruling coalition .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said Mr Brown had returned to Number 10 , and was going to rest and " catch his breath " adding : " We have to be patient for some time more . "
" It 's not possible to make definite claims or reach final conclusions about the outcome of the election because there are results still to come in , " he said .
" You could say the electorate have voted for change but what they have n't done is voted decisively in favour of the Conservatives . "
But shadow schools secretary Michael Gove said voters would not be " entirely happy " if Mr Brown " after a defeat like this , were to try to cling on and try to form some sort of coalition of the defeated , some sort of alliance of the dispossessed " .
In other election night news : Northern Ireland 's first minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson has been defeated in East Belfast by the Alliance party
The Greens have gained their first MP at Westminster - party leader Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavillion
Education secretary Ed Balls hung on in Morley and Outwood by just over 100 votes but former Home Secretary Charles Clarke narrowly lost to the Lib Dem candidate in Norwich South
Jacqui Smith , who stood down as home secretary over her expenses , lost her Redditch seat to the Conservative but Hazel Blears retained her seat in Salford
Labour 's Margaret Hodge beat the BNP's Nick Griffin in Barking and Dagenham , with a 5 % increase in her vote
Esther Rantzen came fourth in Luton South , which went to the Labour candidate
Lib Dem frontbencher Lembit Opik has lost his Montgomeryshire seat after suffering a 13.2 % swing to the Conservatives
There were angry scenes and calls for an inquiry after people were turned away from polling stations as long queues formed ahead of the 2200 BST voting deadline .
With most results in , the Lib Dem vote is up 0.9 % on 2005 , Labour down 6.5 % and the Conservatives up 4 % .
Turnout is running at 65.2 % , a modest increase on the 2005 general election .
' New leadership ' ELECTION 2010 : AT - A - GLANCE Brown ' proud of Labour 's record ' Labour loses mandate - Cameron Independent Richard Taylor loses seat Lembit Opik loses seat UKIP 's Farage ' to miss count '
Analysis :
What next for leaders ?
After winning his Witney seat with an increased majority , Mr Cameron said it was clear from the results announced that the country wanted " change " and that would require " new leadership " .
Promising to put the " national interest first " , Mr Cameron said he would aim to bring about " strong , stable , decisive and good government " .
Despite being on course to lose 90 Labour MPs , and with the party 's lowest share of the vote since 1983 , Gordon Brown vowed to play his part in Britain " having a strong , stable and principled government " .
After winning his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat , Mr Brown said he wanted that government to be able to lead Britain into " sustained recovery " .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said it was " reasonable and right " that parties attempted to work together to form a government in the event of a hung parliament .
' Too early '
He told BBC News : " As far as I can see , the exit poll projection suggesting that no party would win this election is being borne out .
" If indeed no party has won an absolute majority then it seems to me perfectly reasonable and right that parties should talk to each other to see if they can find common ground to establish a strong and stable government .
There 's no harm in that .
" It 's a good thing to do when the voters have clearly not embraced any of us and given us the absolute majority that we are all seeking . "
Mr Brown 's spokesman said it was " too early to say " what he would do , but sources have indicated he is ready to embark on talks aimed at piecing together a coalition .

But as he was returned as MP for Sheffield Hallam Mr Clegg - whose popularity after the live TV debates has not been reflected in votes - said : " This has obviously been a disappointing night for the Liberal Democrats . "
He said they " simply had n't achieved what we hoped " but he was " proud of the way we conducted the campaign " .
Amid speculation about whether the Lib Dems would side with Labour or the Conservatives in a hung parliament , he said politicians should not " rush into making claims or taking decisions which do n't stand the test of time " .
But he said his party would be " guided by the values and principles on which we fought this election " .
The other big story of the night has been disturbances at polling stations in some parts of the country after higher than expected turnout led to lengthy queues .
Even before Houghton and Sunderland South became the first seat to declare there were widespread reports of people being unable to vote .
There could be legal challenges from candidates who have fallen a few votes short of victory and the Electoral Commission have launched an investigation .
In Sheffield , police were called to move people on when voters staged sit -in protests after waiting hours to vote .
The city 's returning officer apologised but said he had to close the polls at 2200 BST .
Exit poll A joint BBC exit poll for the BBC / ITV / Sky suggested the Conservatives would be 21 seats short of an overall majority .
ELECTION FACTS
More than 44 million people are registered to vote in 649 constituencies .
Elections are also taking place for 164 English councils .
Polling in one constituency - Thirsk and Malton - has been delayed until 27 May because of the death of one of the candidates during the campaign Voters will choose representatives in 32 London boroughs , 36 metropolitan authorities and 20 unitary authorities Voters are also choosing mayors in Hackney , Newham , Lewisham and Watford Most counts are taking place overnight , with 20 not due to begin until after 0900 BST on Friday .
The Conservatives would have 305 MPs , up 95 on 2005 , Labour would have 255 , down 94 , and the Lib Dems 61 , down 1 .
Nationalists and others would have 29 , the survey suggests .
NOP and Mori surveyed 17,607 voters at 130 polling stations across the UK for the BBC / ITV / Sky exit poll .
All exit polls have a small margin of error which could be significant in a tight election such as this one , in which the three main Westminster parties have been so close in the opinion polls .
There could also be different voting patterns around the country .
The poll anticipates the Lib Dems will perform better in England than in either Scotland or Wales , but would still lose one MP on their 2005 tally .
Home Affairs spokesman Chris Huhne retained his marginal seat with an increased majority , but Evan Harris lost to the Conservative candidate by 200 votes in Oxford West and Abingdon .
One of the biggest swings of the election saw the party win a seat from Labour in an area hit by huge job losses in recent months .
Vera Baird , who was solicitor general under Gordon Brown , lost her Redcar seat after polling 13,741 votes compared with 18,955 for Lib Dem Ian Swales .

Ottawa , Closer than Ever to Replacing Bus Rapid Transit with Light Rail
» Could the Ottawa model of instituting bus rapid transit , then converting to light rail , inspire other cities ?
There was a time , a few years back , when talk of building bus rapid transit as a cheap precursor to train service was common .
The theory was that cities could invest in new rights - of - way for rapid transit and design guideways specifically for future light rail implementation , but only fork up enough dough to pay for the buses .
After its voters agreed in 2003 to fund a series of new rail lines , Houston ’s elected officials realized by 2007 that they would n’t be able to do so without a federal commitment — but they were n’t able to get help because of obstacles put in the way by Congressional Republicans representing the city ’s suburbs .
And so the city turned to buses , deciding to install BRT along its most promising corridors .
Though it was a second - choice solution , Houston — like many other American cities — may have looked to Ottawa as a model for BRT implementation .
Canada ’s capital has become a gold standard for bus advocates , who point to the region ’s 240,000 daily bus riders and 23 % transit share as proof that buses can work just as well as rail in encouraging people to choose public transportation to get to and from work .
Ottawa ’s several busways transport passengers quickly and relatively comfortably .
Unlike most “ BRT ” lines in North America , this city ’s are mostly grade - separated , producing actually high - speed buses .
But now Ottawa is planning to give up its primary transitway .
Houston eventually got its act together on the federal level and has turned back to light rail , forgetting the bus plans entirely .
Is the Ottawa model — raise ridership with buses , and then think about more expensive rail options — falling flat ?
What went wrong ?
The quick answer is that Ottawa was too successful , encouraging the city ’s citizens to take an average of 125 trips by public transportation a year , more than any equivalently - sized North American city .
The transitway has so many riders that it puts 2,600 daily buses onto two downtown streets , and by 2018 , the system will have literally no more capacity .
By 2030 , Ottawa would have to get a bus downtown every eighteen seconds to accommodate all of its riders — an impossible feat .
Thus for several years , the city has been considering light rail as a replacement ; a 2006 plan fell apart because it would have done nothing to increase capacity and decrease commute times as it would have relied on street - running downtown .
So Mayor Larry O’Brien and his staff have concocted what is now a C$ 2.1 billion project to run light rail in a three - kilometer tunnel under downtown .
The remainder of the 12.5 - kilometer corridor would run from Tunney ’s Pasture to Blair Station along the existing transitway , completely displacing the bus service that ’s currently there .
The 13 - station system will be designed for very high capacity , up to 25,000 riders per direction during the peak hour ( up from 10,000 today ) , thanks to platforms long enough to handle six - car trains and even platform screen doors in the underground stations .
The general plan for a downtown tunnel was approved last May by the city ’s council , and light rail was signed off as the technology in November .
It has received a C$ 600 million promise from Ontario province and is likely to receive a similar guarantee from the federal government later this year .
The project could begin construction in 2013 and open by 2018 — as long as opponents of the rail line do n’t take the mayoral seat in this fall ’s election .
Though the existing bus transitway is already in place , light rail construction will be expensive , notably because of the tunnel , which will cost C$ 735 million by itself .
Even if bus service had been chosen as the preferred technology , this expense would have been required .
But the C$ 540 million cost to convert the remaining ten kilometers of right - of - way is more surprising ; much of that will go towards the big new stations along the line , with the rest to pay for tracks and electrification .
Vehicles and a new maintenance facility will cost C$ 515 million .
With expenses like that — practically equivalent to building a new rail line from scratch — one wonders whether there was ever any fiscal advantage to using buses first along the rapidway .
Did the city lose out by not choosing rail when the transitway first opened in 1983 ?
In terms of operations costs , it almost certainly did .
Even with a nine percent increase in ridership in the first year alone , light rail is expected to allow the city to save up to C$ 100 million annually on bus drivers ’ salaries , gas consumption , and right - of - way maintenance .
By dramatically increasing the average number of passengers per vehicle thanks to long trains and by switching to clean and cheap electricity from diesel fuel , the city will find notable economies in rail .
It will also produce far fewer greenhouse gases — saving 38,000 tons by 2031 .
For passengers , though , the conversion to light rail means mixed outcomes .
The downtown tunnel will decrease trip times by fifteen minutes , principally by avoiding the congestion currently resulting from bus bunching .
But the direct service now offered to many parts of the city will be lost , as many passengers coming from areas not immediately adjacent to the rail stations will be shuttled via bus to the stops , where they will have to transfer to get downtown .
This will result in roughly 40 % of Ottawa ’s transit trips using the rail line .
During rail line construction , bus service will be seriously affected .
Had buses been retained on the transitway and been sent through the tunnel , it would have required a far more extensive tunnel because of ventilation concerns — or it would have necessitated the electrification of the bus fleet , not necessarily a cheap choice either .
So Ottawa had basically no choice but to switch to rail .
If the city gets its way , and finds the money , direct service will be extended ; light rail will replace the 10,000 daily - rider DMU O - Train as well as a number of the other current transitway routes .
A light rail loop across the river into Gatineau , Québec is also being discussed .
With the downtown tunnel built , capacity wo n’t be a problem .
But the underlying question about whether the city should have invested in BRT in the first place twenty - seven years ago returns .
Though Ottawa was much smaller then , it was larger than Edmonton , which had installed a modern light rail line in 1978 — including a downtown tunnel .
If Ottawa ’s politicians had known then that they would have to spend billions converting to rail just to keep up with capacity needs , would they have selected bus service ?
For other cities considering investing in reserved - bus corridors before light rail , Ottawa ’s may be a cautionary tale .
Savings in the short term may ultimately result in far greater expenses — especially when factoring in the high cost of bus operations .

Mohammed Al Fayed is expected to continue at Harrods in some capacity Mohammed Al Fayed has sold London department store Harrods to the Qatari royal family 's investment company for a reported £ 1.5 bn ( $ 2.3bn ) .
The Egyptian - born tycoon acquired the business in Knightsbridge following a £ 615 m takeover in 1985 .
Ken Costa , an adviser to the deal with Qatar Holdings , said Mr Al Fayed was retiring " to spend more time with his children and grandchildren " .
He will continue to promote the store in the role of honorary chairman .
But Mr Al Fayed will not be involved in running the company on a day - to - day basis .
HARRODS
The store has over one million square feet ( 90,000 sq m ) of selling space and 330 departments
The Harrods motto is Omnia Omnibus Ubique - All Things for All People , Everywhere
It was established in 1849 15 million people shop there each year
History of Harrods department store
The sale , signed in the early hours of 8 May , will include all parts of the Harrods group , including Harrods Estates and a charter aircraft service .
Qatar Holdings is the investment arm of the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund , Qatar Investment Authority .
Although it failed in a bid for Sainsbury 's in 2007 , it is the third - largest shareholder in car - maker VW and has a stake in Porsche .
Its chairman , Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al - Thani , who is also Qatar 's prime minister , said Harrods would add " much value " to its portfolio of investments and generate " good and stable returns as a business " .
He added : " It 's a historical place .
I know it 's important , not only for the British people but it is important for the tourism . "
His vice - chairman , Dr Hussain Ali Al - Abdulla , said the acquisition was a " landmark transaction " .
The pair were given a tour of the store by Mr Al Fayed before a news conference in the fourth floor Georgian Restaurant .
Mr Costa , chairman of asset managers Lazard International , who advised the Al Fayed family trust on the sale , said Qatar Holding had been " specifically chosen " by Mr Al Fayed because he believed it had the " vision and financial capacity " to support the long - term growth of the store .
" In reaching the decision to retire , he wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued , and that the team that he has built up would be encouraged to develop the foundations that he has laid , " Mr Costa added .
Reports in March had suggested that the Gulf - based investor , which works on behalf of the royal family in the Arab emirate of Qatar , had approached Mr Al Fayed about a possible deal .
However , staff were assured at the time that the store was not for sale .
Repeatedly refused Mr Al Fayed 's UK business interests include the Premiership football club Fulham FC and a recent rich list put his fortune at £ 650 m .
QATAR HOLDING
Investment arm of the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund , Qatar Investment Authority ( QIA ) Parent company 's estimated assets more than £ 40.5 bn Sold around £ 1.4bn of shares in Barclays bank last October Failed in bid for Sainsbury 's in 2007 Third - largest shareholder in car - maker VW and has stake in Porsche During the 1980s , a battle for control of the store formed part of a long - running feud between Mr Al Fayed and the late businessman Tiny Rowland .
Mr Rowland later accused his business rival of breaking into a safety deposit box stored at Harrods .
Mr Al Fayed waged a 10 - year campaign in an attempt to prove that Princess Diana and his son Dodi , who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 , were murdered in a conspiracy .
Despite living in Britain for decades , the multi-millionaire businessman has repeatedly been refused a UK passport .

NASA is working on creating a new mars rover to be launched in October 2011 called Curiosity or Mars Science Laboratory rover .
Overall , Curiosity is about the size of a small SUV .
Curiosity , will carry many different instruments such as cameras , spectrometers , radiation detectors and other instruments .
Using a radioisotope power system , Curiosity will be able to travel at an average of 98 feet per hour and is expected to last 687 Earth days while on Mars .
NASA also states Curiosity will have a new unique landing .
The rover will rely on new technological innovations , especially for landing .
The spacecraft will descend on a parachute and then , during the final seconds prior to landing , lower the upright rover on a tether to the surface , much like a sky crane .
NASA and JPL ( Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) are also allowing people to send in their name to be included on a microchip on Curiosity .
You can send you name here .
Curiosity was named by a 6th grader named Clara Ma who won a contest .
See Clara ’s winning essay here .
So , will you send your name to Mars aboard Curiosity ?

Three and a half months after a Ukrainian court convicted Stalin of genocide against the Ukrainian nation during the famine of 1932 –1933 , a new monument in honor of the Soviet dictator has been erected in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhia .
Separating the two events was this year ’s Ukrainian presidential election , in which Viktor Yushchenko , who had pursued a radically anti-Stalinist memory policy , was defeated and replaced by Viktor Yanukovych , who promised to avoid extremes and unite the nation .
Though Yanukovych would prefer to steer clear of such ostentatious nostalgia for Stalin , he is responsible for a remarkable change in mood .
In his final months in office , Yuschchenko favored an ill - considered “ trial ” against Stalin and other long - dead defendants as a way to define the history of Ukraine ’s past within the Soviet Union ; Yanukovych , by contrast , has overseen the formation of a new coalition government that includes the Communist Party of Ukraine .
Rather than simply letting his predecessor ’s strident anti-communism fade into the past , the new president has pronounced on Ukrainian history in a contrary spirit .
Thus , Yanokovych told the Council of Europe in late April that the deliberate starvation of the three million inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine by the Stalinist regime was not genocide , but rather a “ common tragedy for all people who lived in the former Soviet Union . ”
His bland formulation blurs important truths .
While it is true that Stalin ’s policy of collectivization — the state seizure of farmland and the coercive employment of peasants — brought enormous suffering throughout the USSR in the early 1930s , it is also true that Stalin made deliberate decisions about grain requisitions and livestock seizures that brought death to three million people in Ukraine who did not have to die .
Some of the very worst of the killing took place in southeastern Ukraine , where Stalin is now being celebrated and where Yanukovych has his political base .
The famine destroyed that region ’s rural society by killing many , cowing more , and permitting the immigration of people from beyond Ukraine — chiefly Russians , some of whom inherited the homes of the starved .
The cult of Stalin is thus no empty symbol in Ukraine ; it is a mark of active identification with a person who owed his mastery of Ukraine to a campaign of death .
Against this background , the new Stalin monument in Zaporizhia has disturbing implications .
Yanukovych himself would have preferred the city to have held a local referendum before erecting the monument , as has been the custom with public monuments in other Ukrainian cities .
But the district committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine in Zaporizhia proudly declared on its
Web site that the action was entirely legal .
However that may be , the monument stands .
Communism is remembered for its killing , but communists ruled and repressed by subtler methods most of the time .
In Yanukovych ’s Ukraine , other signs of the Stalinist past , less prominent but perhaps more frightening , are beginning to resurface .
As students organize protests of Yanukovych ’s policies in western and central Ukraine , the Ukrainian secret service has returned to the discredited approaches of its institutional predecessor , the Ukrainian branch of the old Soviet KGB .
Its officers now approach the rectors of universities and ask them sign statements that amount to promises of loyalty .
The premise is subtle but effective : the rectors take cognizance of the fact that students might be arrested and imprisoned .
Then , when students are arrested and imprisoned , the secret service shows the students the letter , thus breaking their trust in the university system .
The secret service keeps the letter , which also serves as an instrument of blackmail for university officials who later might think of refusing their cooperation .
What seems at first like an anodyne acceptance of police authority quickly becomes a tool to force cooperation .
These statements were the institutional basis for the effective collaboration of millions of people with the old communist regime .
They had disappeared from independent Ukraine ; now they return .
Meanwhile , the Ukrainian secret services seem to have accepted a rather surprising concession : their colleagues in Russia ’s FSB now have the open right , confirmed be an agreement between the two agencies on May 19 , to act on Ukrainian sovereign territory .
Late last year Ukraine was expelling Russian secret service officers ; now it is inviting them back .
In the Russian and the Ukrainian press , analysts speculate that the Russian officers will recruit from retired staffers and sailors of Russia ’s Black Sea Fleet .
The change coincides with debates in the Russian parliament about the “ strategic ” use of ethnic Russians beyond Russia ’s borders .
The Crimean Peninsula , where the Russian fleet docks , is the only part of Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority .
According to the treaty signed in April between Ukraine and the Russia , the Russian naval force will have the right to base at the Ukrainian port at Sevastopol until 2047 .
This makes NATO and EU membership very unlikely for Ukraine for the foreseeable future .
Thus Yanukovych takes a political argument away from his political opponents , who say that they are the ones who can lead Ukraine into western institutions .
If Russian military forces are to be stationed in Ukraine for the political lifetime of anyone now active in politics , which is what the thirty - year extension amounts to ( Russian already had basing rights until 2017 ) , it is hard to see how the conversation about joining NATO and the EU will even be possible in Kiev .
All of this represents a step backward for Ukraine , but the biggest loser — ironically — is probably Russia .
Moscow will pay for basing rights in Crimea by subsidizing natural gas in Ukraine , a gain for the Ukrainian but a loss for the Russian budget .
Moscow gets little of significance in return but the certainty of decades of headaches .
The Black Sea Fleet is an important political presence in southern Ukraine , and that is precisely the problem for Russia .
The very last thing Russia needs is to be drawn into imperial competition for Ukraine .
Russian statebuilding ( whether democratic or not ) depends precisely on the ability of Russian politicians to attend to the obvious problems within their own country , rather than creating permanent distractions for themselves and their successors abroad .
Russian civil society is also threatened by endorsement of Stalin from beyond Russia ’s borders .
The plane crash that killed Poland ’s president and ninety - five other Poles in April provoked a Russian conversation not only about the shootings of Poles at Katyn , which Polish dignitaries were coming to commemorate , but about Stalinist killing in general .
Both Putin and Medvedev have encouraged not only political commemoration of the tragedy of Katyn , but also these broader discussions .
At just such a moment , it is to be rued that viewers of Russian television watch a monument to Stalin erected in Ukraine , a land that suffered under Stalin even more than Russia itself .
Venice , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- BP working on ' parallel paths ' to stop oil gush , company says By the CNN Wire Staff
VENICE , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- BP is working " parallel paths " to fix an oil well blowout that is dumping 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico a day , the energy company 's chief operating officer said Monday .
The failure over the weekend of a four - story dome to cap the leak has led BP to move on to other options , including the use of a smaller chamber over the leak and shooting garbage into the gaping hole to try to plug the gusher , said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production .
The company also is considering placing a valve or a new blowout preventer on top of the existing one , which is not functioning , Suttles told CNN's " American Morning " program .
As the name suggests , a blowout preventer is a device that is supposed to clamp shut over a leaking wellhead .
In addition , Suttles said , BP is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow onto another pipe .
" What we 're going to do is keep developing options until we get this flow stopped , " Suttles said .
The oil spill started April 20 , after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico .
Eleven oil rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead .
The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles ( 80 km ) off the southeast coast of Louisiana , and the untapped wellhead is gushing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico .
On Friday , BP lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points .
But that plan was thwarted Saturday after ice - like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water blocked the top of the dome and made it buoyant .
BP has already built the smaller dome and it is already available , Suttles said Monday .
That device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming , Suttles said .
Methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze .
The process of stopping the gusher with garbage is called a " junk shot " or a " top kill . "
Under that procedure , debris such as shredded up tires , golf balls and similar objects would be shot under extremely high pressure into the blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak .
Work also has begun on the relief well , Suttles said Monday .
" That started about a week ago , " Suttles said .
" That work continues .
The well is at about 9,000 feet .
About 5,000 feet of that is the water depth .
Then the rest is drilling below the sea floor .
We 're slightly ahead of plan here .
These are complex tasks , but we 're making very good process . "
President Barack Obama plans to meet with Cabinet members Monday afternoon to review BP 's efforts and to review response efforts to the oil slick , the White House said Sunday .
Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline .
Thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water 's surface .
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters warned that the Mississippi Delta , Breton Sound , Chandeleur Islands and areas directly north could see oil hit the coast by Tuesday .
And scientists are analyzing tar balls found on a beach on Dauphin Island , Alabama , to determine whether they were caused by the oil spill , Coast Guard spokesman Erik Swanson said .
The tar balls are " pieces of emulsified oil " shaped like pancakes , ranging in size from dimes to golf balls , but can sometimes occur naturally , Swanson said .
The U.S. Coast Guard had tallied six oiled birds that died since the slick formed last month , Swanson said Sunday , though the cause of death is still being determined .
Four additional oiled birds have been cleaned , Swanson said .
The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil washed ashore Thursday on Louisiana 's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River .
The government has closed parts of the Gulf to fishing .
" It 's killing everybody down here , everybody is more or less getting ulcers worrying about this , and it 's something we experienced five years ago with ( Hurricane ) Katrina , " charter boat owner Tom Becker told CNN Saturday .
Federal investigators are still trying determining what caused the explosion that sunk the Deepwater Horizon , which was owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd .
BP is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $ 75 million .
But Florida Sen .
Bill Nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $ 10 billion .
" If this gusher continues for several months , it 's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it's going to get down into the loop current and that 's going to take it down the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida , and you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , to our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training , " Nelson said Sunday on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
BP already has started to pay some fishermen for lost wages , Suttles said Monday .
" We 're getting them checks , " he said .
" People go and make their claim and leave with a check .
What we 're trying to do is minimize the immediate impact .
Longer term , I 'm sure we 'll have to work that out .
" We 're moving swiftly to get these people who are predominantly displaced from working .
Get them money so they can buy their groceries and we can offset the impact until we get this thing resolved . "
Engineers are examining whether they can close a failed blowout preventer by stuffing it with trash , said Adm .
Thad Allen , the commandant of the Coast Guard .
The 48 - foot - tall , 450 - ton device sits atop the well at the heart of the Gulf oil spill and is designed to stop leaks , but it has not been working properly since the oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 and later sank .
" The next tactic is going to be something they call a junk shot , " Allen told CBS 's " Face the Nation " on Sunday .
" They 'll take a bunch of debris -- shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that -- and under very high pressure , shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
Oil company BP , the well 's owner , had attempted to lower a four - story containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of the well 's two leak points .
But that plan was thwarted Saturday after ice - like hydrate crystals , formed when gas combined with water , blocked the top of the dome and made it buoyant .
BP said it has not abandoned the dome plan .
But Doug Suttles , the company 's chief operating officer , told reporters that officials are considering the " junk shot " along with other possible solutions .
Suttles said Saturday that trying to stuff shut the blowout preventer had not yet been attempted because of possible challenges and risks .
And Allen said the approach had worked in the past , but never so deep beneath the water 's surface .
" We 're working at 5,000 feet of depth , which has never been done before , " he said .
The dome was resting on the seabed Sunday while crews tried to find a way to deal with the crystals -- a process that could take two days , Suttles told reporters Saturday .
Officials are considering heating the dome or adding methanol to dissolve the hydrates , he said .
If the hydrate problem is resolved , BP hopes to connect the dome to a drill ship and to begin sucking oil from the containment dome .
President Obama plans to meet with Cabinet members Monday afternoon to review BP 's efforts to stop the oil leak and to review response efforts to the oil slick , the White House said Sunday .
An estimated 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of crude is pouring from the well every day .
Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline , and thousands of workers and volunteers worked to skim the water 's surface .

The U.S. Coast Guard has tallied six oiled birds that have died since the slick formed last month , Swanson said Sunday , though the cause of death is still being determined .
Four additional oiled birds have been cleaned , Swanson said .
A college student in Waveland , Mississippi , e-mailed CNN pictures of thousands of dead fish she found washed up on the beach near her home Saturday .
Sabrina Bradford , a student at the University of Mississippi , identified the fish as menhaden , which are often used as bait or as meal to feed farm - raised fish .
But William Hawkins , director of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at the University of Southern Mississippi , said the dead fish are n't necessarily a result of the oil slick .
The fish could have died in a pocket of low - oxygen water or could have fallen out of a torn fishing net , he said .
The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living by fishing in the Gulf .

The explosion left 11 men presumed dead aboard the rig and caused the massive underwater gusher that the company and the federal government have been trying to cap since late April .
Suttles said Saturday that senior BP employees , including the company 's vice president for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , were on board the rig at the time of the explosion discussing its positive safety performance .
" This rig had an outstanding record , " he said .
All six BP employees on board were among the 111 people who escaped from the burning rig , Suttles said .

A north Mississippi blog is reporting that the alternative prom thrown by Itawamba School District on Friday to replace the one that was cancelled because Constance McMillen wanted to bring a female date was a sham , with only seven kids attending .
The blog alleges that those organizing the prom ( possibly in cahoots with school officials ) pulled a bait and switch and organized yet another " secret " prom to which Constance was n't invited ..
Here 's the report :
The prom the school district promised at the country club in Fulton was a ruse .
Only seven kids , Constance , and her date showed , and at the same time , everyone else held a “ real ” prom at a secret location out in the county .
This is all after the school district had represented to Judge Davidson that Constance was invited to a parent - sponsored prom to be held at Tupelo Furniture Market .
The school represented that Constance was invited in court filings , testimony , and representations by the school district and its lawyers .
In reality , Constance had not been invited , but , based on the representations by the district and its counsel , Judge Davidson denied Constance ’s request for a preliminary injunction that she could go to the prom .
The school reneged , or possibly did n’t ever intend to follow through on its representations to the court .
The parents did n’t want Constance at the prom and did n’t want to be sued ( as they told the Clarion Ledger ) , and so on Tuesday announced the cancellation of the prom .
But what they ’d done was secretly relocated it .
Shortly thereafter , the school ’s attorney announced ( on Wednesday ) that “ the prom ” was to be held at the Fulton Country Club on Friday .
But yet only seven kids showed up .
Meanwhile , there ’s a rumor that school officials were directly involved in setting up the “ fake ” prom .
If true , this is of course very disturbing news .
As of now it 's just a report , so take it as that .
I 'll follow up with any more news , reports , if any of these reports are verified .
( CNN ) -- A Lebanese man condemned to death for sorcery by a court in Saudi Arabia wo n't face beheading Friday , his lawyer said Thursday .
May El Khansa told CNN she received assurances from Lebanon 's justice minister that Ali Hussain Sibat will not be executed Friday .
But there was no indication that Sibat 's death sentence would be commuted or that he would be released , she said .
There was no immediate confirmation of the report from Lebanon 's Justice Ministry , and Saudi authorities have not responded to requests for comment on Sibat 's case .
Sibat 's wife made an emotional plea for mercy during a CNN interview Thursday , asking the kingdom 's rulers to let him come back to his country and his family . "
" All I ask is for the Saudi king and the Saudi government to show him mercy -- let him come back to his country and his family , " Samira Rahmoon said .
Sibat used to offer predictions and advice to callers on a Lebanese television network .
Sibat was arrested by Saudi Arabia 's religious police and charged with sorcery while visiting the country for an Islamic pilgrimage in May 2008 , according to May El Khansa , his attorney in Lebanon .
Saudi authorities have not disclosed details of the charge for which Sibat has been condemned and have not responded to requests for comment on the case .
" We can't understand how they could arrest him and charge him and sentence him to death , " Rahmoon said .
" It does n't make any sense . "
El Khansa said Wednesday that she had been told about the upcoming execution by a Saudi source with knowledge of the case and the proceedings .
Lebanon 's government says it has no confirmation that his execution has been set .
But Justice Minister Ibrahim Najjar said he had asked the Saudis to halt any scheduled execution and release Sibat , calling the punishment " disproportionate . "
" I have asked them not to implement any execution in this case , " he said .
" As far as I know , such an act does n't deserve such a punishment , unless there is something else -- something that I have not had the possibility to study or to examine myself . "
Rahmoon said the family has been unable to contact Sibat " for a long time . "
A law against witchcraft remains on the books in Lebanon , but is the equivalent of a misdemeanor , Najjar said .
" I respect the law of Saudi Arabia , which is based on Sharia law , " he said .
" But at the same time , I 'm very concerned about such a sentence . "
Sibat was convicted by a court in Medina and sentenced to death in November , El Khansa said .
He appealed , and his case was sent back to the trial court for reconsideration .
But the judges in Medina upheld their original verdict in March , she said .
The human rights group Amnesty International has called for Sibat 's release .
His case drew a small knot of protesters from a Lebanese youth group to the Saudi Embassy in Beirut on Thursday , and Najjar said he told his Saudi counterpart that beheading Sibat " would not be productive " to Lebanese - Saudi relations .
" I have done what I thought was responsible for the justice minister in Lebanon to do , and I said to my colleague in Saudi Arabia that such an act in Lebanon would not be sanctioned by more than two months of imprisonment , " Najjar said .

Vespa 550 MP
Well , at some point in life , any young man needs a pickup truck .
At that time , I got a wonderful Vespa 550 MP .
Manufactured in Italy in 1968 , the three - wheeler featured a one - cylinder two - stroke engine .
The incredible power of over 9 ( nine ! ) horsepower was enough to get the truck up to 37 mph -– theoretically and when going downhill .
Inside , it had a narrow bench for two people and a regular scooter handlebar equipped with two twist grips for throttle and shifting the four gears .
There was also a reversing gearbox being functional for all four gears , so if you would have been courageous enough , you could have enjoyed the full 37 mph in fourth gear backward .
I was n’t , however .
Two or three years after I bought this gem from an organic farm , I sold it to a collector – Jens Arne Maennig

Chrysler Sebring
I bought a new Sebring in 1997 .
When I got rid of it 2003 , I literally prayed .
In the interim , the ball joints failed twice ( once with a friend driving ) , a tire blew off the car while driving ( I watched it in my rearview ) , the intake plenum cracked … – James

Skoda S100
Back in 1984 , my dad bought a new car — a Skoda S100 in that very special blue color .
Two years later I got my driver ’s license and I could then drive this amazing car : 40 - something horsepower , 850 kilograms (+/- 1700 lbs. , not a great weight to power ratio ) and proudly made behind the good old Iron Curtain in ( what was then ) Czechoslovakia .
But it took me where I needed to go , it had powerful grip on snow and it was fun to drive just to see people ’s faces .

Ford Aerostar
I traded in my Ford Crown Victoria for a new car .
I really wanted a pickup , but I got a used minivan instead .
I thought , “ OK , this will work kinda like a pickup but no camper shell to buy . ”
The driver ’s window always stuck , sometimes up , sometimes down .
The fix ?
Buy a can of silicone lubricant .
The radiator hose blew .
That was $ 300 .
Then it came time for the first tune - up .
Six bucks for six spark plugs and $ 180 to install them .
Then a headlight went out .
I thought , “ No problem .
I ’ve replaced headlights before . ”
Nope — you need a $ 70 “ dealer only ” device to remove the headlight housing .
Then it started shifting badly .
“ No problem .
It ’s under warranty , ” I thought .
I took it to the shop , and they said , “ Oh , that rear end is bad , too . ”
They replaced it .
It still was n’t shifting .
Turns out the transmission was bad , too … –enyawface

This story went on , and on , and on , so we ’ve just stopped the sad tale of woe here .

Chevrolet Celebrity
I owned a poo-brown 1985 Chevy Celebrity .
After replacing the steering and giving up on the air conditioning , it developed transmission problems .
The car would go for 30 minutes , then overheat and stall out .
I would have to give it an hour to cool .
I lived in Orlando , Florida , so I would arrive at my destination a hot , sweaty mess .
I did n’t feel much like a celebrity in this car .

Chevrolet Vega
This was my second car , and even though it did n’t explode when hit like its contemporary the Pinto , it had to be the worst car ever built .
It had an aluminum ( engine ) block which cracked after it was driven for a while .
Every time I filled up with gas I would have to add one or two quarts of oil .
Whenever I visited my grandparents my grandfather would always slide a piece of cardboard under it to catch the dripping oil .
One day I was shifting into second gear and the shifter just came off into my hand .

Nash Rambler
I only owned a Nash Rambler with a push - button automatic transmission for one hour .
If you shut off the car in any gear except park or neutral you could not start the car by pressing the button from drive to park position .
I did this the first time I drove this piece of junk .
I was stranded on a dirt road , I opened the hood , pulled up the emergency brake , stepped on the gas pedal , took a long screwdriver and used it to cross the terminals on the starter .
The car started and took off down the road shrieking with smoke pouring from the wheels .
I just stood there , mouth wide open and screwdriver in hand .
After about 600 yards the car climbed an embankment , went into the woods and knocked down many small trees .
Suddenly a tow truck appeared ; the driver was having lunch , looked out his window saw everything .
I gave him the registration and walked away .

Kia Rio
Last year , my wife said that either she goes , or three of our “ junkers ” go .
I got rid of a Mercedes 240 D , a first - generation Mazda RX - 7 and a Mercedes 190 E 2.5 .
They were all in pristine condition .
She got a nice , cute little new car — a 2009 Kia Rio .
Seventy miles a day she drives , and with all the required maintenance done , the Rio has blown the head gasket and had the transmission fail twice .

Chrysler Sebring convertible
I owned a 1996 Chrysler Sebring convertible .
It was horrible .
Chrysler made it with a four - and a six - cylinder .
I had the four and it was a complete dog .
The exhaust manifold cracked , I replaced the power steering line and I replaced the fuel pump .
It would n’t start at random times , the door panels would n’t stay on even when glued with Gorilla Glue , I went through three batteries in the 2,000 miles I had it .
There was flaking paint over the entire car , the convertible top was broken , it had a smashed taillight and it got 15 to 18 mpg .
Here ’s the kicker :
When this car was in the shop ( 8 of the 15 months I had it ) , I had to drive a 1997 Plymouth Voyager minivan , baby blue .
I ’m not sure which car made me look like more of a tool .

( Editor ’s note : Yes , we know the Sebring appears on this list twice .
But c’mon .
That story is priceless .

Ford Fairmont
A 1978 Ford Fairmont was my first car , and it was horrible .
The heating core leaked , so you had to refill your car with fluid at least once a day .
If you wanted to warm the car or defrost the windshield , forget it .
Steam came out of the vents .
The steering column was crumbling where the turn signal stalk was .
The engine was a four - cylinder job .
It was so underpowered that if you wanted to speed up to 60 it would take almost 48 seconds if you were lucky .
The only thing that seemed to work was the windows because they were hand - cranked .

Iceland referendum ' to go ahead ' as talks fail
Icesave 's parent bank , Landsbanki , collapsed in 2008 Iceland has all but given up on agreeing a new deal with the UK and the Netherlands to repay more than 3.8bn euros ( $ 5.2bn ; £ 3.4 bn ) of debt .
It had hoped to avoid a referendum on the issue by agreeing a repayment plan before the weekend , but the vote is likely to go ahead on Saturday .
Opinion polls suggest Icelandic voters will reject a plan agreed last year .
A no vote could jeopardise billions of dollars of loans from the International Monetary Fund and other countries .
" The referendum is going to go ahead , " said Iceland 's Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson .
" We have been trying to resolve the matter in another fashion but time has run out . "
However , he did say that the referendum could , technically , be cancelled at any point up to Friday night .
High stakes
The UK and the Netherlands want Iceland to repay money that they paid out in compensation to customers of the Icesave online bank , which collapsed in October 2008 .
I sensed that a majority of Icelanders still supported repaying the UK , but only if the terms were fair

The three countries have been negotiating a repayments package for months .
The country 's parliament voted for a referendum on the original Icesave bill after President Olaf Ragnar Grimsson vetoed the repayment to the UK and the Netherlands .
Opponents say the repayment plan forces Icelandic taxpayers to pay for bankers ' mistakes .
The stakes are high , because Iceland needs international loans to help it rebuild its economy , which was hit particularly hard during the global downturn .
Some of these loans are conditional on Iceland repaying its international debts .
The dispute has also overshadowed Iceland 's application to join the European Union , which was submitted in July last year .

SALT LAKE CITY --
The death of 4 - year - old Ethan Stacy could bring about new legislation designed to prevent tragedies like his .
That 's exactly what came about after a similar tragedy in 2006 .
Ethan 's murder brings back memories of another horrific crime against a child .
The Shelby Andrews case
In 2006 , 10 - year - old Shelby Andrews was tortured and abused by her father and stepmother .
Ryan and Angela Andrews are now serving 15 years to life in prison for her murder .
At the time , prosecutors could not seek the death penalty against the couple because they did n't think they could prove intent to kill .
" According to the prosecutors , the gray area was to go on a capital homicide case and get the death penalty , the intent had to be murder , not the result , " said Rep. Paul Ray , R - Clinton .
Davis County prosecutors say although the Andrews did not receive a death sentence , they will likely stay in prison for the rest of their lives .
Their first parole hearings are not scheduled until 2041 .
Shelby 's Law
Shelby lived in Ray 's district .
He wanted to make sure her death was not in vain .
Any time that anyone , especially a parent , can kill a child , to me that person does n't deserve to be in society and we need to remove them from society permanently .
– Rep. Paul Ray
Ray wrote a bill that makes child abuse deaths involving reckless indifference a capital offense .
Shelby 's Law passed in 2007 .
Ethan 's case could be the first one prosecuted under that law .
" Any time that anyone , especially a parent , can kill a child , to me that person does n't deserve to be in society and we need to remove them from society permanently .
Quite honestly , I do n't think it 's up to the taxpayers to pay $ 32,000 a year in all their medical costs to take care of these people , " Ray said .
Ray says he plans to propose more legislation so cases like Shelby 's and Ethan 's do n't happen again .
He wants a so - called " rocket docket , " which speeds up the time between a death sentence and execution .
Ray also plans to look at how custody cases are handled .
" I chair a national task force on public safety , and we 're going to draft legislation that each state can take a look at and see if they can do something to prevent these types of murder too , " he said .
Friends and family call for ' Ethan 's Law '
Meanwhile , Ethan 's death may lead to a new law regarding parental custody .
Tammy Childress talks with KSL's Nicole Gonzales
Friends of Ethan 's family who live in Virginia have started contacting congressional leaders to create " Ethan 's Law . "
Tammy Childress , for one , is trying to gain support the legislation .
" If we wait , they 'll forget ; because that 's what we do .
We go on with life and people forget , and I do n't want anyone to forget , " she said .
Being from the same town of Richlands , Va. , Childress knows Joe Stacy and his son well .
The legislation she is pushing would set stricter guidelines to ensure a non-custodial parent takes proper care of their child during visitation .
In early May a court order required Joe Stacy to allow Ethan to visit his mother , Stephanie Sloop , in Layton .
In those few days , police and prosecutes say Stephanie and her husband , Nathan Sloop , abused Ethan , killed him and tried to cover it up .
Ethan's
Law would require background checks for anyone living where the child would be staying -- in this case , Nathan Sloop .
Supervised visitation would also be a key point in the law .
" When something like this happens , when there is a non-custodial parent who is wanting visitation or something of that nature ... there are things they have to do to earn that right , " Childress says .
No formal charges have been filed yet against Nathan and Stephanie Sloop .
Prosecutors are still waiting for the medical examiner to determine Ethan 's cause of death before making any decisions .
Childress also provided the beautiful final resting place for Ethan .
She gave her own burial plot to him , which is right next to her father 's grave and at the highest point of the cemetery .

The fat lady has sung .
Loud and clear .
A 2 - 1 reverse to Tottenham at White Hart Lane , our first North London Derby defeat in over a decade , has ended our hopes of winning the Premier League title .
It was always going to be difficult , it was always going to be unlikely and now , it is over .
Six points and a significant amount of goal difference stand between us and Chelsea , a gap that is simply too large to bridge with just four games remaining .
Stranger things have happened , of course , but they simply wo n’t be happening this season .
First things first I want to send my condolences to all the UK born and / or bred Arsenal supporters who will be copping flak from co-workers , friends and family for the loss to our local rivals .
It ’s going to be a long day for you and I hope you can make it through .
I can understand that there is a lot of frustration around the place at the moment .
Heck , our season has just been ended at the hands of our most hated rivals .
If there ’s a time for being frustrated then this is it .
However , I do feel we need to maintain a sense of perspective over what we have achieved this season and the very understandable factors that have prevented us from achieving more .
In many ways the reasons for our Tottenham defeat are representative of our season as a whole .
I know that using the excuse of injuries will be frowned upon by many but the quality and quantity of the players missing in this game , as well as the second - leg defeat to Barcelona a week ago , simply cannot be ignored .
All good teams have a host of key players that are ably supported by a larger group of support players .
The key players are in effect the leaders of the group , players capable of combining consistency with brilliance and as a result inspiring confidence in the support group to play without fear and to the best of their limited ability .
This season has shown our key players to be Cesc Fabregas , Robin van Persie , William Gallas , Alex Song , Andrey Arshavin and Thomas Vermaelen .
Only the latter started this game and for the period between his first - half injury and van Persie ’s unexpected introduction , we played without any of them .
Under those circumstances , against a fired - up Tottenham team shooting for fourth place in the league , it was always going to be difficult .
To put it another way : if you took Xavi , Lionel Messi , Carlos Pujol , Seydou Keita , Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique out of Barcelona and forced them to play against Valencia in the Mestalla , would you expect them to win ?
It ’s unlikely .
Without one of Cesc or Song in the middle the likes of Samir Nasri , Abou Diaby and Denilson look completely different players .
They look timid and unsure of themselves .
With Cesc and Song they look like world beaters , particularly Diaby .
It is an example of why support players need the key players around to help the team function as a whole .
Too often this season we have been denied that opportunity .
There will be people that say I am simply making excuses for another failed season , that I am avoiding the problems of squad depth and the manager ’s inexcusable decision not purchase more players .
However , the evidence suggests that Wenger has not only noted the areas where we lack depth but made steps to address them .
Sol Campbell ’s signing in the summer transfer window was made to counter a unique problem involving both Johan Djourou and Philippe Senderos that left us short of defensive options on the very eve of the season .
I have no doubt in my mind that Djourou was set for a big season with Arsenal , that he would have been rotated regularly with Gallas and Vermaelen and that the calf injuries to our first - choice pair , a result of poor man management and overplaying , would have been far less likely to occur .
However , after making it clear to Senderos that he was not wanted Djourou ’s knee played up and both options were lost .
It would have been unfair to make Senderos stay at a pivotal moment of his career and likewise , the proximity of Djourou ’s injury to the first game of the season made a replacement impossible .
In hindsight it was a horrible stroke of luck , yet one Wenger attempted to fix with the only player realistically happy to fill a short - term void ; Campbell .
Likewise Wenger ’s interest in Marouane Chamakh has indicated his understanding that for this team to function week - in , week - out with a 4 - 3 - 3 then at least three physical strikers are required to balance the load .
Ideally having two in the front three gives us the best balance of strength , speed and skill and the inevitable signing of Chamakh means we will never have to see Arshavin play up front on his own again .
An argument can be made that Chamakh should have been brought in during the summer when both van Persie and Bendtner were sidelined but this simply was n’t possible .
The Moroccan ’s current club Bordeaux were in the middle of their best ever season and were not happy to let Chamakh go for anything but big money .
For a player in the last year of his contract who could be picked up on a free at the end of the season , it would have been foolish for a club so respected for its frugality to splash unreasonable cash .
Keen observers will note that in the early part of our season our 4 - 3 - 3 formation encouraged the two wingers to apply an immense amount of pressure on the opposition ’s fullbacks , very similar to Barcelona ’s approach .
Arshavin and particularly Bendtner did this with aplomb but as the key options dropped off , so to did the ability for our players to provide that pressure and Chamakh ’s arrival will certainly provide a solution to that problem .
The ridiculous injury to Aaron Ramsey has left us unfortunately short in the middle and this is an area that does require attention for the manager .
Yet given that it occurred between the summer transfer window and the end of the season , no remedy could be found and therefore no blame could be attached to the manager .
Likewise Manuel Almunia ’s bizarre fall from grace after a season that promised so much and Lukasz Fabianski ’s inability to capitalise created a very difficult man-management problem for Wenger .
It was not one he could sort out during the season but it is one he will have the opportunity to fix during the break .
I realise this has become a bit waffly but I suppose my point is this : there have been very understandable reasons for our inability to win silverware this season and they should be considered when judging the manager and the club ’s performance .
Too many key players have been injured , a couple of very difficult man-management situations have prevented the opportunity to adequately cover the areas that have lacked depth and our goalkeepers have simply underperformed .
But on the positive side the squad appears to be playing with unity , showing a grit and togetherness that has not been apparent in previous season while the manager appears clued - in to the problems with his squad , as shown by the signings of Campbell and Chamakh .
When you combine that with the solid state of our club , the development of a whole host of players – Song , Diaby , Bendtner , Gibbs and Eboue to name a few – and the fact that we have improved on last season ’s league position there is much to remain optimistic about .
Extending our North London Derby record and winning the league title may have proved beyond us , but let ’s not lose our perspective as to what has been achieved this season .

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , who has been critical of Arizona ’s new immigration law , said Thursday he has n’t yet read the law and is going by what he ’s read in newspapers or seen on television .
Mr. Holder is conducting a review of the law , at President Obama ’s request , to see if the federal government should challenge it in court .
He said he expects he will read the law by the time his staff briefs him on their conclusions .
“ I ’ve just expressed concerns on the basis of what I ’ve heard about the law .
But I ’m not in a position to say at this point , not having read the law , not having had the chance to interact with people are doing the review , exactly what my position is , ” Mr. Holder told the House Judiciary Committee .
This weekend Mr. Holder told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” program that the Arizona law “ has the possibility of leading to racial profiling . ”
He had earlier called the law ’s passage “ unfortunate , ” and questioned whether the law was unconstitutional because it tried to assume powers that may be reserved for the federal government .
Rep .
Ted Poe , who had questioned Mr. Holder about the law , wondered how he could have those opinions if he had n’t yet read the legislation .
“ It ’s hard for me to understand how you would have concerns about something being unconstitutional if you have n’t even read the law , ” the Texas Republican told the attorney general .
The Arizona law ’s backers argue that it does n’t go beyond what federal law already allows , and they say press reports have distorted the legislation .
They point to provisions in the law that specifically rule out racial profiling as proof that it can be implemented without conflicting with civil rights .
But critics said giving police the power to stop those they suspect are in the country illegally is bound to lead to profiling .
Mr. Holder said he expects the Justice and Homeland Security departments will finish their review of the Arizona law soon .

Joseph Squires pleads guilty to buggery of both animals and sentenced to nearly two years in prison
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A 66 - year - old man was jailed today for having sex with a horse and a donkey .
Joseph Squires was sentenced to a total of 22 months , a Leicester crown court official confirmed today .
He previously pleaded guilty to buggery of a donkey between 2 February and 5 February 1999 , and buggery with a horse between 15 and 18 March 2004 .
Squires , of Leicester , also admitted charges of damaging property – relating to the two animals on the same dates .
The court spokesman said Squires had already served 126 days on remand .
A woman gives the V sign as she holds a banner reading ’ Greece is not for sale , Long Live Greece , Long Live Theodorakis ’ , during a demonstration next to the Greek embassy in Buenos Aires on May 12 , 2010 , in support of Greek trade unions , which called for a general strike against government budget cuts .
When Argentinians watch the news today and see the terrible things that are happening in Greece , we cannot but say , “ Hey !!
This is EXACTLY like Argentina in December 2001 and beginning of 2002 …! ” .
Then too , Argentina underwent its worst systemic banking , public debt and monetary collapse which led to social turmoil , mad violence , rioting , and social war .
The turmoil was so bad , that it forced then president Fernando de la Rúa ’s government to resign , especially because of his notorious pro-banker cartel economy minister , Domingo Cavallo , generating a political vacuum that led to Argentina having 5 ( five ! ! ) presidents in that terrible last week of December 2001 .
What triggered social chaos in Argentina was the attempt by president
De la Rúa to implement the grossly unjust austerity measures imposed by the IMF that required , as usual , utmost sacrifice from the people – more taxes , less social spending , “ balanced budgets ” , zero deficit spending , amongst other anti-social measures – which led to a fall of almost 40 % in Argentina ’s GDP .
Half of all Argentinians fell below the poverty line ( most were never to make it back to the traditional Argentina middle class ) , private banks were allowed to legally retain everybody ’s savings , US dollar deposits were arbitrarily changed into Pesos at whatever rate of exchange the government and bankers decided ( the dollar was devalued 300 % from one peso to the dollar , to 4 pesos the dollar in just weeks ) and yet … .
Not one bank fell !!!
Indeed , since then they ’re all back in “ business as usual ” , however the poor and impoverished are today totally out of business …
Throughout 25 years of successive caretaker governments in Argentina , the IMF - led Global Banking Cartel artificially generated a basically illegal – or at best , illegitimate – Sovereign Debt that grew so huge , that it ended up collapsing the entire financial and economic system .
That was no coincidence .
It was part of a highly complex model , engineered to control entire countries , through a cycle having sequential stages and identifiable parts that has one basic overriding goal : when the finance economy is fueled to run in an artificial “ growth mode ” , the bulk of all profits are privatized into the hands of their “ friends ” , managers and operators .
However , when the whole scheme – like all Ponzi schemes - reaches its climax and total collapse is at hand , they revert the process and then socialize all losses .
( See video “ Global Financial Collapse ” , Parts 1 and 2 , below . )
That ’s what Mr. Cavallo - a Rockefeller protégé - achieved , ensuring that the Argentine people bore all the losses , whilst the international banksters took all the profits .
The mainstream media – both global and local – willingly obliged ;
The New York Times went so far as to suggest that the entire Patagonian region ( i.e. , the 5 southern provinces of Argentina accounting for 35 % of Argentina ’s territory and having immeasurable energy , mining , foodstuff , water resource wealth ) , should secede from the rest of the country as a way of “ resolving our foreign debt woes … ”
Now , that was Argentina 2001 / 2002 but , is n’t that also the case when today ’s US taxpayer bails out Goldman Sachs , AIG , CitiCorp and GM whilst losing his house , pension and job ?
Is n’t that what is happening to Greece today ?
And Iceland ?
And the UK ?
And Ireland ?
And – anytime soon – Spain ?
Portugal ?
Italy … ?
In Argentina , our people ended up getting used to being much poorer , so when “ normal ” times returned , the Goldman Sachs and Citicorp controlled local media were able to ensure that a new puppet regime subservient to the money interests should come to power : i.e. , the husband and wife pro-banking mafia team of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner …
And the merry - go - round keeps turning and turning , whilst the Argentine people keep paying and paying …
Today , we look at Greece and see the same tell - tale signs : the IMF imposing strict austerity measures as a condition for the banks to lend more money to them ( as if a country collapsing under the burden of debt can overcome that by getting into even more debt !! ) , the mainstream media speaking vociferously on the need for “ Greece to do things correctly and responsibly ” ( as if the US FED , the Bank of England , Goldman Sachs and the US Treasury , Greenspan , Bernanke , Paulson , Brown , Geithner , Blankfein , Greenberg were examples of responsible accountability ) , local caretaker governments doing all they can on behalf of banking interests ( George Papandreou is a regular at the Bilderberg and Trilateral Commission meetings , as was Fernando de la Rúa , a founding member of the local chapter of the Council on Foreign Relations in Argentina called CARI ) , major banks such as Goldman Sachs trying to collect their pound of flesh in the midst of all the turmoil and hardship ; all of this against a backdrop of desperate citizens taking to the streets to express what is obvious to all : that international bankers and local caretaker government form a complex association of thieves and robbers .
The inevitable then occurs : the Government sends the police out to the streets to protect the bankers , themselves and New World Order power elite interests ...
Then violence flares up , people get hurt and die … .
The poor ( police ) battle against the poor ( population ) , whilst the rich look on from a safe distance with a chuckle …
Make no mistake : this is a Global Model .
Make no mistake : there is NO democracy , not even in Athens , its birthplace .
What we people suffer the world over – be it in Greece , or Argentina , or Brazil , or Indonesia , or Spain , or Iceland , or the US or the UK - is a mechanical mass vote - counting system , that is totally dependent on huge quantities of money , necessary to finance costly political campaigns , purchase radio , TV and press coverage , pay for grotesque political party structures , journalists , analysts , and of course to pay for the well - marketed candidates themselves : that vast array of decrepit stooges we read about in the papers every day : Bush , Blair , Papandreou , Obama , Clinton , Menem , Kirchner , Lula , Uribe , Sarkozy , Rodriguez Zapatero , Merkel ...
What we have is a “ democracy ” that is totally subservient to money , however we need to understand that money is NOT democratic ( nor should it be ) .
Money is controlled by the mega-Banking structure that uses the IMF , World Bank , FED , BIS , ECB as its global regulating entities , and pays to run the whole “ Democracy Show ” .
Ergo , we end up having “ the best democracy that money can buy ” ... which is no Democracy at all ...
The results of this could be tragically seen in Argentina , Turkey , Brazil , Mexico , Indonesia , yesterday ; in Greece , Iceland , the US and the UK , today ...
So , who ’s next ?
Spain ? , Italy ?
Portugal ?
Will the European Monetary System just blow up to pieces ?
A 750 Billion Euro Bail - out will send the recently born ( still in diapers ) Euro into a tailspin …
Will the European Monetary Mechanism fall apart ?
Will Germany be the first to revert to the gold old Deutsch - Mark ?
Will the collapsing Euro and the technically hyper - inflated US Dollar ( Shhh !
Do n’t say that aloud !! ) pave the way for a new , essentially private Global Currency to be managed on a planetary scale by the private money cartel of the Goldman Sach ’s , HSBC ’s , CitCorp ’s , Deutsche Bank ’s of this world ?
Stay tuned …
There is much , much more to come …
… please , try to follow these simple guidelines .
1 . Do n’t bother to format the cells
Where possible , I will not open your spreadsheet in a spreadsheet application .
If I do , it will be only to marvel at the horror , then export it as rapidly as possible to a delimited text file .
I do not care about the font , the font size or the font weight .
I do not care whether there are grid lines around the cells .
I especially do not care about cells which you have highlighted using some arbitrary ( and unexplained ) colour scheme .
2 . No multiple tables
If you include multiple “ tables ” on one sheet , separated by blank rows , there is a good chance that I will not notice them .
If you include multiple tables on multiple “ sheets ” , there is an excellent chance that I will not notice them .
3 . Be consistent
If you must use confusing , abbreviated terms for your row and column names , at least keep them consistent .
When you suddenly switch from “ Patient ID ” to “ MCO_ID ” , or from “ Tissue Bank ID ” to “ TB ID ” but leave everything else the same , I ( and my software ) assume that you ’re talking about something different .
4. Yes / No = 1/0
Would it kill you to think as hard about the type and structure of your data as the data itself ?
If your variable takes one of two values in a “ yes / no ” fashion , the best representation is 1 or 0 .
That goes for “ wt / mut ” too .
If you must use “ Y/ N ” , do n’t suddenly switch to “ Yes / No ” ( or case - sensitive variations thereof ) just because you feel like it .
5 . If it does n’t exist , it should n’t be there
Just leave the cell blank .
I do n’t want to see “ n / a ” , “ NA ” , “ ? ” , “ - ” or anything else .
6 . What belongs with what ?
Have you noticed that certain bits of your data belong with other bits ?
For example , you can take several samples from a patient and do several experiments using those samples ?
Perhaps you ’ve heard the term “ relational data ” ?
Well , that ’s what it means .
If you could find a way to highlight those relations in your spreadsheet ( no , not using coloured cells please ) , it would really help .
On second thoughts : why do n’t you come and see me before collecting your data ?
We ’ll design a database together .
You might even realise why I hate your stupid spreadsheets so much .
The unfortunate situation with my exams is the fact that revision should ( and will ) be taking up most of my time during the day .
This has meant that for the past 2 months , all of my blogging has limited by the fact that I simply do n’t have the time to put into it properly .
This will change after the 25th , but for the mean time I continue to apologise .
This lack of time means I will not be able to do a full album review of Pendulum ’s new album Immersion .
I have however selected two of the better tracks from the album for your listening pleasure .
Crush is what I would describe as a typical Pendulum tune , with their familiar ( and increasingly tedious ) drumbeat and a heavy dose of guitar riffs .
It ’s not a bad track , but the drumming has started to get on my nerves , as they have shown little deviation in style over the course of 3 studio albums .
Self vs Self features Swedish death metal band In Flames , and this track is probably my favourite from the album .
The two differing styles of music seem to compliment each other well , and it sees Pendulum stepping out from their usually generic productions .
If the album had more material like this on it then it would be fantastic .
By the way , if anyone else has listened to the album and has heard Under The Waves , please tell me you think it ’s a straight up track jacking of the High Contrast Remix of Pjanoo .

BBC Radio 4 The Report
Last week David Cameron and Nick Clegg made history when they formed a coalition government .
But the Conservative - Liberal Democrat deal was not a foregone conclusion .
Labour too were very much in the game .
Negotiating teams were locked in talks for five days For The Report on Radio 4 , Linda Pressly talked to negotiators from all three parties to find out how the deal was done .
The first meeting between the Conservative negotiators and their Liberal Democrat counterparts took place on the evening of Friday 7 May .
The Chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , was one of the Conservative team .
" We were all tired because we'd had almost no sleep , " he said .
" But we knew this was a big moment , and we got down to business pretty quickly .
" And my impression of the team Nick Clegg had assembled , " he added , " was that here were four people of serious intent who wanted to sit down and come to some kind of coalition agreement . "
But even on Friday , there was behind - the - scenes manoeuvring between the Liberal Democrats and Number 10 .
By Saturday , Gordon Brown was assembling a potential Labour team to talk to the Liberal Democrats .

Ed Balls , the former schools secretary who had only just hung on to his seat in the general election , got a call from the prime minister about a secret meeting that took place in Portcullis House that afternoon .
" It was absolutely deserted .
We went in a lift to the third floor and had an hour 's discussion with the Liberal Democrats .
" The tenor of the meeting was formal and distant , but we did n't interpret that badly , " he remembers .
" We said it would be very hard to pull this off , and although there were red lines in our manifesto we would n't cross , at the same time , if they were serious , we would be willing to support electoral reform , " said Mr Balls , who has now entered the contest to be the next Labour leader .
Not ' satisfactory '
But Andrew Stunnell - a member of the Liberal Democrat team , and now the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at Communities and Local Government - was not impressed : " It was n't a very satisfactory meeting .
I do n't think the Labour team saw it as a discussion between equals .

" They approached it as if they were Secretaries of State dealing with a minor party , " he said .
" They did n't seem to grasp the fact they were out if they did n't do a bit of serious work . "
Over the weekend and on Monday morning , although formal talks continued between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , there was a major sticking point : electoral reform .
George Osborne was very aware of this .
He thought that " if we could n't offer anything on electoral reform to the Liberal Democrats , then Nick Clegg would be in a very difficult position , because his party would expect him to deliver something .
So he would be tempted to stitch something together on the Labour side . "
During Monday , events moved fast .
The Parliamentary Liberal Democrat party asked their negotiators to talk to Labour .
Negotiations were scheduled to begin on Monday evening .
Trump card Meanwhile the Conservatives were forced on to the back foot .
The Cameron leadership team knew they had to make a substantial offer to the Liberal Democrats .
There was a meeting of the shadow cabinet , followed by one of the parliamentary Conservative Party .

Then the Conservatives played their ace - an offer of a referendum on the Alternative Vote .
That Monday evening , they got positive soundings from the Liberal Democrats on this .
George Osborne remembers that " we knew things were back on with the Liberal Democrats because we were able to make an offer on electoral reform , and although they were having formal talks with the Labour Party , actually the very serious option they were considering was a Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition . "
Meanwhile , those talks on Monday evening between Labour and the Liberal Democrats were going badly .
Treasury Chief Secretary David Laws negotiated for the Liberal Democrats Lord Adonis , the former Transport Secretary , was on the Labour team .
He thought that " what the Lib Dems were doing was going through a checklist of policy areas telling us what the Conservatives had offered and inviting us to bid higher .
" This was a Dutch auction , " he felt , " because what they were seeking to do was not to engage in a serious negotiation with us , but to get from us a set of offers which they could then go back to the Conservatives with . "
Is that what the Liberal Democrats were doing ?
David Laws , now Chief Secretary to the Treasury , was also in the meeting for the Liberal Democrats .
He argues that " half of the Labour negotiating team gave the impression of wanting things to work , half gave the impression of not being so committed , in terms of body language and response .
They seemed to be looking for problems not solutions . "
Deal
There was little improvement in the tenor of the meeting between Labour and the Liberal Democrats on Tuesday morning .
Both Liberal Democrat and Labour negotiators said they knew it was over by the end of that meeting .
By Tuesday afternoon the Liberal Democrat team were heading back to the Cabinet Office to finalise a deal with the Conservatives .
A lot of commentators thought the Liberal Democrats had done very well from the agreement .
George Osborne does not see it like that : " A coalition was a much stronger arrangement than a minority Conservative government .
And a minority government would have struggled to pass all its programme - so every single night in the House of Commons we might have been defeated on education reform or welfare reform , or deficit control which is crucial .
" As it is we get all that during this parliament , " he adds , " but we 're also going to implement some Liberal Democrat policies .

Heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio died Sunday morning after a battle with stomach cancer , his wife announced .
" Today my heart is broken , Ronnie passed away at 7:45 a.m. 16th May , " Wendy Dio said in a message posted on his official website .
Dio , 67 , followed Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath 's lead vocalist in 1979 .
" Many , many friends and family were able to say their private good - byes before he peacefully passed away , " she wrote .
" Ronnie knew how much he was loved by all . "
Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942 , Dio's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s .
His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s , when the group played heavy blues rock .
Dio's rock became darker with his band Rainbow , which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath .
Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio , including " Heaven and Hell " in 1980 , " Mob Rules " in 1981 and " Live Evil " in 1982 .
Dio left that band in 1982 , but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later .
He formed the group Dio in 1982 .
The group continued to perform until his illness .
His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards when he accepted a vocalist of the year award his work on last year 's Heaven and Hell album .
Dio appeared frail , but he was able to speak when accepting his award .
BOSTON — Nancy Gill has worked for the Postal Service for almost 23 years .
But because she is married to a woman , she cannot provide the same health benefits to her spouse that her co-workers at the post office can provide for their families .
Ms. Gill , 51 , and Marcelle Letourneau , 47 , married in Massachusetts in 2004 and are the lead plaintiffs in a suit challenging the federal law — the Defense of Marriage Act , known as DOMA — that defines marriage as being between a man and a woman .
The women , who live in Bridgewater , Mass. , are challenging the section that denies marriage - related benefits to same - sex couples , saying they are being denied equal protection under the law .
The case , filed in March 2009 , was argued Thursday in Federal District Court here before Judge Joseph L. Tauro .
It is the first major challenge to the act and is likely to end up before the Supreme Court .
Mary L. Bonauto , director of the civil rights project for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , argued on behalf of the couple and 15 other plaintiffs , calling the case “ a classic equal - protection issue . ”
I Bet I Can Find 1,000,000,000 People To Cough Up Their Privacy Posted by Pile ( 16688 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Someone wo n't friend you on Facebook and you want to stalk them , or maybe find out more personal info ?
No problem .
Due to Facebook 's new " features " , here 's a clever way to gain access to their profile as if you were their friend !
There 's been a lot of hoopla lately about Facebook 's privacy term changes , but they 've done another thing that 's pretty unorthodox .
Perhaps you 've noticed now you can no longer be a " fan " of a page ; instead you can choose to " like " it , but that 's not the only change .
If you " like " something , according to Facebook , you now have a " connection " with that page , and the page appears to have access to your profile as if they were a friend .
So the new technique to gain access to someone 's more personal information is to merely create a page that centers around some universally - agreeable topic and as soon as people " like " it , it appears to be as good as making someone a friend .
If you want to see for yourself , go to Profile in Facebook and " Edit Friends " and suddenly you will be pages listed as if they were friends .
Facebook undoubtedly gives you the ability to set more restrictive privacy levels for these groups , but by default , it all appears to be open .
The operative factor here is , every time there appears to be a Terms of Service , policy or " feature " change , it 's reasonable to expect you 'll have to wade through miles of configuration screens to restrict access you thought was limited to a small , carefully - selected group of friends .
This is n't true
Posted by Tim on 2010-05 - 10 05:06:22
Hi there , I manage a page with 6,000 + fans and I just checked : there are many fans of my page whose friend list I can not see .
The " access to your profile " that the page has is the ability to publish stories to its wall , which then show up in your newsfeed .
That 's all .
Beyond that , page administrators have the same level of access to your profile as any non-friend does ... it comes back to your privacy settings .
Applications are a different story - they allow for much greater access to profiles .
Agree with Tim
Posted by Gina on 2010-05 - 14 09:29:07
I have a fan page for our org and there is no option to see non-friend profiles .
In fact , when you click to see the pages of the people who liked / joined , it will show them as either on your regular list or give you an option to add them as a friend .
As Tim pointed out , third party applications have the ability to scope out personal information .
The fan pages do not .
I also agree with Tim
Posted by Steve T on 2010 - 05 - 14 09:46:00
Tim is correct .
The fan pages can't access yoyr info .
The applications can .
But I 'd love to know why no one in all the articles I 've read ( and not only on this site ) have never mentioned Twitter 's lack of privacy .
With Twitter you can set your tweets to private .
No problem there .
They tell you your public tweets will be seen by the public which gave me the impression seen only by the public I choose .
But Twitter does n't tell you something .
That something is TWITTER'S PUBLIC TWEETS CAN BE FOUND IN GOOGLE SEARCH .
Why ?
Twitter 's public tweets should be seen only by the Twitter public .
Why are they seen by the Google public ?
TALK ABOUT NO PRIVACY !
who cares

The Tories and Labour are both clearly on a mission .
Their rival manifestoes look uncomfortably , or comically , all too much like religious documents for the comfort of Britain 's largely agnostic electorate .
The Tories ' starchy blue " Invitation to Join the Government of Britain " reminds me of a book of trusty , well - established hymns .
One can easily imagine I Vow to Thee my Country alongside Blake 's Jerusalem , which both parties have adopted for their own faux - mystical ends even though the dissident poet would have hated this double misunderstanding of his plea for a world free for untrammelled spirits .
And , yet , if the Tory manifesto is more or less par for the course , although a bit too leftish in its message for the old party faithful ( who wants riff - raff joining in the governance of these " sceptr 'd isles " ? ) , the Labour manifesto is decidedly , even feverishly and messianically so .
From one perspective , this cover calls to mind illustrations found in The Watchtower , the Jehovah Witness house journal , in which perfect 1950s - style families picnic in Elysium fields surrounded by lions and lambs happily lying down with one another .
It 's hard , though , not to get the feeling that both parties are sending themselves up .
Labour 's image of a heroic Soviet - style family , circa 1950 , seems to be an in - house joke by someone who enjoys Private Eye 's lampoon of Gordon Brown as the Supreme Leader of a half - cock , Soviet - style state .
The cover of the Labour manifesto looks for all the world like a kind of run -of - the - socialist - mill poster , promising loyal workers , fecund farms , all - year sunshine and cities that appear like New Jerusalems over far hills crowned with a nationalised halo .
Manifestos tend to be deeply boring , if unintentionally comic , documents , especially this year when the parties have converged more than they are willing to admit to the electorate .
The plain blue wrapper of the Tory manifesto might look very different at first glance from its colourful Soviet - chic Labour counterpart , yet at heart these are two parish magazines , or songs of praise , trying – a little too hard – to persuade us of the righteousness of two unholy political parties .
In brief , both are very funny indeed , and even funnier taken as a pair .
On the night of January 18 , 2002 , 911 operators serving Ward County , North Dakota began receiving panicked phone calls from the residents of Minot , the state 's fourth largest city .
" I do n't know what it is but there was a huge , huge crash , " one caller explained .
" There 's smoke everywhere outside . "
" You need to stay calm until we can figure out what , what 's going on , " an operator told a resident .
" You need to stay in your house . "
But it was already too late for that .
" Female : My daughter ran out the front door .
Operator : She ran out ?
How old is your daughter ?
Female :
She 's twelve . . .
Is she going to die out there ?
Male : I do n't know .
Female :
You guys have to hurry please . "
What neither emergency dispatch or Minot 's residents knew yet was that a railway train transporting anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer had just derailed nearby .
It exploded and dumped almost 250,000 gallons of the compound near one of the town 's residential neighborhoods .
With electricity down , residents who smelled fumes frantically tuned their battery operated radios to KCJB AM 910 , the designated local emergency broadcast station , for news .
But to no avail .
" KCJB , and every other radio station in town , were not reporting any news or information about the anhydrous spill , " explains New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg in his gripping book Fighting for Air : The Battle to Control America 's Media .
" Instead , all six of Minot 's name - brand stations — Z94 , 97 Kicks , Mix 99.9 , The Fox Classic Rock , 91 Country , and Cars Oldies Radio — continued playing a standard menu of canned music , served up by smooth - talking DJs trading in light banter and off - color jokes while the giant toxic cloud floated into town . "
All of those licenses were owned by Clear Channel Communications , Klinenberg notes , which , upon purchasing the signals in 2000 , " replaced locally produced news , music , and talk programs with prepackaged content engineered in remote studios and transmitted to North Dakota through digital voice - tracking systems . "
The media giant has been trying to discredit Klinenberg 's account ever since .
The company even calls his and similar versions " The Minot Myth . "
" As always , the Myth begins with the same incorrect fact : KCJB ( AM ) was unmanned the night of the disaster , " Clear Channel wrote to the Federal Communications Commission on May 6 , in response to Klinenberg 's testimony at a recent FCC hearing .
" This leads to a faulty assumption : Unattended operation delayed the broadcast of emergency information .
And then an unsupported conclusion : Corporate consolidation led to the unattended operation of the station and the resulting delay in information dissemination . "
The Minot railway crash of 2002 killed one resident and forced many others to evacuate their homes for six weeks .
More than 1,000 people required medical care .
But while the incident is largely forgotten beyond the borders of that region , its memory will inform media policy for years to come .
Ironically , Clear Channel 's framing of the debate is exactly right .
Has consolidation in radio , with its emphasis on centralized remote digital studios rather than live local staffers , weakened our nation 's emergency response system ?
Are we less safe now because of what has happened to broadcast radio over the last 15 years ?
And has the proliferation of broadband devices since then really made us any more secure ?
Let 's follow Klinenberg 's version of the accident , then consider Clear Channel 's reply .
It was awful
Fighting for Air 's account of that desperate night never says that KCJB was " unmanned " during the crisis , but the book chronicles a series of failures to access Clear Channel 's stations to get out the emergency word .
According to Klinenberg , Minot dispatchers attempted to activate the government 's Emergency Alert System , which should have allowed them to take over KCJB 's broadcast and tell residents how to respond to the crisis .
But a Minot police official found " the EAS programming would dump every time we got a power surge .
So it did n't operate . "
Next authorities tried to patch in the older Emergency Broadcasting System , designed during the Cold War era , but that failed as well .
So the cops went for their next option — calling the station .
" Local authorities knew that KCJB was running with automated technology , " Fighting for Air explains , " yet they hoped that someone would be working the late shift . "
But no one answered the phone .
" We rang it and we rang it and we rang it and he never answered , " a lieutenant explained .
" We 're telling people to tune in to the radio , and they 're just getting music .
It was awful . "
Klinenberg 's narrative notes that Clear Channel subsequently insisted that somebody at its central Minot offices was " attempting to learn what was happening . "
The National Transportation and Safety Board 's Railroad Accident Report on the disaster says that at the time of the crisis , " only one person was working at the designated local emergency broadcast radio station ( KCJB - AM ) , and the police department ’s calls to the station went unanswered . "
The local TV signal was off the air .
Finally , the police tracked down KCJB broadcaster Don May , a 40 - year employee of the frequency .
May got in his car and drove through the toxic plume in the dead of night .
" When I got [ to KCJB ] all of our telephone lines and all of the lines at the police department were jammed , " he told Klinenberg .
" The fellow who was there that night had no idea what was transpiring .
He could n't call out because every time he picked up the phone there was someone on the line . "
About two hours after the derailment and spill , May went on the air to make an announcement , but " there was no way for him to update his information . "
These explanations do not properly answer " the only question that matters for the people of Minot , " Klinenberg concludes .
If there was indeed someone at Clear Channel 's Minot HQ at the moment of the ammonia spill , and calls were rapidly coming into the station with news , " why did n't that person go on the air and issue an alert ? "
Regardless
Clear Channel , in contrast , blames Minot officials for the breakdown in communications .
" The failure of specific local law enforcement officials to accept responsibility for the situation that ensued has prevented the situation from being corrected , " the company 's website insists to this day .
" Regardless of what you 've heard or read , the truth of the matter is that local law enforcement were unable to execute EAS procedures that night — they did not and could not automatically interrupt our local broadcast — as the National Weather Service has done without incident before that day and since — because , tragically local law enforcement had not installed their equipment . "
In the media outfit 's version sent to the FCC in early May , the police department had not added a proper encoder link to the " EAS system and a radio receiver they had provided to the station long ago . "
In addition , authorities transmitted their emergency alert message to the wrong frequency .
Nonetheless , through the emergency , KCJB staff " attempted to alert the public about the disaster as best it could , " Clear Channel says :
" That night , Gerald ' Jerry ' Michels , an eighteen year broadcasting veteran , worked the overnight shift at KCJB ( AM ) .
Immediately after the derailment , the station began receiving a flood of telephone calls .
Michels awaited official information via an EAS message without which he did not know exactly what had happened .
In the absence of official news , he had no information to provide the stations ' listeners .
He contacted the station 's Operations Director , Allison Bostow and its News Director , Don May to alert them to the situation .
Ms. Bostow , ( whose concern for the community compelled her to continue working from her basement despite being within the area affected by the toxic cloud ) , and Mr. May , tried calling their police contacts , but police phone lines were jammed with callers .
Finally , Lt. Kurt Smith , the Minot Police Department 's overnight shift commander , and May reached each other .
By this time , additional Clear Channel personnel ( from sales people to on - air staff ) had left the safety of their homes and joined Michels at the studio to help provide on - air information and answer the flood of incoming telephone calls to all of the Clear Channel stations in Minot , including KCJB ( AM ) . "
After the accident , Clear Channel worked with local authorities to get EAS equipment operational .
" The staff of KCJB ( AM ) should be applauded for their efforts in the early hours of January 18 , 2002 , " Clear Channel 's statement to the FCC concludes .
" KCJB ( AM ) was still the first radio station to alert the citizens of Minot to the derailment , and the dangers it posed .
If disaster again strikes the area , the KCJB ( AM ) studio will be staffed - no matter what time or what day - as it was in the early morning of January 18 , 2002 . "
More questions
We wish that Clear Channel 's answers to Klinenberg 's history sewed this issue up .
But they do n't , at least not for us .
For example : why , if KCJB was indeed Minot 's designated emergency radio station , did n't Clear Channel and the police department staff regularly test their EAS connection to make sure that it was functional ?
Why did n't the police and KCJB share a dedicated phone or mobile line , so as to avoid a busy signal ?
And why was Minot 's Christian community station , which Klinenberg reports called the police for information , not required to carry EAS gear as well ?
What good is the " community " classification if these licenses do n't take those responsibilities on ?
Most important , if Clear Channel had not owned all of Minot 's five commercial stations — if they each had been locally owned and operated — would n't it have been as much as five times more likely that first responders would have been able to reach one of them , connect to an on - air talk system , and tell the public what to do next ?
Clear Channel is n't the media behemoth it was in 2002 , when it owned well over 1,000 radio licenses , thanks to the relaxation of the FCC 's broadcast ownership rules .
Since then the company has sold quite a few of them .
And in its bid to go private , the media giant may have over borrowed to the point of collapse .
But that 's not really the issue at hand .
Here at the San Francisco chapter of the Ars Orbiting HQ , we 're waiting for our next major earthquake .
On that fateful day , our Internet wo n't be worth much if our local ISPs go down .
Our smartphones wo n't help if carrier networks overload or their transmitter towers run out of back - up power .
Ditto for cable TV , electricity - wise .
So chances are that when the Big One comes , we 'll drop our fancy mobiles , get in our cars , and fire up our AM radios .
Here 's hoping that six months later we wo n't be following debates about why we heard nothing but Rush Limbaugh and adult contemporary pop .
The War Resisters Campaign is a Canadian group that works with U.S. troops who have deserted to Canada .
Enlarge By Adrien Veczan for USA TODAY Iraq war deserter Kimberly Rivera , with one of her children , attends a war resisters support meeting in Toronto with Charlie Diamond , center , a Vietnam War objector and Phil McDowell , who went AWOL after being ordered back to Iraq under the Army 's " stop - loss " policy .
TORONTO  Patrick
Hart came here in 2005 , when he could n't face a second deployment to Iraq .
A U.S. Army sergeant with almost 10 years of active duty , he would rather stay in Canada forever than return to a war he thinks is wrong .
Hart , 36 , knows that some people think he is a traitor , but he has no regrets .
" I 've bled for my country , I 've sweated for my country , I 've cried myself to sleep for my country — which is a lot more than some people who are passing judgment on me have done , " he says .
" I would rather go sit in prison than go to Iraq . "
Deportation , court martial and prison are imminent threats to Hart and about 200 other U.S. troops seeking sanctuary in Canada .
Despite being members of an all - voluntary military , some oppose the war in Iraq so strongly they are willing to leave their country behind — much like Americans of an earlier generation who crossed the border in the 1960s and ' 70s to avoid serving in Vietnam and built new lives here .
PHOTOS : War resisters make a life in Canada VIDEO : Families share stories of U.S. Soldiers killed in action Some of the draft dodgers and deserters of the Vietnam era , most of them now graying Canadian citizens , are helping the young deserters fight legal battles and find work and housing .
" They understand , " Hart says .
In Canada today , the political climate and immigration policies are less hospitable for the new deserters than during the Vietnam era .
The conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper refuses to give asylum or refugee status to those U.S. troops seeking sanctuary here , although Parliament on Tuesday will debate a bill that would let them stay .
Charlie Diamond was 23 when he fled to Canada from Connecticut in 1968 to avoid going to Vietnam .
By then , the war was unpopular in both countries .
Americans were marching in the streets in protest and young men were burning their draft cards .
Now 64 and a Canadian , he is reciprocating for the welcome he found here .
LONGEST WAR : Stories from Afghanistan and Vietnam FAST FRIENDS : WWII vets meet in retirement home WWII VETERAN : At 85 , a high school graduate " I want my country once again to be a refuge from militarism , " says Diamond , who has joined others who refused to fight in Vietnam — they prefer the term " resisters " — in the War Resisters Support Campaign .
Canada did not support the American invasion of Iraq , and polls show that most Americans also believe the war was a mistake .
Today 's deserters enlisted " in good conscience , " Diamond says , " thinking they were defending America when in fact the whole thing was a lie . "
Young men who left the USA to avoid serving in Vietnam were widely accepted by Canadians and a network of fellow war opponents who helped them find shelter and jobs .
Under Harper , Canada 's government has tightened immigration policies , and every Iraq deserter who has applied for refugee status has been turned down .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says that " being a deserter from voluntary military service in a democracy does not , in any way , meet the … definition of a refugee . "
In March , Kenney proposed more limits : Immigration appeals for people from countries with good human rights records would be heard only by the Federal Court , ending deserters ' chances of winning in lower courts , and failed claimants would be deported in a year instead of the current four years .
Most of the Iraq war deserters in Canada are in hiding , says Michelle Robidoux , spokeswoman for the War Resisters Support Campaign .
The group is in touch with more than 40 of them .
Two others were deported , tried and sentenced to prison in the USA .
Some returned home voluntarily .
More than 50,000 Americans old enough for military service came to Canada to avoid the draft and the Vietnam War , says John Hagan , a Northwestern University sociology and law professor who was among them and wrote a 2001 book , Northern Passages , about the exodus .
About half remain in Canada today , he says , despite President Carter 's 1977 amnesty offer , which applied to draft dodgers but not deserters .
' Self - centered acts ' U.S. military officials have little sympathy for those who abandon their posts .
" Desertion places an undue burden on the unit , it sets a poor example for others , but worst of all it cuts to the very root of military virtue — mutual support and confidence , " says Air Force Col.
Kenneth
Theurer , chief of the military justice division .
Few soldiers desert or go AWOL , says Army spokesman Wayne Hall , but those who do take part in " self - centered acts that not only affect the soldier but also in a time of war may put other soldiers ' lives at risk .
Soldiers serve in an all - volunteer Army because they chose to . "
Since the Iraq war began in 2003 , the Army has convicted 693 soldiers of desertion and 2,657 of being absent without leave .
From fiscal 2003 through 2008 , the Marine Corps had 6,448 deserters .
From fiscal 2003 through March 29 the Air Force had 260 deserters .
From 2003 through the end of March , 9,869 people deserted from the Navy .
The War Resisters Support Campaign — formed when Jeremy Hinzman , an Army paratrooper , deserted in 2004 and went to Canada — raises money for deserters ' legal bills , holds rallies and collects signatures of support across the country .
It 's a deeply personal cause for many of those who refused to go to Vietnam .
Working with Iraq deserters " breaks your heart , " says Bill King , 63 , a musician and producer who came to Canada in 1968 to avoid being sent to Vietnam .
" You flash back to when you were that age . "
' Human nature question ' Jeffry House , a lawyer who represented Iraq deserters before Canada 's highest court , came here in 1970 after he was drafted for service in Vietnam .
He believes the arguments he made in court are valid : " A soldier ought not to have to participate in an illegal war , even a soldier who has joined up voluntarily . "
At their first meeting , House says , Hinzman said he joined the military because he wanted to defend his country , but called the Iraq War bogus .
" That 's a word we would have used , " House says .
" I started to think , you know what ?
This guy is right . "
Gerard Kennedy , a Member of Parliament , is the sponsor of the bill that would make U.S. troops who had a " crisis of conscience " in Iraq eligible for Canadian citizenship .
" There 's a basic moral , human nature question here , " he says .
" Do we always , under all circumstances , want our military personnel to follow orders or do they have some rights ? "
Kennedy believes most Canadians agree with him .
Non-binding resolutions urging that U.S. military deserters be allowed to stay in Canada were approved by Parliament in 2008 and 2009 .
A 2008 poll found that 64 % of Canadians favored giving deserters a chance to become permanent residents of Canada .
Toronto lawyer Alyssa Manning , who represents about 20 U.S. troops , says judges often are receptive to evidence that those who come to Canada face tougher punishment by the U.S. military when they return to the USA .
But Harper 's government , she says , is " adamantly and actively opposed to the war resisters being able to stay in Canada . "
That 's ominous news for Phil McDowell .
He joined the Army in 2001 , after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , and served in Iraq for a year .
A few weeks after he was discharged in 2006 , he was notified that he would be sent back to Iraq under the Army 's " stop - loss " policy — an involuntary extension of his active - duty service .
He rejoined his unit , but he could n't go back to Iraq .
He came to Canada instead .
It was a wrenching decision , one McDowell , 29 , at first considered " an outrageous thing to do . "
But he had soured on the Iraq war :
There were no weapons of mass destruction there , as the Bush administration had claimed , and McDowell hated the way average Iraqis were treated by coalition forces , as well as the reports of abuse of Iraqi inmates at Abu Ghraib prison by U.S. troops .
" No matter what , I was not going back to Iraq , " he says .
McDowell found the War Resisters Support Campaign online and sought its help when he arrived .
He regrets missing family weddings and funerals , but he has a job installing solar panels and says he could make his life here , even if it means never going home to Rhode Island .
He 's also " absolutely " prepared for deportation and prison , he says .
To McDowell , those who came to Canada instead of going to Vietnam are a source of reassurance that " something 's going to work out .
…
Life goes on , and they 're a good example of that . "
Kimberly Rivera feels the same way .
She went to Iraq with her Army unit in 2006 .
Three months later when she was home on leave , she decided she could n't return .
In 2007 , she came to Canada .
Rivera , 27 , who is from Mesquite , Texas , lives here with her husband , Mario , and their three children .
She has received two deportation notices ; those are being challenged in court .
Rivera says it 's hard to live with the knowledge that some people think she 's a coward .
Coming to Canada " was very , very hard .
Not only am I giving up everything that I know and love — everything — but there 's a possibility I would never be able to go back . "
If she 's forced to return , she says , " I 've prepared myself mentally to take whatever punishment they have in store for me . "
Different eras , same choices Dennis James never went back .
He was drafted in 1969 and moved to Canada when his medic training shifted to rifle drills to prepare him for deployment to Vietnam .
If he were to return , even now , he would have to report to military officials and face desertion charges , he says .
Like many Americans who stayed in Canada after Vietnam , James , 64 , says its " atmosphere of welcoming and respect for people " made him feel at home .
James is deputy clinical director of the addictions program at Toronto 's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and is not active in politics .
Even so , when he's asked whether he feels a kinship with the former U.S. troops who have come here to avoid Iraq , he replies , " I do . "
Others from the Vietnam era are helping Iraq deserters .
Tom Riley , 63 , is from Baltimore but was living here when he received his induction notice in 1970 .
He refused to report for duty .
Today , the longtime social worker feels an obligation to help troops who do n't want to fight in Iraq , and they 're eager to hear his story .
" It 's quite interesting for them to know that there was a former generation that made the same choices , " Riley says .
Carolyn Egan , 60 , president of the Toronto Steelworkers Area Council , came here in 1970 with a partner who was ducking the draft .
She believes men and women who refuse to fight in Iraq " had the courage to say no " to an unjustified war , she says .
Diamond , a Quaker who works with Toronto 's homeless , hopes his adopted country " will have the courage to do what we 've historically done . …
I see what war and violence does .
It 's made the United States a very ugly country .
I do n't want Canada to go that route . "
If Canada accepts this generation of deserters , it will be because of the efforts of Diamond and others who refused to go to Vietnam , says Jesse McLaren , 31 , a doctor who belongs to the War Resisters Support Campaign .
The older activists , he says , " add historical and moral force to the campaign . "

Tensions between North and South Korea are spiraling out of control .
The north has cut all ties , and Kim Jong - il reportedly ordered his forces to prepare to defend against attack .
Seoul continues to push for satisfaction in the U.N. Security Council after the north allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship .
State media reports that North Korea will not engage diplomatically until the south ’s President Lee Myong - bak leaves office .
Lee has backed his nation away from its so - called sunshine policy , meant to ease relations between the two Koreas .
Speaking from Beijing , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised President Lee and referred to stability on the Korean Peninsula as a “ shared responsibility ” with China .
Clinton added that “ we will work with the international community and our Chinese colleagues to fashion an effective and appropriate response ” to the crisis .
China is by far North Korea ’s biggest trading partner and , together with South Korea , accounts for most of the north ’s imports and exports .

Senior sources in the Metropolitan Police have told The Observer that members of the surveillance team who followed de Menezes into Stockwell underground station in London felt that he was not about to detonate a bomb , was not armed and was not acting suspiciously .
It was only when they were joined by armed officers that his threat was deemed so great that he was shot seven times .
Sources said that the surveillance officers wanted to detain de Menezes , but were told to hand over the operation to the firearms team .
The two teams have fallen out over the circumstances surrounding the incident , raising fresh questions about how the operation was handled .
A police source said : ' There is no way those three guys would have been on the train carriage with him [ de Menezes ] if they believed he was carrying a bomb .
Nothing he did gave the surveillance team the impression that he was carrying a device . '
Last night , Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair admitted he was told that shooting created ' a difficulty ' .
In an interview with the News of the World , Blair said that an officer came to him the day after the shooting and said the equivalent of ' Houston , we have a problem ' .
' He did n't use those words but he said " We have some difficulty here , there is a lack of connection " .
' I thought " That 's dreadful , what are we going to do about that ? " .'
The Observer can also reveal that the de Menezes family was offered £ 15,000 after the shooting .
The ex gratia payment , which does not affect legal action by the family or compensation , is a fraction of the $ 1 million ( £ 560,000 ) reported to have been offered the family .
Police yesterday denied they had made the offer , which the family has described as ' offensive ' .
Members of the firearms unit are said to be furious that de Menezes was not properly identified when he left his flat , the first problem in the chain of events that led to the Brazilian 's death .
Specialist officers with the firearms team active that day had received training in how to deal with suicide bombers .
A key element was advice that a potential bomber will detonate at the first inkling he has been identified .
They are trained to react at the first sign of any action .
The Observer now understands that seconds before the firearms team entered the tube train carriage , a member of the surveillance squad using the codename Hotel 3 moved to the doorway and shouted : ' He 's in here . '
De Menezes , in all likelihood alarmed by the activity , stood and moved towards the doorway .
He was grabbed and pushed back to his seat .
The first shots were then fired while Hotel 3 was holding him .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) is to investigate if the firearms officers , with only seconds to decide whether to shoot , mistakenly interpreted de Menezes 's movement as an aggressive act .
For the firearms officers involved in the death to avoid any legal action , they will have to state that they believed their lives and those of the passengers were in immediate danger .
Such a view is unlikely to be supported by members of the surveillance unit .
For reasons as yet unclear , members of the firearms team have yet to submit their own account of the events to the IPCC .
The two members of the team believed to have fired the fatal shots are known to have gone on holiday immediately after the shooting .
In one case , the holiday had been pre-booked , in the other the leave was authorised by Blair , who yesterday received the backing of the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke : ' I am very happy with the conduct , not only of Sir Ian Blair , but the whole Metropolitan Police in relation to this inquiry . '
Meanwhile , questions have been raised about the accuracy of the police intelligence that led to the raid on the block of flats occupied by de Menezes .
It was initially suggested that the flat was connected to the man known as Hussein Osman , who was arrested in Italy .
On the Saturday after the shooting , officers raided the flat in a high - profile operation watched by the world 's media .
As a result , a man , identified only as ' C ' , was arrested ' on suspicion of the commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism ' .
But he was released on 30 July with no charge , raising the possibility that the flats had no connection with the bombings .
The IPCC is also expected to look into selective briefings to the media over the days following the shootings .
The parents of de Menezes said they have rejected all financial offers made by the police .
' I feel hurt and offended , ' Jean 's mother , Maria Otoni de Menezes , told The Observer this weekend .
' I did n't think it was right to talk about money so soon after my son 's death . '
One document seen by The Observer and handed to the family on 1 August by the Met 's assistant deputy commissioner , John Yates , sets out a final settlement , on top of an agreement to pay repatriation and legal fees .
' The MPS offers £ 15,000 by way of compensation to you for the death of Jean Charles , ' says the document , dated 27 July .
' This ... extra gratia paymen ... means it is paid without any consideration of legal liability or responsibility . '
