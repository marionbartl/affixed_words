Thirty four ( 34 ) is the number of Legislatures from the several States necessary to call a States Convention or a Constitutional Convention .
This also known as an Article Five ( 5 ) Convention , or a Convention to Amend the U.S. Constitution .
With fifty ( 50 ) States in the U.S. Federal Compact today , thirty four ( 34 ) is the Constitutional number of legislatures from the several States needed to cross the threshold for such a convention .
Let 's look at Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution :
“ The Congress , whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose Amendments to this Constitution , or , on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States , shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments , which , in either Case , shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes , as Part of this Constitution , when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States or by Conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article ; and that no State , without its Consent , shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate . “
Thirty eight ( 38 ) is the number of legislatures from the several States that is necessary to ratify and thus amend the U.S. Constitution after such a convention .
This amendment could be “ to dissolve ” .
By “ dissolve ” I mean the whole compact between the several States .
Yes , the entire Federal Government and every thing it has or was created under it 's jurisdiction .
This would include but is not limited too , the Federal Debt , the Federal Reserve Bank , the FDIC , the Department of Education , the Department of Homeland Security , the Army , the Navy , the Air Force , the Marines , etc. etc …
Think of it as a Constitutional self destruct mechanism .
This would leave the fifty ( 50 ) several States and the numerous Federal Territories , sovereign and under their own rightful and direct jurisdiction .
Of course each State or Territory would then be free to individually or in groups engage in new compacts and trade arrangements .
That is up to them to decide at a further date .
I know this information is very powerful and the far reaching ramification of such a decision may be a little hard for the reader to grasp or understand at first glance .
I openly admit that I am not capable of understanding all the possibilities or consequences of such a decision .
That being said , please allow me to entertain some ideas that immediately come to mind .
The Federal Reserve and Federal Reserve Notes are gone .
The National Debt under the Federal Governments ' promise to pay , evaporates Of course the IRS and all Federal Taxes .
Social Security , Medicare and all that has been promised , owed or collected .
Any claim to Federal Park Lands , highways , military bases , equipment , buildings , assets of any kind inside the several States .
Any and all Federal agreements or treaties such as NATO , the UN , WTO , NAFTA , CAFTA , GAT and so on .
I invite the readers to speculate and comment on any of the challenges or possibilities that could result if such a course was taken .
I will leave you with this final thought , “ That which has been created can NOT be greater than the creator . ”
It is time for the people through their several State Governments assert their power over the Federal Government over which they created .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Sen. John Ensign of Nevada -- the latest elected officials to admit publicly to having extramarital affairs -- are flying in the face of public opinion if they expect to find Americans condoning their dalliances .
Gallup 's latest Values and Beliefs update , conducted last month , shows that 92 % of Americans say married men and women having an affair is morally wrong , garnering more opprobrium than any other moral issue tested in the poll .
Both Gov. Sanford and Sen. Ensign evinced deep regrets when they publicly announced their transgressions , and both apologized profusely for the distress their affairs had caused those around them .
The overt acknowledgement that their actions were wrong may help these politicians gain at least some sympathy from their constituents and others around the country , given the stark fact that the American public overwhelmingly sticks by the position that affairs are morally wrong .
By way of contrast , almost 6 out of 10 Americans say unmarried men and women having sexual relations is morally acceptable .
A little over half say having a baby out of wedlock is morally OK .
But casting negative moral aspersions on having an extramarital affair is nearly universal , and even exceeds ( by one point ) the percentage who say polygamy is morally wrong .
There has been little change over the last eight years in Americans ' views about married men and women having an affair .
Both Sanford and Ensign are Republicans , although there have certainly been Democratic elected officials who have admitted to straying from the marital bed in recent years , including former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards and former President Bill Clinton .
But with such a high percentage of Americans agreeing on the moral unacceptability of having an affair , there is , not surprisingly , only slight variation across party lines .
Two percent of Republicans , 5 % of independents , and 10 % of Democrats say having an affair is morally acceptable .
There is also a slight difference between men's views and women 's views on extramarital affairs ; 8 % of men say they are acceptable , compared to 3 % of women .
And despite the conventional wisdom that young Americans may be more morally libertine than those who are older , 18 - to 29 - year - olds in the Gallup survey are little different in their views on the moral acceptability of extramarital affairs than are those 30 years of age and up .
Despite the fact that Americans overwhelmingly find the recent actions of Sanford and Ensign to have been morally wrong , it is unclear at this point how much of an impact their affairs will have on their careers .
Neither has resigned from his office .
Both had been mentioned as possible presidential contenders in 2012 .
A Gallup Poll from November 2007 showed that while 54 % of Americans said it would bother them at least moderately if a presidential candidate has had an extramarital affair , another 46 % said it would bother them either " not much " or " not at all .
" Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,015 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 7 - 10 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Some car shoppers are finding that their trade - in vehicles , which qualified for a Cash for Clunkers rebate last week , do n't this week because of changes in the EPA 's fuel economy ratings .
In some cases , car buyers say , dealers are backing out of sales they 've already made because the EPA changed the fuel economy figures on their trade - in .
" My wife just received a call from the sales manager saying that our clunker does n't qualify anymore , and that we could either pay the extra $ 4,500 or return the new car ( and get our old car back ) , " Greg Straka wrote Tuesday on a message board at the Edmunds.com automotive Web site .
He had signed a document agreeing to provide additional documentation needed to process his trade - in , but had not done so yet , Straka wrote .
He had made the deal for his new car last Saturday , the day after program rules were supposed to have been finalized , Straka wrote in an e-mail to CNNMoney.com .
But the fuel economy information on the car apparently changed the next day , he said .
Straka declined to name the dealership or the specific car models involved in the disputed transaction .
Another car shopper e-mailed CNNMoney.com saying he went to the Environmental Protection Agency 's fueleconomy.gov
Web site on Saturday to double - check the fuel economy rating for his 1987 Mercury Grand Marquis .
When he had visited previously , the car 's combined city and highway fuel economy was rated at 18 miles per gallon , making it eligible for the program .
But on Saturday , he found something different :
The fuel economy for his car had been raised to 19 mpg -- one mile per gallon over the maximum fuel - efficiency allowed under the Car Allowance Rebate System ( aka Cash for Clunkers ) .
As a result , he became ineligible for a trade - in credit worth up to $ 4,500 .
Even though the program 's basic requirements have been known since it was created by Congress earlier this year , Cash for Clunkers did n't become official until Friday .
So as part of the official launch , the EPA conducted " quality assurance and quality control effort regarding fuel economy calculations on more than 30,000 vehicle model types spanning the past 25 years , " according to an e-mail sent by EPA spokesman Dale Kemery .
As a result , 86 car models became newly eligible for the program .
However , 78 models became ineligible , EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourne said in a statement released Tuesday night .
The EPA completed its changes by the time the rules were finalized on Friday , Milbourne said .
The updates , which involved calculating average fuel economy out to four decimal places , were required by the legislation , she said .
Car shoppers have been posting comments on various Internet message boards , including several at the automotive Web site Edmunds.com , describing their frustration with the changes .
The owners of a 1993 Camry V6 wagon , a 1995 Saab 900S and a 1988 Toyota 4 Runner all describe their vehicles becoming suddenly ineligible for the program around the time the rules officially went into effect .
Consumers who believe their eligibility may have been hurt by EPA 's changes should contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which administers Cash For Clunkers .
" They should call our attention to it , " said Rae Tyson , spokesman for the NHTSA .
He did not promise , however , that the agency would bend the rules .
Cash for Clunkers benefits are retroactive to July 1 , so dealers have been able to make deals since that date .
But they had to wait until Friday to file for their reimbursement checks .
Hyundai Motor America has been helping its dealers close Cash for Clunkers deals since July 1 by providing them with cash advances equal to the expected CARS rebate , a Hyundai spokesman said .
As of Friday , about 14 % of Hyundai sales were Cash for Clunker deals , according to the automaker .
Last month , Hyundai sold about 38,000 cars .
It is unclear if any of Hyundai 's deals so far were made ineligible by the changes , said Hyundai spokesman Phil Leinert , or how the automaker might deal with situations in which a car 's eligibility changed .
Brian Benstock , owner of Paragon Honda in New York City , said he 's done 33 Cash for Clunkers deals since July 1 .
So far , he said , he has had no problems because of altered fuel economy numbers .
" Fortunately , most of our customers were n't on the edge , " he said .
The average fuel economy of his Clunker trade - ins has been about 16 mpg , he said .
Dealers who entered into agreements with customers before last Friday , based on a fuel economy figure listed at fueleconomy .gov , have only themselves to blame , said Tyson .
" We made it very clear that they would be holding themselves out to some risk if they consummate a deal before the program officially begins , " Tyson said .
BEIRUT , Lebanon 
A day after Iranian authorities began a mass trial of more than 100 government opponents , state television broadcast a chilling segment in which two defendants  both prominent reform figures  said they had “ changed ” since being arrested , and disputed widespread claims that their publicized confessions had been coerced through torture .
The segment was broadcast shortly after a Tehran prosecutor , Saeed Mortazavi , who is running the trials , released a statement warning that anyone criticizing the trial as illegitimate , as many opposition figures have done , would also be prosecuted .
The two steps reflected an intensified effort to intimidate Iran ’s opposition movement before President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is inaugurated for a second term on Wednesday .
Opposition supporters maintain that his landslide victory in the June 12 elections was rigged .
Some senior reformist figures have hinted they will boycott the inauguration , or the ceremony Monday in which Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is to confirm Mr. Ahmadinejad as president .
She was the intern whose secret was kept for 40 years and he was the president who did n’t confine his affairs to a side room off the Oval Office .
But now Mimi Beardsley Alford , a retired New York church administrator , who as a teenager had an 18 - month sexual relationship with President John F Kennedy , has finally decided to tell the story of those White House days and the impact the revelation of the affair four decades later has had on her life .
The relationship was exposed in 2003 in a biography of Kennedy that included a reference to JFK ’s involvement with a Mimi Beardsley .
She had not even told her parents or children of the affair .
A New York newspaper found that Beardsley Alford had married , changed her name , divorced and was working for a Presbyterian church .
After the revelations Beardsley Alford said no more than to confirm that she was “ involved in a sexual relationship ” with the president from June 1962 .
But her agent , Mark Reiter , told the New York Times that she is now writing her own account of the relationship , in a book called Once Upon a Secret , to be published by Random House .
“ As she thought about it , she said : ‘ This is a story that I ’d like to take control of , rather than have somebody else tell my side of it , ' ” he said .
Reiter said Beardsley Alford would not be serving up salacious details of the affair .
“ She ’s just not that type of person where she ’s going to spill her guts about intimate stuff for the whole country to see , ” he said .
“ The story has three acts to it : before the White House , during the White House , and then the really powerful part is what happens afterwards .
What ’s the impact on your family life , your marriage , knowing that this happened to you in your early life and you have chosen to keep it a secret ? ”

Even though the prurient minds of professional moralists would have exploded across the landscape , the point is made that serious journalists did n’t consider bedroom stories worth reporting about in comparison to the end - of - the - world politics in play at the time .

DAMASCUS --
The chief of Palestinian militant group Hamas said his organization is prepared to cooperate with the U.S. in promoting a peaceful resolution to the Arab - Israeli conflict if the White House can secure an Israeli settlement freeze and a lifting of the economic and military blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Khaled Meshaal , 53 years old , said in a 90 - minute interview at Hamas 's Syrian headquarters that his political party and military wing would commit to an immediate reciprocal cease - fire with Israel , as well as a prisoner ...
Bill O'Reilly pens ode to Obama ( seriously )
Fox News 's Bill O'Reilly , a frequent critic of President Obama , has written an unexpected and glowing tribute to the president 's character for this Sunday 's Parade magazine .
Under a headline of " What President Obama Can Teach America 's Kids , " the conservative talk show host cites examples from Obama 's at - times difficult past to demonstrate how children can overcome adversity and illuminate what an inspiration the president is .
O'Reilly says Obama 's " breathtaking achievement presents five important lessons for all children : " Forgiveness , Respect , Persistence , and the notion that in America anything is possible .
In doing so , O'Reilly uses language that could have come out of the president 's campaign talking points .
Under the Persistence category , O'Reilly notes : " For example , in 2000 , he lost his run for Congress in Illinois .
He could have given up and gone into the private sector where high - salaried jobs awaited him .
But he preferred public service .
So , just four years later , he ran again , this time winning a U.S. Senate seat . "
O'Reilly stays away from Obama 's policies in the essay , but writes admiringly that he 's already established himself as a historical figure .
" Barack Obama , a youngster in Hawaii without his parents around , has toughed it out and become one of history ’s great stories , no matter what happens going forward , " he writes at the end .
" What he has achieved in his 48 years is simply astounding .
Consider the odds .
The United States is a nation of more than 300 million citizens .
Only one person is currently the Commander in Chief .
That man had no fatherly guidance , is of mixed race , and had no family connections to guide him into the world of national politics .
That adds up to one simple truth that every American child should be told : “ If Barack Obama
can become the President of the United States , then whatever dream you may have can happen in your life . "
They are considered risque dens of iniquity and have been bombed simply for providing a place where men and women can ( gasp ) talk to each other .
Fruit juice bars may seem an unusual front line in Pakistan ’s war on Islamic militancy , but many of their owners feel deserving of combat pay these days for serving up cold smoothies .
Although there have n’t been any attacks for several months , fears linger and many people say they ’re aware that violence could come at any time .
Attacks on fresh juice bars in Lahore late last year centered on the Garhi Shahu neighborhood , where bearded men crouched on low stools in front of small shops gossip , gulp down sweet tea and launch tobacco clouds skyward from communal hookahs .
It ’s also a part of Lahore where many Afghans and Uzbeks have settled , residents say , creating a subculture of Islamic fundamentalism in a historically more tolerant city .

Anti-Taliban cleric Sarfraz Naeemi was killed in the neighborhood last month by a suicide bomber .
Navigating through a jumble of parked motorcycles brings you to Dasko Juice , decorated with dusty , low - hanging fruit of the plastic variety , a picture of London ’s Tower Bridge and pyramids of canned orange juice .
The reason Dasko was among those attacked with bombs late last year is six booths in an adjoining room , some of which have small curtains for privacy , where men and women can chat discreetly .
“ Basically it ’s just a place where girls and boys come and drink juice , ” says Mohammed Naeem , Dasko ’s owner , dressed in a shalwar kameez , the traditional loose - fitting pants and long shirt .
“ These people try and portray us as immoral , but it ’s not true .
They ’re just sitting and talking , but that ’s a threat to them . ”

As he speaks , a woman dressed in a burka enters with a male companion .
She looks embarrassed at the presence of a foreigner and immediately leaves .
In one of the two booths without a curtain , businessman Mohammed Yasim , 45 , sits talking with a woman in a head scarf .
Asked whether it ’s a sensitive issue to be seen here with a female companion , he gets visibly irritated .
“ She ’s my sister , she ’s my sister , ” he blurts out .
“ We ’re only talking family business . ”
The coordinated attacks on Dasko and several competitors -- part of a chain of neighborhood threats and violence targeting cinemas , DVD stores and barbershops -- started about 10 one night in October with an explosion at the Chino Juice Corner down the street that some initially thought was a gas cylinder blowing up .
One person died and several were injured .
Chino is now out of business .

Minutes later , an explosion was heard at the nearby Al Rehman juice bar , followed by the bomb at Dasko , left on the wall of an empty shop next door .
The blast blew apart the wall , destroying booths and causing other damage .
The operators received no warnings , although posters in the neighborhood had been prodding people for months to end their sinful ways and one of the other juice bars had been ordered to stop letting boys and girls “ indulge in immoral acts ” on its property .
“ We never knew who placed the bombs , ” says Khuram Butt , a waiter .
“ Fortunately the one that hit us was relatively small and seemed to be aimed more at scaring than killing . ”
An adjoining shop that sold DVDs suffered collateral damage of sorts .

“ The militants also hate DVDs , so I got very scared and switched to selling clothes , ” says Abdul Kalam , his window decorated with five pairs of dusty jeans and three handwritten signs seeking someone to take over his lease .
“ I probably lost $ 7,000 and make no money at this , all because of fear . ”
Juice bars , a feature in many Pakistani cities , seem a reasonable way for many lower middle - class young people to relax .
“ It ’s something to do and it does n’t cost much , maybe 70 cents , ” says Zulqernain Tahir , a reporter in Lahore with the newspaper Dawn .
“ These attacks are very unfortunate . ”
Most of the stores probably have been targets of opportunity , analysts say .

“ It ’s really a matter of conveniently hitting people , ” says Mohammed Jawwad , an assistant professor of psychology at Lahore ’s University of the Punjab .
“ Basically they do n’t like coed gathering , even though coed gatherings are a part of Islam , including the hajj itself .
There ’s a real narrowness of thinking . ”
Dasko ’s sales fell after the explosion .
But without another juice bar attack in several months , business has begun to increase .
The staff has stepped up security , proudly displaying a “ Super Scanner ” brand metal detector wand , although its use seems a bit random .
“ I could tell you were n’t dangerous so I did n’t use it on you , ” Butt , the waiter , says to a Westerner .
“ You did n’t seem to be carrying anything . ”

The staff says it ’s now keeping a closer eye on customers leaving bags behind and keeps only one door open to better monitor those entering .
It has also put up some new drywall and repaired decorative arches damaged by the blast .
“ They were trying to stop our way of life , ” says Naeem , the owner .
“ Sure , it ’s dangerous to stay in this business , but what can we do .
We have no other way of making a living . ”

What is the class of 2006 worth ?
Around this time last year , I tried to estimate the kind of contracts the big name players from the class of 2004 and 2005 would sign , and here ’s how I fared :
All in all , I think I did a pretty good job .
Of the 12 players that signed a contract last summer , I correctly predicted the range for seven and was within $ 1.5 million for the other five .
Granted , I underestimated what the Lakers would give Vujacic , but I find him so annoying that I have a tough time objectively determining his worth .
( Though it should be noted that he did n’t do anything this season to justify $ 5.0 million per season . )
This year , I ’m going to list the top names from the class of ’ 06 to try to determine what kind of extension they ’ll get if their current teams choose to lock them up this summer instead of letting them hit restricted free agency in 2010 .
( I ’ll tackle the restricted free agents of the class of ’05 in my free agency preview , which will run on 6/29 . )
Due to the economy and the unwillingness of most owners to spend , the summer of 2009 promises to be tougher for free agents than years past , so we may see a few players stubbornness get the best of them .
One executive predicted a “ nuclear winter ” of sorts , so at the very least , it will be interesting .
So here are the top players from the class of ’06 and my best estimate of the kind of money they ’ll command .
I ’ll list their age , Player Efficiency Rating ( PER ) , along with a few comparables .
Brandon Roy , G , Blazers
Age : 24
PER : 24.08
Comparables : Kobe Bryant ( $ 23.0 M ) , Dwyane Wade ( $ 15.8 M )
The Blazers hit a home run with Roy .
In his third season , he averaged 22.6 points , 5.1 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game .
Moreover , he did it efficiently , shooting a stellar 48 % from the field , 38 % from long range and 82 % from the line .
Simply stated , he is one of the league ’s best all - around players .
I ’d be shocked if the Blazers did n’t offer him a max contract , though he may elect to sign a shorter three - or four - year deal ( like LeBron and Wade did ) to give him more flexibility in the future .
( Just to throw a little salt in the wounds , the Bobcats , Bulls , Hawks and Celtics all had a shot at Roy on the night of the draft and passed . )
Value : $ 14.5 M – $ 15.5 M per year , depending on the salary cap
LaMarcus Aldridge , PF , Blazers
Age : 23
PER : 19.13
Comparables : Antawn Jamison ( $ 13.4 M ) , David West ( $ 9.0 M ) , Amare Stoudemire ( $ 17.0 M )
The Blazers hit another home run with Aldridge .
In his third season , the smooth shooting power forward averaged 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds while shooting 48 % from the floor .
I seriously doubt Portland will be able to get him to sign a West - type deal .
He ’s going to command more than that , though it ’s pretty clear that he ’s not a “ franchise ” player , so he probably wo n’t get a max contract .
Value : $ 13.0 M – $ 14.0 M per year
Rajon Rondo , PG , Celtics
Age : 23
PER : 18.90
Comparables : Jameer Nelson ( $ 7.7 M ) , Chauncey Billups ( $ 12.0 M ) , Jose Calderon ( $ 8.0 M ) , Devin Harris ( $ 8.8 M )
It ’s going to be interesting to see if Rondo and the Celtics will be able to come to terms on an extension this summer .
He ’s a great guard , and has improved in his biggest area of weakness ( shooting ) , but he has a reputation for being a pain in the ass .
The C’s can argue that Rondo thrived playing alongside three All - Stars , while Rondo ’s camp can point to his playoff stats — 16.9 ppg , 9.8 apg , 9.7 rpg — as proof of what he can do as one of the main cogs in the offense .
I think he ’ll get a little more than Harris but not as much as Billups .
Value : $ 9.0 M – $ 10.0 M per year
Rudy Gay , SF , Grizzlies
Age : 22
PER : 15.38
Comparables : Tayshaun Prince ( $ 10.8 M ) , Richard Jefferson ( $ 14.7 M ) , Corey Maggette ( $ 9.6 M ) , Luol Deng ( $ 11.9 M )
Gay ’s value is a little tough to pin down .
He posted good numbers on a bad team , but was n’t terribly efficient in his play , as evidenced by his just - above - average PER .
He can score ( 18.9 ppg ) and his rebounding ( 5.5 rpg ) is decent , but he ’s not a playmaker ( 1.7 apg , 0.7 A / TO ratio ) .
I would n’t be surprised if he and the Grizzlies find themselves miles apart when they sit down at the negotiation table .
I think he ’s more valuable than Maggette , but does n’t have the reputation of Deng .
However , both of those contracts seem quite high at this point , so I ’d estimate Gay ’s value at or below Maggette’s .
Value : $ 8.0 M – $ 9.0 M per year
Andrea Bargnani , FC , Raptors
Age : 23
PER : 14.66
Comparables : Tim Thomas ( $ 6.5 M ) , Nenad Krstic ( $ 5.4 M )
After a pretty disastrous sophomore season ( 39 % from the field ) , Bargnani bounced back and posted decent offensive numbers in 2008 - 09 .
He averaged 15.4 points and shot almost 41 % from long range .
His rebounding ( 5.3 ) is pretty bad for a seven - footer , and has a reputation of being a mediocre to poor defender .
Both areas should improve as he gets stronger , but he ’s a long way from becoming the next Dirk Nowitzki .
Like Thomas , I think the Raptors will wait to see how Bargnani develops in his fourth season before committing to a long term deal .
Even then , he ’ll probably just sign a three - year deal so that he can sign another contract at 27 , when he ( hopefully ) reaches his potential .
Value : $ 7.0 M – $ 8.0 M per season
Ronnie Brewer , SG , Jazz
Age : 24
PER : 16.19
Comparables : Jamal Crawford ( $ 9.8 M ) , Delonte West ( $ 4.4 M ) , Tayshaun Prince ( $ 10.8 M ) , Shane Battier ( $ 7.1 M )
Brewer is known more for his defense , but he ’s a capable scorer ( 13.7 ppg , 51 % FG % ) , who gets his points on layups and putbacks .
His three point shot is still shaky ( 26 % ) , but it ’s improving , and he only takes about one per game .
He ’s an athlete with a 6 ’ 11 ” wingspan , and the Jazz need his defense if they hope to get past Kobe and Co. in the postseason anytime soon .
He ’s not the stopper that Prince or Battier is , but he ’s better offensively than Battier , at least from a scoring standpoint .
Value : $ 6.0 M – $ 7.0 M per year
Tyrus Thomas , F , Bulls
Age : 22
PER : 15.95
Comparables : Al Harrington ( $ 10.0 M ) , Jason Maxiell ( $ 5.0 M )
Thomas is an athletic freak who has improved his skill set in his first three seasons .
He now has a pretty dependable shot out to about 18 - feet , and he ’s a terrific shot blocker on the other end of the court .
His third - year averages of 10.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in 27.5 minutes are pretty solid , but his field goal percentage ( 45 % ) is low for a forward .
This is mostly due to a lack of finishing ability , which is surprising considering his overall athleticism .
I think the Bulls are going to want to see how he develops for another season before signing him to an extension , as I ’m guessing that the franchise and his camp are miles apart on his true value .
Value : $ 6.0 M – $ 7.0 M per year
One key to motivating people is understanding what drives them .
In western culture individual needs dominate and other forces take a back seat .
Group needs are more important in many other cultures , including Māori , indigenous Australians and Pacific Islanders .
People from these cultures put tribal or family needs before their own .
Second generation immigrants from these backgrounds can follow either pattern – or both at once .
Abraham Maslow studied human driving forces and developed the ‘ hierarchy of needs ‘ .
Maslow ’s hierarchy of needs lists human drivers in order of relative importance .
Stronger , instinctive , more animal - like drivers sit at the bottom of the hierarchy .
The top of the list has weaker , but more advanced , human needs .
The list ordered from bottom to top :
Physiological
This covers basic needs like breathing , getting enough food , finding a place of shelter , keeping warm and dealing with bodily functions ( including sexual gratification ) .
In crude terms , you ca n’t progress up the hierarchy if you ca n’t breath or you are freezing to death .
Safety
People need to feel safe from physical danger .
They also need physical , mental and emotional security .
They get out of the firing line before dealing with higher needs .
Social
Everybody , even those who say otherwise , needs human contact and love .
They also need to belong to social groups such as families , organisations , groups and gangs .
Esteem
The feelings of self - worth and self - reliance .
People have a deep - rooted desire for recognition by others in terms of respect , praise and status .
The flip side of this is people often have low self - esteem or an inferiority complex .
Maslow says because just about everyone in the western world has the bottom three bases covered , the esteem driver lies at the root of most psychological problems .
By extension we can see this is the key to many interpersonal relationships in the workplace .
Maslow on self - actualisation
The highest need a person can have is to meet their full potential and maximise their personal development .
Maslow says people generally move up the hierarchy ; progressing up the list is the essence of motivation .
Once people have enough to eat , they start to look around for physical safety .
Once they have esteem they move towards self - actualisation .
On the other hand if something threatens a person ’s more basic needs , they will move down the hierarchy to the level necessary to protect that need .
For instance , people trade self - esteem in return for belonging to a social group .
They take great risks with personal safety and do n’t care about esteem if they face starvation .
Not everyone agrees with Maslow ’s hierarchy , it is controversial .
Despite the criticisms it makes a great practical tool for managers .
If you are managing someone and you threaten his or her security in some way , you can expect a strong reaction .
People go a long way to defend themselves from threats .
On the other side of the ledger , Maslow says once a person has taken care of a particular need on the list , it ceases to be a motivating force and they progress to the next level .

Dream Life – Live Dream
What a challenge in a western society !
Right from a very early age we are being told off for dreaming .
It is considered to be of no value for our development and becoming established in life later on .
We are step by step deprived by our powerful , given way of creating , as a dream is a high incentive to focus on ideas which in turn will make us take action to bring them to life .
A dream is a vision and visions come in when a person connects with the higher spheres and is open for input .
The majority of adults will need help with re-collecting their dreams .
Team work in programs like the Mental Cleanse offered by Michael Dloughy are very effective when it comes to removing old and inadequate programming from our minds .
Old programming like : do n’t do this and do n’t do that , be careful this is dangerous , watch our what your friends are saying , or even worse the manifold superstitions we get imprinted on us by the well meaning people around us to name only a small list of them , is highly inhibiting when it comes to dreaming life – day dreaming and as such boosting creativity .
It is this fear which was built up over the years through the conditioning we received which needs to be acknowledged and removed from within us .
Since these things have sunk in deep as a rule – so deep in many cases that people need to actually dig them out from very deep within , ongoing teamwork is the most efficient way to also help stabilise the new found freedom of mind .
Dreams like happy children , a relaxed atmosphere at home , having a secure income without having to commute to work , a home business , the freedom to decide what to work , when to work and with whom to work , the chance to make others succeed – people need courage to bring all this to the surface , to as a next step express it and bring it to life .
It is this bringing to life which again requires the loving support of a mastermind group to compensate for the raging storm in our environment – again those loving people close to us and also buddies at work and in many places who may ridicule us for what we have found to be our dream , our goal .
The team gives support and a “ home ” where to mix with like minded friends who have to face same or similar issues and eventually we grow enough that we spread our wings and proudly “ live our dream ” !

Your Dream Facilitator
Looks like the deathers got to Johnny Isakson , the Georgia Republican who authored Senate legislation providing Medicare coverage for end - of - life planning .
Yesterday , Isakson slammed deather claims about the House bill :
I just had a phone call where someone said Sarah Palin 's web site had talked about the House bill having death panels on it where people would be euthanized .
How someone could take an end of life directive or a living will as that is nuts .
You 're putting the authority in the individual rather than the government .
I do n't know how that got so mixed up .
Today , after President Obama pointed to Isakson 's comments while refuting deather claims such as Sarah Palin 's imaginary " death panels , " Isakson went ballistic , releasing a statement from his office :
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , today denounced comments made by President Obama and his spokesman regarding Isakson ’s alleged connection to language contained in the House health care bill on " end - of - life counseling . "
Isakson vehemently opposes the House and Senate health care bills and he played no role in drafting language added to the House bill by House Democrats calling for the government to incentivize doctors by offering them money to conduct " end-of - life counseling " with Medicare patients every five years .
In the statement , Isakson himself bent over backwards to please the deathers :
" The House provision is merely another ill - advised attempt at more government mandates , more government intrusion , and more government involvement in what should be an individual choice . "
It 's yet another example that if you 're a Republican and you criticize Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck teabaggers birthers deathers , there 's only one thing you can do if you want to stay in the party : you flip - flop as fast as you can .
Update ( 5:04 PM ) : John Cole wraps it up nicely :
Jerzy Buzek , a Polish Lutheran who has become the first president of the European Parliament from a post - communist eastern European country , says he wants to deepen dialogue with the continent 's Christian churches - writes Jonathan Luxmoore .
" The principles associated with the whole tradition , culture and , above all , faith of Christianity have fundamental importance for me , as well as for Europe 's future identity and development , " said Buzek , who was Poland 's prime minister from 1997 to 2001 .
" A debate with churches and other religions on our continent 's problems is essential , " Buzek said in an interview with Poland 's Catholic information agency KAI .
" I 've no doubt Christian values should be very important at an individual level for each politician and leader , but also collectively since they define and show the key ways a politician can act . "
The 69 - year - old politician was speaking after his election on 14 July to head the 736 - seat parliament for the 27 - nation European Union .
He belongs to the parliament 's Christian Democratic European People 's Party grouping .
" Respect for others who think differently is also a special value for Christians .
Such is my understanding of the presence of these values in social and political life , " Buzek stated .
" I have never manifested my faith in a persistent manner .
The best way of showing what we believe in is through our own actions and behaviour in daily life , and by acting publicly in a way which reflects our deep Christian faith . "
Buzek said he believed the " vision of Europe " promoted by the Pope John Paul II still indicated " the end to which we should strive " , and said he was concerned European politics had " somewhat renounced Christian values " .
Born in the Silesian town of Smilevice , now in the Czech Republic , Buzek has been a member of the European Parliament since 2004 for the Civic Platform .
This is currently the biggest partner in Poland 's coalition government .
Buzek 's election was praised by the Rev Thomas Wipf , president of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe , which groups more than 100 Lutheran , United , Reformed , Methodist and other Protestant churches .
" It is good for the EU that for the first time a politician from the states which entered in 2004 will assume a key position , " said Wipf , who also heads the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches .
" Moreover we are delighted that in future a committed Protestant and member of a minority church will take over the presidency of the European Parliament . "
The ( Lutheran ) Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland has 75,000 members in a country where Roman Catholics make up around 86 per cent of the population of 38 million .
Speaking at a Lutheran service on 20 July 2009 in the southern town of Wisla , Buzek said he knew " how important prayer is " .
He said he counted on " spiritual support and community " from fellow Lutherans in Poland , which will take over the European Union 's rotating presidency in June 2011 .

Never mind the fact that this kind of thinking is just so obviously stupid it also flies in the face of sensible thinking .
The idea that we should have to have a license in order to use computers is utterly ridiculous I can’t believe that anyone would take it seriously .
Just because of gullible people Russel Smith , billed as Australia ’s leading criminologist , is putting forth to the government the idea that first time users of computers should have to earn a license in order to access and use the Web .
On top of that he feels that all hardware manufacturers and software companies should be required to devise technology that will make it impossible , or at least more difficult , for people to be defrauded .
In an interview with IT News Smith said
“ At the moment we have drivers licences for cars , and cars are very dangerous machines .
Computers are also quite dangerous in the way that they can make people vulnerable to fraud .
“ In the future we might want to think about whether it ’s necessary there be some sort of compulsory education of people before they start using computers , ” he said .
Additionally he says banks are being kind when they bear the costs of cyber crime especially when it comes to them compensating customers who he suggests are partially responsible because of something they have done that is either silly or negligent .
Thinking that by the act of making people have license will change the current situation of people being defrauded online then Smith is utterly delusional .
In no case of anything in our society being forced to require licensing has it been shown to make people behave smarter .
We have to have drivers licenses but we still have people doing incredibly stupid things – things that can actually kill real people .
If licensing was the answer to cure human stupidity we ’d have to be licensed to have children so I do n’t see this being forced the have a ‘ computer license ’ will save stupid people from doing stupid things .
■ Apache モジュール版の Amazon API 認証プロキシを作った よ
Amazon の Web サービ ス API が、8月中旬から署名付きのリクエストしか受け付けなくなるとのこと。
これに対して、オープンソースとして配布するソフトの利用者が不便になるとの指摘がある。
さらに、指摘するだけではなくて、認証を代行するプロキシを用意するというアクションまで起こされている。素晴らしい。
このプロキシを経由すれば、既存のスクリプトでも修正せずに新しいAPIに対応できる。
現在では、複数のプロキシを束ねるリバースプロキシまで登場している。
少しでもお手伝いできればと思って、この Amazon API 認証プロキシを Apache モジュールに移植した。 自分でもプロキシサーバを立てて、上記のリバースプロキシに登録している。 今のところ、エラー無しで動いているみたい 。
ソースコー ド
GitHub - mod_amazon_proxyで公開。
Apache モジュールに詳しい人にチェックしてもらえると助かるなぁ…。
クエリストリングの解析と URI エンコードのために 、 Apache の Apache HTTP Request Library ( mod_apreq2 ) に依存しています。
Apache2.2でテストしています。2.0で動くかどうかは不明です。
Apache モジュールで動かす利 点
第 1にパフォーマンス。 Amazon API のプロキシは利用者が増えると負荷が大きくなることが予想されるので、速いに越したことはない。 ab コマンドを使って、たださんの CGI 版プロキシと比較してみた 。

20リクエストを処理するのにCGIで1.8秒がApacheモジュールで0.013秒だった。だいたい100倍くらい速い。
Apache モジュールで動かす欠 点
CGI より敷居が高いことかな 。 Amazon の API は1秒に1回しか使えないらしいので、たくさんの人がプロキシサーバを立てないと辛くなる。
レンタルサーバで動く CGI のほうが、たくさんの人に参加してもらえる。
インストール方 法
Apacheモジュールなので 、Apacheを操作できる権限 ( 通常は root 権限 ) が必要 。
以下のコマンドでコンパイルとインストールする。 apxsコマンドが無い場合は、 apache2 - devel パッケージなどが必要かも。
apxs -c mod_amazon_proxy .c sudo apxs - i mod_amazon_proxy.la
次に、添付 の httpd-amazon-proxy.conf.sample にて Amazonのキーを設定する。 ここでは / amazon_proxy をエンドポイントにしている。 複数のロケールに対応する場合は、 Location をコピーして AmazonEndPoint を書き換える。

Last week , Jen Phillips discussed five ways to respond to jokes about rape .
She chose option # 5 , wherein you disarm the joke - teller by pointing out just how un - funny these jokes are by reversing the target of the joke .
Below , a few options for dealing with that ubiquitous troll of the city sidewalk — the catcaller :
1. Ignore it and keep walking .
2 . Use non-verbal cues ( involving the middle finger ) to indicate your disgust .
3 . Attempt to educate harasser through dialogue or a handy business card .
4 . Share this gem of human interaction with others online via photo or tweet .
5 . Organize a city - wide summit to address gender - based harrassment and assault in public spaces , complete with a gallery exhibition of photographs of area cat - callers caught in the act .
I tend to go with # 1 , since I prefer not to let the catcaller get the satisfaction of a reaction , though sometimes option # 2 happens as a knee - jerk response .
Unfortunately , directly responding to , and even ignoring , catcallers is not always a safe option .
In April , a woman was left partially blind , and her friend suffered a fractured jaw , after telling someone to leave them alone in a NYC pizzeria .
In March , a 29 - year - old pregnant woman was run over and killed when she ignored a catcaller .
To bring attention to the prevalence of public harassment , a number of websites have been created under the title Hollaback .
These sites offer a space for people who are the target of gender - based harassment to share their experience in specific cities , regions , and countries with a sympathetic community , while publicly shaming the perpetrators .
You can also tweet sidewalk utterances to @catcalled so long as it ’s under 140 characters .
Which it probably is , since as any city - dweller knows , these are not eloquent treatises .
However , these sites are not just chronicles of the harassers that make your walk to work less than pleasant .
HollabackDC seeks to make public not just catcallers , but all forms of street harrassment and misogyny :
“ Gender based sexual harassment is any sexual harassment that occurs in a public space when one or more individuals ( man or woman ) accost another individual , based on their gender , as they go about their daily life .
This can include vulgar remarks , heckling , insults , innuendo , stalking , leering , fondling , indecent exposure and other forms of public humiliation .
Gender based public sexual harassment occurs on a continuum starting with words , stalking , and unwanted touching which can lead to more violent crimes like rape , assault , and murder . ”
That is why they are moving beyond the web and joining other DC - based community activists to stage a summit that will address strategies for responding to — and ending — street harassment .
The summit ’s opening reception will include a photography exhibit of street harassers in the act .
If you live in DC and snap a catcaller in the act , you can submit your own photo .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Setting a world record , Joey Chestnut won Nathan 's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest on Saturday , solidifying himself to many as the greatest gustatory athlete of all time .
Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi struggle to eat hot dogs Saturday during the annual contest .
For the third straight year , Chestnut beat out his main rival , Takeru Kobayashi .
The two lived up to their ravenous reputations .
They made quick work of the 17 other eaters , and set personal best scores : Chestnut ate 68 dogs to Kobayashi's 64.5 .
The event lasts 10 minutes and the two were keeping pace with each other until the last minute where Chestnut pulled away .
" I 've been practicing hard , " said Chestnut in an interview with ESPN after the contest .
" After the second minute , I knew that my body was cooperating . "
Chestnut and Kobayashi are considered the game 's best and have different techniques to eating .
While Kobayashi has a smooth , effortless approach , Chestnut muscles them down .
Late in the competition Chestnut 's face turns red and contorts as he drools .
He 's got the competition down to a science : grabbing two hot dogs , forcing them into his mouth and taking a minimal number of chews as he gulps them down his throat .
He then dips the buns in water and lets them slide right down .
Prior to the contest , Chestnut felt confident , saying he would set a new record .
" I 'm usually pretty hesitant on making predictions like that , " he said told CNN Radio Saturday .
" But I was feeling good . "
CNN Radio's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this story .
All About Nathan's Famous Hot Dog • Coney Island
Medication that can protect humans against nuclear radiation has been developed by Jewish - American scientists in cooperation with a researcher and investors from Israel .
The full story behind the dramatic discovery will be published in Yedioth Ahronoth 's weekend edition .
The ground - breaking medication , developed by Professor Andrei Gudkov – Chief Scientific Officer at Cleveland BioLabs - may have far - reaching implications on the balance of power in the world , as states capable of providing their citizens with protection against radiation will enjoy a significant strategic advantage vis -à - vis their rivals .
For Israel , the discovery marks a particularly dramatic development that could deeply affect the main issue on the defense establishment 's agenda : Protection against a nuclear attack by Iran or against " dirty bomb " attacks by terror groups .
Gudkov 's discovery may also have immense implications for cancer patients by enabling doctors to better protect patients against radiation .
Should the new medication enable cancer patients to be treated with more powerful radiation , our ability to fight the disease could greatly improve .
Dramatic test results
The process that led up to the medical innovation dates back to 2003 , when Professor Gudkov came up with the idea of using protein produced in bacteria found in the intestine to protect cells from radiation .
Gudkov recounted an experiment he held with two groups of mice .
" We exposed both groups to lethal radioactive radiation , " he said .
" All the mice in the control group died within a short period of time .
A few days later , when I approached the cage with the mice that received the protein , I could see that they 're ok , that they 're alive .
They survived .
It 's hard to describe the joy all of us felt .
We realized that finally , after so many years and so many experiments and frustrations , we made a breakthrough that may save the lives of millions . "
Prof .
Gudkov published the findings of the protein experiment in Science , the world 's leading scientific journal ; however , the discovery of the medication was kept secret until now , while Gudkov and his associated waited for the results of two series of critical tests examining the medication 's effectiveness and safety .
The first series of tests included experiments on more than 650 monkeys .
Each test featured two groups of monkeys exposed to radiation , but only one group was given the medication .
The radiation dosage was equal to the highest dosage sustained by humans as result of the Chernobyl mishap .
The experiment 's results were dramatic : 70 % of the monkeys that did not receive the cure died , while the ones that survived suffered from the various maladies associated with lethal nuclear radiation .
However , the group that did receive the anti-radiation shot saw almost all monkeys survive , most of them without any side - effects .
The tests showed that injecting the medication between 24 hours before the exposure to 72 hours following the exposure achieves similar results .
Another test on humans , who were given the drug without being exposed to radiation , showed that the medication does not have side - effects and is safe .
Prof .
Gudkov 's company now needs to expand the safety tests , a process expected to be completed by mid-2010 via a shortened test track approved for bio - defense drugs .
Should experiments continue at the current rate , the medication is estimated to be approved for use by the FDA within a year or two .
' Stable , safe , and easy to inject '
The company 's subcontractor in Europe is already prepared to embark on mass production .
Meanwhile , emergency regulations in Israel allow the government to purchase drugs on short notice , even if they are still in the process of being approved .
Notably , the medication in question is not a vaccine , but rather , a preventative drug administered via one or several shots .
The medication works by suppressing the " suicide mechanism " of cells hit by radiation , while enabling them to recover from the radiation - induced damages that prompted them to activate the suicide mechanism in the first place .
Prof . Gudkov heads a group of Jewish - American scientists and has cooperated with an Israeli researcher and Israeli investors .
A large part of the revolutionary medication 's development process was funded by the US Defense and Health departments , which thus far earmarked $ 40 million to the project .
About two weeks ago , the US Defense Department announced that in light of the successful tests , it will continue to fund the project .
The Israeli scientist involved in the research , Dr. Elena Feinstein , made Aliyah to Israel in 1985 and for many years served as a cancer researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science .
Dr. Feinstein met Prof .
Gudkov while they worked together in Moscow and was among the founders of the company , serving as its deputy director for some time .
Today , Feinstein works for an Israel company engaged in cancer research and continues to cooperate with Gudkov .
Referring to the innovative medication , she says : " Both its effectiveness and safety had been proven .
It is stable , safe , and easy to inject . "
Both Feinstein and Gudkov stress that the innovative drug does not provide 100 % protection against radioactive damage .
However , should the discovery announced by the scientists meet all the required tests and permits , it may change the 21st Century .
It is the year 2029 .

With the economy suffering and food prices rising , your family ’s grocery bill might be in need of a few budget cuts .
Unfortunately , because of the misperception that healthy foods always cost more , nutritious foods like fresh produce are often the first to get bumped from grocery carts .
But there are plenty of ways to save money without sacrificing the quality of your diet .
Here are 10 of my top picks for healthy foods that wo n’t break the bank .
1. Oats
Oats are one of the cheapest healthy breakfast options around , and , as a member of the whole - grain family , they ’re loaded with healthful nutrients .
One serving of oatmeal ( made from a half - cup dry oats ) doles out five grams of protein and four grams of fiber , while setting you back only about 30 cents ( and 150 calories ) .
Buy plain , dry oats in the big canisters rather than the ( often presweetened ) individual packets , which are way more costly .
This way , you ’re also in control of the added ingredients , sugars , and total calories in your breakfast .
Great mix -ins include fresh or dried fruit ( such as diced apple , sliced banana , berries , or raisins ) , peanut butter , chopped nuts , or a few teaspoons of preserves .
2. Healthy Frozen Mixed - Vegetable Blends
Bagged frozen vegetables are one of the greatest values in the grocery store ( generic versions are typically cheaper than the popular name brands , unless there ’s a sale ) .
And because mixed - vegetable blends ( such as stir - fry or California - style varieties ) contain up to seven different vegetables in one bag , they are an incredibly easy and cost - effective way to incorporate a colorful variety of healthy produce into your diet .
You ’d spend significantly more if you bought all those veggies individually in their fresh form and would be much more likely to have the extras go to waste .
Frozen vegetables really are just as nutritious as fresh .
They ’re picked at their peak and flash - frozen , locking in all their healthful nutrients .
Use frozen veggies just as you would fresh — in soups , chilies , casseroles , pasta sauces , omelets , stir - fries , and side dishes .
Just make sure you do n’t select blends that contain sauces , salt , sugar , or other unhealthy additives .
3. Fresh Fruit : Bananas , Apples , and Oranges
Refilling your fruit bowl every week can cost an arm and a leg… but it does n’t have to !
Make affordable fruits like bananas , apples , and oranges your weekly staples , and save more costly options like pineapple , pomegranates , melons , and papayas for special treats .
Bananas in particular are a bargain hunter ’s dream .
Select green , relatively unripe bananas at the store so they last all week .
Do n’t worry about them going to waste either ; if they start to turn black and squishy , toss them into a plastic storage bag and freeze for later .
Use frozen bananas in healthy fruit smoothies , or mash them up and mix into oatmeal , low - fat muffins , or pancakes .
Do n’t forget about those oranges and apples — they ’re kid-friendly , easy to tote , and stay fresh longer than most fruits .
4. Lentils
Lentils really are the king of legumes .
They ’ve got it all : fiber , protein , folate , iron , potassium , and a host of other trace minerals .
Plus , they ’re super - affordable and surprisingly easy to prepare .
Unlike dried beans , they do n’t require presoaking and they cook up quickly .
Simmer lentils with diced tomatoes and seasonings for a hearty side dish , or add dry lentils to soups or stews to increase protein without relying on expensive meats .
5. Beans ( Canned or Dried )
You ca n’t go wrong with these little guys .
Like lentils , beans are packed with protein , making them an economical alternative to meat , poultry , and seafood .
Plus , they ’re healthy — loaded with fiber , which , among other things , maintains digestive health , reduces cholesterol levels , and keeps blood sugars under control .
Stockpile these pantry staples when they go on sale ; dried beans will keep for up to a year , and canned beans last twice as long .
If you choose canned beans , buy low - sodium whenever possible and be sure to thoroughly rinse before using to remove excess salt from the canning liquids .
Substitute beans for ground meat in chilies , tacos , soups , or burgers , or add them to cold salads .
Pureed beans can even be used as a healthy , low - fat alternative to butter or oil in baked goods .
6. Peanut Butter
Peanut butter is a concentrated source of protein , as well as heart - healthy monounsaturated fats , vitamin E , and B vitamins .
Of course , it ’s also a concentrated source of calories , so make sure you limit yourself to no more than two tablespoons per serving ( two level tablespoons are 195 calories ) .
Your money will be better spent if you choose natural peanut butters without added sugars or other additives .
For a thrifty , wholesome breakfast , enjoy peanut butter spread on whole - wheat toast .
Or squirrel away the cash you ’d normally shell out for an expensive deli sandwich and have a “ grown - up PB&J ” for lunch — a real comfort food — by substituting sliced fresh fruit ( apples or bananas work best with the bonus of being among the cheapest fruits ) for jelly on your sandwich .
7. Canned Salmon
The healthy benefits of eating omega - 3 - rich fish like wild salmon are clear , but the price of fresh fish can be hard to swallow , especially if you ’re feeding an entire family .
Canned wild ( Alaskan ) salmon is a much more economical way to get your weekly fish quota .
If you ’re willing to spend just a few extra minutes removing the bones and skin yourself ( rather than buying the boneless , skinless variety ) , you can save yourself even more money .
Canned salmon is perfect for cold salmon salad and warm salmon melts , and it makes great salmon cakes when mixed with egg , milk , and whole oats .
Kids will love its mild flavor , too .
Of course , canned salmon provides a hefty dose of sodium , so you ’ll want to take that into consideration if you ’re watching your salt intake .
8. Fat -Free Yogurt
An easy protein- and calcium - rich snack or breakfast option is fat - free yogurt .
If your family members are big fans of this dairy favorite , consider buying the large 32 - ounce tubs instead of the pricier individual cartons .
Purchasing yogurt in portable six - ounce containers is convenient , but your wallet will be rewarded ( you ’ll save at least 20 percent ) by taking a few extra seconds to scoop out an individual serving into a plastic container or bowl .
Since the 32 - ounce containers come in only a limited number of flavors , keep plenty of fun add - ins such as fresh fruit , raisins , and flavored extracts on hand to add some variety .
9. Eggs
Eggs are another low - cost , high - quality protein source .
When stored properly in the fridge , raw eggs last about three weeks in the shell , so stock up when they ’re on sale .
Also consider buying one of the trays of 18 or two dozen that are available in some grocery and club stores to save a few more pennies .
Use eggs to whip up cost - effective , meatless dinner entrées like omelets , frittatas , low - fat quiches , and egg sandwiches .
Replace some of the whole eggs in these recipes with egg whites to lower the calories , fat , and cholesterol .
10 . Sweet Potatoes
Our list of cheap eats would not be complete without the humble potato .
For an added boost of nutrition , try replacing your regular old white potatoes with sweet potatoes .
Like white potatoes , they are one of the richest sources of potassium , but ounce for ounce , sweet potatoes deliver more fiber , vitamin C , and beta - carotene than their pale cousins .
These nutritional powerhouses do n’t have to be limited to Thanksgiving dinner , either .
Turn sweet potatoes into everyday favorites :
Use them to prepare oven fries , mashed potatoes , and stews .
Or , for a super - easy side , pierce a whole sweet potato with a fork , wrap in a damp paper towel , and microwave for four to five minutes .
Top with nonfat Greek yogurt … or salsa for a little kick !
One medium - sized sweet potato provides about 200 calories .

Researchers from the Department of Science Education - Biology at the University of Haifa - Oranim have managed to make out the " self - irrigating " mechanism of the desert rhubarb , which enables it to harvest 16 times the amount of water than otherwise expected for a plant in this region based on the quantities of rain in the desert .
This is the first example of a self - irrigating desert plant , the scientists say .
The desert rhubarb grows in the mountains of Israel 's Negev desert , where average precipitation is particularly low ( 75 mm per year ) .
Unlike most of the other desert plant species , which have small leaves so as to minimize moisture loss , this plant is unique in that its leaves are particularly large ; each plant 's rosette of one to four leaves reaches a total diameter of up to one meter .
Prof. Simcha Lev-Yadun , Prof. Gidi Ne'eman and Prof. Gadi Katzir came across this unique plant growing in the desert while studying the field area with students of the Department of Science Education - Biology of the University of Haifa - Oranim , and noticed that its leaves are unusually large and covered with a waxy cuticle .
They observed an exceptionally ridged structure on each leaf , forming a leaf structure that resembles the habitat 's mountainous topography .
The scientists explained that these deep and wide depressions in the leaves create a " channeling " mountain - like system by which the rain water is channeled toward the ground surrounding the plant 's deep root .
Other desert plants simply suffice with the rain water that penetrates the ground in its immediate surroundings .
The findings have shown that the natural selection process has resulted in the evolution of this plant 's extremely large leaves , which improved its ability to survive in the arid climate of the desert .
The results of experiments and analysis of the plant 's growth - in an area with an average annual rainfall of 75 mm - showed that the desert rhubarb is able to harvest quantities of water that are closer to that of Mediterranean plants , reaching up to 426 mm per year .
This is 16 times the amount of water harvested by the small - leafed plants of the Negev desert region .
When the research team watered the plant artificially , they observed how the water flows along the course of the leave 's depressed veins to the ground surrounding the plant 's single root and then penetrates the ground to a depth of 10 cm or more .
Under the experimental conditions , water penetrated the ground only as deep as 1 cm .
" We know of no other plant in the deserts of the world that functions in this manner , " the researchers concluded .
BAGHDAD , Aug. 4 ( UPI ) -- Coalition forces engineers say they 're meeting electricity challenges in remote areas of Iraq by building alternative energy systems for border checkpoints .
The engineers are partnering with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fund and build alternative energy systems for border security facilities in remote locations , the U.S. military said Tuesday in a news release .

The engineering team designed a system that leverages solar panels and a large wind turbine , which they call " energy in a box , " for a checkpoint southeast of Baghdad .
The wind turbine and solar panels are connected to a switch gear so both power sources can generate electricity , depending on the environmental conditions , the military said .
Iraqi Border Enforcement teams run the systems , while U.S. military personnel offer training on how to operate and maintain the facilities .
Also , the military said , the costs for the solar - wind systems are less over the long term compared with the expense of transporting fuel to large generators along the Iraqi border .

BEST SELLING AUTHOR Copy This Idea went straight to number one in the book charts .
When I was asked to write COPY THIS IDEA , which went on the become a Sunday Times Business Best Seller , I remember my publisher saying to me – “ You ’re nothing special , yet you ’ve made all this money ! ! ”
And she was right .
I ’m nothing special .
I ’m not some glitzy TV Business Guru or someone whose face you see every other day in the papers .
I ’m nothing special – I ’m just an ordinary bloke who keeps himself to himself … who left school with 4 GCE ’s – including woodwork and drawing .
I ’m not an expert on ‘ the world of business ’ and you certainly wo n’t find me at one of those awful ‘ business networking events ’ .
No – I ’m just an ordinary bloke who , bored with his full time job , the commuting in traffic , the bosses I hated and the ‘ just getting by each month ’… stumbled upon a great way for someone with no business qualifications and no experience , to start and run a business in his spare room at home … and banked well over £ 50 Million !!
It ’s a far cry from where I came from and what I ’d grown up with .
As a lad , I was born and raised in a one bedroom caravan by my parents .
My Mum and Dad could best be described as ‘ potless ’ for most of their lives .
They spent most of their adult lives scraping a living together in a little hardware store they ran at the bottom of the town .
I went to school on the local council estate and never did very well .
My Dad wanted me to go into the family business – so I was packed off to the local technical college when I left school , to learn about “ business ” .
But I was a failure .
I remember the look of absolute bewilderment on the face of the lecturer who used to teach us ‘ accountancy ’ .
Seems I was the only person ever to fail the accountancy exam .
What made it a real kick in the teeth , as far as he was concerned , was that HE wrote the exam paper – HE told us what to revise … and yet I STILL failed !!
He was beside himself .
It was n’t my fault .
I simply did n’t understand what the rows of figures on a balance sheet meant .
In fact – I still do n’t even now !!
I understand that if I buy something for £ 5 and sell it for £ 50 – or I buy something for £ 50 and sell it for almost £ 2,000 ( which I do all the time in my business ) – there ’s a nice chunk of profit in there .
( Through my workshops and training events , I share the money making system I use – and show how you can copy my way of making these huge profits for yourself if you wish .
Internetsucht bei Jugendlichen tritt seltener auf als bislang angenommen .
Nur vier von hundert Heranwachsenden in Deutschland sind nach einer aktuellen Studie der Berliner Humboldt - Universität exzessive Internetnutzer .
Von Sucht könne nur bei 1,4 Prozent der 12 - bis 19 - Jährigen gesprochen werden , sagte Sabine Meixner vom Lehrstuhl für Pädagogische Psychologie am Mittwoch auf einem Symposium bei Schwerin .
Damit würden frühere Untersuchungen relativiert , nach denen in Deutschland etwa 17 Prozent der Jugendlichen krankhaft auffällige Computer - Nutzer sein sollen .
Die Studie der Humboldt - Uni basiert auf einer Befragung von 5200 Schülern in Hamburg , Sachsen und Sachsen - Anhalt zwischen 2005 und 2009 .
Nach den neuesten Erkenntnissen sind junge Leute mit einer Internetnutzung von rund 35 Stunden in der Woche als süchtig einzustufen und ab 28 Stunden pro Woche als gefährdet .
Besonders häufig seien Jungen oder junge Männer betroffen .
Ängstlichkeit , Einsamkeit , ein geringes Selbstwertgefühl , Überforderung , Kommunikationsstörungen und Depressionen begünstigen die Sucht , sagte Meixner .
Zudem trete die Sucht öfter bei Real - und Hauptschülern auf als bei Gymnasiasten .
Die Flucht in die virtuelle
Welt des Computerspiels oder in Chatrooms diene den jungen Leuten vor allem dazu , Probleme zu vergessen .
Für eine repräsentative bundesweite Studie zur Internetsucht gebe es aber bislang keine ausreichenden Daten , räumte Meixner ein. ( dpa ) / ( anw )
I 've just finished watching a fascinating documentary on DVD that attempts to tell the story of black Mormons , who - according to the liner notes - " have been a continuous presence in the LDS church from its earliest days . "
The creators bring an insider 's POV - but do n't flinch from grappling with Mormonism 's racist past - and I applaud their effort and welcome the Mormon conversation it has engendered .
That said , it was n't the film 's treatment of historical injustice that provoked me to write this post , but rather what the clip below reveals about an ongoing and very present cause for concern .
First , a quick synopsis to set up the clip :
00:00:00 - Faithful young Mormon couple , parents of nine
00:00:55 - Their encounter with racism inside the Salt Lake Temple
00:01:13 - " You speak such good English ! "
00:01:25 - This worthy Mormon family is apparently not appropriate for LDS church media ?
Good enough to tithe , to attend the Mormon Temple , but not good enough for Mormon magazine covers ?
What is it with NOM the Mormon church and its addiction to artifice and actors ?
UPDATE : Backstory : I bought the DVD and grabbed 3 minutes of the documentary figuring that posting such a short clip together with commentary was a safe move under " fair use " ...
Long story short , the video works again , but it 's only 1 minute long and it's not hosted on my YouTube account .
All apologies for the service interruption .
And here it is , a short excerpt from Nobody Knows : The Untold Story of Black Mormons ...
For the record , I have no association with the folks who created Nobody Knows .
I 'm too busy with my own documentary project ( and I could probably use some help with the title , because it seems a bit long ) ...
" Everybody Knows Except the Mormons Who Never Got Told :
Why a religion so rigid that until today it 's still grappling with the meaning of interracial marriage in its own church culture decided to bankroll a nationwide campaign to define marriage for the rest of the country . "
August 18 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
I was reading this recently – it ’s some extracts from a book by Bakunin ( prominent Russian anarcho - communist ) which Marx had written notes in ( the online text , on libcom , unfortunately does n’t distinguish between who ’s saying what , but I think I ’ve worked it out from context – who ’s calling who an idiot , generally ) .
The topic , as one might expect , is the ‘ workers ’ state ’ and the ‘ dictatorship of the proletariat ’ ( hereafter DOTP ) .
It stimulated some thoughts in my brain , so I reproduce some of the exchanges , with my comments .
My sympathies are mixed – partly I agree with Bakunin , partly with Marx , and I think a lot of the time their exchange may be clouded by their rivalry and dislike of each other .
Bakunin :
We have already stated our deep opposition to the theory of Lassalle and Marx , which recommends to the workers , if not as final ideal then at least as the next major aim — the foundation of a people ’s state , which , as they have expressed it , will be none other than the proletariat organized as ruling class .
The question arises , if the proletariat becomes the ruling class , over whom will it rule ?
It means that there will still remain another proletariat , which will be subject to this new domination , this new state .
Marx :
It means that so long as the other classes , especially the capitalist class , still exists , so long as the proletariat struggles with it ( for when it attains government power its enemies and the old organization of society have not yet vanished ) , it must employ forcible means , hence governmental means .
It is itself still a class and the economic conditions from which the class struggle and the existence of classes derive have still not disappeared and must forcibly be either removed out of the way or transformed , this transformation process being forcibly hastened .
Warm - Fork :
Is Bakunin denying that the proletariat is likely to have many enemies , even after the threshold of revolution has been passed ?
Surely not .
Nor , presumably , is he denying that the proletariat will have to ‘ struggle ’ with them in some sense , nor that it will have to meet force with force , nor that it will have to organise itself for such purposes .
So the precise dispute is when Marx says “ it must employ forcible means , hence governmental means ” , about which Bakunin says “ It means that there will still remain another proletariat , which will be subject to this new domination ” .
So what is meant by ‘ governmental means ’ – my instinctive definition would be ‘ establishing a centralised apparatus for initiating physical force against not - immediately - violent targets ’ .
It ’s certainly a plausible allegation that this inevitably makes people other than the intended counter - revolutionaries vulnerable to such an apparatus .
Bakunin : e.g. the common peasant folk , the peasant mob , which as is well known does not enjoy the goodwill of the Marxists , and which , being as it is at the lowest level of culture , will apparently be governed by the urban factory proletariat .
Marx : where the peasant exists in the mass as private proprietor , where he even forms a more or less considerable majority … either he hinders each workers ’ revolution , makes a wreck of it , as he has formerly done in France , or the proletariat ( for the peasant proprietor does not belong to the proletariat , and even where his condition is proletarian , he believes himself not to ) must as government take measures through which the peasant finds his condition immediately improved , so as to win him for the revolution … easing the transition from private ownership of land to collective ownership , so that the peasant arrives at this of his own accord , from economic reasons .
It must not hit the peasant over the head , as it would e.g. by proclaiming the abolition of the right of inheritance or the abolition of his property …
Still less should small - holding property be strengthened , by the enlargement of the peasant allotment simply through peasant annexation of the larger estates , as in Bakunin ’s revolutionary campaign .
Warm - Fork : Marx ’s comments to a certain extent seem to bear out Bakukin ’s accusation .
He speaks of what “ the proletariat … as government ” must do with regards to peasant property , even in cases where peasants are the majority .
This seems to imply that , as Bakunin says , “ the peasant mob… will …be governed by the urban factory proletariat “ .
For all that Marxists declare the DOTP to be ‘ the most rigourously democratic form of government ’ , this is a little disconcerting .
Marx ’s idea , I think , is to preserve the ‘ proletarian ’ character of the revolutionary movement , and not ‘ dilute ’ it away from communism by bringing in a majority of aspiring property - owners – and I can empathise with that .
But the problem arises precisely from his insistence on ‘ governmental means ’ .
Does the DOTP send its army , police force , militia , into the countryside ?
Does it impose its law onto the peasantry by force ?
If Marx does n’t support that , he does n’t make it clear , and events in the Russian Revolution hardly dispel the idea .
But how is this anything but a military occupation , however supposedly benevolent ?
I ’ve argued before for something like a DOTP – an association preserving its proletarian character by restricting membership to those who forswear property claims .
But this has to be consistent with the idea of democracy , which means it must be something less than a government .
But it can still wield enormous power by non-governmental means – offering its protection , its technical aid , its products , etc .
Bakunin :
If there is a state , then there is unavoidably domination , and consequently slavery .
Domination without slavery , open or veiled , is unthinkable — this is why we are enemies of the state .
What does it mean , the proletariat organized as ruling class ?
Marx :
It means that the proletariat , instead of struggling sectionally against the economically privileged class , has attained a sufficient strength and organization to employ general means of coercion in this struggle .
It can however only use such economic means as abolish its own character as salariat , hence as class .
Warm - Fork :
If the proletariat can only use such economic means as abolish its own character , why not also say it can only use such political means as do so – whatever such a constraint amounts to ?
That is , if we are to uphold some such ‘ constraints ’ against unrestricted ‘ the - ends - justifies - the - means ’ necessity , why not those that ( sensible ) anarchists insist on ?
Bakunin : The Germans number around forty million .
Will for example all forty million be member of the government ?
Marx : Certainly !
Since the whole thing begins with the self - government of the commune .
Warm - Fork :
Though I inclined towards Bakunin ’s side earlier , here Marx certainly seems to have the better of it – if there is to be decision - making on large scales ( and if there is n’t , global warming at least will eat us all ) then we must suppose direct democracy a practical possibility at whatever level .
Though I do wonder – at what point does the label ‘ state ’ become misleading ?
Bakunin :
By people ’s government they understand the government of the people by means of a small number of leaders , chosen ( elected ) by the people .
Marx : Asinine !
This is democratic twaddle , political drivel .
Warm - Fork :
They continue in this way for a bit .
It sometimes seems that Bakunin has a grossly unfair idea of what Marx is advocating ( something like of our ‘ representative democracy ’ , or worse , one - party rule ) , and Marx a grossly unfair of what Bakunin is advocating ( a disorganised collection of ineffectual communities growing their own pot ) .
Might they both be reasoning to themselves ‘ this person misrepresents me so outrageously , they must be an idiot – so their position must be idiotic ’?
Bakunin :
But those elected will be fervently convinced and therefore educated socialists .
The phrase ‘ educated socialism ’…
Marx : … never was used .
Bakunin :… ‘ scientific socialism ’…
Marx :… was only used in opposition to utopian socialism , which wants to attach the people to new delusions , instead of limiting its science to the knowledge of the social movement made by the people itself ; see my text against Proudhon .
Bakunin : … which is unceasingly found in the works and speeches of the Lasalleans and Marxists , itself indicates that the so - called people ’s state will be nothing else than the very despotic guidance of the mass of the people by a new and numerically very small aristocracy of the genuine or supposedly educated .
Warm - Fork :
In fairness to Marx , the idea of rule by the educated is not something I ’ve ever found in his writing .
In fairness to Bakunin , it does seem to have been found there by other ‘ Marxists ’ .
The Ceuta - Morocco border fence ( image )
Wanted to share with you a couple of links that have deeply interested and distressed me today and yesterday .
The first one is a lecture that Wendy Brown , a professor of political science at the University of California , gave at the London School of Economics and Political Science .
Her recent research focuses on the concept of political sovereignty as it is connected to globalization and other transnational forces .
Archived by Resist , a project i am involved in , the lecture explains how the building of walls around the world today is so starkly at odds with images of a world that is ever more connected & unbordered .
Whether they aim to deter poor people , illegal workers , asylum seekers , drugs , weapons and other contraband , enslaved youth , ethnic or religious mixing , walls and fences basically do not work .
An Iraqi boy walks near a blast wall in the Karrada neighborhood .
US troops are building a wall around the Adhamiya Sunni neighborhood , which is surrounded by Shia areas , north of Baghdad ( photo )
The list of walls she gave is absolutely alarming , especially considered that she focused on the ones that have risen since the much celebrated fall of the Berlin Wall : the U.S. border with Mexico and the Israeli West Bank barrier ( these two share high technology , sub - contracting and they also reference each other for legitimation ) , Post - Apartheid South Africa ’s internal maze of walls and check point , Saudi Arabia concrete structure along its border with Yemen , India ’s reinforced border with Pakistan and Bengladesh , Botswana ’s electric fence along the border with Zimbabwe , the wall between Egypt and Gaza , etc .
But also walls within walls : gated communities so popular in the U.S. ( in particular in Southern Californian communities living closer to the Mexico border ) , walls around Israel settlements in West Bank , walls around the Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem and the walls that partition the city itself , the triple layer of walls around Spanish enclaves in Morocco , the wall of Via Anelli inside the Italian city of Padua that separate white middle class with immigrants living in an “ African ghetto ” ( i’d recommend Italian readers the documentary Stato di Paura , you can find the trailer here ) , the Baghdad wall built by the U.S. military , etc .
The list goes on and on and the analysis Brown makes of the phenomenon is thought - provoking .
I ca n’t recommend enough the audio file of Prof.
Brown ’s lecture .

The second video depicts in a particularly moving way a project which might not be new to most of you but i had never heard about it so far .
Israeli NGO B’Tselem has given Palestinian families across the West Bank video cameras to document how they are treated by Israeli soldiers and settlers .
Simple , smart and apparently effective .
Here ’s two interviews with Oren Yakobovich , Director of Video at B’Tselem : a video and an audio .
The blog Subtopia covers this kind of topic in a very documented and intelligent way .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Countries on the front line in the “ war on terror ” are using the battle against extremists as a smokescreen to crack down on minority groups , an international human rights group said on Thursday .
For the fourth straight year , Somalia , Iraq , Sudan and Afghanistan topped an annual index compiled by Minority Rights Group International ( MRG ) of countries where minorities are most at risk of genocide , mass killings or violent repression .
“ You see governments who have faced a genuine threat , but the point is the actions they have taken against the wider civilian population , including minority civilians , has been justified as part of the ‘ war on terror , ’ ” MRG director Mark Lattimer told Reuters .
“ It has included disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions . ”
A two - year insurgency in Somalia led by al Shabaab militants , who have links to al Qaeda and include foreign Islamists among their ranks , has killed some 18,000 civilians .
The insurgency has put historically oppressed minority groups such as the Bantu , Gabooye and Yibir at particular risk , the chairman of Somali Minority Rights and Aid Forum , Mohamed Hassan Daryeel , said .
“ If the Yibir go with the government , they will be attacked by the radical Islamists .
At the same time , if they go with the Islamists , they will be considered terrorists , and if they are neutral they ’ll be targeted by all sides . ”
Daryeel said recent amputations carried out by al Shabaab fighters were performed on child soldiers forcibly recruited from minority groups .
“ They are at the bottom of society , the most disadvantaged , ” he said .
Despite a decline in violence in Iraq , the report said civilian deaths from violence were still estimated at 300 - 800 a month over the past year .
It said minorities continued to bear the brunt of the violence , especially in the Nineveh area , home to the Shabak people .
“ The Shabak community has suffered a lot at the hands of the terrorist groups and at the hands of the Kurdish ‘ Assayish ’ ( secret police ) , ” head of Iraq ’s Minorities Council , Hunain Al - Qaddo , told Reuters .
He said around 10,000 Shabak families had fled parts of Mosul to their homeland in the Nineveh plains for fear of being killed because of their ethnicity .
The rest of the top 10 list was comprised of Myanmar in fifth place , followed by Pakistan , Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Nigeria and Israel / Palestinian territories .
Pakistan rose on the list due to an escalating conflict against different Islamist groups , combined with growing violence in national politics and suppression of dissidents .
Ethiopia , Eritrea and Yemen were assessed as under greater danger than a year ago with their governments ’ involvement in regional conflicts compounding the risk of repression at home .
African states make up half the report ’s top 20 list .
Views of what constitutes poverty change with time
GO FIGURE
Different ways of seeing stats
Many people might think of poverty as absolute , the lack of certain basic amenities , but politicians measure it in relative terms .
So we could see poverty fall during the recession , writes Michael Blastland in his regular column .
Are you poor ?
Well , it depends on the income of someone you 've never met .
Poverty can be a puzzle , or at least the way it 's measured .
News this week , for example , was that UK pensioners suffer worse poverty than Romanian , even though four times richer .
Intrigued ?
Use our interactive graphic to find out who 's poor by moving the smiley faces around and watching the boundaries change .
The slider 's default position is £ 393 per week - the UK median income for a couple without children , before housing costs , for 2007 / 8 .
That means the poverty line is set at £ 235 per week .
See how the median line switches from one smiley to another as they 're moved .
The median is always the person in the middle .
It does n't matter to the median who 's on what income , only how many are on either side .
You 'll also see as you move the median smiley that the pink poverty zone grows or shrinks .
Poverty is defined as below 60 % of the median .
So as median smiley 's income grows , so does the zone in which other smilies are labelled poor .
Are British pensioners really poorer than those in Romania ?
Try moving the median smiley left to make it poorer .
If the line swaps to someone else , move that too .
You 'll see that even though the incomes of the poor have n't changed , some stop being poor just because the median moves .
Move the median in the other direction to make it richer and more people become poor even though their incomes do n't change .
So one person 's poverty also depends on how well the person in the middle is doing .
See if you can make no - one poor , then see how many you can make poor .
By dragging the middle smiley , with five others , to the far right , the poverty line shifts to £ 600 per week ( 31,200 per year ) .
Some would see homelessness as an absolute indicator of poverty
Now try moving the rich and see what happens to poverty .
Nothing at all .
Some people think that because poverty is relative that it is the same as inequality .
It is n't .
The richest can become richer and it has no effect at all on poverty .
This is not to comment on the experience of poverty or the rights and wrongs of who gets what , just to show how the system works .
So here are some curiosities about poverty .
It might improve during the recession , not because the poor get richer , and nor because the poor do , but because those who are on benefits could stay where they are but the median might fall .
Since Victorian times there have been concerted efforts to overcome poverty Romanian pensioners can have much less money than UK pensioners but fewer of them be described as poor .
That 's because they are closer to the median person in their country , not because they have more money .
In fact , they are simply bunched together at what others would consider the bottom .
But who is this person in the middle ?
Can we have a national quest to find out , compered by Graham Norton , where we line up the whole population according to income , lowest to highest , and name the person bang in the centre ?
So there are some questions .
Why not a fixed figure for poverty rather than one that changes as people become richer ?
Fixed at what ?
Fixed 50 years ago ?
Fixed at $ 2 a day - the international standard for absolute poverty ?
Anything fixed is soon left far behind by dramatic changes in the wealth of people as a whole .
It 's argued that poverty is the lack what most people take for granted and so has to change as society changes .
Why does this calculation matter ?
It 's the calculation the government uses to measure its success in reducing poverty , including child poverty , for which it sets targets .
It 's also used for country comparisons like the recent report that pensioner poverty in the UK was the fourth worst in the EU .
Why the median , not the mean ?
Because calculating the mean would include everyone , including the Chelsea football team 's stellar earners .
Would it make sense to say that one person 's poverty depends on what John Terry earns ?
Using the mean would make it a measure of inequality .
Why 60 % of the median and not 55 or 65 ?
The line is to some extent arbitrary , but is now used internationally and seems to reflect a view that this is the point at which people struggle to share the ordinary expectations of the majority .
How do we know what people earn ?
The numbers that appear on the graphic as you first see it are the real numbers ( approximately ) as reported in the survey of Households Below Average Income .
They show disposable income - that 's after tax and benefits , adjusted to take account of household composition - if there are more people in the household they need more money to enjoy the same standard of living as someone living alone .
The survey is of 25,000 households annually .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Since poverty is admitted to be subjective , and based on people 's perceptions of basic things that people should have , why not simply ask a number of people what wage they believe constitutes the borderline of poverty ?
Then draw up a distribution of people 's opinions .
Maybe a meaningful definition of poverty would then be the wage below which 90 % of people consider your wage to be insufficient .
Will Becker , Sheffield " Poor " used to mean you could n't afford to feed your family .
Now it means you can't afford broadband internet .
Rik Sweeney , London
To say that people live in poverty in this country is an insult to the third world .
People my be poor or disadvantaged but have access to health care , education , housing etc .
Poverty was effectively eliminated with the introduction of the welfare state following WWII .
It is now time to remove the word " poverty " to describe the disadvantaged in the UK .
Andrew Potter , Newport , England
There is one big problem in using this method to calculate how many people are living in poverty - it does n't take the cost of living into account .
It would n't matter if we all earned £ 1 million a month if a pint of milk or load of bread cost us £ 500 k .
On the other hand if we all earned £ 100 a month but milk and bread were 1 p then we would n't feel poor at all .
Rod , Edinburgh I am currently visiting India where poverty is defined as the inability to consistently afford 800 calories a day .
Nobody in the UK is in poverty .
TimN , Cambridge
My family would LOVE to have the median income each week .
Even with family tax credits and child benefit we are still below this level .
However , we are fortunate as our mortgage is not the largest bill anymore - the gas and electric is .
We do not feel POOR , but we have to be careful and think before we spend money on anything but necessities .
Jacquie , Yorkshire
If poverty is measured as ' below 60 % of the median ' then , if everyone 's income was set at £ 5,000 per annum , no one would be deemed as poor !
What a strange way of measuring poverty .
Michael W , Chatham , England
The statistic I would be interested in understanding is the percentage of pensioners each country has that is under the median of the entire European Union - I think this is probably a better matter of relative poverty gauged against those countries which pensioners can move between relatively easily .
Or alternatively the percentage of a pensioners income required to purchase two or three standard shopping baskets in each country - after all this is a pretty standard measurement used by business people worldwide to judge salary requirements and expectations when moving between countries so why should it not be used to measure the value of pensioners money between countries .
What I would want to know is can UK pensioners buy less or more with their money than if they were living elsewhere ?
George , Huddersfield
My husband and I both work full time , in qualified positions and pretty much always have .
Our household net income is , per month , £ 2900 .
We have old cars ( eg 10+yrs old ) , neither of us have ever owned a new car , we live in a housing association property and we never holiday abroad .
We have two children from my first marriage living with us and he pays maintenance for his two children , who do not live with us .
We rarely , perhaps three times a year go out as a family or a couple .
Most of our furniture is second hand and despite living in the property for about five years , we have not finished decorating it due to lack of finance available .
We can barely afford to live from one month to the next .
Are we rich , I do not think so , relatively speaking .
Who is the average person and what do they earn ?
How do people afford to buy a property , we could n't even consider getting one through the key worker scheme as the repayments were way too high .
Do we have debt , yes , but less than £ 12,000 .
We feel stuck in a rut .
Heidi Towner , Aldershot , Hants Sounds quite manipulative to me - " relative terms " are so open to interpretation or bias .
All Statistics are at danger of political interpretation and / or of being rigged .
Surely the only measure of poverty is whether you can afford pay your accommodation , bills , utilities , medicines , food and transport .
If you can't , then quite simply you are in poverty .
Peter Jackson , Bexhill - on - Sea
There 's more to it than poverty in financial terms , per se .
There 's a poverty of position and influence , viz .
the bankers received billions almost instantaneously from the so - called government , whereas pensioners qualifying for pension credit have to wait until next October for an adjustment to an already grossly over - estimated earning power of their small savings .
Pension credit is , in any case , a " government " joke .
They claim it 's a reward for saving - and then penalize pensioners with modest savings .

It seems to me common sense that poverty in real terms is hardship .
I live on under £ 10,000 a year , but have all the luxuries I need , I am retired , I have a £ 3,000 computer system , plus a £ 3,000 camera .
All my cupboards are full of food as is my fridge , and I have everything I need in real terms .
How many pensioners live on this kind of money or have more income ?
Are they classed as poor ?
e should describe poverty as hardship , not the amount of money we have .

( CNN ) --
They were there for the view -- spectators awed by a vista of massive waves smashing against the rocky shore .
A U.S. Coast Guard rescue boat reaches a man swept out to sea Sunday at Acadia National Park in Maine .
But then one wave struck violently , sweeping three people into the churning ocean , one of them a 7 - year - old girl .
What spectator Mary Ellen Martel saw next were bodies bobbing along in the frothy waters .
And in a heartbeat , a day of spectacular surf turned tragic .
Watch a dramatic rescue at sea »
Thousands of people flocked to the jagged shoreline of Maine 's Acadia National Park on Sunday as Hurricane Bill weakened offshore on its trajectory north and delivered dramatic waves to the New England seaboard .
" People were clapping and laughing when the wind would bring the spray over .
It was a very festive atmosphere , " Martel told CNN in a telephone interview .
" It was a warm , sunny day , and everyone was just enjoying the show that Mother Nature was offering , but not everybody knows to stay away from the edge -- or way away from the edge . "
A section of the shore is known as Thunder Hole , a popular tourist attraction where waves crashing against the shore mimic the sound of thunder .
But Sunday , conditions were such that even the walkway to Thunder Hole was closed for the safety of spectators .
On a rock cliff about 20 feet above the sea , a wave struck about 11:50 a.m. , pushing water onto the ankles of some of the people standing on " top of what we think would be a safe area , " Acadia Chief Ranger Stuart West told CNN .
People started to turn back , to get farther away from the edge , and then a second , monstrous wave hit them .
The unrelenting sea dragged in seven onlookers , forcing four to claw their way back to shore but sweeping three others out into the chilly waters .
Two were rescued , but 7 - year - old Clio Axlerod of New York perished , West said .
Watch preparations for the storm »
Martel , a resident of Maine 's Southwest Harbor for more than 35 years and a frequent park visitor , had come there with her husband , and she said she feels " pretty certain " she had been on the same ledge as the three victims swept out to sea .
Martel had stood far enough back that the first wave did not affect her much , but when she saw the second coming , she turned her back to protect the camera she used to photograph the surf .
She was doused from her shoulders down , she said .
She said she knew then she had to get back to the road that led to the area .
" When I looked [ back ] , everybody was scrambling to get off the ledge , " she said .
Her husband , a volunteer firefighter , ran back to offer his help and overheard a woman say that her husband and daughter were swept away from the spot where the Martels and maybe 30 others had been , she said .
U.S. Coast Guard rescuers arrived about 20 minutes after the first call and had the tough task of finding the three drifting in the rough seas .
" Of course , trying to locate a head in frothy , agitated water like it was is a very difficult operation , " West said .
" But the rangers on the shore could still spot them . "
Martel saw bobbing buoys out in the distance , but not until she used a zoom lens on her camera could she tell the buoys from the bodies , she said .
At 12:52 p.m. , the Coast Guard picked up Simone Pelletier , 12 , of Belfast , Maine , and Peter Axlerod , 55 , Clio 's father .
The 7 - year - old was found at 3:32 p.m. , West said in a statement .
Petty Officer Dayton Trubee of the Coast Guard said he was not present during the rescue effort , but heard from his colleagues what happened when they grabbed Peter Axlerod out of the sea 's grip .
" They told me when they pulled them on board he was exhausted , " Trubee said .
" He really did n't have any idea what happened to his daughter .
He was totally worn out from just struggling . "
Six others at Acadia suffered broken bones and cuts from the effects of the intense waves , West said .
Park officials had warned visitors of the dangers of the surf , West said , but he was not sure whether those seven pulled out by the massive wave got the warning .
West said that people ask why rangers did n't just close off the park 's shoreline .
" The reality is we have so many miles of boundary that if we close up one section people just go to the other section , " he said .
Instead they concentrate rangers in the areas they know people want to visit , he said .
But nature can't be managed .
The second wave has been reported by some as a rogue wave , because it was unexpected and " monstrous , " said Chief Christopher Wheeler of the Coast Guard 's field office for Northern New England .
Martel said she did not initially think the waves would be an injurious , " imminent " threat .
" It 's kind of like a false sense of security , and then out of nowhere comes this monstrous wave that 's like , holy moly , " Wheeler said .

Philosophical Isms
Here are 234 different isms , each representing a philosophical , political or moral doctrine or a belief system .
In selecting terms for the list , I have deliberately avoided any word which apply ism to a personal name , so that Marxism does n't count although it is otherwise an ideal candidate for the list .
I also excluded isms which do not refer to a specific belief system , such as impressionism ( an artistic movement ) or alcoholism ( a disease ) .
Despite these omissions , enough remain to leave an ism in every pot , including beliefs about proper government , God , and the nature of existence itself .
Of the terms on the list that are of a religious nature , most are Christian , which is not unexpected , but I 'm open to adding isms from other world religions .

Let ’s start by talking about how Goldman makes money .
Over the past generation  ever since the banking deregulation of the Reagan years  the U.S. economy has been “ financialized . ”
The business of moving money around , of slicing , dicing and repackaging financial claims , has soared in importance compared with the actual production of useful stuff .
The sector officially labeled “ securities , commodity contracts and investments ” has grown especially fast , from only 0.3 percent of G.D.P. in the late 1970s to 1.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2007 .
Such growth would be fine if financialization really delivered on its promises  if financial firms made money by directing capital to its most productive uses , by developing innovative ways to spread and reduce risk .
But can anyone , at this point , make those claims with a straight face ?
Financial firms , we now know , directed vast quantities of capital into the construction of unsellable houses and empty shopping malls .
They increased risk rather than reducing it , and concentrated risk rather than spreading it .
In effect , the industry was selling dangerous patent medicine to gullible consumers .
Image Paul Krugman Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Goldman ’s role in the financialization of America was similar to that of other players , except for one thing : Goldman did n’t believe its own hype .
Other banks invested heavily in the same toxic waste they were selling to the public at large .
Goldman , famously , made a lot of money selling securities backed by subprime mortgages  then made a lot more money by selling mortgage - backed securities short , just before their value crashed .
All of this was perfectly legal , but the net effect was that Goldman made profits by playing the rest of us for suckers .
And Wall Streeters have every incentive to keep playing that kind of game .
The huge bonuses Goldman will soon hand out show that financial - industry highfliers are still operating under a system of heads they win , tails other people lose .
If you ’re a banker , and you generate big short - term profits , you get lavishly rewarded  and you do n’t have to give the money back if and when those profits turn out to have been a mirage .
You have every reason , then , to steer investors into taking risks they do n’t understand .
Late Saturday night , former Village Voice sales rep Joseph Holladay was attacked on New York City ’s Upper East Side by a half dozen young men in an apparent hate crime ; the men were screaming anti-gay slurs while beating Holladay , who lay lifeless before a friend got him to a hospital .
The NYPD ’s Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in the investigation , and investigators have deemed the attack a hate crime .
But a little over a week before , in the wee hours of June 19 , transgender woman Leslie Mora was walking home from a nightclub in Queens when she was attacked by two men with a belt who screamed the word “ faggot ” at her in Spanish .
According to the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund , the attackers “ stopped only when a passing motorist threatened to call the police . ”
The alleged suspects , Trinidad Tapia and Gilberto Ortiz , were arrested shortly after fleeing the scene .
Except while the Queens County District Attorney charged the men with “ assault with intent to cause physical injury with a weapon , ” it ’s refusing to investigate the attack as a hate crime .
Under New York State Law , attacks qualify as hate crimes if they are based on actual or perceived sexual orientation .
( Thanks , Lena )
UPDATE : New York ’s U.S. Sen .
Thomas
Duane says his office is aware of the case , and : “ New York State ’s Hate Crimes Law , which I fought hard to pass , clearly states that crimes in which individuals are targeted and attacked because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation are classified as hate crimes .
Ms. Mora ’s account of her assault appears to fit this definition .
I expect the Queens District Attorney will expedite its investigation and pursue the case to the fullest extent of the law . ”
Not exactly a demand the DA treat this as a hate crimes case .

Wired so I did n't see Kevin Kelly 's article called " Here Comes Everybody ( my views on that are I do n't usually readWired so I did n't see Kevin Kelly 's article called " The New Socialism : Global Collectivist Society is Coming Online " .
I did n't miss much .
It was a precis of Clay Shirky 's bookHere Comes Everybody ( my views on that are here ) , about how the Internet is dramatically enhancing our abilities to cooperate , collaborate , share , join and do all kinds of groupy things , prefaced by a few paragraphs in which he tried to claim that this groupiness is " socialism " .
In that it 's social , or something .
KK does n't really care if it 's socialism or not of course , but using the word in the pages of a Condé Nast - owned publication sounds daring and provocative , so why not ?
And what else would you expect from someone who calls himself " Senior Maverick at Wired Magazine " [ link ] ?
( In the comments section of the first link of the following paragraph , Seth Finkelstein says all this more energetically . )
" at the core of socialism is coercion " so " I will never agree to call what millions have voluntarily created on the Net ' socialism . '
That term insults the creators , and confuses the rest . "
I did n't read his posts when they first came out either , so I missed the sentence " No one forces Wikipedia editors to build a free encyclopedia " , which is close enough to a certain book title to catch my eye .
Law professor Lawrence Lessig took umbrage at the dread word , because
" Item one : under Lessig ’s definition , when the Young Socialists League of the Socialisty Socialists of America organizes its volunteer commune in Ann Arbor , this commune is n’t a socialistic one , because no - one is being forced to join .
Item two – that if you are to deplore your critics for having mysteriously misinterpreted you as associating coercion with Stalin , you probably should n’t have been arsing on about Stalin , collective farms und so weiter in your original post .
This class of rhetorical maneuver is what we call running with the hare and coursing with the hounds in the country where I grew up . "
This sent be back to the original articles , which I read with increasing irritation .
I 'm eagerly awaiting Henry Farrell 's promised longer post on the subject , but there 's no sign of it yet .
So as a substitute here 's what gets me pissed off about the Lessig / Kelly debate .
It 's not what they disagree about that annoys me .
Is this socialism or is this just love ?
At some point the label does n't matter : you say tomayto and I say tomahto , a rose by any other name , sticks and stones , etc .
No , it 's what they agree on that drives me spare .
The idea that the technological innovation surrounding the Internet is a transformative social movement and , what 's more , a political movement in the broad sense .
LL and KK ascribe explicit political consequences to open source software , the hacker ethos , Wikipedia , and so on .
They adopt and share with others an implicit belief in technological determinism , in which new technology is inherently linked to a particular kind of progressive and liberating social change .
Clay
Shirky is another who looks at the world this way :
" The internet ’s output is data , but its product is freedom , lots and lots of freedom .
Freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of association , the freedom of an unprecedented number of people to say absolutely anything they like at any time , with the reasonable expectation that those utterances will be globally available , broadly discoverable at no cost , and preserved for far longer than most utterances are , and possibly forever . " [ link ]
KK calls the development of open source and social software " an alternative to capitalism and corporatism " , and LL sees the debate in explicitly political terms :
... sloppiness here has serious political consequences .
When a founder of the movement which we all now celebrate calls this movement " socialist , " that plays right in the hand of those would attack everything this movement has built .
Here 's the problem .
This rhetoric of liberation has led many a talented and idealistic young person to believe that coding , especially for free , is a political statement .
In the guise of an anti-establishment , scrappy , can - do underdog attitude , LL , KK and their colleagues have created an environment in which well - intentioned people really believe that the commercialization of friendship by Facebook is a democratizing force , that it 's progressive for technology entrepreneurs to make billions from the work of artists who get nothing , and that posting book reviews on Amazon and movie reviews on Amazon - owned IMDB is contributing to a public good .
In which otherwise intelligent people believe that Google and Twitter are somehow morally different from Microsoft and Wal - Mart because their employees are younger and because they use phrases like " radical transparency " without living up to them .
in its portrait of Flickr founders Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield : " IPOs ?
Web 1.0 .
Building it and flipping it to Yahoo , Google or Microsoft ? Web 2.0 " .
The Internet does n't have one product , it has many products .
Some of which are wonderful and some of which are politically reactionary .
It has produced some admirable and exciting cultural innovations , and it has also led to a huge influx of money to the pockets of Silicon Valley billionaires and away from proprietors and employees of small - scale , independent outfits that are vital to our cultural health .
The Internet is not inherently anti-corporate and it is not anti-state .
If you want to be part of an anti-corporate movement , simply doing your digital thing is not enough .
Google is not an upstart .
Anyone who can read their statement about making YouTube profitable and still think Google is run by coders , not bean counters , is kidding themselves .
their statement about making YouTube profitable and still think Google is run by coders , not bean counters , is kidding themselves .
The open source " movement " is not a political movement and open source is not a political virtue .
Open source is perfectly compatible with businesses as conservative as they come .
The largest death machine on the planet has its own open source initiative [ link ] ; anything key to IBM 's strategy is not an alternative to capitalism .
Of course , Google says that in building its new Chrome OS on top of Linux " We have a lot of work to do , and we 're definitely going to need a lot of help from the open source community to accomplish this vision " [ link ] .
So go ahead , help them , but do n't think you 're doing something progressive .
I 'm not saying that the Internet is inherently reactionary , any more than it is inherently progressive .
Political activists are spending a lot of time building digital tools to help maintain movements and promote worthwhile causes , to promote worthwhile goals , and these are useful activities .
Even I use Drupal and CiviCRM for groups I am a member of .
But let 's not think that these tools make this generation of activists materially different from previous generations .
Elsewhere on this blog Phil Edwards ( blog here ) relayed a question he asked John Curtice : " has pervasive Internet access been a force for good in terms of expanding participation , i.e. were people who would n't previously have been informed & involved using the Net to get informed & involved ?
His answer was , um , no , not really - political activism was a minority pursuit & always had been , and the Net had n't made it any less of one .
Afterwards I asked the Shirky / Howard Dean question - had the Net been a negative influence , in that the frictionless ease of Net activism actually attracted people away from real - world politics ?
His answer was , um , no , not really - political activism was a minority pursuit & always had been , and in all probability the same minority were going to the physical meetings and joining the Facebook groups " [ link ] .
Somehow the digirati choose to ignore the fact that the major media corporations they love to knock are doing just fine in the brand new world of the Internet - but then a Condé Nast publication may be expected to believe that .
LL's talk of a " hybrid economy " is filled with optimistic assumptions about the behaviour of the new corporations and breezy acceptance , even approval , of the fact that his young children 's everyday social interactions are now a legitimate target of advertisers .
Even when a cool kid shows signs of disillusionment , as Boing Boing 's Cory Doctorow did recently , he wraps his claims in qualifiers : I sympathize with companies and creators who want to keep Google or Amazon from becoming gatekeepers on culture .
Not because of who runs Amazon or Google -- I know senior people at both companies whom I believe to be honorable and decent -- but because no one should be that gatekeeper .
I 'd oppose consolidation in distribution and sales channels , even if the companies involved were Santa Claus Inc. , Mahatma Gandhi Ltd. , and Toothfairy Enterprises LLC . [ link ]
Cory - you 're on the right track , but why would you think that the character of the people you know matters a damn ?
It certainly sounds like you think the " honorable and decent " nature of people at Google and Amazon ameliorates the impact of those companies .
The problems with the mainstream institutions you have so little time for are nothing to do with levels of honour and decency among their senior people .
This is not a matter of good guys and bad guys .
As someone who knew a bit about socialism once said " In the social production of their existence , men [ and women too ] inevitably enter into definite relations , which are independent of their will , namely [ the ] relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production . "
So let 's get some things clear .
I 'm not anti-technology .
But it 's time to think about the Internet and digital technology in the same way that we think of the road system or other pieces of our social infrastructure .
It would be ludicrous to claim that roads have one product .
I just watched my son drive off with a car full of friends to a weekend at a cottage - a form of freedom possible only because of the technology of the road .
But I worry a little , as any parent does , because roads are dangerous places too ( as a scar on forehead from when I was eight years old reminds me ) .
Few people are pro- or anti-road in general any more ; instead the interesting questions are about how to make the most of the benefits roads can bring and how to limit the damage they can cause .
The same goes for the Internet : let 's not assume its progressive nature , let 's not assume that everyone working in an open source manner or building new technologies is somehow on the same side , let 's appreciate those who are building progressive spaces on the Internet because they are progressive spaces , not because they are on the Internet .
Some of those young people have created great things .
Others have been suckered into digital sharecropping efforts believing that they are doing something worthwhile , painting a fence for some Tom Sawyer with a venture capitalist behind him who makes a mint off their efforts .
And others have become those rich young men ( almost always men ) with their private jets .
As Time Magazine wrote in its portrait of Flickr founders Caterina Fake and Stewart Butterfield : " IPOs ?
Web 1.0 .
Building it and flipping it to Yahoo , Google or Microsoft ? Web 2.0 " .
But I did see Henry Farrell 's fine post , calling Lessig 's arguments " a horrible , horriblemess " :
Forget about nuclear winter .
Humans are resilient .
We will survive .
So how many nukes will it take to destroy every single human being in the planet , on first blast ?
Here 's the calculation in graphic form — with a surprising answer :
The first part of the graphic — created by David McCandless — shows how much space is actually used by the entire population .
According to the Guardian Datablog and the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , only 12.5 % of the planet 's surface is actually occupied by humans .
A total of 18,617,500 square kilometers .

Now , the most powerful active nuclear warhead in the world is the B83 , which has a destructive power of two hundred Little Boys , the bomb that destroyed part of Hiroshima .
That 's a 14.9 - square - kilometer total destruction area .
Complete instant tanning , and obliteration of anything in sight .
To give you an idea of what this space means , Manhattan is 58.8 square kilometers .
Central London is 26 square kilometers .
What Is This ?
I will tell you :
This is the place where Humanity reached one of its lowest points in history .

Now divide the total number of square kilometers by the destruction radius of the B83 to get the total number of nukes required for instant annihilation .
As you can see , we need 123.36 times the amount of nukes available today : 10,227 nukes vs 1,241,166 nukes needed to completely disintegrate every single one of us in a millisecond .
Conclusion : WE NEED MORE NUKES , NOT FEWER .
Better die instantly than having to survive nuclear winter and yet another horrible movie with Mel Gibson playing Mad Max .
One that would last for a few hundred years at that .

For more than 200 years , buried deep within Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence and papers , there lay a mysterious cipher -- a coded message that appears to have remained unsolved .
Until now .
The cryptic message was sent to President Jefferson in December 1801 by his friend and frequent correspondent , Robert Patterson , a mathematics professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
President Jefferson and Mr. Patterson were both officials at the American Philosophical Society -- a group that promoted scholarly research in the sciences ...
Business is back on Wall Street .
If the good times continue to roll , lofty pay packages may be set for a comeback as well .
Based on analysts ' earnings forecasts for 2009 , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is on track to pay out as much as $ 20 billion this year , or about $ 700,000 per employee .
That would be nearly double the firm's $ 363,000 average last year , and slightly higher than the $ 661,000 for the average Goldman employee in fiscal 2007 , according to analyst estimates reviewed by The Wall Street Journal .

Officers from the Met are in Lithuania to warn women about trafficking London could see an increase in prostitution and sex trafficking in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics .
A report by the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) warned the increase in would put women at risk .
Thousands of site workers , spectators and athletes are expected to fuel the sex industry boom .
During the Athens Games , sex trafficking almost doubled and there were reports of sex attacks in the athletes ' village at Sydney in 2000 .
A small increase in the number of trafficked women working in the five Olympic host boroughs has already been noted .
The eyes of the world will be on London during 2012 and the possibility of damage to the reputation of not only the Met but London and the UK is considerable
Lynne Abrams , MPA Lynne Abrams , of the MPA , said despite warnings , people responsible for security during the Olympics have not yet formed plans to tackle the issue .
" There is considerable international evidence to suggest that such an increase in population in the context of the Games may have an impact on women 's safety . "
She added : " The eyes of the world will be on London during 2012 and the possibility of damage to the reputation of not only the Met but London and the UK is considerable . "
Officers will be trained to spot women who are forced to work as prostitutes and the police are also expecting a rise in domestic attacks , rape and sexual assaults following increased drinking during the Games .
A special team of officers will work with the boroughs in east London and immigration officers to target those involved in human trafficking , the report said .
In the lead up to the Games , 100,000 people will be involved with the preparation and the event itself will see 10,500 athletes , hundreds of thousands of spectators and 20,000 journalists .

i Phone 3GS users , try this :
Go to the App Store , download Yelp , and shake your phone three times .
What happens next should make anyone who eats smile , and anyone who makes review apps tremble :
Yelp 's got augmented reality .

The secret feature , called Monocle , works a lot like the other AR apps we 've seen so far for the iPhone and Android , except instead of overlaying subway stops or Netherlands real estate onto a live camera view , it hang up little icons for Yelp - reviewed establishments — including restaurants — letting you know exactly where , and how far away from your mouth , they are .

This is one of the first iPhone apps to use this style of augmented reality , which is n't really supposed to come of age until iPhone OS 3.1 .
Yelp does n't explicitly mention this feature in their App Store listing , which I 'll take to mean they 're still in the testing stages .
That wo n't stop me from using the shit out of this thing , until my stomach literally ruptures .

Taste
Test is our weeklong tribute to the leaps that occur when technology meets cuisine , spanning everything from the historic breakthroughs that made food tastier and safer to the Earl - Grey - friendly replicators we impatiently await in the future .
Microsoft has given the press a limited preview of some of the new features that will be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard , and while the Twitter and Last . fm functionality has yet to arrive , what is there points to a rosy future for the 360 as a media box ... not to mention a more friendly platform for advertising .
Let 's take a look at the changes coming to the system .
Netflix is now browsable , without an extra computer
One of the nicest additions to the service is the ability to browse the content available via Netflix .
Streaming Netflix content on your 360 used to require a computer or laptop to fill your queue , but will soon be able browse movies directly from the system — a much - needed update .
You can also share content with your friends in a virtual movie theater , where your Avatars watch the same film or TV show , as long as everyone has Netflix .
I 'm not sure how many people want to see movies together with your virtual friends , but hey , it 's there .
Netflix is now also more adaptable to " changing network conditions . "
You also have the ability to see what your friends are watching , or you can choose to hide that information .
Netflix is much easier to use on the Xbox 360 , and content is likewise simple to find and watch .
If you liked the Netflix feature before , be prepared to fall in love .
Rate games , spiff up your avatar
Combing through arcade games and content used to be something of a pain , but now you can rate every game , every add - on , every arcade release , and likewise arrange games by rating .
Right now Geometry Wars Evolved has 78 ratings , showing four and a half stars .
That 's a game worth checking out !
Bankshot Billiards 2 , on the other hand , shows 22 ratings with an average of two and a half stars ... you may be safe skipping that one .
While putting too much stock in user - controlled ratings may not be wise , they certainly give you another data point when browsing titles , and could help to separate the good stuff from the junk .
With so much content on Xbox Live , every little bit helps .
The system is also granular , meaning that a game is rated , as well as its add - on content .
That way users can send the message that a certain game is great , but a $ 5 update that adds bigger breasts to the NPCs is rather lame .
One annoying issue ?
When you select " top rated " under Game Add - Ons , it gives you the top rated games , not the content .
I would have loved to have seen what content was top rated , but the system apparently is n't set up to share that sort of information .
For instance , I know that Mass Effect is a highly rated game , but that should n't make it jump to the top of the charts in Game Add-ons when the Bring Down the Sky content has zero ratings .
Disappointing .
You can also now check out the expanded store for clothing and accessories for your Avatar , although there is n't much there to see yet .
You can browse through branded clothing from Halo 3 or Fable 2 , or simply pick up some Steampunk duds .
How does 80 Microsoft points for Black Boots sound ?
Or 160 points for a Halo Hoodie ?
The concept of real money for fake goods is nothing new , and with Microsoft using Avatars for more and more content , this sort of for - pay add - ons may catch on faster than many expect .
Indie games , Games on Demand , and other updates
Community Games have now been rebranded as Independent Games , and with the aforementioned ratings , are now much easier to browse to find good games .
The new name , matched with user ratings , should do much to make this area of Xbox Live much more popular .
There is a slot for Games on Demand , but we 've been told the 360 games wo n't be available until a later preview closer to August .
The rest of the updates may sound unremarkable when taken individually , but as a group they add much usability to the system .
Party invites are now one - click affairs , and if you become disconnected you 're automatically reinstated into the party .
This now a badge showing how long you 've been an Xbox Live subscriber , and you can get a feel for how many achievements you 've earned with new graphical information .
Console settings have also be re-organized to be easier to use .
The only issue is that , at least in the preview build given to the press , the responsiveness of the dashboard has been severely compromised .
The 360 runs slllloooowww at the moment , with frequent pauses and stutters between windows .
I 'm sure that 's an issue with what may be unfinished code , but at the moment the system can be frustratingly unresponsive .
Buying full games with real cash , not points , as well as Twitter , Last.fm , and Facebook functionality will be coming in future updates , but so far we like what we see .
If you 'd like to take the update for a test drive yourself , sign up for the testing program ; Microsoft is allowing a good amount of gamers to explore the new options .
The latest to leave  Ms. Burgueno and her husband , Mr. Ramirez , who fixed cars for sale in Mexico  packed up in July after the bank gave them $ 1,500 to leave by the end of the month .
As she gathered the last of her belongings , Ms. Burgueno asked the oldest Winkler daughter to sit with her in the repossessed home because its near emptiness gave her the heebie - jeebies .
“ I have learned that you ca n’t trust anyone but God , ” Ms. Burgueno said .
“ Nothing falls from the sky . ”
Her eyes hardened with hurt when she talked about her home while standing on the steps of the courthouse in nearby Corona , where the house was to be auctioned by the bank .
“ I think a lot of these investors are taking advantage of people ’s problems out here , ” Ms. Burgueno said .
“ I heard about a guy who bought like eight houses out here for $ 80,000 .
To me , it is n’t right . ”
Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Winkler , the couple with two daughters , dream of moving on someday , but know there is no chance for that now .
It has been a humbling time , an object lesson with a high cost .
“ In the long run , I think the people might have actually learned something , ” Mr. Winkler said on Memorial Day over a hamburger cooked on the grill .
“ This might be a good thing . ”
Mr. Blanco , the unemployed electrician , remains a picture of nervous cheer .
He has had time to learn English , to think about a new career .
He is studying cooking , and all the physical therapy for his injured back has made him extremely fit .
He spends his free time studying , or blasting Michael McDonald on the stereo while frenetically cleaning the house he is not sure will remain his .
When he begged the bank for a loan modification that he appeared to qualify for under the latest plan passed by Congress , he was rebuffed .
Now that he has stopped making mortgage payments , he said , the bank is calling him back , looking to do business again .

The Science of Kids
Nick is a 6 - year - old boy who does n’t lie .
At least according to his father , Steve .
So imagine Steve ’s chagrin when he witnessed what a hidden camera had documented in the McGill University laboratory of psychologist Victoria Talwar .
In order to win a prize , Nick readily cheated in a game , then lied to cover up his cheating .
When pressed , he elaborated on his lie , and he showed not a glimmer of remorse .
Indeed , he was gleeful .
Is Nick a “ young sociopath in the making ? ” Probably not .
In fact , he ’s fairly typical of 6 - year - olds , who lie about once an hour , usually to cover up a transgression of some kind .
That ’s about twice as much lying as 4 - year - olds do , which suggests that kids are learning to lie .
Looking at kids of all ages , fully 96 percent are liars .
Indeed , Talwar views lying as an important developmental milestone , linked to intelligence .
That does n’t mean lying is okay , and both father and son know this .
It ’s uncomfortable to watch Nick squirm through his lies as he digs himself in deeper .
And Steve is a fairly typical parent too , in the sense that all parents are very bad at lie detection .
What ’s more , Nick likely learned to lie from watching his parents tell white lies .
Parents typically view precocious lying as innocent , something that will correct itself ; but in fact a lot of kids get “ hooked ” on lying very early .
Nick ’s story comes from science writers Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman , who include it in NurtureShock , their delightful new collection of essays on the “ science of kids . ”
Though not exactly a parenting manual , the book does offer a lot of useful information on why kids do what they do .
For example , Talwar and her colleagues have tried using stories to teach kids like Nick to curb their lying .
In one study , they had kids listen to either " The Boy Who Cried Wolf " or " George Washington and the Cherry Tree " ; they heard the story after they had cheated , but before the psychologist asked them about cheating .
For those who do n’t recall : In " The Boy Who Cried Wolf , " the shepherd boy lies repeatedly about a wolf , and in the end is eaten by a wolf when nobody believes his calls for help .
So it ’s about severe punishment for lying .
George Washington , by contrast , tells his father the truth about chopping down the tree , and is forgiven and praised for his truthfulness .
When Bronson and Merryman conducted a survey , three of four respondents said the wolf story would be the more effective teaching tool , but in fact it was the opposite .
The honest George tale cut lying by 75 percent in boys , and 50 percent in girls .
Why ?
Probably because kids already know that lying is a punishable offense ; they ’re not learning anything new there .
What ’s new — and welcome information — is that honesty might bring them both immunity from punishment and parental praise .
Bronson and Merryman ’s essay on lying is representative of this engaging volume , in its mix of pitch - perfect science writing and soft - pedaled guidance for parents .
Many of their essays — on sleep , racial attitudes , self - control , sibling relations , and more — are animated by actual flesh - and - blood kids , who we meet on an excursion through many of the nation ’s top child psychology laboratories .
It ’s a rewarding and entertaining excursion .
NurtureShock is published by Twelve Books , and is in bookstores now .

The Linux Foundation hopes to raise cash by branding a Visa card with its cutesy Tux mascot .
Executive director of the org , Jim Zemlin , said people can carry " Tux in their pocket " to show their support for Linux .
The foundation has buddied up with CardPartner to offer the Platinum credit card through UMB Bank .
It is only available in the US for now .
The Linux Foundation will suck up $ 50 for every activated card , and the group will be handed an additional undisclosed percentage of every purchase made with the credit card .
" Funds raised from our new Visa card program will go directly toward providing community technical events and travel grants for open source community members in order to accelerate Linux innovation , " said the group .
As for the small print , the card comes with zero per cent introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first six months only .
Thereafter , APR charges will apply no matter how adorable Tux looks on your bit of plastic .

In retrospect , all the signs were there .
But six months ago , back in July 2009 , no one actually guessed that Peter Mandelson was about to become Labour 's seventh prime minister .
The suggestion had been doing the rounds at Westminster , of course , as one of those frivolous " what if games " – such as " what if John Smith had lived " , or " what if Tony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in 2001 " .
That was n't the same as predicting the events of the hot summer to come .
Long before the bond crisis of late August , and Alistair Darling 's resignation , which followed hours later , Lord Mandelson ( as he was still known then ) had been teasing journalists with his ambitions .
In an interview with the Financial Times , published in June on the day Brown attempted one last relaunch , he was in flirtatious mood .
" I can well do without it , " Mandelson said , asked if he wanted to lead Labour .
" I 'm trapped , " he added of his peerage .
" I believe it is for life ... of course , you could always change the law . "
At private dinners he was rumoured to go further , speculating on whether it was constitutionally possible to rule Britain from the Lords and citing Lord Salisbury as a precedent .
But everyone took it as a bit of a tease : Peter being Peter , Labour 's naughty uncle .
Looking back it is hard to understand why untested Alan Johnson was still seen as the obvious successor , or why indecisive David Miliband fancied his chances after twice ducking out of the challenge .
Mandelson had established himself as the second most senior member of the government and had insisted on the title to go with it – first minister .
After years in Brussels , he had experience and credibility unmatched by anyone in British politics apart from Brown .
There was talk of him becoming the first president of the European Union , if the Lisbon treaty was ratified .
David Cameron 's short stint as a television executive still looks small by comparison .
" Whenever I returned to London from Brussels or elsewhere in the world , I felt that Westminster was a bit parochial , " Mandelson had told the FT in June .
" But actually , it 's nice to be home , and it 's nice to be welcomed home . "
Opinion differed on the warmth of the welcome and on what motivated Mandelson to keep the Brown premiership afloat .
Some wondered whether he had , as he claimed , really changed his opinion about Blair 's successor , or whether his deeper loyalty was to the Labour cause – or simply his own career .
Everyone knew that he could have brought down Brown in the crisis that followed the European elections , but he had persuaded Blairites such as Miliband to stay loyal .
Ironically , the beneficiary of that was to be Mandelson himself .
Brown never recovered from his June election drubbing , and the attacks on spending that Cameron pressed home over the summer .
The prime minister came to depend more and more on Ed Balls and Shaun Woodward , the former Tory MP who had become a close ally – to Mandelson 's barely disguised contempt .
It was inevitable their refusal to admit that public spending had to be cut would fatally spook the markets .
In the last week of August , news hit the City that Standard & Poor 's had downgraded Britain 's credit rating .
Hours later the Treasury announced an auction of £ 4bn worth of 25 - year bonds at 4.5 % had failed – dealers dismissed them as a risky punt compared with the security of German or US loans .
The chancellor was forced by Downing Street to make a live broadcast dismissing the story as " incomplete and misleading " .
But when the governor of the Bank of England confirmed his deep alarm about Britain 's inability to pay its way , Darling 's resignation became inevitable .
Perhaps Brown might still have survived , if he had not gone to ground in his Fife family home .
The street outside was blocked by satellite broadcast vans as reporters relayed news of his silence .
The BBC even hired a helicopter ( later much criticised as a waste of £ 12,000 ) to film the prime minister 's empty back garden .
That afternoon a big British building society collapsed under the strain of bad loans in the commercial property market and the FTSE fell sharply .
The prime minister 's claim to have turned round the economy was in ruins .
He made one last effort to stay on , announcing from Scotland that Balls was to become chancellor and Woodward chief secretary , in charge of spending .
The appointments simply added insult to injury .
In London , the cabinet gathered to issue a private ultimatum : Brown must go or they would quit – and to everyone 's surprise , he folded .
He gave a dignified final statement to Sky News , before flying to Harvard with his family .
He has not spoken in public since .
Given the circumstances , Labour 's long - formal process of electing a leader was untenable – the new prime minister might not be in place much before Christmas .
Under the party 's constitution , the cabinet found itself able to postpone the contest and pick one of its own to serve immediately .
Harriet Harman 's Newsnight announcement that she expected to get the job only added to the panic .
The next morning , Mandelson , as the dominant figure in the cabinet , was elected on a show of hands .
He headed for Buckingham Palace and soon after swept into Downing Street in the prime minister 's Daimler .
Polls showed that most people were unaware that it was constitutionally possible for a peer to be prime minister .
Even constitutionalists were divided over whether the practice had fallen beyond revival into disuse – but the Commons was in such low esteem after the expenses scandal that voters did not seem to care .
And conveniently , Speaker Bercow kept his silence .
After all , Mandelson 's predecessor , Brown , had not been elected to the post either .
And as someone pointed out , Clement Attlee had once declared Lord Salisbury , the last peer to enter Downing Street before Mandelson , to be the best prime minister of his lifetime .
Journalists turned to Vernon Bogdanor 's new book on the constitution , and found an appropriate quote from Trollope : " Anything is constitutional or anything is unconstitutional just as you choose to look at it . "
Within days Mandelson had introduced a bill for rapid democratic reform of the Lords .
He won support when he persuaded Vince Cable to become his independent chancellor .
John Cruddas and James Purnell joined the cabinet ; soon after , Mandelson – released from the Lords – fought and narrowly won a byelection to get him back into the Commons .
The general election date was confirmed well in advance : 6 May 2010 .
With just months to go , an emergency programme of cuts has given the government an austere sense of purpose – the halving of the Olympic budget , the scrapping of Trident , and withdrawal from Afghanistan are said to be just the start .
The Tories have been outflanked .
At 34 % , their poll rating is now just 1 % ahead of Labour .
The once unimaginable – a Labour fourth term – is on the cards .
" A fighter , not a quitter " , as somebody once said – but who would have thought that the path to power would be paved with ermine .
What are these programs ?
Income - Based Repayment ( IBR )
Pay As You Earn ( PAYE )
Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF )
The Basics
Income - Based Repayment ( IBR )
Income - Based Repayment ( IBR ) is the most widely available income - driven repayment ( IDR ) plan for federal student loans that has been available since 2009 .
Income - driven repayment plans can help borrowers keep their loan payments affordable with payment caps based on their income and family size .
IBR will also forgive remaining debt , if any , after 25 years of qualifying payments .
Who can use IBR ?
IBR is available to federal student loan borrowers with either Direct or FFEL loans , and covers most types of federal loans made to students , but not those made to parents ( click here for more about qualifying loans ) .
To enter IBR , you have to have enough debt relative to your income to qualify for a reduced payment .
That means it would take more than 15 % of whatever you earn above 150 % of poverty level to pay off your loans on a standard 10 - year payment plan .
Please see the Department of Education 's Repayment Estimator to see if you 're likely to be eligible .
How does IBR make payments more affordable ?
IBR uses a kind of sliding scale to determine how much you can afford to pay on your federal loans .
If you earn below 150 % of the poverty level for your family size , your required loan payment will be $ 0 .
If you earn more , your loan payment will be capped at 15 % of whatever you earn above that amount .

For each additional person , add : $ 6,240 $ 7,800 $ 7,170
The chart below shows examples of IBR payment caps as a percentage of the borrower 's total family income , based on various incomes and family sizes .

What about interest ?
In some situations , your reduced payment under IBR may not cover the interest on your loans .
If so , the government will pay that interest on your Subsidized Stafford Loans for your first three years in IBR .
After three years and for other loan types , the interest will be added to the total amount you owe .
While your debt may grow if your affordable payments are low enough , anything you still owe after 25 years of qualifying payments will be forgiven .
What are qualifying payments ?
The Department of Education has indicated that the following types of payments will count towards IBR 's 25 - year forgiveness period , as long as you are in IBR at some point during those 25 years .
Payments made in the Income Contingent Repayment plan ( ICR ) before July 1 , 2009 .
All payments made on or after July 1 , 2009 in the IBR , Income Contingent Repayment ( ICR ) , and Standard ( 10 - year ) Repayment plans .
Periods when the borrower has a calculated payment of zero in IBR or ICR ( this occurs when your income is at or below 150 % of the poverty level for your family size ) .
Periods on or after July 1 , 2009 , when the borrower has been granted an economic hardship deferment .
Find out more about how to qualify for IBR .
Pay As You Earn ( PAYE )
Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ) is a repayment option for federal student loans that has been available since 2012 .
It can help current students and recent graduates keep their loan payments affordable with payment caps based on their income and family size .
PAYE will also forgive remaining debt , if any , after 20 years of qualifying payments .
Who can use PAYE ?
Pay As You Earn is available to federal Direct student loan borrowers , and covers most types of Direct loans made to students , but not those made to parents ( click here for more about qualifying loans ) .
To be eligible for PAYE , borrowers must have taken out their first federal student loan after September 30 , 2007 and at least one after September 30 , 2011 .
You must also have to have enough debt relative to your income to qualify for a reduced payment .
That means it would take more than 10 % of whatever you earn above 150 % of poverty level to pay off your loans on a standard 10 - year payment plan .
Please see the Department of Education 's Repayment Estimator to see if you 're likely to be eligible .
How does PAYE make payments more affordable ?
PAYE uses a kind of sliding scale to determine how much you can afford to pay on your federal loans .
If you earn below 150 % of the poverty level for your family size , your required loan payment will be $ 0 .
If you earn more , your loan payment will be capped at 10 % of whatever you earn above that amount .

What about interest ?
In some situations , your reduced payment under PAYE may not cover the interest on your loans .
If so , the government will pay that interest on your Subsidized Stafford Loans for your first three years in PAYE .
After three years and for other loan types , the interest will be added to the total amount you owe .
While your debt may grow if your affordable payments are low enough , anything you still owe after 20 years of qualifying payments will be forgiven .
Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF )
Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) is a program for federal student loan borrowers who work in certain kinds of jobs .
It will forgive remaining debt after 10 years of eligible employment and qualifying loan payments .
( During those 10 years , the Income - Based Repayment ( IBR ) plan can help keep your loan payments affordable . )
Who can get PSLF ?
This program is for people with federal student loans who work in a wide range of " public service " jobs , including jobs in government and nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations .
What are eligible jobs ?
In most cases , eligibility is based on whether you work for an eligible employer .
Your job is eligible if you :
are employed by any nonprofit , tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization ;
are employed by the federal government , a state government , local government , or tribal government ( this includes the military and public schools and colleges ) ; or
serve in a full - time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps position .
If you do n't meet these criteria , the Department of Education 's regulations create a two - part test of other circumstances under which you may still be eligible :
(1 ) your employer is not " a business organized for profit , a labor union , a partisan political organization , or a non-profit organization engaged in religious instruction , worship services , or any form of proselytizing ; "
and ,
( 2 ) your employer provides any of the following public services : emergency management ; military service ; public safety ; law enforcement ; public interest law services ; early childhood education ; public service for individuals with disabilities and the elderly ; public health ; public education ; public library services ; and school library or other school - based services .
These definitions of eligible jobs reflect the Department of Education 's final regulations for PSLF , as posted in the Federal Register in 2009 .
What kinds of loans does it cover ?
It covers federal Stafford , Grad PLUS , or consolidation loans as long as they are in the Direct Loan program .
Borrowers with FFEL loans must switch to the Direct Loan program to get this benefit .
When does the 10 - year clock start , and which payments count ?
Only payments made after October 1 , 2007 count towards the 10 years ( 120 monthly payments , not necessarily consecutive ) required for Public Service Loan Forgiveness .
Qualifying payments are payments made through the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program in any of the following three repayment plans : the Income Contingent Repayment plan , the Standard ( 10 - year ) Repayment plan , and the Income - Based Repayment ( IBR ) plan .
To count , these payments must be made while you 're working full - time in an eligible job .
" Full - time , " according to the final regulations issued by the Department of Education , means an annual average of 30 hours per week or the standard for full - time used by the employer , whichever is greater .
For people working part - time at two or more qualifying jobs , " full - time " means an annual average of 30 hours across all jobs held .
In professions such as teaching , annual contracts that include at least eight months of full - time work will be treated as the equivalent of a full year 's employment .
If you meet all the criteria , the earliest your remaining debt could be forgiven is October 2017 .
What if I 've already paid off my loans by then ?
This loan forgiveness program will only benefit people who still owe money on their federal loans after 10 years of eligible payments and employment .
If your income is low relative to your debt , and you qualify for reduced payments under IBR ( or Income Contingent Repayment ) at any time during those 10 years , you will likely have debt left to forgive .

Fascism , state terror and power abuse
A satanic ( luciferian ) world order - starting in the cradle of civilisation , Iraq
The perpetual war , to end all peace - but Bush , Blair and the rest are on a hiding to nothing
Do please take the time to look through the evidence compiled by the 9/11 truth movement .
Democratic institutions and rights , particularly in the UK & US , are under sustained covert attack .
The same neoCon mafia who got away with Iran / Contra ( where the US military used illegal drug money to fund far right uprisings ) are now at the helm of the most powerful nuclear armed state in the world .
British and US occupying forces are dishing out ' government approved ' terror alongside CIA trained fanatics .
More worryingly NATO / Israeli special forces appear to be responsible for hundreds of false flag attacks targetting civilians in occupied lands which are then blamed on various local factions .
As in Operation Gladio ( watch the BBC Timewatch DVD ) carried out by NATO Intelligence prove , this is nothing new .
The NATO / Zionist alliance are fuelling anti-Western hatred round the world and channeling massive public funds to the Carlyle Group / Halliburton / military industrial complex .
The ultimate objective appears to be to generate an economic and nuclear crisis ( and permanent massive military spending ) to ' rescue '
Western economies and bounce us all into a far - right global police state .
The links between ' defensive ' treaty bureacracy NATO and the Nazis are too many to ignore .
War is terrorism with a bigger budget
You could be endangering your family and loved ones by not having read this book - 911 Synthetic Terror , Made in USA by Webster Griffin Tarpley
Documents like those of the New American Century project and Zbigniew Brzezinski's book ' The Grand Chessboard , American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives ' explain the plan which includes extending military objectives and operations to information warfare .
But does the end justify the means ?
As the extraordinary events unfold in this ' war on terrorism ' I present an alternative chronology .
Based on the idea that the main public offices and centres of power in the world , politics ; police ; education ; the press ; armed forces and royalty have been heavily infiltrated by a rogue network of selfish psycopathic liars .
Here you will find well researched , often mainstream press articles , which show another side to events , namely that a US corporate led fascist system of global control is gradually being imposed around the world .
' And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet '

' So let us fight together with Israel , with our Zionist brothers against all anti-Zionists , against all cultural Marxists / multiculturalists . '
20 . april 2012 av Torstein Viddal
I happened to be present at the Oslo courthouse on Tuesday , April 17th , watching and listening to 22/7 terrorist Anders Behring Breiviks 75 minute main prepared defense speech .
A speech that the press and media were banned from broadcasting to the general public .
These are my thoughts after following the story for almost nine months .
The first thing that has to be said , is that watching Breivik defend himself for 5 hours this Tuesday removed each and every doubt that he is indeed « legally sane » , in the sense that he is absolutely fit to be punished by the Norwegian judicial system for his criminal terrorist acts .
All « experts » who say otherwise are flat out lying .
This is a sane , rational , logically stringent man of great wit , who happens to also have some pretty effed up ideological views that have made him become a mass murderer and a terrorist .
It should also be said right from the start of this article that there is little doubt that he carried out both the bombing in Oslo and the shooting at Utøya .
What remains to be seen is whether he had accomplices and what parts of the misdeeds these people took part in .
There were also some pretty amazing instances of police SNAFU  27 according to one commentator , but a lot more if you look more closely .
Theres a string of maybe 40 or 50 or 60 grave mistakes on behalf of the police , guards and government , making them unable to stop Breivik before the bombing of Oslo , stop him getting out of Oslo and to nearby Utøya , and to stop the shooting ASAP when Breivik amazingly managed to get himself transported over the sound to Utøya island , using the Labour Partys own ferry .
So many instances of SNAFU , in fact , that the mathematical probability of them all occuring on the same day or relating to the same person , should tell you all you need to know .
And of course , in the weeks and months after the terror , documents , tapes and other evidence started disappearing .
As by invisible hands .
OK .
So , returning to the terrorists defense speech on Tuesday , April 17th .
Breivik started telling us how thered been no real post - WW2 democracy in Norway , because « nationalists » like himself were not allowed free speech and democratic rights .
This should tell us that he wanted there to be more democracy , and that Norwegian democracy should also include « ultra nationalists » , a fair point that even I could agree on .
However , he messes it up by contradicting himself completely .
He loves America , and especially a certain McCarthy , the postwar communist witchhunt general , and he regrets that McCarthyism didnt go far enough and never succeeded in sending alleged « commie » American citizens to Soviet Russia .
So , really , when it comes to a more real and including democracy with less political censorship , our terrorist is only in favour of it when it applies to his chums , and to his « nationalist » parties .
Apart from this ideologically induced blindness or logical breakdown , he argues convincingly that censoring a movement like his own for too long , eventually will make members of that movement resort to other means , even violence .
His speech more generally was aimed at reaching out to a slightly broader audience than his Manifesto and his earlier writing on Norwegian websites , or to « unite national conservatism , which I support , with national socialism and militant christendom » , as he put it himself .
So the strategy obviously is to appeal to a broader spectrum of racists , and to play down the Zionist issue , which devides Breivik , JDL , EDL , NDL and Knights Templar , on the one side , from other nationalists and nazis , on the other .
Breivik talks rather openly about the strategy of supporting and expanding « street extremism » , like the JDL , EDL and NDL ( Jewish , English and Norwegian Defense League , respectively ) , while at the same time building a network of single cell terror operatives , borrowing tactics from  yup  al - Qaida .
The reason for using terror cells consisting of only one man , says Breivik , is to avoid the eyes of anti-terror agencies .
This way he only needed to meet with his comrades once or twice during a decade , if we choose to believe him , and I guess blogs , forums , RSS feeds , social media etc took care of the rest .
Breivik also tries to use the term « counter jihad » as much as possible , rather than « zionism » , which is what he really supports , and he has succeeded in selling this bogus « counter jihad » term to the Norwegian mainstream media .
To quote from the terrorists Manifesto :
« So let us fight together with Israel , with our Zionist brothers against all anti-Zionists , against all cultural Marxists / multiculturalists . »
So , then , this is what it came to in Norway :
Where we could have had the press digging into and revealing the horrific lies of the 9/11 terror attacks ten years after the events , instead we got a snob from the West who bombed his own city using « al - Qaida tactics » , and who shot fellow Norwegian kids taking part in a summer youth camp for young politicians and future administrators , because he believed the lies and racist conspiracy theories fed to him for ten years by every newspaper , radio and TV station in this nation and throughout the West .
Malicious , racist lies about muslims behind every terrorist act from New York and Bali , through Madrid and London , to Mumbai and Stockholm .
The mythical snake  Midgardsormen  seems to be biting its own tail : False - flag terrorism over a long , sad decade goes unnoticed by the press , the journalists and the editors , and the inevitable end - product of these ten years of lies and cowardice and cover - up is our very own Nordic mass murderer and terrorist ; Anders Behring Breivik .
Whether he had handlers or not we dont know , and the press and the police for some reason dont seem very eager to find out , he is now the shining example , or knight in shining armour , intended to inspire many , many followers in Scandinavia , Europe and America .
He will even be allowed internet access in jail , and thus to build , expand and strengthen his zionist terrorist networks , both on the streets and in the single - man sleeper cells .

Brief History of the New World Order
The same old economic crisis is now repeating itself as these Elitist Bankers are getting ready for their WW3 after having sucessfully weakened the USA and Britain .
What this author failed to point out more clearly is the the real power behind these Banking Mafia , namely the Rothschilds and their secretive infamous dynasty that have been behind all the tragic Wars in the last 200 years or so .
How they have used and abused every nation , leaving them economically weakened and bankrupted , to achieve their ultimate goal - namely their New Wolrd Order - their hegemony for a One world Government , One world Bank , Currency , Military , Police - a Totalitarian World Fascist Government that resides at present in Tel Aviv but has its Financial Devil 's den in London where it has been manipulating world events and economies .
Their next War will of course be against Iran , Syria , Lebanon and any other nation they want to rope in to their scheme of things .
They have destroyed and bakrupted the USA , economically as well as politically and morally ; have ensured the weakening of China through its unwise investments in the USA , outsourced businesses etc to India , its next little growing financial darling Enterprise ; detroyed other nations ' economies also through constant price fixings and manipulations and thus also ensuring all the relevant Laws are put into place to guarantee the fruition of the NWO .

A Brief History of the New World Order
February 2009 - Richard Moore

" For more than a century , ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well - publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions .
Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ' internationalists ' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world , if you will .
If that 's the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . "
David Rockefeller , Memoirs , 6-11 -6
World War I and the birth of the new - world - order project
The beginning of anything is always problematic to pin down .
For every beginning , there are always antecedents , causes , preparations , broader canvases to consider , etc .
For my money , World War I the war to end all wars is a sensible choice , as the launch - event into the new world order project .
Of course one must go further back for motivation , the conception of means , and for the vision .
Some refer all the way back to The Illuminati , which was ( still is ? ) a real conspiratorial clique aiming for global governance , .
Others refer to Cecil Rhodes , who quite effectively used his wealth from diamond mining to promote his vision of global Anglo - Saxon dominance .
Regardless of the details of the preceding historical thread , WWI was the epochal event that began an identifiable program toward a new world order , a single global hierarchy , controlling all global affairs , under the control of elite financiers .
The British Empire represented the ultimate evolution of one particular path to global dominance : a single hegemonic power , playing off other powers against one another in a balance of powers strategy .
Certain mechanisms of power were perfected in this era .
I refer to the integration of propaganda , racism , intelligence operations , covert intervention , diplomacy , financial manipulation , and naked military power all orchestrated , with considerable art and brutality , in the pursuit of imperialist objectives .
The real power behind the British government , however , by 1900 , had long been the elite banking families of The City , in league with their colleagues in Europe and America .
In Marxist terms , we would call this community the capitalist elite of the day , and they were the ones envisioning our now - unfolding new world order .
Within the context of the British Empire , they had exercised considerable power over global affairs and finance , and they had outgrown the relatively limited vision of the British imperial model .
Britain itself , circa 1900 , despite being still seen as the greatest world power , had become only a shadow of its former self .
Once the manufacturer to the world it enjoyed a near monopoly on industrial production for a century it had now been eclipsed industrially by both Germany and the USA .
Britain was no longer the obvious choice , as the base for a global power grab .
As Alexis d'Tocqueville had noted earlier in Democracy in America , the nations most inherently destined for greatness were the USA and Russia .
Of the two , c. 1900 , the USA was certainly more promising , from a capitalist perspective , as a power base .
So the decision was made , to shift hegemony from London to Washington , and to create the context for a more evolved model of global hegemony .
For centuries
The City 's banking elite and Britain 's nationalist elite had collaborated harmoniously .
One might not have imagined a distinction between them ; they were , it seemed , of a whole .
But while in British circles generally , c. 1900 , European dominance and the rise of Germany were the big issues , the bankers were looking at a broader canvas , and with a longer - range lens .
A splitting of the ways was beginning , and a betrayal among global elites was in the offing .
In British nationalist eyes , control over the balance of power in Europe was everything .
America was far away , and up until then its only imperialist adventures were also far away , peripheral to European affairs .
Germany , however , had become an urgent threat to European dominance , with its industrial productivity and its plans for a Berlin - Baghdad railway and a wider rail network , undercutting Britain 's sea- based dominance of world trade .
British nationalists , quite naturally , were thinking in terms of war with Germany , as the only available means of maintaining British hegemony .
The banking elite , more slyly , was seeing such an adventure as a way to kill several birds with one stone .
And thus began a classic betrayal scenario .
For the time being they were still seemingly one , still comrades , the bankers and the nationalists .
They worked together to set the stage for war , creating encircling alliances which would bring everyone and their cousin in against Germany and her allies , once a match was lit under the carefully prepared conflagration .
And then came the small matter of finance .
Long before , the Rothschilds , the classic model of an elite banking family , learned that the financing of wars is the most profitable and reliable of all banking operations .
Britain could indeed prosecute the war with Germany , with the help of her alliances , and prevail , and she could also stake out strategic claims in the Middle East but where would she get the money for the troops and ships ?
Do n't worry about that , we 'll take care of you , said the friendly bankers .
So Johnny goes marching off to war , allegedly to end war , while the British state pursues with vigor its nationalist objectives .
Meanwhile the City 's bankers appointed their man in America JP Morgan to broker America 's support of the British war effort .
By making America the financier and goods - supplier of Britain 's war on Germany , Germany could be brought to its knees militarily , and Britain could be brought to its knees financially while at the same time America could be turned into a proto - superpower .
All of these things coming together at one time that is why I see WWI as the birth of the new - world - order project .
WWI was the making of America , as a world power .
Its actual military participation was minimal , late , and secondary .
Much more important were the internal industrial expansion , the influx of funding to the domestic economy , and the business consolidation that occurred .
Money went from New York to London , on loan , and then the money was sent back to Chicago , or Cleveland , or wherever , to purchase the goods of war .
While Europeans and Brits were being slaughtered in their millions , Americans were experiencing boom times , leading into its golden age of the roaring 1920s .
When the war ended , Britain had accomplished her imperial objectives , had won the battle for European hegemony , and eliminated Germany as an immediate threat .
In the process , however , she had inadvertently lost the war for global hegemony : Europe was no longer the focus of world power .
Guns and troops had won the battle , but debt had won the war .
All of Europe winners and losers alike were destitute as the war ended , and the victorious allies were encumbered by astronomical debt to the American Treasury and to the banking elite .
The European economic malaise that emerged out of the Treaty of Versailles is usually blamed , in popular mythology , on the ' shortsightedness of chauvinistic diplomats ' , eg. Clemenceau , in seeking revenge on their erstwhile enemies .
Or it is blamed on ' narrow - minded protectionist measures ' adopted by European nations in the postwar years .
In reality , it was the enforcement of debt collection that caused the malaise , and it was Morgan 's men , not diplomats , who dictated the draconian terms of repayment .
The betrayal , of Britain by the bankers , was now complete , and the dagger was being twisted in the guts of the betrayed .
Britain and its allies could not afford the repayment terms out of their own pockets , so the fiction was propagated that Germany had started the war , and that it must therefore pay reparations to the innocent victors .
As usual , the victors write the histories .
The whole repayment scenario was carefully scripted by Morgan 's men , in the terms of the treaty , so that Europe would be struggling for decades to pay their debts to America and to Morgan 's financing syndicate .
The focus of global hegemony had shifted Westward across the Atlantic .
While Europe had been devastated by war , America had built up its infrastructures and expanded its industrial base .
While Europe emerged deeply in debt , America emerged with a strong balance sheet and an astronomical amount in the accounts - receivable column , to be paid by the war 's ' victors ' , and subsidized by the ' losers ' .
While Europe struggled to rebuild requiring still more borrowing America could continue its economic expansion , capture global markets , and generally exploit its privileged financial and industrial position .
From a nationalist perspective , we could say that America won WWI , and all of Europe lost and lost big .
The Europeans were bound to pay America huge sums for the privilege of having devastated one another .
But in America as in Britain , one must draw a distinction between nationalist - minded elites , and financial elites .
During the war the bankers had shown the face of a true comrade to both Britain and America enabling the one to win the war , and facilitating the rise to power of the other .
Each of the banker 's " friends " got what it wished for .
( One needs to be very careful of what one wishes for . )
We have seen how the banking comrade betrayed his British nationalist friends , by shifting the ground of hegemony westward while the old ground was being bitterly contested .
It turns out that the American nationalist friends were also betrayed at the same time , by the same banking comrade , in a coup that will be described in the next section .
Britain had won the battle for Europe , for a while ; America had won the battle for strongest nation , for a longer while but it was the banking elite who won the war for discretionary power over the future course of world affairs .
The Federal Reserve and the subversion of the American republic
" Let me issue and control a nations money and I care not who writes the laws . "
Amshall Rothschild
" If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currencies , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their prosperity until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . "
Thomas Jefferson
Even while Britain was arranging its encircling alliances , and creating the conditions for inevitable war , banking - agent Morgan and his cohorts were busy arranging the means of financing the adventure , and creating the conditions so that that the banking elite would be the decider - behind - the - scenes and a primary raker - in - of - profits , as America exploited its position of dominance in the post - WWI era .
The time - tested formula , by which banking elites had come to dominate European governments , was the creation of a privately - owned central bank .
Such a bank , according to the trusty formula , has the power to control credit , the money supply , and interest rates , to issue the currency of the nation , and to loan that currency at interest to the government .
The implementation of that fatal formula in America , however , had severe obstacles to overcome .
The dangers of a central bank were well known to the Founding Fathers , and sentiment among political elites remained strong in the republic against such an institution .
Earlier implementations had occurred , and each had been dissolved , to beneficial effect , by a subsequent administration .
In order to overcome these political obstacles , the bankers employed two other time - tested formulas : buying politicians , and creating panic through engineered crisis .
Like so many well - minded politicians , who for the most part try to do good during their tenure , Woodrow Wilson found it necessary , at a critical juncture in his career , to make a pact with the devil .
The path to the Presidency would be opened to him , and in most things he could have his own mind , but if a bill came before him establishing a central bank , he was to sign it .
The pact was made , the coffers were opened , and the road to the Presidency was successfully travelled .
With Wilson elected , and his signature assured , it remained only to manipulate the Federal Reserve Bill ( which was written by banking - agent Paul Warburg ) through Congress .
Step
One was to create a banking panic , which JP Morgan was able to accomplish simply by leaking rumors to the press that a certain New York bank was in trouble , causing a run on the bank , and from there the crisis spread domino - fashion and general panic ensued .
When the panic was at its peak , the Federal Reserve Bill was introduced into Congress , along with false and sombre assurances that the result would be financial stability , and an end to boom - bust cycles .
The general panic created enough political support that a vocal minority of Congress came to support the bill .
Step
Two , in manipulating the bill through Congress , was to call for a vote late one night , when most of Congress had gone home for Christmas , while the minority - in - favor had been tipped off to stick around .
The bill passed , Wilson signed it promptly , and the coup was complete .
The devil got his due , and just in time to maximize elite gains ( both political and economic ) from the financing of WWI .
Wilson lived to rue the day he shook hands with the devil .
He expressed this later in strong terms :
" We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the world no longer a Government of free opinion , no longer a Government by conviction and vote of the majority , but a Government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men . "
" Some of the biggest men in the United States are afraid of something .
They know there is a power somewhere , so organised , so subtle , so watchful , so interlocked , so complete , so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it "
The war had served as a vehicle to transfer the focus of hegemony to America , and much else was shipped across the Atlantic along with that focus .
The lessons Britain had learned in its centuries of empire were brought over as well the sly coordination of the overt and the covert , secret collaborations between private and public actors , the artful use of deception and betrayal , and all the other tricks of internal intrigue and geopolitical dominance .
The Council on Foreign Relations was established , directly on the model of a similar British organization .
The emerging American giant was being carefully tutored by past masters of global games .
In a single decade the Anglo - American banking elite had managed to devastate Europe , launch America on the path to hegemony , secure direct control of American finance and behind - the - scenes control of American political affairs and rake in astronomical profits in the process .
Let this be a lesson to those who assume that elites are n't clever enough to carry out big projects successfully in this complicated world of ours .
And in fact these kinds of elite manipulations are not really rocket science .
When you have control over finance , and you have your tentacles into high - level political circles and you have centuries of experience at this kind of thing there 's a lot you can accomplish using routine methods .
Among the routine methods are deception , betrayal , artificial crises , bubble and burst economic cycles , engineered conflicts and above all never hesitating to finance wars to get what you want ; genocide is a legitimate means .
As Henry Kissinger put it , when America betrayed the Kurds and was enthusiastically supporting Saddam Hussein , " You ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs " .
It 's really just a matter of thinking big , and not giving a damn about anyone else but you and your friends and your shared power .
These people have a philosophy : if we were n't on top , someone else would be .
Typical gangster reasoning .
World War II and the consolidation of American hegemony
WWI had been such a successful project that planning began immediately for a grander sequel , another giant step toward a new world order .
In the early 1920's , still in the days of the Weimar Republic , a team of Krupp engineers were secretly tasked with a project : come up with designs for a line of military equipment suitable for a war twenty years from now .
Thus were conceived the advanced weapons that served the Reich so well when the time came .
Even though Germany was destitute , and treaty - bound not to rearm , someone knew , and told Krupp , that all this would change and within the designated timeframe .
There were two primary elite objectives for the inter - war years : collecting the WWI debts , and creating the conditions for a larger - scale war that would consolidate America 's hegemonic role in world affairs .
As in WWI , the plan would be to get others to do the hard work , and for the yanks to come in when most of the fighting was over , pick up all the marbles , and score the points for victory .
And once again , the banking elite would be financing the war ( as it turns out , all sides ) and raking in profits beyond measure .
Ongoing destitution in Europe was useful for two reasons : it maximized debt repayment , and it created the conditions in which elites could socially engineer the reconstruction process .
Destitute people are likely to accept whatever crumbs of hope are thrown their way .
When Mussolini came along , with his vision of fascism , elites saw a man who could ' instill the discipline ' necessary to enable debt repayment .
He was promptly funded by the Anglo - American bankers .
Mussolini 's fascist ideas resonated with ideas popular among American elites .
Eugenics , for example , including the killing or sterilizing of " undesirables " , was a cause promoted by Rockefeller , Ford , and many others .
And the primary tenet of fascism , the individual is subservient to the needs of the state is music to the ears of ruthless elites everywhere , and in particular to our friendly banking elites .
Hitler was a project of the Anglo - American bankers .
His charismatic brilliance was noticed early , and his Mein Kampf served as an effective marketing brochure for himself : here was a man determined to do exactly what the financial elite would love to see happen he wanted to invade and decimate the anti-capitalist Soviet Union .
His rise to power was funded largely through the auspices of the Anglo - American bankers , and immense profits were made by investing in the German rearmament process .
And he was good about debt repayments .
Germany fighting Russia , that was a good start for the next war project .
Meanwhile , in the Pacific , Japan was looming as a new power .
In 1905 she had bettered Russia in the Russo - Japanese war and she was rapidly industrializing .
Japan had imperialist aspirations and this fit perfectly into elite planning .
Japan against China , and Germany against Russia , was precisely the kind of global war that elites , comfortable in New York , would be happy to fight , and win .
Many a dollar was made investing in Japan 's imperialist adventures , and selling them supplies and equipment , prior to Pearl Harbor .
Meanwhile , in the USA , there were profits and gains of other kinds to be made during the inter - war years .
First came the bubble , aka the roaring twenties .
Everyone and his cousin was playing the market .
Everything was going up , as carefully stage managed by the new Federal Reserve financial autocracy .
With a strong economy , and all that cash coming in from debt repayments , the bubble was easy to manage .
Lots of people made a bundle , but the biggest bundles were stashed away by those at the top who financed the episode .
The house always wins .
Next came the consolidation phase , aka the Great Depression .
If America was to emerge from the next war project as global hegemon , the important thing was to own as much of America as possible .
By comparison , current profits were secondary .
And the most convenient way to buy up American assets was to create a depression , whereby everything would be on the market at fire - sale prices .
Elementary , my dear Watson .
All of these threads wove together perfectly as WWII began .
The masses of people in Europe and Asia were engaged in murdering one another , and destroying one another 's countries , while the USA continued to stay out of the fray , and the Anglo - American banking elite was profiting from its investments and loans to all sides of the conflicts .
America 's entry into the war was carefully delayed , coming just in time to determine the outcome , but after much of the fighting had already occurred .
In order to facilitate this delay , the virtues of neutrality were promoted in the mainstream media right up until Pearl Harbor , despite considerable grassroots anti-fascist sentiment .
When the right time came for entry , banking - agent Roosevelt initiated a series of provocations against Japan , designed to force them to attack .
The Japanese codes had been broken , the date of the attack on Pearl Harbor was known , and the valuable aircraft carriers were put safely out to sea .
Out - of - date ships were left as sacrificial lambs , eg the Arizona .
Day of Infamy indeed .
By such an arranged incident , the neutrality propaganda could be instantly reversed , and a declaration of war readily obtained from a neutralist - minded Congress .
Many of them pacifists yesterday , the young men of America were now all lining up to enlist .
So easy , when you pull all the strings , to turn a whole nation around on a dime .
" If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany and that way let them kill as many as possible , although I do n't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances . "
Harry S. Truman , New York Times , June 24 , 1941
Even after declaring war on Japan and Germany , America participated only marginally , with a holding action in the Pacific , a troop buildup in the British isles , and a bombing campaign against the Reich .
The real fighting was happening in China and on the Eastern Front of the German campaign .
America was happy for the fighting to go on , as long as a big winner did n't emerge , a potential threat to US hegemony .
Every day the fighting continued , the bankers were profiting from the financing , and potential rivals to America were being weakened .
Only when Germany was defeated at Stalingrad , and the huge Russian army began advancing westward , did America finally commit masses of ground troops to combat .
There was no need to defeat Hitler ; Stalin was taking care of that business on the Eastern Front , where 80 % of the German divisions were fighting .
The task of the American troops was to race eastward to halt the advance of Russia as quickly as possible .
Much to the consternation of Stalin , after the allies landed in Italy , the yanks allowed three more German divisions to transfer unmolested from Italy to the Eastern Front , as one way of slowing down the Russian advance .
Once again betrayal , this time of ally Russia .
The WWII project achieved all of its objectives admirably .
While having fought only marginally , and suffered negligible casualties in comparison with the other major combatants the US emerged with an intact infrastructure , 40 % of the world 's wealth and industrial capacity , control of the seven seas , a monopoly on atomic weapons , strategic footholds in the Middle East oil sheikdoms , and general popular acclaim as the heroic champion of democracy .
Quite naturally , the world 's eyes turned to Washington for leadership in shaping the postwar world .
And America was ready with a blueprint .
The bankers had selected a committee , from their Council on Foreign Relations , and sent it over to the White House to design the postwar architecture .
America was now secured as a hegemonic base of operations , more viable for that role than Britain had been , and it was time to move forward with the next phase of the new - world - order project .
Thus were launched , promptly after the war ended , the Bretton Woods globalist institutions the UN , IMF , and World Bank the early foundation stones for an eventual one - world government .
Note to the reader :
In my harsh description of America 's participation in WWII , I in no way mean to dishonor the brave men and women who fought and sacrificed in that war as GI's .
They were not deceiving or betraying , they were fighting with all their hearts for freedom .
They were as much the victims of elite games as were all the others who lost their lives .
The short American Century : preparing the world to accept global governance
The WWII project was , like the first war project , a remarkable success for the banking elites .
Again , as before , the next stage of the larger new - world - order project was promptly set in motion .
With its hegemonic position , America would serve as an ideal base of operations for this next stage , but a global American Empire was not to be the final outcome .
America was to be used and betrayed , like Britain before it , and this time the plan called , and still calls , for a world government to be installed , making the whole Earth into a base of operations , a private fiefdom , to be owned and ruled directly by the banking elite .
The unfolding of this third phase of the new - world - order project took about six decades , and as we lived through it we saw what seemed to be many surprising and unpredictable episodes .
However , if we step back and look at the big picture , the key elements of the project become clear .
The following objectives have all been achieved , and they were all carefully orchestrated to reach their conclusions at about the same time , which turned out to be the end of 2008 :
the rise and fall of America as hegemonic imperial power the preservation of American military supremacy as its only major asset the universal destabilization of localized economic systems a worldwide extended boom - bust cycle , ending with most of the world destitute and hopelessly in debt
In the final section of this article we will examine how these conditions are currently being exploited , under the charismatic and deceptive leadership of banking - agent Barak Obama , to bring about the final installation of the New World Order .
In this section , we 'll briefly review how each of these objectives was systematically achieved .
As it was in the heyday of the British Empire , the interests of banking elites and nationalist - minded elites ( in America this time ) were more or less aligned as the postwar era began .
A grand campaign of imperialist operations in the Global South served both their interests .
With a policy of containment with respect to the communist world , and of Pax Americana with respect to Europe precluding Europe from becoming a military competitor America was able to maintain military hegemony in the " free world " and use its forces to achieve direct imperialist objectives in the Global South , without needing to directly confront other major powers .
America employed a much more refined and efficient model for imperial management than the British Empire had ever been able to achieve .
Besides avoiding direct military conflicts with major competitors , Washington spurned the burden and expense of colonial administration , and instead focused on regime - change operations as a way of keeping small nations under control .
The installation of corrupt dictators was the preferred model ( eg , the Shah , Noriega , Marcos , Saddam , etc ad nauseum ) , who once installed were encouraged to enrich themselves and their cronies as they suppressed their populations , so that investors from the North could exploit the nation 's resources and workers .
Eventually such dictators would always outlive their usefulness .
Either they would lose control of rebellious populations ( eg Marcos ) , or they would get uppity and start defending their national interests ( eg Noriega ) .
When such a time came , the elite - controlled mass media would suddenly discover that there was a ruthless dictator loose in the world , and the successor regime change would be widely welcomed as a ' victory for democracy ' .
The faces would change , and perhaps some reforms would be implemented , but in the end there would be another proxy in place doing whatever needs to be done to facilitate exploitation by foreign investors .
Such has been the nature of the free world era in the South .
A critical underpinning of the Cold War and the Pax Americana regime was the mythology of a communist threat .
In fact Russia posed no real threat , not militarily nor in terms of covert subversion .
Russia had been devastated by the war , and the last thing it wanted was to get involved in another one .
It had been invaded by Europe time and again , WWI being only the most recent example , and its main concerns were security and national development .
Russia tried time and again to normalize relations with the West , and to pursue large - scale nuclear disarmament , but was each time rebuffed .
With the destruction caused by WWI , and with the West again exhibiting hostility , Russia had little choice but to hold on to Eastern Europe as a protective barrier against another attack .
Certainly Eastern Europeans were not happy with clumsy , autocratic Russian rule , but they were not being economically exploited as was the Southern " free world " .
Living conditions in Eastern Europe were typically better than in the Soviet Union itself , and better than in the South .
It 's " satellites " were an economic and political burden to the Soviets , an investment not in imperialism but in national security .
Now that Eastern Europe has been separated from Russia , and Washington is putting missiles and radar installation there and extending NATO , it is clear that Russia 's attempt to maintain a buffer made perfect defensive sense .
The " communist threat " provided a handy excuse for US interventionism , for maintaining a strong US military , and for the ongoing development of America 's nuclear arsenal .
Equally important , enabled by the fiction that Russia threatened the entire West , America was able to portray itself as the ' friend and protector of Europe ' , justify the economic isolation of the socialist block , and justify as well the Pax Americana regime in the " free world " .
But as in Britain before , the interests of nationalism and of the banking elite were not to remain aligned .
Even as America continued to extend its hegemony in a geopolitical and military sense , the seeds of economic decline were being planted by the bankers .
The first step was to start moving manufacturing overseas , leading to the de- industrialization of America and yielding increased profits to investors and transnational corporations .
After that Reagan was ushered into power , bringing with him a full scale assault on the stability of the American national economy .
The program of economic destabilization was then extended globally , as the globalization project .
Globalization , with its deregulation of corporations and international finance , has certainly been a profit bonanza for international banks and transnational corporations .
It 's deeper purpose , however , has been to destroy localized economic systems and to make everyone dependent on the global marketplace for essential goods and services .
Not only has self - sufficiency been undermined for nations everywhere , but mutual - benefit bilateral trade arrangements have been largely eliminated as well .
Under the hocus - pocus doctrine of free trade , a situation has been created where , to the maximum extent possible , all goods and services are generated in the lowest - waged parts of the world , and then sold on the global market to the highest bidders .
Not only does this maximize the profits of the middlemen ( the bankers and transnational corporations ) , and drive wages down everywhere , but it also results in market prices that are largely beyond the reach of the Global South .
Under globalization , we 've seen the most draconian system of imperialism every imposed on the South , and it's an imperialism managed by the bankers ( via their globalist institutions ) directly , not by an imperialist nation , as in the days of earlier empires .
Just as with the Native Americans and the Australian Aborigines in the 1800's , the whole population of the South is now considered to be ' in the way ' of ongoing economic development and the accelerated exploitation of Southern resources .
A program of wholesale genocide , on a scale much larger than the Holocaust , is now underway in the South , facilitated by economic and social destabilization , in turn facilitated by " free trade " and by covert interventions .
The campaign for biofuel development , which makes little or no sense from an energy perspective , has the main ( and intended ) consequence of accelerating the program of genocide by substantially increasing the price of food on the global market .
Keep this in mind when next you listen to banking - agent Al Gore 's inspiring speeches about " energy independence " .
Of all the advantages the banking elites enjoy from this globalized and unregulated economic system , the most strategic is the discretionary power they have to arbitrarily manipulate global affairs .
And of the tools available to them under this regime , the most potent is the ability to manipulate high - level finance .
By such means Japan and the Southeast " Tigers " were cut down to size , and any number of other boom - bust cycles have been engineered over the past several decades ( eg Brazil , Argentina ) .
It is this ability to manipulate high - level finance that has been used to create the climactic conclusion of this short American Century : the engineered global banking collapse and the ensuing general panic .
This manufactured panic was then exploited to push through the disastrous bailout schemes that are transferring insolvency from the banks to the governments .
By intentionally committing economic suicide , the bankers have managed to kill not their banking system , but the economic viability of nations worldwide .
From a big - picture perspective , the entire period since the end of WWII can be seen as one big boom - bust cycle .
It brought us the greatest period of sustained economic growth the world has ever seen , and in the end , with the engineered collapse and bailouts , all the marbles are now being picked up by the banking elites .
Game over .
Obama and the marketing of subservience : installing the New World Order
As with the two world - war projects , the short - American - Century project was a complete success , in preparing the ground for a global system of governance by , of , and for the elite bankers .
Again , the main elements of this penultimate sub-project :
the rise and fall of America as hegemonic imperial power the preservation of American military supremacy as its only major asset the universal destabilization of localized economic systems a worldwide extended boom - bust cycle , ending with most of the world destitute and hopelessly in debt
To be more precise , the destitution and hopelessness are only now beginning to unfold .
We 've seen the first wave of business failures and personal insolvencies , but many more will follow domino fashion .
The amount of the losses the banks have suffered have still not been disclosed , and massive credit - card defaults are yet to come , as the ranks of the unemployed continue to soar globally .
The classic , time - tested way to implement big social - engineering changes is to first create a crisis , and then in the ensuing panic to offer a solution the ' solution ' being the original goal of the entire exercise .
We 've seen this formula used to facilitate the installation of the Federal Reserve system , the passage of the bailout schemes , the entry of America into WWII , etc .
On a still - grander scale , it is the formula that will lead to the creation of a one - world government .
The problem in this case is the collapse of national economies and the global financial system ; the solution will be a Global Central Bank in sum , a global - scale replay of the Federal Reserve project .
Banking - agent Gordon Brown seems to be the one who has been assigned the task of moving this agenda forward .
In a recent article in BBC News he begins framing the context of the debate to come .

Around 700 M - 16 rifle bullets were found yesterday in a package abandoned by the roadside in the Senyuva area of the Turkish capital , believed to have been dumped in panic by individuals related to Ergenekon .
The bullets were taken to the Ankara Police Department for examination .
Twenty - three bullets were also found in Izmir on Thursday , and seven hand grenades and other bombs were discovered abandoned in a similar fashion in Ankara on Wednesday .
Unidentified individuals have been abandoning weapons and ammunition in isolated locations across the country since the discovery of munitions buried underground early in January after raids on houses of various suspects who were wanted in connection with Ergenekon , a clandestine gang charged with plotting to overthrow the government .
In the meantime , Ankara police yesterday detained two men in the Yenimahalle and Keçiören districts .
The men were reportedly taken into custody after they were found to be carrying hand grenades .
The suspects were later transferred to the police departments counterterrorism unit ...;...

http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=165725&bolum=101
Thousands of people from various segments of society on Saturday gathered at Tünel Square in Istanbul 's Taksim area to protest the Ergenekon gang , charged with plotting a coup d'etat , in an event organized jointly by the Young Civilians and the No to Coups Platform .
Lawyers in their courtroom robes supported the demonstration demanding democracy , freedom , human rights and the supremacy of law .
The protest started at 4 p.m .
Many intellectuals , writers , artists and journalists also supported the march .
Slogans demanding resistance against military influence and intervention were chanted .
People held up posters against illegal and clandestine units inside the military and state bureaucracy trying to rule the country from behind the scenes .
Journalist Ümit Kivanç also joined yesterday 's protest .
He said the Ergenekon investigation should be continued until the very end .
Modern dance performer and choreographer Zeynep Tanbay said , " Sixty - one percent of the people are against Ergenekon .
People have woken up .
Rightists , leftists , religious right , atheists , all of them .
People want to face the truth . "
Well - known sociologist Ferhat Kentel said attempts to water down the investigation would be in vain .

' latest suspects are from the special operations unit of the police '
Most of the latest suspects are from the special operations unit of the police , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul says .
The unit was set up to fight against terror in the 1980s - and was mainly active against Kurdish separatists .
Human rights groups have documented many unsolved murders and disappearances from that time , she adds .
The unit 's former leader , Ibrahim Shahin , was arrested earlier this month , and a map found at his house led police to a cache of weapons buried in a forest .

The Bullingdon Club - Nat Rothchild 's smack Crazed Bully Boys
This morning 's Broadcasting House programme on Radio 4 heard from a fascinating witness to a Bullingdon Club initiation .
Here it is - 3 m 25 s long
http://www.bilderberg-mirror.org.uk/BullingdonClubIanRogers.mp3
That audio was posted here at UK Indymedia , now not just hidden but deleted
Also ...
The Mail On Sunday has an extraordinary revelation that the photo above has been photoshopped !
Who has been removed ???
Two faces are mysteriously missing from this picture of the Bullingdon Club
Who doctored the toffs ?
I bring you the Mystery of the Missing Toff .
Who is doctoring pictures of the Bullingdon Club ?
And why ?
By a mysterious process , almost all photographs of this unlovely society for rich , young drunkards have now been suppressed , which suits David Cameron very well , since he is in so many of them , looking so very rich and arrogant .
I have seen them .
But last week a new study of the lads appeared , featuring George Osborne and his ( now former ) friend Nat Rothschild .
To the left of the middle , theres a mysterious gap where somebody ought to be standing but isnt .
Odder still , theres a patch of shirt - front and waistcoat there , with no person attached .
Odder yet , Mr Rothschilds right trouser leg has a white lapel , not usual even under the bizarre dress code of the Bullingdon .
On close examination , the three seated figures at the front appear to have been stuck in place after being moved from somewhere else .
If you know whats going on , please let me know .
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080604/PETER-HITCHENS-Not-Kim-Jong-II-live-visit-Mandy.html
Great rant from Peter Hitchens
So here we see our new , one - party elite in all its lack of glory , interchangeable careerists from fake  Tory  and fake  Labour front benches , floating around in lukewarm seas of money with Russian oligarchs , hedge - fund millionaires , foreign media magnates and who knows what else ?
This , the Corfu set , is your choice at the next Election .
You can have one thing , or you can have the same thing .
If you want anything else , you can get stuffed .
These individuals have no interest in you , or in this country , nor much idea of how the rest of us live .
It is centuries since Britain was ruled by a set of people who have so little in common with those they govern .
What they re really embarrassed about this week is that you might realise that this is what they are like .
Peter Mandelson is less troubled than George Osborne because nobody would be surprised by anything he did , or anyone he met .
If Peter turned up in North Korea having cocktails with Kim Jong Il , it would be Kims reputation that got damaged .
But it is much worse for the Tories .
They have spent millions ( raised how , exactly ? ) on buying themselves a nice new image .
Now they fear that the whole lot has gone down the plumbing .
They tried so hard to avoid this .
David Cameron even had a pseudo - holiday in Cornwall , where he posed for pictures , before heading off for his real holiday in Yachtworld , where he wasnt so keen to be seen .
How it makes me yearn for the much - mocked old days of the grouse moors , and even Harold Wilsons expeditions to the Scilly Isles .
Our political leaders may not have been much good but at least they were ours , not the trashy flotsam of the global elite .
Nest of vipers , more accurately , exactly exemplified by the Bullingdon / Bilderberg / Banker / Mafia Corfu set
I like that story about Osbourne 's given Bullingdon nickname being ' Oik ' , because his baronetcy background was n't quite posh enough , and his initiative ritual - being held upside down by established club members and asked " What are you ? " , his head being repeatedly banged on the ground for each incorrect reply , until he came with the correct answer

The Hell Fire Clubs : Sex , Satanism and Secret Societies
The Hell Fire Clubs scandalized eighteenth - century English society .
Rumours of their orgies , recruitment of prostitutes , extensive libraries of erotica , extreme rituals , and initiation ceremonies circulated widely at the time , only to become more sensational as generations passed .
This thoroughly researched book sets aside the exaggerated gossip about the secret Hell Fire Clubs and brings to light the first accurate portrait of their membership ( including John Wilkes , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and the Prince of Wales ) , beliefs , activities , and the reasons for their proliferation , first in the British Isles and later in America , possibly under the auspices of Benjamin Franklin .
Hell Fire Clubs operated under a variety of titles , but all attracted similar members - mainly upper -class men with abundant leisure and the desire to shock society .
The book explores the social and economic context in which the clubs emerged and flourished ; their various phases , which first involved violence as an assertion of masculinity , then religious blasphemy , and later sexual indulgence ; and the counter - movement that eventually suppressed them .
Uncovering the facts behind the Hell Fire legends , this book also opens a window on the rich contradictions of the Enlightenment period .
Books : The Hell - Fire Clubs - Barbarians to Angels
Published Date : 11 October 2008
THE HELL - FIRE CLUBS BY EVELYN LORD ( Yale , £ 19.99 )
NOT , of course , that one approves of the ravishing of virgins or devil worship , but it 's still something of a let - down to find the goings - on at these notorious 18th - century gatherings so comparatively sedate .
They were n't exactly wholesome , Evelyn Lord shows , yet younger members of the royal family and future statesmen joined in these secret societies whose presiding figures were not Satan but Bacchus , Priapus and ( to a genuinely alarming extent ) Onan .
So
we 're talking  a bit bathetically  David Cameron , Boris Johnson and the Bullingdon rather than Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn .
But it 's still fascinating to see from Lord 's absorbing study how integral this sort of institutionalised decadence became to the fabric of the state at a crucial moment in its formation .
" Dour " or not , Scotland was not to miss out : there 's some intriguing discussion here of Fife 's " Beggar 's Benison " and of Edinburgh 's " Knights of the Mortar and the Cape " .

10Oct08 - Bilderberg exclusive - A False Flag Presidential Assassination ?
THE NEW 9/11
DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT :
Why the possible Assassination of George W. Bush will be an inside job .
https://secure.gn.apc.org/members/www.bilderberg.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3007
By Timucin Leflef ,
bilderberg.org
28th August 2008
Last updated : 8th October 2008
Over the next few weeks , there is a grave possibility that President Bush will be assassinated as part of a joint military / intelligence operation designed to further expedite the formation of a New World Order .
If the blame is put on an Iranian patsy , it will politically destabilize the United States and provide a perfect opportunity for Vice - President Dick Cheney to step in as interim president , declare martial law and ignite a war with Iran before the elections .
According to reports , the CIA have already been in Iran since 2007 setting up the pieces for the next war .
Consider the following :
 Iran is the only Middle - Eastern country aside from Iraq that has threatened to sell their oil in Euros and circumvent buying the United States  several - trillion dollar national debt which the Saudis do thanks to a plan set in motion by Bilderberg luminary Henry Kissinger .
According to author and lecturer Lindsey Williams , notable figures in the oil industry have recently given the Iranian government an ultimatum to sell their oil in U.S. dollars , or else . ( i )
 The Bilderbergers require a new war to continue destabilising the Middle East ( create a problem ) , plunder their vast resources and forge a New World Order ( offer the solution ) in its wake .
Bilderberger Wolfowitzs PNAC document  Rebuilding Americas Defenses Abroad clearly shows Iran as their next intended target . ( ii )
 They have hiked up the price of oil to give the USA the incentive to invade Iran .
At their 2007 meeting , the Bilderberg Group announced they would increase the price of oil from $ 3.50 a gallon to between $ 4 - $ 5 .
This is now giving the United States the incentive to pillage Iran for its huge oil reserves , even though there is evidence that Alaska has enough reserves to last them another 200 years .
( iii )
 People will not fall for the " WMD " lie a second time , so a majority consent will have to be manufactured with yet another false - flag terrorist operation  a New 9/11 - in order to justify the next invasion .
 A presidential assassination fits the bill this time round .
It will politically destabilise the country , create a state of National Emergency and provide the incentive for ( 1 ) the Declaration of Martial Law , ( 2 ) the incentive for a new war with the alleged Muslim aggressors , and ( 3 ) the excuse to control the US population using subdermally implantable RFID microchips under the false pretext of national security  - as was proposed at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting . ( iv )
 Day by day , a deliberate hatred is being fostered towards President Bush , even though it is evident he 's a puppet of the CFRs Dick Cheney and Bush Sr. and ultimately their controllers within the Bilderberg Group .
 Bob Woodward , assistant managing editor for The Washington Post , was recently chastised for revealing that both Dick Cheney ( CFR ) and Bush Jr. were being advised by Dr. Kissinger . (
v )
 Bush Jr. is the only one in his cabinet who is NOT a member of the CFR even though most presidents , including Bush Sr. have been in the past .
Was this done intentionally to keep him in the dark about CFR policy ?
Another notable exception was President John F. Kennedy , who was also assassinated . ( vi )
 According to reports , within the last year Bush has been calling for a new 9/11 which will be ten times worse than the previous one .
 He has recently visited Middle Eastern countries lecturing about human rights , thus giving the appearance of taunting Muslims , inciting further hatred and giving the incentive for " Al CIA - da " to attack .
 Were being told regularly on TV that he has been the least popular President ever .
 A book has recently been published :  The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder further compounding this justified notion . ( vii )
 In July , the Israelis averted an alleged " Al Qaeda " plan to target Bush 's helicopter . ( viii )
 He was greeted with angry protests in London last June when 2,000 people protested in Parliament Square against his wishes to attack Iran . ( ix )
 According to former Naval Intelligence officer Milton William Cooper , it was the Bilderberg Groups Policy Committee that gave the order to assassinate President Kennedy ( x ) .
This was at a time when he threatened to split the Central Intelligence Agency up for lying about the Bay of Pigs invasion .
It is rather curious therefore , that the Bilderberg Group met at Washington D.C. this year .
What do they have in store for the President this time round ?
 The  Death of a President docudrama - made in 2006 - paints an eerily credible portrayal of what may happen " 2 years in the future " when Bush is assassinated during a protest march . ( xi )
 Several other presidential assassination movies have since cropped up : Shooter , Vantage Point , and the remake of The Manchurian Candidate .
The first Manchurian Candidate movie was released shortly before Kennedys assassination .
 None of them show a black president , so an Obama hit is less likely at this time , as would be the motives for such an action by an alleged Muslim aggressor .
 Furthermore , Hollywood movies such as 300  foster support for a war with Iran ( Persia ) and can be likened to pre-war propaganda by the military - industrial complex .
The TV drama  Band of Brothers  was released just two days before September the 11th . ( xii ) Now they re working on a Band of Brothers 2 ( The Pacific ) which shall be released in 2009 . ( xiii )
 Members of Satanic Orders such as the  Skull & Bones are involved in sacrificial rituals , some of which may involve their own members .
 According to The History Channel documentary Secret Societies , Bush 's Skull & Bones Society nickname is ' Temporary ' ( xiv )
 Bush is a pawn of the Bilderberg Group through the Skull & Bones Society and the CFR members in his cabinet .
Pawns are often sacrificed in games of chess for a better chance of winning the overall game .
 Bilderberg policy takes 2 years to come into full effect within the country they meet .
 Bilderberg met in D.C. this year , which means a large scale event may occur in the USA quite soon .
A year after their meeting in Turkey , there has already been a successful " Al CIA - da " terror attack .
And leaders of the terrorist organisation ' Ergenokon ' were recently imprisoned for planning a military coup to oust the Turkish Prime Minister by 2009 ( within 2 years of the Bilderberg meeting ) .
 Last year it was reported that Kissinger Associates was advising presidential hopefuls to take a pro-war stance against Iran if they wanted to succeed .
 Bilderberger Zbigniew Brzezinski is currently Obamas advisor .( xv )
 Obama is being touted as a favourite by the Bilderbergers who invited both him and Hillary Clinton to their 2008 meeting . ( xvi )
 Bush declared at a recent meeting with the Israeli Parliament that he would start a war with Iran before his term is out and that he plans for Barak Obama to shoulder the burden of this war . ( xvii )
 In Alex Joness documentary Endgame ( 2007 ) , researcher Daniel Estulin stated that Bilderberg were not going to start a war with Iran . ( xviii ) .
This may very well be disinformation .
Veteran sleuth Jim Tucker contends they have been discussing an attack for several years now .
In Bilderberg 2007 , it was reported that the Turkish delegates unanimously stated that if there was to be a war with Iran , Turkey would have nothing to do with it .
This lead the Bilderberg Group to reply that a war with Iran would not involve ground troops , but an aerial bombing campaign .
( xix )
This shows they have clearly been considering it for quite some time .
 Such disinformation may have been deliberately disseminated to placate the many European Bilderberg Attendees so that the Policy Committee may wash their hands of responsibility if it were to arise eventually .
I can only imagine Dr. Kissinger stating  Well , Dick Cheney started it all .
We had nothing to do it  so that he may continue with his deathly New World Order policies and avoid being reprimanded for future war - crimes .
It will not be the first time this strategist and mega - manipulator has started a war , washed his hands of responsibility and carried off the hypocritical title of being a diplomat . ( xx )
 Some observers consdier that Bush Jr. is nothing more than Dr. Kissingers puppet .
At the time when Kissinger was National Security Advisor to a confused President Nixon , both he and General Alexander Haig were the true acting president ( s ) . ( xxi )
 There is also the possibility of engineering a " Civil War " which will give an incentive for UN forces to invade the United States in order to " keep the peace " .
This may be why certain Illuminati - backed " freedom fighters " are being kept alive , to be used as " leaders " of the revolt , especially ones who aid the " let 's hate Bush " campaign in line with the Bilderberg agenda .
If Bush were assassinated , it would also give them the excuse to round up many dissenters as well .
 Kissinger declared at the 1992 Bilderberg meeting :  Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order ; tomorrow they will be grateful .
This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond , whether real or promulgated , that threatened our very existence .
It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil .
The one thing every man fears is the unknown .
When presented with this scenario , individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government . ( xxi )
This quote could very well have suggested today 's CIA - trained and controlled  Al Qaeda terrorists , a probable Civil War , as well as a false - flag alien invasion scenario staged with the aid of NASA to convince the nations of the world to give up their sovereignty and band together under a one - world military dictatorship ( see NASAs  Project Bluebeam ) ( xxiii ) .
For the New World Order to emerge , all it may take this time is for Bush to take a dive in the final round of his presidency .
So when CNN , Fox News and other such news outlets declare :  Ladies and Gentlemen , the President has just been shot ! , please understand it is most likely part of the Global Elite 's strategy to further remove our powers , our freedoms and our sovereignty and expedite the coming together of a One World fascist military dictatorship run by the power - hungry elite .
Let s hope this particular scenario , which I certainly dont advocate , will not become an eventuality .

My Top Ten Conspiracy Facts
8th September 2008
As if the War ofTerror is some kind of ' accident ' or in any way a ' natural ' reaction to radical Islam - here are my present top tencopnspiracy facts
1. the combination of defence industries , the Military Industrial Complex , which conspire for world war
2. the NATO ' defensive ' alliance which was started by Nazis
3. the Bilderberg Group which is organised by freemasons and was started by Nazis
4. the collaberation of the Bush family with Nazis in WWII
5. the freemasons who now put almost all western leaders in power - documented by ex masons
6. the conglomeration fo the western world 's mass media which is now almost all owned by 6 massive companies
7. the fascinating chequered history of the sect of the Illuminati who are proven to have infiltrated freemasonry
8. the erroneous idea turned into a respectable discipline by ruthless people that there are ' too many people in the world ' and they must be wiped out
9. the global money ' Bretton Woods ' system which is a scam run for private profit
10 . the theft of the land from the people over the centuries
11 . the illigitimacy of the present British monarchy
12 . the still unpunished murder of Princess Diana
13 . systematic election fixing in the West , particularly in the USA
Communique from family court fugitive Natalie Bracht and her five daughters
Natalie Bracht is still believed to be on the run with her five daughters and expresses her fears here that she may be ' suicided ' .
In other words that some intelligence service or other ' higher ' group than Northumbria police may know exactly where she is , playing her a sick sort of cat and mouse game .
Whether she deserves to be accused of being a potential child murderer as Sunderland social services have done ... and separated from her five children we shall probably never know due to the chilling secrecy of the Family Courts and the High Court judge that issued the Recovery Order for the children .
Much of what Northumbria police have had to say about her case , such as her first husband denying that he is a Mossad nuclear scientist when Natalie said her second husband was , does not add up .
This communique was written on 23rd June 2008 before the High Court Recovery Order was issued and the photograph of Natalie and four of the girls taken in Shoreditch on 4th June 2008 .
All who have met her whilst she 's been ' on the run ' seem to agree that the only real threat to the children comes from injustices of Sunderland Social Services and the High Court .
Such as the exclusion by said Social Services of all and any supportive professional voices from Natalies ' case conferences .
To The Outside World
by Natalie Bracht - Monday 23rd June 2008
This is a response to the missing  appeal in the British media as well as the poster campaign to find the missing mum and her five daughters from Sunderland
Now , in the beginning , my name is Natalie Bracht and Im the mother of five lovely kids .
Im 33 and my children are between 5 and 13 .
We are not only Germans but also British citizens .
Not that this is important to us but to correct errors in the press and police records .
We have been reading the Northumbria police missing  appeal in many different newspapers , from television news and the BBC website
We found ourselves described as people on the run .
On the run from whom ?
... well they dont explain that part , do they ?
Honestly they dont say anything , apart from that we are missing and that the kids havent been to school for more than a week and have been separated from their friends and that this is certainly not good for them .
hmmm
And that they dont know where we are .
hmmm
And that they are concerned about the safety of my children .
hmmm
Now , I dont believe that anybody , especially the so - called counterparts  who are working very closely with the police - are concerned about the safety of my children at all .
[ Natalie describes the secret network of those she believes are harassing her as  the counterparts  ]
Because Im described as a person with a personality disorder and emotional and narcissistic behaviour .
In short , totally mad and mental , according to a so - called independent psychiatrist - who has been organised through one of the counterparts  .
Im also not aware of the mental history they claim for me .
So why do they claim ?
Now , just in case you are mental enough outside there , you might understand .
This is also a message to all the thousands of parents in this country whose children have been wrongly taken away by Britains corruptly installed family court system .
And as you have read before I m mad and mental .
I say that their power to do so is coming from a very well known society in this country .
[ Natalie mentioned freemasonry in the previous hour long interview I recorded with her which is available on the web  ed. ]
Anyway , I have no intention of letting them use my five daughters and therefore we are on a run .
Now , facing the mastermind of a surveillance system in London I was , we can say forced , to use some camouflage for me and my daughters .
And yes , we have been successful .
Yes , we also disconnected our mobile .
And we didnt use our bank account .
All because I m so mad ?
We changed our outfits - not because of a personality disorder - but simply to find a way to keep the kids safe .
I hereby congratulate the reporter of The Sun who put me down as a Muslim mother and Kings Cross and hiding and so on - well this is The Sun .
I also understand that in the media it is believed that I have visited the central mosque in Regents Park .
Is it confirmed ?
Now , let me help you , I have in fact visited the ICCUK many times in the last 2 years .
And Im sure this is well known to  the counterparts  .
Taking into account that everything that goes in or out of Regents Park mosque is miraculously shared immediately
So why is it that certain people cannot be touched by the law ?
Well , I have to admit that I often ask my self , and there are more and more people who ask the same question :
What happens to all the children who are put through forced adoption process ?
Why an increasing number of kids ?
In certain parts of Britain mostly white children , very young .
Hmmmm ?
Why is it so easy to take away children from their parents ?
What is the purpose of so much secrecy in the family courts ?
And what is happening inside them ?
Why are the parents silenced , and threatened to be imprisoned when they start to talk about this ?
Is this why most people dont know this goes on ?
Talk to Journalist Brian Morgan in Cardiff about the effect of this on his freedom of speech .
What kind of children are they interested in ?
And who are they ?
Well , coming back to my kids , they had a good attendance at school and good school reports .
They were a pleasure to teach .
No emotional difficulties at all .
Clean , well fed , happy , interested , according to the school reports .
But social services say I am emotionally abusing  them because I said bad things to my children about social services in Sunderland .
I see .
Well , there was also a very dangerous way of interviewing my children through social services or counterparts  who were using my children to get information about my family .
Passed on to different agencies in Britain .
And I dont like my children being interrogated .
I call this emotional abuse of them and I also think I have to protect them from this .
Maybe because I m a narcissistic mother ?
And Im also mad because I wanted my childrens fingerprints to be removed from their database .
For anyone who hasnt heard about this : in some schools they take the childrens fingerprints instead of their name when the kids want to borrow a book out of the library .
Now I dont like that .
Because Im having a paranoid world view according to the independent psychiatrist who is connected to a certain community in Britain .
Incidentally , the same as most of the other people who are making allegations against us .
[ freemasonry again ?  ed. ]
Now , the connection between this community and the media as well as the court systems and  Labour Friends  is by now known , to a certain extent .
Yes , we are in hiding .
No , we will not be silenced .
Yes , I have a connection to people who know about these things .
Yes , they are sheltering us .
And the number of people affected by this is increasing
And the number of adoptions as well .
Now , they have destroyed my existence .
Dirtied my name ,
We were facing emotional harassment , all of us .
Through the British state institutions
No more freedom at all .
My family lost all our privacy , absolutely no liberty left .
A normal live was made impossible for us .
We were treated like criminals .
Until today .
Now we may be surprised to see what is coming next .
Looking at the present political climate maybe are developing into suspects .
Or suicide victims .
Or whatever .
Names on a list in the controlled media systems .
For now though I would like to say that it is a very relaxing time we are having without these people around us .
The children are enjoying themselves , doing all the things they like to do without the feeling that they are being watched or immediately reported .
I also would like to use the opportunity , and the kids as well , to send greetings to my aunt in the Netherlands and to let her know we are fine and the kids are recovering from all this and are very happy .
Im also asking the German authorities to watch this case from a different view point .

 Perhaps 60 % of todays oil price is pure speculation 
By F. William Engdahl
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=8878
Global Research , May 2 , 2008
The price of crude oil today is not made according to any traditional relation of supply to demand .
It s controlled by an elaborate financial market system as well as by the four major Anglo - American oil companies .
As much as 60 % of todays crude oil price is pure speculation driven by large trader banks and hedge funds .
It has nothing to do with the convenient myths of Peak Oil .
It has to do with control of oil and its price .
How ?
First , the crucial role of the international oil exchanges in London and New York is crucial to the game .
Nymex in New York and the ICE Futures in London today control global benchmark oil prices which in turn set most of the freely traded oil cargo .
They do so via oil futures contracts on two grades of crude oil West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent .
A third rather new oil exchange , the Dubai Mercantile Exchange ( DME ) , trading Dubai crude , is more or less a daughter of Nymex , with Nymex President , James Newsome , sitting on the board of DME and most key personnel British or American citizens .
Brent is used in spot and long - term contracts to value as much of crude oil produced in global oil markets each day .
The Brent price is published by a private oil industry publication , Platts .
Major oil producers including Russia and Nigeria use Brent as a benchmark for pricing the crude they produce .
Brent is a key crude blend for the European market and , to some extent , for Asia .
WTI has historically been more of a US crude oil basket .
Not only is it used as the basis for US - traded oil futures , but it 's also a key benchmark for US production .
 The tail that wags the dog 
All this is well and official .
But how todays oil prices are really determined is done by a process so opaque only a handful of major oil trading banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley have any idea who is buying and who selling oil futures or derivative contracts that set physical oil prices in this strange new world of paper oil . 
With the development of unregulated international derivatives trading in oil futures over the past decade or more , the way has opened for the present speculative bubble in oil prices .
Since the advent of oil futures trading and the two major London and New York oil futures contracts , control of oil prices has left OPEC and gone to Wall Street .
It is a classic case of the tail that wags the dog . 
A June 2006 US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report on  The Role of Market Speculation in rising oil and gas prices ,  noted ,  there is substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the large amount of speculation in the current market has significantly increased prices . 
What the Senate committee staff documented in the report was a gaping loophole in US Government regulation of oil derivatives trading so huge a herd of elephants could walk through it .
That seems precisely what they have been doing in ramping oil prices through the roof in recent months .
The Senate report was ignored in the media and in the Congress .
The report pointed out that the Commodity Futures Trading Trading Commission , a financial futures regulator , had been mandated by Congress to ensure that prices on the futures market reflect the laws of supply and demand rather than manipulative practices or excessive speculation .
The US Commodity Exchange Act ( CEA ) states ,  Excessive speculation in any commodity under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery . . . causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity , is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity . 
Further , the CEA directs the CFTC to establish such trading limits as the Commission finds are necessary to diminish , eliminate , or prevent such burden . 
Where is the CFTC now that we need such limits ?
They seem to have deliberately walked away from their mandated oversight responsibilities in the worlds most important traded commodity , oil .
Enron has the last laugh
As that US Senate report noted :
 Until recently , US energy futures were traded exclusively on regulated exchanges within the United States , like the NYMEX , which are subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC , including ongoing monitoring to detect and prevent price manipulation or fraud .
In recent years , however , there has been a tremendous growth in the trading of contracts that look and are structured just like futures contracts , but which are traded on unregulated OTC electronic markets .
Because of their similarity to futures contracts they are often called futures look - alikes . 
The only practical difference between futures look - alike contracts and futures contracts is that the look - alikes are traded in unregulated markets whereas futures are traded on regulated exchanges .
The trading of energy commodities by large firms on OTC electronic exchanges was exempted from CFTC oversight by a provision inserted at the behest of Enron and other large energy traders into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 in the waning hours of the 106th Congress .
The impact on market oversight has been substantial .
NYMEX traders , for example , are required to keep records of all trades and report large trades to the CFTC .
These Large Trader Reports , together with daily trading data providing price and volume information , are the CFTCs primary tools to gauge the extent of speculation in the markets and to detect , prevent , and prosecute price manipulation .
CFTC Chairman Reuben Jeffrey recently stated :  The Commissions Large Trader information system is one of the cornerstones of our surveillance program and enables detection of concentrated and coordinated positions that might be used by one or more traders to attempt manipulation . 
In contrast to trades conducted on the NYMEX , traders on unregulated OTC electronic exchanges are not required to keep records or file Large Trader Reports with the CFTC , and these trades are exempt from routine CFTC oversight .
In contrast to trades conducted on regulated futures exchanges , there is no limit on the number of contracts a speculator may hold on an unregulated OTC electronic exchange , no monitoring of trading by the exchange itself , and no reporting of the amount of outstanding contracts ( open interest ) at the end of each day . 
1
Then , apparently to make sure the way was opened really wide to potential market oil price manipulation , in January 2006 , the Bush Administrations CFTC permitted the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) , the leading operator of electronic energy exchanges , to use its trading terminals in the United States for the trading of US crude oil futures on the ICE futures exchange in London  called ICE Futures . 
Previously , the ICE Futures exchange in London had traded only in European energy commodities 
Brent crude oil and United Kingdom natural gas .
As a United Kingdom futures market , the ICE Futures exchange is regulated solely by the UK Financial Services Authority .
In 1999 , the London exchange obtained the CFTCs permission to install computer terminals in the United States to permit traders in New York and other US cities to trade European energy commodities through the ICE exchange .
The CFTC opens the door
Then , in January 2006 , ICE Futures in London began trading a futures contract for
West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil , a type of crude oil that is produced and delivered in the United States .
ICE Futures also notified the CFTC that it would be permitting traders in the United States to use ICE terminals in the United States to trade its new WTI contract on the ICE Futures London exchange .
ICE Futures as well allowed traders in the United States to trade US gasoline and heating oil futures on the ICE Futures exchange in London .
Despite the use by US traders of trading terminals within the United States to trade US oil , gasoline , and heating oil futures contracts , the CFTC has until today refused to assert any jurisdiction over the trading of these contracts .
Persons within the United States seeking to trade key US energy commodities  US crude oil , gasoline , and heating oil futures  are able to avoid all US market oversight or reporting requirements by routing their trades through the ICE Futures exchange in London instead of the NYMEX in New York .
Is that not elegant ?
The US Government energy futures regulator , CFTC opened the way to the present unregulated and highly opaque oil futures speculation .
It may just be coincidence that the present CEO of NYMEX , James Newsome , who also sits on the Dubai Exchange , is a former chairman of the US CFTC .
In Washington doors revolve quite smoothly between private and public posts .
A glance at the price for Brent and WTI futures prices since January 2006 indicates the remarkable correlation between skyrocketing oil prices and the unregulated trade in ICE oil futures in US markets .
Keep in mind that ICE Futures in London is owned and controlled by a USA company based in Atlanta Georgia .
In January 2006 when the CFTC allowed the ICE Futures the gaping exception , oil prices were trading in the range of $ 59 - 60 a barrel .
Today some two years later we see prices tapping $ 120 and trend upwards .
This is not an OPEC problem , it is a US Government regulatory problem of malign neglect .
By not requiring the ICE to file daily reports of large trades of energy commodities , it is not able to detect and deter price manipulation .
As the Senate report noted ,  The CFTC 's ability to detect and deter energy price manipulation is suffering from critical information gaps , because traders on OTC electronic exchanges and the London ICE Futures are currently exempt from CFTC reporting requirements .
Large trader reporting is also essential to analyze the effect of speculation on energy prices . 
The report added , ICE 's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other evidence indicate that its over - the - counter electronic exchange performs a price discovery function -- and thereby affects US energy prices -- in the cash market for the energy commodities traded on that exchange . 
Hedge Funds and Banks driving oil prices
In the most recent sustained run-up in energy prices , large financial institutions , hedge funds , pension funds , and other investors have been pouring billions of dollars into the energy commodities markets to try to take advantage of price changes or hedge against them .
Most of this additional investment has not come from producers or consumers of these commodities , but from speculators seeking to take advantage of these price changes .
The CFTC defines a speculator as a person who does not produce or use the commodity , but risks his or her own capital trading futures in that commodity in hopes of making a profit on price changes . 
The large purchases of crude oil futures contracts by speculators have , in effect , created an
additional demand for oil , driving up the price of oil for future delivery in the same manner that additional demand for contracts for the delivery of a physical barrel today drives up the price for oil on the spot market .
As far as the market is concerned , the demand for a barrel of oil that results from the purchase of a futures contract by a speculator is just as real as the demand for a barrel that results from the purchase of a futures contract by a refiner or other user of petroleum .
Perhaps 60 % of oil prices today pure speculation
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley today are the two leading energy trading firms in the United States .
Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase are major players and fund numerous hedge funds as well who speculate .
In June 2006 , oil traded in futures markets at some $ 60 a barrel and the Senate investigation estimated that some $ 25 of that was due to pure financial speculation .
One analyst estimated in August 2005 that US oil inventory levels suggested WTI crude prices should be around $ 25 a barrel , and not $ 60 .
That would mean today that at least $ 50 to $ 60 or more of todays $ 115 a barrel price is due to pure hedge fund and financial institution speculation .
However , given the unchanged equilibrium in global oil supply and demand over recent months amid the explosive rise in oil futures prices traded on Nymex and ICE exchanges in New York and London it is more likely that as much as 60 % of the today oil price is pure speculation .
No one knows officially except the tiny handful of energy trading banks in New York and London and they certainly arent talking .
By purchasing large numbers of futures contracts , and thereby pushing up futures prices to even higher levels than current prices , speculators have provided a financial incentive for oil companies to buy even more oil and place it in storage .
A refiner will purchase extra oil today , even if it costs $ 115 per barrel , if the futures price is even higher .
As a result , over the past two years crude oil inventories have been steadily growing , resulting in US crude oil inventories that are now higher than at any time in the previous eight years .
The large influx of speculative investment into oil futures has led to a situation where we have both high supplies of crude oil and high crude oil prices .
Compelling evidence also suggests that the oft - cited geopolitical , economic , and natural factors do not explain the recent rise in energy prices can be seen in the actual data on crude oil supply and demand .
Although demand has significantly increased over the past few years , so have supplies .
Over the past couple of years global crude oil production has increased along with the increases in demand ; in fact , during this period global supplies have exceeded demand , according to the US Department of Energy .
The US Department of Energys Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) recently forecast that in the next few years global surplus production capacity will continue to grow to between 3 and 5 million barrels per day by 2010 , thereby substantially thickening the surplus capacity cushion . 
Dollar and oil link
A common speculation strategy amid a declining USA economy and a falling US dollar is for speculators and ordinary investment funds desperate for more profitable investments amid the US securitization disaster , to take futures positions selling the dollar short and oil long . 
For huge US or EU pension funds or banks desperate to get profits following the collapse in earnings since August 2007 and the US real estate crisis , oil is one of the best ways to get huge speculative gains .
The backdrop that supports the current oil price bubble is continued unrest in the Middle East , in Sudan , in Venezuela and Pakistan and firm oil demand in China and most of the world outside the US .
Speculators trade on rumor , not fact .
In turn , once major oil companies and refiners in North America and EU countries begin to hoard oil , supplies appear even tighter lending background support to present prices .
Because the over - the - counter ( OTC ) and London ICE Futures energy markets are unregulated , there are no precise or reliable figures as to the total dollar value of recent spending on investments in energy commodities , but the estimates are consistently in the range of tens of billions of dollars .
The increased speculative interest in commodities is also seen in the increasing popularity of commodity index funds , which are funds whose price is tied to the price of a basket of various commodity futures .
Goldman Sachs estimates that pension funds and mutual funds have invested a total of approximately $ 85 billion in commodity index funds , and that investments in its own index , the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index ( GSCI ) , has tripled over the past few years .
Notable is the fact that the US Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , is former Chairman of Goldman Sachs .

The New York Times is also reporting now that the secret Bush - era CIA program kept from Congress and terminated last month by CIA Director Leon Panetta was a plan to assassinate top al Qaeda officials that was never implemented .
This is additional confirmation of the Wall Street Journal story that essentially reported the same basic outlines of the still - classified program .
The Times compares the program to drone attacks against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ This was another effort that was trying to accomplish the same objective , ” Sen. Kit Bond ( R - MO ) , ranking member on the Senate intel committee , tells the paper .
But as a former CIA counterterrorism chief told TPMmuckraker today :
“ The CIA runs drones and targets al Qaeda safe houses all the time , ” said Cannistraro , explaining that there ’s no important difference between those kinds of attacks and “ assassinations ” with a gun or a knife .
So regardless of how you might feel about targeted assassinations , it ’s not at all clear why this particular program would be so radioactive — compared to what the U.S. was , and still is , doing more or less openly — that ( 1 ) Cheney would demand the CIA not brief Congress about it for eight years ; ( 2 ) Panetta would cancel it immediately upon learning of it ; and ( 3 ) Democrats would howl quite so loudly when finally informed .
Or to think about it another way , put yourself in the seat of a Democrat on one of the intel committees after 9/11 .
If you had any doubt about whether the intel agencies were targeting al Qaeda leaders , would n’t you have demanded that they show you proof they were ?
And if you did n’t have any doubt that they were , why are you complaining now about not being briefed ?
It does n’t add up .
There ’s more to this story to be told .

DebADay needs you more than ever !
Please submit good articles about software you like !
Logcheck is a simple yet great idea , an almost set - it - and - forget - it way to monitor your server logs for problems of all kinds .
You create three pattern ( grep regex ) lists :
Known bad stuff
Looks bad but is n’t
Known good stuff
Logcheck periodically checks various syslog ( or other ) log files and picks up where it left off the last time .
During each run it takes the new messages and looks for “ known bad ” things but first removes stuff that “ looks bad but is n’t ” and saves the messages as “ this is known to be bad . ”
Then it rewinds , removes the known bad it just collected , removes the “ known good ” and stuff that “ looks bad but is n’t ” and saves whatever is left as “ unknown . ”
Then it emails you the results .
Over time , as you tune your files , you end up only being alerted to known bad or new ( not yet classified ) stuff .
Brilliant .
I even did a ( cheesy ) Windows port of it .
Originally written by Marcus J. Ranum and Fred Avolio as frequentcheck.sh for the TIS Gauntlet firewall toolkit , it was adapted by Craig Rowland and applied to system logs .
It spent some time as logsentry as part of Psionic ’s Abacus / Sentry tools until they were bought by Cisco and the tools moved to SourceForge .
The version in Debian is a re-write which was then inherited by Ubuntu .
But the best about the Debian / Ubuntu implementation is that almost all of the patterns you need are already Just There™ .
I usually only have to add a handful to work around odd things I ’m doing or minor bugs .
See the example at the bottom .
If you run a server you should be using fcheck and logcheck .
And probably tmpreaper , etckeeper and maybe monit too .
Articles about all these tools will be published soon , stay tuned !
As drawbacks , it should be noted that it may require some tuning , especially on a workstation or newer distro versions , and that may not be scalable for a lot of servers .
Is also worth mentioning that there are a variety of commercial and Managed Security Monitoring solutions that will scale and provide more information about events , but none are this easy .
Availability
The logcheck package is available in Debian since at least etch , and in Ubuntu since at least Dapper .
See also the logcheck - database package .
Sample configuration
/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/LOCAL.ignore ( lines wrapped for readability )
I have a pretty good friend who is from India .
Now that summer is coming and 100 + degree weather , she has become stinky !
We have classes together and the entire classroom is filled with a bad smell !
How can I POLITELY and delicately bring this to her attention ?
Is it culturally acceptable in India to not wear deodorant ?
China is on its way to surpassing the U.S. as the world 's largest manufacturer far sooner than expected .
The question is , does that matter ?
In terms of actual size , the answer is , no .
But if size is a proxy for relative health of each nation 's sector , the answer is yes .
Anyone who walks the aisles of a U.S. retailer might think China already is the world 's largest manufacturer .
But , in fact , the U.S. retains that distinction by a wide margin .
In 2007 , the latest year for which data are available , the U.S. accounted for 20 % of global manufacturing ; China was 12 % .
The gap , though , is closing rapidly .
According to IHS / Global Insight , an economic - forecasting firm in Lexington , Mass. , China will produce more in terms of real value - added by 2015 .
Using value - added as a measure avoids the problem of double - counting by tallying the value created at each step of an extended production process .
As recently as two years ago , Global Insight 's estimate was that China would surpass the U.S. as the world 's top manufacturer by 2020 .
Last year , it pulled the date forward to 2016 or 2017 .
Found over at 23rd and Guerrero in the Mission district , SFist Cedric found the above love letter stuck on his windshield .
He explains , " I found a spot that was literally three inches longer than my car .
And this is the congratulation I get for managing to fit in . "
Makes you tingle a bit , does n't it ?

Jon Taplin reproduces this jaw - dropping chart : Floyd Norris 's scary graph of Durable Goods Production , adding , " We have so hollowed out our industrial plant that the only thing we are now producing is weapons of war . "
He goes on to quote Toynbee on Rome : " The economy of the Empire was basically a Raubwirtschaft or plunder economy based on looting existing resources rather than producing anything new .
The Empire relied on booty from conquered territories …
With the cessation of tribute from conquered territories , the full cost of their military machine had to be borne by the citizenry . "

Richard Gage : The Architect
Who exactly is Richard Gage ?
He is an AIA Architect and the founding member of AE911 Truth.org .
From his website :
“ Gage has been a practicing Architect for 20 years and has worked on most types of building construction including numerous fire - proofed steel - framed buildings .
He is employed with a San Francisco Bay Area architecture firm and has most recently performed Construction Administration services for a new $ 120 M High School campus including a $ 10 M steel - framed Gymnasium .
Currently he is working on the Design Development for a very large mixed use urban project with 1.2 M sq.ft. of retail and 320 K sq.ft. of high - rise office space — altogether about 1,200 tons of steel framing . ”
But there is no CV or any detailed description of his work experience .
That ’s strange , since he is considered as one of the experts of the 9/11 truth movement .
It sure would be nice to know more about his credentials .
Well , luckily his CV is publicly available on another website .
The CV is last updated on March , 2007 .
So we get a quite recent description of his experience .
Let ’s take a closer look , shall we .
Richard Gage Curriculum Vitae :
First , the summary : “ 24 years professional architectural experience ( 19 yrs Licenced ) including public , commercial , industrial , institutional , rapid transit , civil defense and residential typologies , with the last 17 years as lead Project Architect role in addition to 5 years as Principal of a small Architecture practice . ”
17 years experience as lead Project Architect role .
Fair enough .
Qualifications : “ Extensive experience in project management leading Design Development , Construction Documents , Bidding and Construction Administration phases ; in - depth research into uncommon building types and technologies ; coordination , engineering disciplines and municipal agencies ; rigorous building code analysis and expertise in CA T24 / ADA ; Excellent leadership and interpersonal skills ; Proficient writer and speaker . ”
Proficient writer and speaker ?
We ’ll get into that later .
Experience : “ Responsibility as lead Project Architect on the following projects performing all of the following activities :
Extensive coordination with Clients , project Budgeting & Scheduling , Design Development , Construction Document ( usually leading about 5 staff ) ; Life Safety & T24 / ADA Code Analysis ; Coordination of all Consultants - Geotechnical , Structural , Mechanical , Electrical , Acoustical , Landscape and Civil consultants , Utility Co’s , Coordination with City , County and State Agencies throughout Planning and Building Permit acquisition ; Development of & cross-coordination of
Specifications ; and Construction Administration . ”
It has become quite clear now , that Gage is a Project Architect .
Coordination seems to be the main thing .
But his detailed work experience ?
It ’s all here .
We will not go through it in great detail , but here are the main observations :
· He has been involved in 4 projects with his current employer :
o A Dougherty Valley High School Project ,
o Main Gym and Auxilliary Gym
o ADA Upgrades Project for the Acalanes Union High School District ,
o Acalanes H.S. – New Wing 500 , Storage Buildings , Tennis Courts , Parking Lots , & Fields Renovation
· His current employer is not found by the ZIP code search of the AIA website .
Indication of a small firm ?
· His earlier projects in order ( newest first , starting from Sept , 2001 ) include the following :
o A Lecture Hall building
o The remodel of 2 historic former Waves barracks
o 5 - building 38,000 s.f. $ 4 M retail center
o 7 retail restaurant tenant improvements
o Livermore City Hall – a 2 - story concrete / steel framed complete building renovation / addition
o Animal Care & Adoption facility
o 2 - Story 2 - Building 24 - Unit wood framed condominium project
o 11 new Classroom buildings at 11 different schools , including remodeling of existing class rooms

o HealthWays Medical Clinics tenant improvements
o Sanwa Bank
o 6,000 s.f. Type -V restaurant
o Peralta Warehouse
o Carpeteria - renovation of 16,300 s.f.
Type - V concrete tilt - up building

o Motorola factory and office complex - Tienjen , China
o Airport Terminal at Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
o Euro - Disney MGM Studio
Tour theme park - Backlot Express restaurant , Maintenance Building and Sound stages
o Prepared design development drawings for the Bay Area Rapid Transit stations
o Directed a team of 5 through construction documents for a 94 building Type-l California state maximum security prison complex
o Designed fallout and blast shelters for several clients over a two year period
o Remodel of a 200 room hotel
One thing that immediately catches the eye .
No high - rises .
We have shopping centers , halls , school projects , barracks , warehouses , etc .
Richard Gage of AE911 Truth
Now that we know his experience and credentials , we can move on to the Richard Gage of the AE911 Truth .
Richard Gage joined the truth movement after hearing David Ray Griffin on the radio March , 2006 .
The Evidence ?
Gage has produced no original evidence of his own .
His evidence is direct copy - paste from the works of David Ray Griffin , Jim Hoffman and Steven Jones .
You can compare the evidence listed by Richard Gage at the frontpage of AE911 Truth.org to the evidence presented by Griffin , Hoffman and Jones .
To critically analyze his demolition evidence , please see the paper written by Ryan Mackey http://911guide.googlepages.com/ryanmackey
or go to
http://wtc7lies.googlepages.com/nist%2Cfemareports%2C911structuralengineerin
http://911guide.googlepages.com/griffin29
http://www.debunking911.com
http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc__demolition_.html
But let 's take a closer look at a couple of more absurd Gage claims :
In a very interesting statement ( around 1:05:00 mark ) , Richard Gage suggests that “ silent thermate ( an advanced form of thermite ) ” was used to bring the WTC towers down .
He then states that 118 FDNY personnel heard explosions .
" Gage : Well that 's why they would have used thermite , which is a more silent , um , thermate , which is a special form of thermite with added sulfur , because obviously you would n't want a whole bunch of explosions to be heard , even though they were , it 's not a perfect science .
They have a hundred and eighteen witnesses just from those who were recorded in the oral histories . "
How do you hear silent explosions ?
When did thermate start exploding ?
What are you talking about ?
To see what the explosions described by some firemen actually were , see here and here .
Another statement from the same debate ( around 41:45 mark ) .
Gage says about the collapse : “ 80.000 tons of intact , cold structural steel designed to resist exactly that load , having done that for the last 30 years , and the life - span of this building for the next 50 , free - fall speed virtually .. ”
A short lesson .
The difference between a static load and a dynamic load .
Static Load :
A nonvarying load ; the basal pressure exerted by the weight of a mass at rest .
Also known as dead load .
Dynamic Load :
A force exerted by a moving body on a resisting member , usually in a relatively short time interval .
Also known as energy load .
The towers were designed to resist the static load , not the dropping hat trusses and the dynamic load .
Try this little experiment with your friend .
First , ask your friend to gently place a brick on top your head .
Just let it rest there .
You will feel the weight of the brick , but you can live with that .
Next , kneel down but ask your friend to hold the brick above your head at exactly the same height , as it was when you were standing up .
Then ask your friend to drop that brick .
You have experienced the difference between a static load and a dynamic load .
Gage also lists FDNY foreknowledge as partial evidence of controlled demolition of WTC 7 .
FDNY foreknowledge means , they knew the building was going to collapse .
FDNY Chief Daniel Nigro made the decision to evacuate , he did not receive the evacuation order from some higher - ups .
This means Chief Nigro had foreknowledge .
This means Chief Nigro ’s foreknowledge is evidence of controlled demolition .
This means Chief Nigro is involved .
Which is absurd .
Gage claims sounds of explosions at ground floor of WTC 7 a full second prior to collapse , were heard by hundreds of firemen and media reporters .
This is simply not true .
He bases this claim on this testimony , that can be listened to at his site .
The testimony does not mention bombs , it does not even mention explosions , let alone mention hundreds of firemen and media reporters .
It is a quote of one single person , who says : “ We heard this sound that was like a clap of thunder ” , which is exactly what you would expect hearing when a building collapses .
One can not assume buildings collapse totally silently .
Gage also claims NIST admits that they have not analyzed and have not been able to adequately explain the Twin Towers ' collapse .
This is misleading .
NIST says they have not been able to model the collapse .
This is , quote " Because of the magnitude of deflections and the number of failures occurring , the computer models are not able to converge a solution " .
This is clearly explained in the NIST letter .
Update : Richard Gage seems to think that he can compare the WTC towers to boxes made of cardboard .
He has used the cardboard box comparison in his lectures since the summer of 2008 .
He drops a smaller box of cardboard on top of a taller box of cardboard .
Unsurprisingly , the taller cardboard box taking the hit does not give in to the dropping box .
In his other hand he holds another small cardboard box and drops it straight to the ground .
He does all this to make the point , that the WTC towers should have resisted or stopped the collapse .
I am not kidding .
Here is a screen shot of Gage holding the boxes .
His cardboard box demonstration on video here .
And here at about 57 seconds into the clip .
Has Produced Nothing Himself
Let ’s take a look at the technical articles page over at AE911 truth :
http://www.ae911truth.org/techarts.php
The amount of technical articles on this page equals to 30 as of December 26 , 2007 .
How many of these technical articles are written by him ?
None of them are written by Richard Gage .
No original content , no papers , no calculations have originated from Gage or AE911 Truth .
And is an architect really an expert to analyze structural collapses ?
Apparently even
Gage thinks not , because his December 2007 newsletter makes a desperate call for structural engineers : " Tell your friends , family and colleagues the truth that you know — particularly the structural engineers ! " ( bolding by Richard Gage ) .
There indeed is a shortage of actual structural engineers who claim WTC was demolished with explosives .
This page lists well over 1000 certified structural engineers , certified by the Structural Engineering Certification Board ( SECB ) of The National Council of Structural Engineers Association .
And that is just certified structural engineers in United States , Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands , certified in 2005 or later .
Consider , how many thousands of more of structural engineers there are worldwide .
And how many of these over 1000 certified structural engineers question the events of 9/11 ?
You guessed it , not a single one .
Admits to Controlled Demolition Being Outside the Scope of His Expertise
See this page :
http://www.ae911truth.org/info/4
" Architects and Engineers are trained to design buildings that function well and withstand potentially destructive forces .
However , the 3 high - rise buildings at the World Trade Center which ‘ collapsed ’ on 9/11 ( the Twin Towers plus WTC Building # 7 ) presented us with a body of evidence ( i.e.controlled demolition ) that was clearly outside the scope of our training and experience . "
Richard Gage himself admits , that controlled demolition is clearly outside the scope of his expertise .
Yet , all his evidence consists of arguments trying to prove the demolition of the 3 towers .
" Twenty - seven hundred people were murdered in what we can now safely
call demolitions , " Gage said .
http://www.ae911truth.org/press/7
The AE911 Truth Petition & Growth of AE911 Truth.org
AE911 Truth.org has a petition on their website .
It is currently ( December 27 , 2007 ) signed by 231 Arhitects / Engineers and 609 other supporters .
That ’s 840 in total .
Everyone who wishes to join AE911 Truth website , has to sign the petition .
One cannot even view their discussion board without joining and thus also signing their petition .
The petition goes as follows : “ On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . ”
In short , this is just another demand for a new , independent investigation .
But Richard
Gage seems to think this is a very popular petition .
From his letter to Mark Weitzman , dated December 8 , 2007 : “ Maybe now you understand why our membership of architects , engineers , and other building professionals , who are all calling for a science - based forensic investigation - which has yet to be performed - is growing exponentially ! ”
First of all , as mentioned before , if one wishes to join AE911 Truth one is forced to sign the petition .
Second , is their membership of building professionals really growing exponentially ?
When Richard Gage fully launced his website on May 28 , 2007 a total of 48 building professionals were listed .
After that moment it was quickly found out , that anyone could join their site using any credentials they wanted .
You could just click “ join ” and put “ Architect ” in your credentials box .
This confusion lasted some time , so no credible membership figures can be gathered from the summer of 2007 .
Later , they somewhat fixed their problems , and we can get more credible figures once again ( although the identity of many is still questionable ) .
Quite credible figures from October 16 , 2007 .
Both this and this article list the membership figures as “ Nearly 200 ” or “ Almost 200 ” .
We take the right to estimate a figure of 190 .
In his letter to Mark Weitzman , Gage reveals his figure as of December 8 , 2007 : “ more than 230 well - respected architects and engineers ” .
More than 230 , could it be 231 ?
Because the figure on December 27 , 2007 is 231 ( see his front page ) .
So , we have the following figures :
May 28 : 48 members
October 16 : 190 members
December 8 : 231 members
December 27 : 231 members
Let ’s draw a graph .
That growth is not exponential .
It is linear .
The definition of exponential : “ Something is said to increase or decrease exponentially if its rate of change must be expressed using exponents .
A graph of such a rate would appear not as a straight line , but as a curve that continually becomes steeper or shallower . ”
http://www.thefreedictionary.com/exponential
And one more interesting detail .
The “ recruiter ” for AE911 Truth is , or at least used to be , a person called Doug Plumb .
He has said his views do not represent the views of AE911 Truth , but they are quite interesting .
Doug Plumb believes in mini-nukes at WTC .
He supports Judy Wood , who says Space Beams brought the WTC towers down .
About FDNY
Plumb says " When they cover up evidence or imply that there were huge fires and that wtc7 was expected to collapse then that is being an accomplice .
Its the same thing as murder . "
His views are expressed in a discussion thread here .
Update :
The day after I wrote this article their membership of " building professionals " dropped from 231 to 230 .
It was discovered , that a man called Hans Van Willigenburg was on the membership list .
His status was supposedly checked .
However , Mr. Willigenburg is not an engineer or an architect .
He is in fact a Dutch television and radio host .
I have also received information , that their former member Cameron Porter , PHD was a made up name , and it was asked that his name should be removed .
Yet , the name was listed for a long time after that request .
It has now been removed .
Asking for Money
To continue their work efficiently , Gage and AE911 Truth seem to need a lot of money .
http://www.ae911truth.org/sustain.php
" Our responsibilities , time commitment and expenses are growing dramatically with our increasing success .
We also must purchase computers , printers , software , and handle traveling and legal expenses .
Our efforts and growth cannot be sustained without your help . "
" We need many thousands of dollars per month to realize our goals . "
But why do they need thousands of dollars on a monthly basis ?
They sure do not need new computer equipment or software every month .
Traveling ?
I thought the event organizers usually pay for the travel costs .
Does this money go to compensate for the work of the volunteers ?
What exactly do these volunteers do ?
Update the slide presentation ?
Here is what it costs to become a “ sustaining member ” :
Pledge Level : Cost / Month :
What you get with the money :
Citizen / Student $ 10 monthly 20 WTC Evidence and 20 Twin Towers Cards
Advocate $ 25 monthly DVD : 9/11 Blueprint for Truth + 20 of each card
Activist $ 50 monthly 2 DVD's + 50 of each card
Patriot $ 100 monthly 3 DVD's + 100 of each card
Statesman $ 250 monthly 5 DVD's + 250 of each card
Ambassador $ 500 monthly 10 DVD's + 500 of each card
AE911 Truth Hero $ 911 monthly 20 DVD's + 1000 of each card
Let 's see how much that makes on a yearly basis :
Pledge Level : Cost / Year :
What you get with the money :
Citizen / Student $ 120 yearly 20 WTC Evidence and 20 Twin Towers Cards
Advocate $ 300 yearly DVD : 9/11 Blueprint for Truth + 20 of each card
Activist $ 600 yearly 2 DVD's + 50 of each card
Patriot $ 1200 yearly 3 DVD's + 100 of each card
Statesman $ 3000 yearly 5 DVD's + 250 of each card
Ambassador $ 6000 yearly 10 DVD's + 500 of each card
AE911 Truth Hero $ 10932 yearly 20 DVD's + 1000 of each card
For $ 10932 / year you can become a AE911 Truth Hero .
Sounds like an insanely huge amount of money , considering the reward .
If you do not prefer monthly donations , you can also make a substantial one - time donation .
The only condition is , that you must donate a minimum of $ 100 to qualify for premium ( premium = their giveaway DVD's / Evidence Cards ) .
Selling Products
The other money making method , selling truth products .
http://www.ae911truth.org/store.php
Over here you will find DVD ’s and so called “ evidence cards ” .
But it ’s does n’t end there .
Their December 2007 newsletter promises the following : " In addition to our flagship products our store will soon stock AE911 Truth.org T - shirts , bumper stickers , and vinyl banners for responsible street action visibility .
We will also stock a host of books and other DVD's .
Before the year ends we will be stocking enveloped 9/11 Blueprint for Truth DVD 's and audio CD 's which you can buy in quantity at extremely low prices . "
( Update :
All the above mentioned products plus more now available at AE911 Truth Store ; see the store link above . )
Taking People to Lunch ?
This is a completely new way of making money , courtesy of AE911 Truth .
Taking A/E firms to lunch .
http://www.ae911truth.org/donate.php?b=mih
$ 9.00 Take an Architect or Engineer to Lunch !
$ 50.00 Take a few A / E 's out to Lunch !
$ 90.00 Take a small A/E firm to Lunch !
$ 500.00 Take a medium A/E firm to Lunch !
$ 900.00 Take a large A/E firm to lunch !
Donate $ any amount Take any size A/E firm to lunch !
How exactly does that work ?
The only advice the page gives you , is detailed instructions on how to make a donation .
There are no instructions on how the lunch is actually arranged .
If I wish to buy this lunch , I donate money .. ok .. what next ..?
Oh , but they do have this there : " Thank you very much for you support of the 9/11 Truth ! " and a button " Contact Us " , which takes you to the general " contact " page of AE911 Truth .
I guess that takes care of it !
And what exactly are the size limits to " small " or " medium " sized A/E firms anyway .
I sure would like to know the difference , because the donation amount jumps from $ 90 to $ 500 between these two " sizes " .
And what is that " donate $ any amount " to take any size A/E firm to lunch ?
If I donate $ 1.50 dollars , can I take a large A/E firm to lunch ?
I would save $ 898.50 !
Changing Methods ?
On July 11 , 2007 :
http://www.ae911truth.org/info/10
Unauthorized use of the AE911 Truth.org name
" We have received notification of graffiti - like direct actions by independent persons not affiliated in any way with ae911 truth using the ae911 truth.org URL address .
Although we encourage activism , we discourage and disavow intrusive and possibly unlawful activism methods , which can be counterproductive to our mission of public education , scientific investigation and research , and legal objectives like our demand for a new , Congressional investigation into the events of 9/11 . "
But surpsire surprise , a couple of months later , on the December 2007 newsletter :
" We Support 9/11 Truth Street Action " and " The 9/11 truthers out on the street are the heroes of this movement .
Send us your AE911 Truth street action photos and we will post them here . "
And what photos do they have posted there ?
That 's right , a photo of the same graffiti they said they do not want to be affiliated with .
What About the Wrong Demolition Audio ?
This topic has raised many questions .
Start by visiting the ImplosionWorld Cinema .
Choose the Philips building ( top of the two rows , right - hand side ) and watch the video .
Pay particular attention when the timer gets past 10 seconds .
You 'll hear an explosion , see smoke shoot out from the centre base of the building , then hear another set of explosions , then the building falls .
Repeat that a few times so you 're familar with the timing .
Take a look at the same implosion from another angle .
We do n't have the same view of the base of the building this time , but you can still hear loud explosions before and after first smoke shoots out .
Now visit this page at the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
( Update : Gage has removed the slide )
Now there 's no explosions at all , and what 's more you can hear the building fall before it actually happens .
It appears this version of the video has either had the explosions removed and seen the rest of the collapse sound moved forward to cover it ( which would explain the silent second or two at the end ) , or perhaps has had the complete audio track added from somewhere else .
Why would you need to remove the explosion sounds from the soundtrack ?
I have asked Richard Gage about this .
He has not responded .
But he has responded to another person asking the same question .
His response :
His slide presentation was put together by a committee , not by Richard Gage himself .
They claim to be looking into the matter .
Update : Gage has finally removed the altered soundtrack from the presentation and replaced the slide with this new one .
( Update : Gage has also removed this slide )
Of course , now that we DO hear explosions , it makes Gage 's position even worse since no audible charges were heard on 9/11 .
So ok , Gage produces no original arguments , no calculations , no papers or articles .
And now we find out , that he does n't even put together his own slide presentation .
What exactly DOES this man do , besides take people to lunch and ask for donations ?
Let me present to you …
Richard Gage : The Activist
What Richard Gage does do besides the aforementioned , is lecturing .
He tours around the U.S. presenting his slideshow and evidence .
He also appears on radio shows .
See his appearances here .
Update : Gage also bombards the press , as well as architects and engineers around the US with AE911 Truth mass e-mails .
Here you can find one of his letters , informing the recipients of the e-mail that Ed Asner has signed the AE911 Truth petition .
This mass e-mail " press release " was sent to over 1,000 media outlets nationwide !
But the mass e-mailing does not end here .
They encourage all their supporters to mass e-mail AE911 Truth links to all the architects and engineers they know .
It 's up on their site , take a look .
AE911 Truth also had a goal of 1,000 A&E members by the day of September 11 , 2008 .
To reach this goal they further encouraged everyone to join the mass e-mailing .
They specifically stated : " Send a minimum of one e-mail per day : to every architect and engineer that you can find in your area . " .
They even had a sample e-mail on their site and provided an evidence letter for everyone to download and send as an attachment .
Did they reach their goal ?
They missed it by over 500 members : on September 10 , 2008 they had a total of 473 " A&E members " .
So , let ’s recap .
We have this man , who
admits demolition is clearly outside the scope of his expertise
has made no original claims or calculations , and written no articles
copies the works of Griffin , Hoffman and Jones ( who are also no experts of demolition )
has not even put together his own slide presentation
does n’t know the basics of engineering
What he does :
presents the slide presentation made by others
makes radio appearances stating the claims made by others
asks for huge amounts of money
makes uninformed phone calls and letters to NIST
has an online petition demanding an independent investigation
exaggerates his popularity
encourages people to mass e-mail his material and links to his site
Does all this sound something an expert would be like ?
If you still want to become an AE911 Truth hero and donate $ 911 / month to Gage , feel free to do so .
If you want to take a medium sized A/E firm and Gage to lunch for $ 500 , feel free to do so .
In the words of Gage and AE911 Truth :
" We need many thousands of dollars per month to realize our goals . "

The 50 Funniest Scenes in the History of Film
By Dustin Rowles | Guides | April 22 , 2011 |
Coming up with the 50 funniest scenes in the history of cinema turned out to be much easier than I expected , thanks to the stellar efforts of our readership , who essentially nominated hundreds of clips to choose from .
Narrowing it down to 50 was another matter , and then attempting to rank them in order of hilariousness was an almost impossible task .
But we rank , therefore we are .
There ’s not a lot of fun to be had in a perfect list ; it forecloses the possibility of discussion .
And if I have n’t left off a few of your favorite scenes , then you have n’t seen enough comedies , and if you ’re completely happy with the way these scenes are ranked , you are either an idiot , separated at me from birth , or both .
There ’s no scientific method to ranking funny — it ’s largely a matter of weighing a film ’s classic status along with the amount of pain each scene caused my ribs .
It was essentially an all day exercise , and by the end of it , I had to have my spleen removed .
That said , if you ’re a fan of Peter Sellers , Bill Murray , John Cleese , or Steve Martin , you ’re probably going to like this list more than not .
But if you ’re knowledge of comedies extends only back to 1990 or so , you ’ll probably be a little lost .
Like no Guide we ’ve ever put together , this one goes back even to the silent era , though obviously modern sensibilities were weighed in the decision - making factor .
I will also note that many of the movies that scenes were taken from had dozens of scenes to choose from , but out of fairness , there ’s only one scene per movie included among the top 50 , which offers yet another opportunity for you folks to take umbrage .
At any rate , here are your 50 Funniest Movie Scenes of All Time .
There ’s a lot here NSFW , and there ’s a couple of hours , at least , of humor to be had on this page .
Bookmark it .
Come back to it on days that life pummels you .
If laughter is indeed the best medicine , there ’s enough here for a few overdoses .
50 . The Pink Panther Strikes Again featuring Peter Sellers
49 . Duck Soup , featuring Harpo & Groucho Marx
48 . Ghostbusters featuring Bill Murray
47 . Wet Hot American Summer , featuring Michael Showalter and Christopher Meloni

Tens of thousands of foreign students may have entered the UK to study at bogus colleges , MPs believe , before the system of accreditation was tightened up this year .
One student , who wishes to remain anonymous , told BBC News how an offer to study for a degree in the UK turned out to be a scam .
The student says many Indians dream of a degree from the UK I am an Indian citizen and came to the UK to study in 2005 at a college based in the heart of London .
Earlier that year I received an email from a person who claimed that my CV had been selected for a Masters in Business Administration ( MBA ) course in London .
I initially ignored it , but the prospect of a foreign education was just too tempting .
I contacted the man and secured admission to a UK college for the MBA .
The costs were much lower than for a normal UK college or university , and since I did n't want to put too much financial strain on my parents , I decided it would be a good option .
I still needed a bank loan though and borrowed about £ 6,000 from a bank in India , which I had to start paying back immediately after the year - long course .
I got my student visa sorted and came to the UK with a dream of getting my postgraduate degree .
' Weird education ' I visited the college to get the initial stuff sorted and to obtain timetables for the lectures .
I found the building to be quite small for a " college " building .
Lectures started and I realised that the majority of the students , say about 85 % , were Indian .
In the next few weeks , I found their method of education weird .
All the students knew they had been tricked .
But we were too ashamed to go back to India
In India you get a good standard of education - this was much worse .
Assessments were questions on the board .
This is how you get assessed in school , not for a university qualification .
No course materials were provided and the university to which the college claimed to be affiliated was " work in progress " .
The principal was a Sri Lankan national and so were most of the teachers .
Nothing about this college was up to the mark of an education institution and I knew it was all a sham .
All the students knew they had been tricked .
But we were too ashamed to go back to India .
I was completely shattered , but I knew I could n't tell my parents .
Serving burgers
Some students started doing part - time jobs to survive and in the hope that they could save enough for a proper college degree in the UK .
I joined them .
On a student visa you can only do 20 hours paid work a week - a proper graduate - level job was out of the question .
With a first - class graduate degree from India , I found myself working behind tills and serving burgers .
My self - confidence had taken a huge step back .
I knew people in all jobs should be treated equally , but I had not slogged for four years in India to get a first - class degree and serve burgers in London .
Months passed by and I decided I had to get out of this , so I decided to gain some work experience .
It cost about £ 500 to gain an internship in a good company - for unpaid work .
I took my first step back towards the life I deserved and secured an internship with a renowned company based in central London .
I still needed money to survive , so I also took a job working nights with Royal Mail .
My employers were ok about it , and understood I had to earn money to live .
I could go home and sleep for a few hours before my night shift .
I started taking pills which helped me stay awake .
Being in this position was dangerous , when I think about it - but I knew I would survive somehow .
Three months of work experience put me in a better place to find a job and I did eventually .
Today I am working in a good job I like with my head high .
I have put this experience behind me .
' Blind '
Some students from the college I attended got their student visa extended from other fake colleges which charge around £ 500 for a fake degree , and they continue to work here illegally .
Many of the migrants we see working in fast food places and distributing free papers are students like me who were duped and are now trying somehow to survive .
They could be engineers , IT professionals or accountants in their home country .
But these fake colleges have made them work in blue collar jobs in the UK .
I think the Home Office is blind and does not see through these scam colleges .
I have since found out , through articles in the Indian press , that these agents for bogus colleges can take 40 % of the course fees themselves .
Obviously no UK university would pay this to an agent .
I survived this whole scam , but I hate these tricksters .
Hate does not even encompass my feelings for them .
The college referred to in this article was never accredited to recruit students from outside the EU .
The BBC has seen evidence that it was recruiting students from India until at least 2006 .

Hot -Dog Vendor Economics
A Slate article mentions that the annual price of a hot - dog stand license near the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is $ 362,201 .
Licenses are very limited and are bought at auction .
The price presumably reflects the economic rent associated with the particular site ( the price would be a lot lower in the middle of Central Park ) .
Yet at a fixed cost of $ 1,000 per day , how can a hot - dog vendor make enough money to cover his variable cost , including the value of his own time ?
If , on average , he sells only one hot dog and drink every minute the Met is open , with about 500 average daily opening minutes , that ’s 500 servings per day .
If he charges $ 3 for a dog and drink , his revenue of $ 1,500 leaves him $ 500 per day to cover variable costs .
Seems possible , but I would expect that he ’s not making economic profits .
If the city were to issue many more licenses , we would see more vendors , cheaper hot dogs , but , in the end , no higher net returns to the vendors .

Will Torchwood : Children of Earth director Euros Lyn be the man in charge of the much - rumored Doctor Who movie ?
Rumors say yes , and also suggest that the movie is only two years away .
Advertisement
BleedingCool.com suggests that Lyn has already been approached for the project - confirmed as in development by the BBC and expected to be announced at this year 's San Diego Comic - Con - and that the movie will be headed up by departing showrunner Russell T Davies and starring outgoing Doctor David Tennant , allowing the incoming team of Steven Moffatt and Matt Smith to concentrate on the television series .
If true , then the movie will reunite Lyn with Tennant and Davies ; as well as directing many episodes during their Who tenure , Lyn will helm Tennant 's final episodes , including the scene regenerating the character into his new , younger , Matt Smith incarnation .
Adding fuel to the fire , Lyn , Tennant and Davies have all been confirmed to appear at Comic - Con later this month .

You know I would n’t have believed it if i had n’t read it myself .
For those who were n’t already aware of the Judd case they are learning what happened on Tuesday March 18th , 2008 .
Here ’s a quick rundown from what we know according to police reports :
4 off duty police officers , after a day of St. Patrick ’s celebrations ( according to testimony by a member of their own party ) walked down the street to confront a neighbor for their partying .
Words were exchanged , and after being told to leave the property a fight broke out on the neighbors property .
Jason Judd , who was carrying his sidearm ( which is against policy according to police personnel manual ) then shot two of the individuals .
For many of those who are well aware of this incident , many are learning of the twists and turns regarding the case .
For example , the Topeka Capital Journal reported that off duty police officer Jason Judd did not take a blood test to determine his alcohol level until sometime between 9am – 12 pm THE NEXT DAY .
A time span of possibly 9 hours after the altercation took place .
For anyone who understands metabolism , it seems an awfully long time to wait to correctly determine Judd ’s alcohol level from the night before .
Another twist came when Johnson County DA ’s special prosecutor Cindi Carle decided the Topeka DA ’s office did not have probable cause to prosecute Jason Judd and company .
This decision was announced despite the fact that Judd and company confessed to have been partying and drinking according to police reports , trespassed on another ’s property and shot his neighbors .
Nancy Parrish , the judge presiding over this case didnt buy this and ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine the merits of the case and whether it should go to trial .
Now , Special Prosecutor Carle believes that witnesses to the Judd incident should n’t give their personal testimony at the upcoming evidentiary hearing on July 2nd .
Thats right !
The only individuals who were there that night , who know what actually happened that night and Carle thinks that it would n’t be a good idea to hear both sides of the story .
What is she thinkin ?
Does n’t she understand that we all want the truth !
FAST FORWARD JUST A FEW HOUR LATER …
Judge Parish sets
Carle straight when she ruled that witnesses to the night in question should be allowed to give their side of the story .
CRAZY HUH ?
http://www.cjonline.com/news/local/2009-07-01/judge_witnesses_can_testify#new
No , not really .
Just plain ‘ ol common sense .
Seems that everyone under the stars thinks getting to the truth would be a good idea .
The defense agrees .
Judge Nancy Parrish agrees .
Topeka Capital Journal readers agree .
TCJ Editorial Board agrees .
Our readers all agree .
Only Special Prosecutor Carle and a few individuals out there think its not worth it to get to the truth .
Why is that ?
any ideas ?

Heart - Kun is an adorable dog with a heart marking on his side .
He 's a minor internet celebrity and was even featured on the post we recently linked to featuring animals with heart markings .
His parents recently gave birth to a new litter , including little Love - Kun who also has a heart marking .
Now that is one special family .
Fellow students at Bern 's German - speaking Liebefeld - Steinhölzli School recall North Korean heir apparent Kim Jong - un as unremarkable and obsessed with basketball , the Washington Post said Wednesday .
Those who knew " Pak Un , " the name he used at the Swiss school , say he was indifferent to political issues and never made any anti-American comments .
He worshipped basketball players in the NBA .
A friend who visited his apartment at # 10 , Kirchstrasse , Liebefeld , recalls that Kim had a room filled with NBA - memorabilia .
" He proudly showed off photographs of himself standing with Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers .
It is unclear where the pictures were taken .
On at least one occasion , a car from the North Korean Embassy drove Pak Un to Paris to watch an NBA exhibition game , " the daily said .
In class , Pak Un was generally shy and awkward with girls , but he became a different person on basketball court , according to his classmates .
" A fiercely competitive player , " said classmate Nikola Kovacevic .
" He was very explosive .
He could make things happen .
He was the playmaker . "
Kim also had a collection of Nike sneakers .
" We only dreamed about having such shoes .
He was wearing them , " recalled Kovacevic , who estimated the price of each pair at around US $ 200 .
Another friend , Marco Imhof , who used to play basketball with Kim , said two Korean women often observed their play and videotaped it at times .
" It was a bit strange , " I mhof said , but he thought this was just " a Korean thing . "
Fake Blood Used In Harlequins Rugby Club ’s “ Bloodgate ” Scandal
Total Pro Sports –
It is amazing how far some will go to help lead their team to victory .
While some would be willing to take a few punches in order to change the momentum , others have shown that they have no problem with cheating .
Look no further than Boston ’s beloved franchises .
In England , the notion of cheating was taken to a whole new level .
It was all part of a plan put together by Harlequins ’ director of rugby Dean Richards , and club physio Steph Brennan .
Richards ordered Brennan to purchase a pack of blood capsules from a Clapham joke shop .
The capsules were to be used by players in order to fake injuries during a Heineken Cup match against Leinster .
The player they used as their subject was Quins full - back Tom Williams , a young but promising player who obliged when asked to commit the act .
Willliams admits that when he was handed the fake blood capsule on the pitch by Brennan he put it in his sock and then pulled it out after a contact situation and tried to bite on it .
The capsule fell out of his mouth , forcing him to pick it up and and try the whole process again in full view of the sold - out stadium and television cameras .
[ ThisIsLondon.co.uk ]
When officials of Leinster began yelling that the blood was not real , Williams asked the club doctor Wendy Chapman to cut the inside of his lip with a scalpel .
The pantomime nature of the incident continued in the medical rooms under the stand with Williams and Dr Chapman initially having to avoid the gaze of doubting officials and find a room where they could cut his lip .
A picture was taken of the cut which was neatly done and did not require any stitches .
In a hearing on the incident , Williams claimed that he was given a lucrative offer of compensation by club chairman Charles Jillings , and chief executive Mark Evans if he agreed to hide the complete details of the situation by making a “ limited ” appeal .
The offer included compensation for a 12 - month ban , a new four - year contract , and an offer of employment with the team following his retirement .
This move was made in a effort to prevent the team from receiving a Heineken Cup ban and relegation .
Williams had refused such offers and has come forth with the complete details , which were uncovered during the hearing .
He was given a 4 - month ban for his involvement in Bloodgate , while Richards has received a 3 - year ban , Brennan got a 2 - year ban , and the club was fined £ 259,000 .
What may have initially seemed like a good idea for the Harlequins rugby club has turned into a costly one .
Next time Harlequins are looking for blood , they should consider just asking their players to bite his tongue during the game , rather than later on at the hearing .
Here is a video of Will Carling talking about “ Bloodgate ” which includes a clip of Williams spitting blood as he walks off during the match ( 19 second mark ) .

There was a time when Sarah Palin made the case that serving as a Republican Governor was just about the most patriotic thing a person could do .
That , of course , was before she got sick of her job and decided to move on .
But just in case she forgets how essential she once said her job was , here 's a flashback to November 13 , 2008 , at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Miami , Florida .
What this video really shows is that whatever Palin is saying at any given moment are just words fluttering out of her mouth .
She may believe them as she says them , but they have no durability ; in the long run , any promise she makes is almost completely devoid of any significance or meaning .

Even at the best of times , Internet traffic in Iran is subject to extensive filtering .
But in the wake of the disputed election and the civil unrest that has followed , the government appears to have taken more aggressive steps to police online communications .
Nevertheless , news and images continue to make their way out of Iran , and a limited amount of organization by groups within the country appears to be continuing despite both online and real - world crackdowns .
This can be ascribed in part to a number of volunteer efforts to provide Iranian citizens with secure ways of accessing the ' Net through secure proxies .
According to the OpenNet Initiative , Iran is ranked up with places like China and Burma as having pervasive filtering of online content .
The ONI completed a report on the nation immediately before the election that suggested the country was following a trajectory similar to China's .
Internet use is booming , having grown roughly 25 - fold in this decade alone .
The government had initially relied on off - the - shelf software to block sites deemed offensive for political or cultural reasons , but has developed an expertise and sophistication that matches the growth in the number of users it must police .
As a whole , the nation has started relying on Internet access for business and government services , which means that it can't realistically pull the plug on all services ( a route apparently taken by Myanmar during recent protests there ) .
Private households , however , have been subject to bandwidth caps that would make using video a painful experience , and all traffic must be routed through the state - owned Telecommunication Company of Iran , where filtering takes place .
On Saturday , June 12 , the day after the election , TCI simply pulled the plug .
Arbor Networks , which aggregates data from a number of global ISPs , saw traffic plunge radically , and then perform an erratic partial recovery .
Although it 's impossible to tell precisely what 's going on , increased use of deep packet inspection hardware could account for the slow return of traffic .
What does appear to be increasing is the use of proxy servers by Iranian citizens , who can use them to obscure both the site that 's being visited and the content being obtained from it .
A blog at the Tor project , which develops the software needed to maintain an anonymizing chain of encrypted proxy servers , has seen several indications of an upsurge in use by Iranian citizens .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is suggesting that anyone interested in helping out the Iranians consider running a Tor Bridge , which will allow the user to help forward
Tor traffic without having their computer 's IP address show up in any public list , which could expose them to blacklisting by Iranian authorities .
But Tor is n't the only game in town when it comes to proxies .
The Web proxy Squid will apparently work , and instructions for its use , along with a secure configuration file are also available .
Other volunteers have created an ISO for use with VMWare and a VirtualBox VM file , either of which will boot into a Debian environment that runs Squid and Tor services by default .
Even a commercial service , IP Rental , that provides anonymized access to a temporary IP address chosen from a large pool , is chipping in .
Although it provides commercial services , anyone from Iran can apparently request a free account .
Of course , they presumably need encrypted access in order to safely exchange those emails in the fist place .
The main thing to emphasize is that anyone volunteering has the potential to do more harm than good .
Improperly configuring any of these services can result in IP addresses that are visible and subject to blocking by Iranian authorities , or transmission of data in plain text .
They also hold the potential of running you up against your ISP 's usage caps , and may ultimately make your machine the target of hacking attempts by those loyal to the current Iranian government .
It 's essential that anyone considering helping the citizens of that nation out understand the risks and have sufficient technical competence to ensure that everything is configured properly .
Microsoft ( MSFT ) is about to give its Web portal MSN a big re-design , BoomTown reports .
It 's a retrenchment , mainly .
“ It ’s a decision to make it so MSN does less better , ” one source told BoomTown .
“ So there will be a focus of attention on a smaller number of categories in which we can be either # 1 or # 2 in , rather than # 4 or # 5 . ”
There will be a greater emphasis on News , Sports , Finance , Lifestyle and Entertainment offerings .
Not surprisingly , those are verticals MSN media boss Scott Moore had a lot of success with when he ran the Yahoo Media Group until late last year .
Part of the redesign will be aimed at integrating Bing more tightly into the MSN user - experience .

So long Mel , and good riddance .
Global trade and the economic stimulus policies of individual national economies will play an important role in the recovery from the current global recession .
This is especially true of the world 's two largest economies , the United States and China .
The US economy was running an annualized trade deficit of $ 697bn , or five per cent of GDP , when our recession began in the last quarter of 2007 .
By the first quarter of this year , it had fallen by more than half to $ 327bn , or 2.3 % of GDP .
Partly this is due to the arithmetic of going into a world recession with a large trade deficit .
If imports and exports decline by the same proportion , then the trade deficit will shrink , because the imports are bigger in absolute size .
It so happens that US imports have declined even faster than our exports in percentage terms too , partly due to falling oil prices – which are also a product of the world recession .
This means that the US economy is getting a boost from the global economy during the current global recession .
It may not feel like that , as we in the US now hemorrhage jobs and have about one - sixth of the labour force officially unemployed or underemployed .
But the national income accounting is real .
If not for our shrinking trade surplus , for example , the first quarter of this year would have seen a fall of 7.9 % of GDP , instead of 5.5 % – a big difference in terms of output and employment .
Countries that export a lot ( relative to their economy ) and entered the recession with a surplus are affected by the opposite arithmetic : they get hit harder in the recession as their trade surplus shrinks .
Japan 's GDP is projected to fall by six per cent this year , much worse than the United States ' projected 2.6 % .
Although it is no consolation for the Japanese , their shrinking trade surplus contributes to the growth of the rest of the world .
Countries that export significant amounts to the US have also been hit hard .
Mexico , which exports more than 21 % of its GDP to the US , is expected to shrink by 7 % this year .
Brazil , by comparison , exports less than two per cent of its GDP to the United States ( and does not have a large trade share of GDP overall ) , is expected to decline by 1.3 % .
This seems to offer a lesson for developing countries : it 's good to diversify your trade , and maybe not become overly dependent on markets where there are enormous asset bubbles ( such as our $ 8tn housing bubble ) and large trade deficits .
Mexico's " free trade " agreement with the United States also had the misfortune of not even producing decent economic growth before the crash .
But the most interesting case is China , which over the last three decades has had the fastest - growing economy in world history .
The Chinese economy grew at 9 % last year , and now looks likely to grow by 8 % this year .
Hans Timmer , director of economic forecasting at the World Bank , told the Wall Street Journal that " China will be among the first countries to lead the global economy out of this recession . "
He appears to be right .
Remarkably , this is despite the fact that China – which has had a lot of export - led growth for many years – is facing a rapidly - shrinking trade surplus .
This shows how powerful an effective economic stimulus can be to counteract the fall - off in private demand .
China 's stimulus is not just a matter of deficit spending , as economist John Ross has emphasized .
China 's government has other tools available , and is using them in a big way .
The state controls most of the banking system , and has used this control to double the amount of bank lending in the first half of this year , as compared to 2008 .
It has greatly increased investment by state - owned enterprises , which are a large share of investment in the Chinese economy .
The money supply has increased 28 % over the past year .
( There is no need to worry about domestic inflation , which has been negative for the last year . )
This has implications for the rest of the world that go beyond the significant positive effect that China , the world 's second largest economy , will have on the global recovery .
It is clear that more countries need to counter the fall - off in private spending with large - scale and effective stimulus programmes .
This is true for developing countries as well as for rich countries .
Of course , many developing countries do not have the institutional capacity to implement a stimulus as effectively as China has done .
In many cases this is because neoliberal reforms over the past quarter of a century have weakened the capacity of the state to respond appropriately to the global downturn .
China did not adopt reforms that would cause the government to lose control over key policy instruments .
Nonetheless , most developing country governments can still use expansionary fiscal and monetary policies as much as possible to counteract the downturn .
Unfortunately , the IMF , which supports such counter - cyclical policies in rich countries , has been promoting the opposite – including fiscal and monetary tightening – in some low - and - middle - income countries .
Rich countries also seem to be more hamstrung than China .
The US has approved a stimulus package that for 2009 and 2010 – taking into account the spending cuts and tax increases by state and local governments – is only about 0.9 % of its national income .
This is a small fraction , perhaps not even a tenth , of the expected decline in private spending from the bursting of America 's $ 8tn housing bubble .
Critics will point out that the Chinese government can move public investment projects much more quickly because it does not have to respond as much to environmental or other citizen concerns .
But there are other stimulus policies in the US that can be implemented very quickly .
The sad truth is that in spite of our more developed system of governance , the rule of law , and a much more developed economy , the US government has not been all that responsive to the most urgent needs of our national economy in a time of its greatest challenge since the great depression .
In fact it is less responsive than the government of a middle - income country run by a Communist party .
That ought to give American pundits and social scientists something to think about .
Update :
We also suggest reading our follow - up to this piece , With Chrome OS , Google Intends to Destroy the Desktop and Microsoft .
-
It 's only been a few days , but it feels like weeks since Google announced Google Chrome OS and stirred up the blogosphere and the imagination of techies and Microsoft haters everywhere .
The response , the analysis , and the debate has been constant ever since .
Can it beat Windows ?
Can it even run Photoshop ?
Two days ago , we profiled the ongoing battle between Microsoft and Google , focusing on areas where the two companies compete .
Almost everyone has framed Google Chrome OS as a direct competitor to Microsoft Windows .
But I am about to argue that this is the wrong way to view Chrome OS .
Google 's goal is n't to have the majority market share .
The goal is to force you on the web more and for longer .
Why ?
It 's all part of Google 's simple equation to monetize the world .
It 's not about how Google makes money , it 's about where
What website does n't have a Google ad these days ?
Google generated about $ 21 billion in revenue last year .
The vast majority of that revenue , well over 95 % , comes from advertising via its search engine and its AdSense program , which places ads on millions of websites , including Mashable .
You probably already knew that , though .
The key to understanding why Google is building an OS based on Chrome though is n't about how it generates revenue , it 's about where .
The answer 's simple : anywhere on the web .
View a YouTube video ?
That 's revenue for Google .
Visit Mashable ?
Google makes money .
MySpace ?
Search ?
The New York Times ?
In almost every instance in which you spend time on the web , Google is able to generate click revenue , impression revenue ( primarily via DoubleClick ) , and is able to collect data on your browsing activities to better target ads that will interest you .
The Google Revenue Equation
Thus , while Google has a lot of complex algorithms that go towards improving its revenue , it really has one overarching equation and correlation that always holds true .
I have faith that you 've guessed it by now .
Here it is :
Revenue = Amount of Time on the Web
Since nearly every website holds a Google ad slot , every impression and every second you spend on the web is revenue for Google .
Every second you 're playing a desktop game , using Microsoft Office , or using AOL Instant Messenger , that 's unrealized potential revenue .
The equation may be obvious , but that does n't diminish its importance .
Its product releases are a clear indication of this trend .
Nearly every Google product is designed to get you on the web .
Gmail is integrated with Gtalk online , Google Docs exists in the cloud , and most of all , Google Chrome is designed to get the world to rely on web - based applications more .
The video above explains why they built Chrome : faster load times , increased use of web apps by users , and freeing up user time so they can browse the web more .
Each and every one of those improvements means increased time on the web , which , if you remember the Google Revenue Equation , means more money .
Chrome OS : Keeping you on the web
Google Chrome and Google Docs have not only increased web - based use , but they have spurred their competitors to build products that bring users onto the web more and for longer periods of time .
In fact , it 's rumored that Microsoft Office is coming to the Cloud very soon .
Google Docs changed the game , and Microsoft reacted .
Google hopes for the same reaction from Microsoft and Apple to Chrome OS .
Its biggest selling points , directly from Google , are that it will " get you onto the web in a few seconds , " that " most of the user experience takes place on the web , " and finally that " all web - based applications will automatically work and new applications can be written using your favorite web technologies . "
This does n't sound at all like Google 's trying to build a competitor that users will choose over Microsoft .
Instead , it sounds like its goal is to get people onto the web faster and for longer .
Getting you to spend more time on the web is why Google based its OS on Chrome .
You can expect that Microsoft and Apple will incorporate the best features of Chrome OS in their future iterations .
That 's exactly what Google wants ( and by the way , since Chrome OS is open - source , Google 's making it easy ) .
As long as you 're on the web , Google wins .
So we need to stop framing the Google - Microsoft battle in the context of " Chrome OS vs. Windows , " because Google will not win a straight up battle .
And guess what ?
That 's not Google 's goal .
We need to frame it in the larger context of the Google Revenue Equation and how much time we spend on the web .
Chrome OS is just another step in getting us online , both directly and indirectly .
If you view the battle with this in mind , then you realize that Google will almost certainly succeed .
Google will have won once again .
Here we go again .
A Danish art conservator claims that the controversial Vinland Map of America , published prior to Christopher Columbus 's landfall , may not be a forgery after all .
" We have so far found no reason to believe that the Vinland Map is the result of a modern forgery , " says René Larsen of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts .
Reuters first publicized his results last week but provided none of the skepticism being voiced by veterans in the field .
The map mysteriously emerged in a Geneva bookshop in 1957 depicting a " new " and " fertile " land to the west that Viking explorer Leif Eriksson had christened Vinland .
Eriksson 's 11th - century voyages to Newfoundland are well - known today , but they were thought to be unknown to 15th - century Europeans .
The Vinland map could represent the earliest cartographic record of North America and prove that Europeans were aware of the continent prior to Columbus 's voyage .
But scientific experts have bickered over the map 's authenticity since the 1970s , as described in a 2004 Scientific American article .
The map 's parchment dates to circa 1434 , but scientists say that the underlying yellow - brown ink has a chemical component , anatase , that indicates a 20th - century origin .
In the new study , presented at the 2009 International Conference on the History of Cartography in Copenhagen , Larsen proposed a possible explanation for the ink 's anatase .
He suggested the mineral comes from gneiss rocks in the Binnenthal area of Switzerland , which have long been used for sand production .
Sand , he explains , was commonly used to dry ink prior to the introduction of blotter paper : " You often find remains of it in old books and manuscripts . "
But Kenneth Towe , a retired geologist from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , who has followed the issue for many years , says that Larsen is a " serious " researcher but his explanation is " bogus . "
" The problem is if the anatase … came out of gneiss or any other natural source , it is going to have a totally different appearance than the anatase that appears on the Vinland map ink , " he notes .
Towe says the Vinland ink has small round crystals produced chemically , whereas sand would have larger fractured crystals from grinding along with other minerals like quartz .
" Even if sand has been found on other maps , " he adds , " it still has never been found on the Vinland Map . "
Larsen responds he has not looked at the crystals himself but suggests that the sand has been through a " cleaning " that leaves only the smallest crystals .
He also claims that the yellow - brown marks are actually a residue left behind after black ink flaked off the map , calling into question the findings that the anatase was only found in yellow ink .
The only thing that is certain , Towe says , is this wo n't be the end of the Vinland controversy .
" This thing has a life of it 's own , " he says .
OTTAWA – Prime Minister Stephen Harper is condemning Iranian authorities for using " brute force and intimidation " to stifle widespread protests against that country 's recent election results .
" The reaction of the Iranian authorities to the demonstrations in Iran is wholly unacceptable , " Harper said in a statement today .
" The regime has chosen to use brute force and intimidation in responding to peaceful opposition regarding legitimate and serious allegations of electoral fraud , " he said .
The strong statement comes with word that a Canadian journalist has been detained in Iran .
Canadian consular officials are seeking access to Maziar Bahari , an Iranian - Canadian detained Sunday while working for Newsweek magazine .
Harper said the human rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression , were being ignored , citing the arrest of protesters and the crackdown on journalists .
" Canada calls on the Iranian authorities to immediately cease the use of violence against their own people , to release all political prisoners and journalists — including Canadians — who have been unjustly detained , to allow Iranian and foreign media to report freely on these historic events , and to conduct a full and transparent investigation into allegations of fraud in the presidential election , " Harper said .
Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon summoned Iran 's top diplomat in Canada to protest Bahari 's arrest .
The charge is the highest - ranking Iranian diplomat in Ottawa .
Neither country has had an ambassador in the other 's capital for a about a year in a diplomatic skirmish over acceptable candidates .
The charge runs the embassy in the absence of an ambassador .
Consular officials have sent a diplomatic note to Iranian authorities in Tehran to demand immediate consular access to Bahari .
Online profiles of Bahari say he was born in Iran in 1967 and studied in Montreal , where he earned a degree in communications from Concordia University .
Newsweek says he is a Canadian citizen who has been living in and covering Iran for the last decade .
The magazine has called for his immediate release and is asking western governments to use their influence on his behalf .
Bahari is one of at least two dozen journalists and bloggers arrested in Iran since protests began there a week ago over the recent presidential election .

An Afghan voice against the US - led occupation
By James Cogan
25 July 2009
Malalai Joya
The so - called “ lefts ” and liberals who try to justify the war in Afghanistan with claims it is bringing democracy and liberation to women do not like what Malalai Joya has to say .
A 31 - year - old Afghan woman and politician , she is intimately familiar with the reality of what is happening in her country and she tells the truth : the US / NATO occupation has created a “ disastrous situation ” for the long - suffering Afghan people .
Joya gave an extensive interview to the WSWS earlier this month , while she was in Australia promoting her recently published biography , Raising My Voice .
The book provides an account of her life , which has been shaped by the foreign occupations , insurgencies and civil wars that have ravaged Afghanistan since 1979 .
As a child she lived as a refugee in both Iran and Pakistan during the protracted Soviet occupation .
As a young woman , she defied the Taliban ’s reactionary restrictions on female education and helped operate an illegal school for girls in Herat province .
In the wake of the 2001 US - led invasion , she felt compelled to step forward and speak out against the pro-US puppet regime of President Hamid Karzai that had been installed in Kabul by the Bush administration .
The occupation placed back into key political positions many of the brutal warlords and militia commanders who had plunged the country into civil war from 1992 to 1996 .
The Taliban ’s denunciations of their atrocities were a major factor in its ability to win support and take control of most of the country by the end of 1996 .
At the age of 25 , Joya was selected as a delegate to the December 2003 loya jirga that was convened to rubber - stamp a new Afghan constitution .
Instead , she delivered a speech in which she demanded that the warlords should be put on trial for their numerous crimes , not sitting on constitutional committees and holding government posts .
Her microphone was cut off within two minutes and she was temporarily expelled from the convention .
In September 2005 , she was elected to the Afghan parliament as a representative of the western province of Farah .
In May 2006 , she was physically and verbally abused when she denounced other members of the assembly as the “ kind [ who ] destroyed the country and killed 60,000 people ” .
She was subsequently prevented from speaking on other occasions .
On May 21 , 2007 , the majority of the Afghan parliament removed Ms. Joya from her elected seat , using a clause in the constitution that forbids members from “ publicly criticising ” one another .
Her offence had been to state in a television interview that the assembly was “ worse than a stable ” because at least animals served useful purposes .
More than two years later , she is still barred from the parliament .
She lives under the shadow of death threats , issued by both pro-US Afghan factions and the Taliban , and she is forced to take extraordinary security measures to avoid assassination .
Despite the dangers , she continues to speak out .
Her voice deserves to be heard .
Her words are a damning indictment of all the apologists for the war in Afghanistan .
Note : Malalai Joya is not a native English speaker .
For clarity , her answers have been grammatically edited .

James Cogan :
What do you hope to achieve with the book Raising My Voice ?
Malalai Joya :
After the 9/11 tragedy , the US and its allies invaded my country in the name of women ’s rights , human rights and democracy .
Through the media they try to promote this to people around the world .
It is all propaganda and lies .
I hope this book will first of all open the eyes of democratic people around the world and also send the message on behalf of my people that in the struggle for emancipation we need the helping hand of democratic men and women , human rights ’ activists and women ’s rights activists .
We want liberation .
We do n’t want occupation .
Most importantly , the book is to take the mask from the fundamentalist warlords , drug- lords and criminals who after 9/11 came to power in the name of democracy , but who are mentally [ ideologically ] the same as the Taliban .
Today in Afghanistan , we have a mafia system and it is an especially hard situation for women .
JC : Why do you think the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001 ?
MJ : Why did they bring the Northern Alliance [ the anti-Taliban alliance of former Afghan warlords ] to power ?
The US and its allies invaded Afghanistan and imposed such elements on our people for their own strategic policies and because of the geo-political location of Afghanistan .
The military bases in Afghanistan can be used to control other Asian powers like China , Russia , Iran and Pakistan and other countries .
It is impossible to bring democracy , women ’s rights and human rights through the enemies of these values and also through war .
You can ’t .
The situation in Afghanistan and Iraq proves that .
After nearly eight years , they have turned Afghanistan into a centre for drugs .
High - ranking officials in the government are famous drug - traffickers , such as Hamid Karzai ’s brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai .
Now , they are negotiating with the Taliban .
Since Obama has come into power , there have been invitations for Hekmatyar [ 1 ] to join the government , and even Mullah Omar [ 2 ] .
Some former Taliban are already in power .
JC : Do you have any information on how advanced the talks with Hekmatyar and other factions are ?
MJ : They want to negotiate with them .
Many times Karzai made invitations during the Bush administration .
Since Obama came to power , he also wants to call barbaric Talibs “ moderate ” and let them join the government .
That is why we believe that they have pushed us from the frying pan into the fire .
Obama ’s policies are quite similar to Bush — and in some sense he is worse than him .
The air strike in Farah province was the most brutal since 2001 in Afghanistan .
More than 150 people were killed .
It was quite a massacre and most of them were women and children .
They even used white phosphorous .
They did n’t want to give an exact report .
They said only 20 to 30 civilians were killed .
Later they said the Taliban killed them .
These are just lies .
Karzai ’s government had a commission which went there and they said 144 were killed .
But it was more than that .
It is first of all shameful of the US government .
It is a war crime they are committing in Afghanistan .
After seven years we have gained nothing .
We have only lost our independence .
If the occupation forces do not leave Afghanistan voluntarily then they will face the resistance of my people .
During the first few months of Obama ’s administration around 400 civilians have been killed .
He wants to surge more troops to Afghanistan .
More troops will bring more conflict , more war .
Under Obama , it is not only Afghan civilians being killed , but also innocent people in the Pakistan border area .
JC : The way it is presented in the US and Australia is that the only people who are opposed to the occupation are Taliban or Islamic extremists .
MJ : Firstly , let me say that the Australian government has followed for eight years the wrong policy of the US government , which is a mockery of democracy .
As I have said , they imposed the sworn enemies of democracy on our people .
While we have many democratic men and women in our country and also some democratic parties , they are very weak today .
Karzai ’s government is a puppet , mafia regime — one of the most corrupt governments in the world .
Today , 18 million people live on less than $ 2 a day , while Karzai ’s government has received $ 18 billion from the international community in the name of reconstruction .
Most of the money from the international community went into the pockets of the warlords or the official donors themselves .
The city of Kabul has been changed into the city of beggars .
Most of them are women and children .
Eighty percent of the people live below the poverty line while America alone spends $ 100 million a day on the war .
We are sandwiched between two enemies : external enemies and internal enemies .
If the external enemy leaves Afghanistan and stops supporting the enemies of my people with money , power and weapons , it will be easier for us to fight against them .
They have already been prosecuted in the minds and hearts of our people .
Our people do not support them anymore .
Let me say on behalf of my people , condolences to the families in Australia , and the US , and England , who have lost their loved loves , their husbands and sons in Afghanistan .
They are the ones who first of all should raise their voices against the wrong policies of their governments .
JC : Are you supporting any candidate in the August elections in Afghanistan ?
MJ : Our people have no hope in an election under warlordism , drug- lordism , corruption and occupation forces .
It has no legitimacy at all .
Most of the candidates are discredited faces .
Karzai is a shameless man .
He is betraying my people by choosing [ for vice - president ] two cruel and criminal men like Fahim [ 3 ] and Khalili [ 4 ] .
Even Human Rights
Watch said that by this act Karzai insulted the people of Afghanistan .
To help the democratic people around the world to better understand this election it is enough just to say “ one puppet will be replaced with another puppet ” .
My people know even now that the winner will most certainly be selected behind the closed doors of the White House and the Pentagon .
JC : Can you describe the living conditions that face ordinary people ?
For example , what are conditions like in Farah province where you are from ?
Malalai Joya signing copies of Raising My Voice in Adelaide
MJ : Like most of the men and women of my country , Farah people suffer injustice , from insecurity , from poverty and joblessness .
There are local warlords , on one side , who are in power on behalf of this government and control Farah province , but from another side , the Taliban criminals are also getting more powerful .
There is no justice in Afghanistan .
The number of rape cases is historical .
In the northern provinces , the Northern Alliance warlords are very powerful .
Twelve rape cases have been reported by the media but there are many more than that .
A woman was raped by three men , one of them a son of a member of parliament , and the police did n’t pay any attention to the case .
When I get back to Kabul I have an appointment with another girl who was raped .
I try to meet with them just to try to give them strength , to give them hope , so they do n’t burn themselves [ commit suicide ] .
While education is a key to our emancipation , the fundamentalists are against education .
They are killing the teachers , threatening the teachers .
They are throwing acid in the faces of the girls .
Fifteen girls who went to school in Kandahar province had acid thrown in their faces .
More than 100 female students in the northern provinces of Afghanistan were poisoned .
The condition of the schools is very poor .
Teachers go for months without receiving salaries .
The salaries are not enough for living , about $ 60 a month .
They have just blackboards and no heat .
They are establishing private schools and universities .
The best teachers are going to them and the families and children of the warlords and those who are in power can go .
Most people cannot go .
The level of education is very low .
According to Oxfam , just one in five girls are in primary education and one in 20 in secondary school .
Some 200,000 children in the areas under the control of the Taliban are completely deprived of education .
JC : Can you describe the situation you face for speaking out the way you have ?
MJ : My life is no better than that of my people .
I exposed these warlords after 2003 and my life has changed and become risky , and day by day it becomes more risky .
I am woman and those in power are against women .
Five times they have tried assassination attempts against me .
I have to change houses and face many other problems that you can read about in the book .
My life is an example of the life of democratic and innocent men and women of my country who nobody knows about .
Democratic activists are risking their lives .
Nobody listens to our voice .
Because I spoke the truth inside parliament , they cut off my microphone and they threatened me .
In May 2006 , they threw bottles of water at me and threatened me with rape inside parliament .
Every time I expose their crimes , they say I am an “ infidel ” , “ a communist ” , “ not Muslim ” .
The ones in power mix Islam with politics , just like the Taliban .
They use it like a whip against our people .
No -one is allowed to talk about secularism .
Because they could not make me silent in parliament , they used one of my interviews against me and expelled me , which was an illegal act and against freedom of speech .
They threatened my lawyers .
In parliament , they even said I must be punished with the Kalashnikov [ rifle ] !
Anyway , as I told them : “ One day you may be able to kill me physically .
You are killing thousands of my people , millions of my people .
But you can never kill the voice of the people .
One day the truth will be known . ” I do not fear death .
I fear political silence .
JC : Western governments try to justify the occupation with claims that if foreign troops left there would be a civil war ...
MJ : They say that if they left Afghanistan a civil war will happen ?
Let ’s talk about today ’s civil war .
After nearly eight years , we have not gained even the limited rights that Afghan women had in the 1970s and 1980s .
After 9/11 they said that women can now take off the burkha .
Laura Bush always tried to make this point for the Bush administration .
But the burkha is not the main problem for women of my country , and not the only problem .
Women wear the burkha today for security reasons .
That is why I am saying the only solution is a secular , democratic government in my country .
The occupation forces are supporting the enemies of my people and it is better that they leave .
We will know what to do about our destiny .
It is easier to fight against one enemy than two .
We must end the drama of the “ war on terror ” , which is a war against the innocent people of my country .
The US government has long had plans for Afghanistan .
Now it is making a massive base at Bagram and forcing local people to leave .
They are spending $ 80 million to set up a new Guantánamo Bay camp there , and this is happening under Obama ’s administration .
We will never accept the occupation .
One day , I ’m sure they will face the resistance of my people .
We have lost almost everything , but we have gained one positive thing and that is the political knowledge of my people has improved and that gives us hope for the future of Afghanistan .
Notes :
[ 1 ] Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was the main US - backed mujahaddin warlord in the 1980s .
In 1992 , he was installed as prime minister .
In subsequent factional warfare , he ruthlessly attacked his opponents and the civilian population .
Along with other warlords , he was driven out of Kabul by the Taliban in 1996 .
After the US invasion , he came into conflict with the occupying powers and called for an alliance with his former Taliban enemies and advocated armed resistance to the foreign forces .
Hekmatyar ’s Hezb - e - Islami movement is currently waging an anti-occupation guerilla war in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
In May , there were reports that it had been offered talks over the possibility of ending its involvement in the insurgency and joining the Afghan government .
Hekmatyar was to be granted a full amnesty for his past crimes .
To date , Hezb - e - Islami has rejected the overtures .
[ 2 ] Mullah Omar is the religious leader of the Taliban movement , which overthrew the warlord regime in 1996 and established a harsh Islamic state until its overthrow by the US invasion .
He is believed to be directing Taliban resistance to the occupation from somewhere in Pakistan .
Hamid Karzai has publicly appealed to Mullah Omar on several occasions to agree to “ peace talks ” , most recently on July 13 .
To date , the offer has been rejected by the Taliban .
[ 3 ] Mohammad Qasim Fahim , an ethnic Tajik warlord , was the commander of the Northern Alliance ’s forces in October 2001 and assisted the US military overthrow the Taliban .
In the 1990s , the militia under his command was accused of massacres and atrocities against civilians , especially in Kabul .
[ 4 ] Karim Khalili , an ethnic Hazara powerbroker , is one of the current vice - presidents of Afghanistan .
Like Fahim , he is accused of atrocities against civilians during the 1992 to 1996 civil war .
I 'm loving the Windows 7 " Boot to VHD " lifestyle .
This is n't Virtual Machines , to be clear , and it 's not Dual Booting .
It 's Boot to VHD .
Let me break it down :
Method Pros Cons Dual Booting Your OS 's always run at full speed .
You can screw up your partition table .
You have to partition which means disks of fixed size .
Or you can have them all share the same disk , which is dangerous .
OS 's are n't portable .
Virtual Machines
Your OS 's are completely separate from each other and can't hurt one other .
Your OS 's are very portable .
You get Undo support for your disks .
Everything is virtualized , so you 're taking a perf hit on pretty much everything .
Often not a good solution for laptops .
Boot to VHD
Your OS runs on the hardware directly , except your disk , which is virtualized and runs inside a single file .
Estimated 3 % - 5 % perf hit .
Seriously .
Also is awesome on a laptop if you have the HD space .
None !
But I 'm biased !
Neener neener !
Only works on internal drives or ESATA .
No USB Drive support .
No undo disk support .
Making a VHD is easy with Windows 7 since you can create and mount / attach VHDs in the standard tools .
VHD as a disk format is built into the Operating System ( although , strangely , you can't mount ISOs . ) .
You can create a blank VHD , set it up in your boot menu with BCDEdit ( details and walkthrough here and a video demo here ) and then just boot off your VHD .
If you want to install your OS ( Windows Server 2008 and Win 7 Enterprise or Ultimate are the only ones supported ) then you just install away .
However , this is STILL not convenient enough for me .
I 'm always trying crazy new Daily Builds of big stuff that takes a while to be installed .
The step where I install an OS onto my VHD takes too long , so I 'd like a prepared VHD that 's already to be started for the first time , kind of like when you buy a machine from Dell or whoever and you get that nice " starting your computer , detecting drivers " action on first boot .
Well , there 's a script over at the MSDN Code Gallery to help with this .
It 's the Windows Image to Virtual Hard Disk Converter ( WIM2VHD ) .
From their description :
The Windows ( R ) Image to Virtual Hard Disk ( WIM2VHD ) command - line tool allows you to create sysprepped VHD images from any Windows 7 installation source .
VHDs created by WIM2VHD will boot directly to the Out Of Box Experience , ready for your first - use customizations .
You can also automate the OOBE by supplying your own unattend.xml file , making the possibilities limitless .
Fresh squeezed , organically grown , free - range VHDs - just like Mom used to make - that work with Virtual PC , Virtual Server , Microsoft Hyper - V , and Windows 7's new Native VHD - Boot functionality !
I like this guy already .
How to SysPrep your Windows 7 Image
I copied my Windows 7 DVD to a folder on a drive with lots of space free .
I probably did n't need to copy it over , but it likely made the process faster .
Then I downloaded and installed the Windows® Automated Installation Kit ( AIK ) for Windows ®
7 . This file is a large ISO ( 1.5G ) so be aware .
It 's meant for admins , not humans .
I did n't want to burn the ISO to disk , so I used 7 - Zip to open the ISO as an archive and extract it .
( If you 're not using 7 - Zip , you 're missing out on life , BTW )
Now , go into C : \Program Files \Windows AIK \Tools and find ImageX.exe and copy it where you put the Windows Image to Virtual Hard Disk Converter ( WIM2VHD ) script .
Go read the Example Command Lines for Win2VHD , but since I had a Windows 7 Ultimate I ran this command - line .
Note that d:\win7working is where I copied my DVD .
cscript wim2vhd.wsf /wim:d:\win7working\sources\install.wim /sku:ultimate
In this example , d:\win7working is the folder I copied the DVD to .
Could be your DVD drive too , I suppose .
It chewed for a while , maybe seven minutes .
You 'll also here the " Device Plugged In " sound as the script automatically connects a VHD as a drive temporarily so do n't panic :
D:\>cscript wim2vhd.wsf /wim:d:\win7working\sources\install.wim /sku:ultimate

Magical .
Now I 've got a 5 gig VHD file that I can setup to boot from directly as described here .
The first time I start up , it 'll be 95 % into the setup process and just ready to detect my hardware .
It 's a nice " OEM - like " VHD that I can use again and again .
Since I 'm only using these VHDs temporarily ( for a week or two for testing ) I wo n't use an activation key and instead leave that field blank during setup .
That 'll buy me 30 days of testing if I need to , and I can easily start over by just starting over with my new fresh VHD .
Enjoy !
Now go tell Mike and his team that they 're awesome .
Go ahead .
I 'll wait here .

Chris Kahn - NEW YORK ( AP ) —
When owners of the Empire State Building decided to blanket its towering facade this year with thousands of insulating windows , they were only partly interested in saving energy .
They also needed tenants .
After 78 years , Manhattan 's signature office building had lost its sheen as one of the city 's most desirable places to work .
To get it back , the owners did what an increasing number of property owners have done — they went green , shelling out $ 120 million on a variety of environmental improvements , a move would have been considered a huge gamble a few years ago .
Buildings that define city skylines across the country , some national icons , are catching up to the sleek , new structures designed with efficiency in mind , as property owners and managers become convinced that a greener building now makes financial sense .
That 's because in recent years environmental retrofits have begun to pay off for owners and tenants alike .
Higher - profile companies are seeking out more efficient office space , and new technology at older buildings has started to translate into higher property values , leases and occupancy rates .
" In a good market , we 're going to get the best rents for the best tenants , " said Anthony E. Malkin , who leads a real estate group that owns the Empire State Building .
" In a bad market like we have now , we 're going to get tenants when other buildings wo n't . "
Renovation specialists around the country have been plugging porous walls in numerous old buildings , adding high tech water systems and using recycled material in carpets and tile .
One of them is the Christman Building in Lansing , Michigan , an 81 - year - old Elizabethan Revival office that 's listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
While repairing the limestone exterior and preserving unique details like the mica light fixtures , the building owners spent $ 8.5 million to add water - efficient plumbing and increased the amount of natural light .
They also capped the building with a reflective " cool " roof .
Chicago 's Sears
Tower announced late last month that it will embark on a five - year , $ 350 million green renovation .
The 110 - story , staggered skyscraper , which turned 36 this year , will crown its rooftops with solar panels , wind turbines and up to 35,000 square feet ( 3,250 sq. meters ) of sunlight - absorbing gardens .
When complete , the improvements will cut the tower 's annual electricity use by 80 percent and save 24 million gallons ( 90 million liters ) of water , property managers say .
Building owners trumpet their environmental commitment when extensive modifications are made , yet in many cases those changes are being pushed by tenants .
Many high - profile tenants wo n't even consider moving into a property without the U.S. Green Building Council 's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) certification , said Allan Skodowski with Transwestern management group .
They may not even know what the certification means , he said , but they demand it nonetheless .
" They say ' We want LEED , ' " Skodowski said , " and that 's it . "
Nine of Transwestern 's properties received certification this year .
A combination of energy efficient light bulbs and other green equipment helped those buildings slash energy consumption .
On average , they 've seen a 2 percent drop in energy costs , even as electricity rates jumped between 10 percent and 40 percent , Skodowski said .
Leasing rates have not risen as a result of the changes , Skodowski said , yet at the same time occupancy rates have not fallen .
That 's a victory for an industry hit hard by the recession .
Vacancy rates at office buildings nationwide have gone from 10.9 percent at the end of 2007 to 12.4 percent in the first quarter of this year .
" If one extra tenant comes and looks at the building , if the owner gets an extra penny or so a foot , then at the end of the day it 's paying for itself , " Skodowski said .
A recent analysis by real estate researcher CoStar Group , Inc. found that green - certified buildings had fewer vacancies than other buildings with similar age , size and location .
The CoStar study , which included about 3,000 green - certified offices , found that buildings with the council 's certification enjoyed higher occupancy rates ( 90.3 percent ) than their peers ( 84.7 percent ) in the first three months of 2009 .
Certified buildings have fetched higher lease rates for several years .
The CoStar report said the buildings rented at an average of $ 38.86 per square foot in the first quarter of 2009 compared with $ 29.80 per square foot for their peers .
" This is n't just a ' We are doing the right thing ' movement , " said Marc Heisterkamp , U.S. Green Building Council 's director of commercial real estate .
" In the end , the numbers pencil out . "
At the Empire State Building , Malkin proposed a top - to - bottom renovation that included a $ 13.2 million investment in new green technologies .
The goal was to sufficiently reduce greenhouse gases without spending more than he could justify to his investors .
What the owners settled on was a series of upgrades that include retrofitting all 6,500 windows .
Under every window , radiators will be padded with extra insulation .
The building 's lighting , cold water and ventilation systems also will be upgraded .
The renovation should take 18 months .
Afterward , the owners expect an annual energy savings of $ 4.4 million , enough to pay off the new technologies in about three years .
Already , the renovation has lured upscale , energy - conscious companies like Swedish construction firm Skanska , said Ray Quartararo with Jones Lang Lasalle , which is managing the renovation .
Skanska wanted its U.S. headquarters to have a LEED " platinum " certification — reserved for only the most efficient of buildings — and it found a willing partner in the Empire State Building .
Skanska officials said the building 's management helped them install bike racks and add other energy - saving details on the 32nd floor .
" We had looked at several downtown spaces , but the Empire State Building made the most sense , " a company spokeswoman said .
Jacques Catafago , an attorney who works 16 floors above Skanska 's new office , is also happy with the changes .
Catafago has fought the building management before on other fees , but he said he would n't mind paying more rent if it goes toward renovations that cut his electric bill .
Besides , Catafago said , he 's already checked out the rent for similar buildings in the city and realizes he has a pretty good deal at the Empire State Building .
" We 'd be paying twice as much " uptown , he said .

Harry releases the review of the flaming turd he 's clenched for 2 days : TERMINATOR SALVATION !
Published at : May 20 , 2009 , 9 a.m. CST by headgeek
( Given every paper / site online has broken embargo .
Here ya go )
It is a very rare thing for a film to shit squarely on my open and unexpecting eyes to such a degree that absolute hatred and loathing festers out of my every pore … but McG managed to do it with TERMINATOR SALVATION .
This is odd .
I ’ve been wildly excited about this movie throughout production .
I love the trailers , tv spots and the special internet trailer thing that was n’t a clip like it said it was .
I ’ve been circling buying many of the toys – I ’ve been thinking of picking up a couple of the SIDESHOW TOYS things they ’ve been advertising on my site .
I was so excited I even sent my wife into a 7 - 11 to get me a Slurpee cup for the TERMINATOR SALVATION movie .
But today , I began to get a tad nervous about seeing the film .
I dug out my TERMINATOR Blu - Ray , my foreign T2 HD DVD and I thought about watching the last 15 minutes or so of Mostow’s .
I put fresh batteries in my Stan Winston / Terminator head that McG gave me at Butt - Numb - A - Thon … and I was going to tune my brain into the fevered state necessary for a new TERMINATOR film .
But as I held that TERMINATOR Blu - Ray … I sat it down and I did n’t put it in .
I thought .
You know , maybe that would be stacking the deck against McG .
This is a beginning of a new series .
I should just go in and let it play for me .
Yoko called me from work about 30 minutes before she got off and I was already annoyingly excited about the movie , demanding that she come home immediately so we could get to the theater .
I wanted to be at the theater .
I wanted to see the line of anxious fans .
I wanted the excitement to envelope me .
I feed on that kind of psychic geek energy .
This is big summer movie energy .
But it was more than that .
I was 12 when THE TERMINATOR came out and thank God , my parents were the kind of awesome people that let me watch it .
Now – that movie is all kinds of awesome greatness – but the thing that captured my imagination were those glimpses of the future mythology .
The resistance .
Purple lasers shooting & blowing the fuck out of robots .
In a fearful world where anyone looking human could suddenly whip out a gun and start killing everyone .
It scared the fuck out of me , but it fascinated me .
When TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY came out – I had purposefully stayed ignorant of everything about the film .
I knew nothing .
I was obsessive about seeing it – and I remember the giant ass line I stood in for the film .
And while Robert Patrick was amazing with the help of ILM – I was left amazed by the brief glimpses of the future – that lone shot of a scarred John Connor with the binoculars .
That reinforced the dream of John Connor and the Future War .
I ’ve been dreaming and chatting about the “ Future ” for a long time .
With Mostow’s TERMINATOR 3 – I loved the idea of a machine sent back to just ensure the preservation of Skynet and if it could take out the future leader of the resistance or key associates of the resistance … all the better .
But I did n’t like the Termanatrix , but I really loved it when Connor found himself in that bunker – with radio messages coming in and he suddenly found himself exactly where he was always meant to be .
This was how it began for John Connor .
In this mountain , these weapons , these tools … this is where he began to build the resistance .
So , while I did n’t like bits of the film or the antagonist …
I did n’t feel betrayed or a sense of loathing for the film .
But it was not either of the first two films .
This brings me to TERMINATOR SALVATION .
An experience that I fucking loathed .
First off – the screen at the Gateway was warped slightly at the top and along the side .
So not the theater I wanted to see this “ hopefully ” awesome film at .
But the screen did n’t cause me to hate the film .
Nor was it the dispassionate audience that laughed mockingly at a few particularly awkward sub-ARMAGEDDON cutsie - poo scenes .
No. TERMINATOR SALVATION is about accomplishing 3 things .
1st – John Connor has to meet his dad , Kyle Reese and hand him a photograph of his mommy .
2nd – John Connor must become the leader of the resistance .
3rd – John Connor must get his scar .
What causes TERMINATOR SALVATION to fail in a way that has all the power of a yawn ?
Well , first off – nothing has any weight to it .
Christian Bale looks like he could give a shit about all of this .
Somewhere while he was holed up in his mountain with his wife he has suddenly developed a slight British accent .
Which just does n’t feel right .
I never buy that he loves his wife Kate Connor that is played by Bryce Dallas Howard – whose sole job in the film is to really open her eyes wide .
( and I like Bryce , it ’s just she ’s given not one solid scene . )
But by incorporating a structure kinda like PEARL HARBOR and all big movies that leave their soul – to tell a lot of pieces of an overall epic story – this film does n’t have a main character that we care about .
And does n't develop any of the characters we 're left with .
The star of the film is Sam Worthington .
He plays a Death Row inmate that is written terribly .
His scenes with Helena Bonham Carter are so mind numbingly awful , that you will not be able to not stare with train wreck in your thoughts ( especially the latter scenes ) .
She has n’t been this bad since Kenneth Branagh ’s FRANKENSTEIN .
But wow , she ’s excruciatingly awful here .
Perhaps I should tell you the opening scene .
We open with Sam ’s Marcus sitting on his prison bed as a ridiculously awful looking Helena Bonham Carter comes out .
She ’s there to get Marcus to sign his body , post - execution , away .
She tells him she can give him a second chance at life .
Would n’t he want that ?
He tells her a sentence about how he killed his brother and some other men , he does n’t deserve a second chance .
She continues to go after his body and he agrees , but on the condition that she kiss him .
Her lips are so sickly looking , and he kisses her by grabbing the back of her head and forcing her face into his suddenly .
When he pulls away he says rather absurdly , “ Now I know what Death tastes like ! ” – the line and the delivery were BAD !
I ’m talking the kind of bad that you repeat as a watermark of awfulness .
It ’s a shame that Nolan was n’t the sole screenwriter here … but those guys from CATWOMAN and T3 .
Anyway , Sam Worthington .
He ’s the star of Cameron ’s AVATAR and the upcoming CLASH OF THE TITANS .
McG gets nothing out of him .
He ’s got sad eyes for the entire film .
Which fits his morose Death Row Inmate , who wakes up naked in mud in the wasteland of the apocalypse .
I can see a performance in him , he ’s got a great face and body for film – but McG really seems to have asked for nothing out of him .
But he certainly does n’t come out of this as a star .
His Marcus does come across a real performance though .
Anton Yelchin ’s the real deal folks .
His CHARLIE BARTLETT was great .
His Chekov was spot on in JJ ’s STAR TREK , but his Kyle Reese .
Man , I just wanted to spend time with him .
He ’s perfect .
He ’s playing Kyle as a young man trying to find a way to become a member of the resistance , but he ca n’t get his radio to even work .
When Worthington ’s Marcus meets Yelchin ’s Kyle – things seem to pick up ever so slightly , but then we get introduced to one of the many utterly worthless characters in this film .
Kyle ’s sidekick is this little girl with a perm and a beret – that says nothing , but seemingly is always on hand with the right prop at the right moment .
She ’s oh so adorably worthless in the film .
When I first saw her , I thought – “ Oh wow , this is going to be our Ferel Kid from the THE ROAD WARRIOR or Newt from ALIENS … a cute kid raised in the wake of Judgment Day – a mean little kid that kills robots .
Nope .
She ’s just mute and delivers useful props in the film .
These two characters get picked up and taken to SkyNet in San Francisco – probably because SkyNet needed the most powerful computers in the world … which are probably ILM ’s computers .
Heh .
But no , they do n’t do anything that fucking cute .
Sigh .
With Marcus no longer with a thoroughly interesting character like Yelchin ’s Kyle Reese … he ’s given the horrifying acting cohort of Moon Bloodgood as a downed Resistance pilot that goes into battle with Geisha makeup , even though she ’s half Korean and not Japanese .
If you hated “ Animal Crackers ” – wait till you see her cuddle scene .
FUCKING AWFUL .
Shortly after this – we have Marcus ’ machine reality blown – and he now has to escape the resistance in order to save Kyle Reese .
His scenes with Christian Bale are dreadful .
First off , there ’s zero smartass or fun in this John Connor .
Having been helped by one Terminator – well it does n’t seem to have given him much insight into anything .
And you can tell that Bale does n’t give two shits about the first two films , or anyone that has done anything with the character before .
Or how the character was described .
He ’s got his own take on the material and it is BORING , UNINVOLVING , and without a single iconic moment .
His performance is FLAT , and this is an actor I love on film , but not this time .
Also in this travesty is COMMON playing BARNES .
Apparently his brother died , he hates the machines .
End of character .
There ’s also Michael Ironside as the leader of the resistance known as General Ashdown .
He ’s really got nothing to work with other than taking a bit of the piss out of the prophesized Savior John Connor .
Whom he does n’t believe in .
By the time Marcus Wright is infiltrating SKYNET helping John Connor to rescue Kyle Reese before the Resistance blows it all to hell …
We ’re in the midst of pointless action and nonsensical meaningless bullshit .
Somehow in this film – it is fairly fucking common knowledge that Kyle Reese is John Connor ’s daddy .
Somehow - even fucking SKYNET knows this .
Now you might think – AH – so the tension is – they have to rescue Kyle before they scan and recognize him – somehow .
Well , except SkyNet finds him pretty quickly – but decides to use him as bait .
Instead of killing him , which would have resulted in SkyNet winning .
Ok – so then – through the most painfully excruciating sequence of the film – when Marcus is in Skynet and is trying to access the files on where Kyle Reese is … suddenly McG “ nukes the fridge ” by giving SkyNet a face .
SkyNet is Helena Bonham Carter – the chemo lady that visits Marcus when he was on Death Row to get him to sign his body over to Cyberdyne .
And through this really long and grotesque hand - holding monologue catching the painfully slow - witted Marcus up on what ’s going on … well , it ’s bad !
Really bad !
I ’m talking , you want to look away from the screen cuz it ’s fucking embarrassingly awful bad .
And if that was n’t bad enough – she has to show off crazy nonsensical morphing capabilities to show how her face could be anyone ’s in Marcus ’ memory .
And it feels like the scene will never end .
I ’ll stop there and not go into the rest of the film – with the exception of Arnold ’s scenes , which he had nothing to do with , other than a body cast that Stan Winston did on him years ago .
Charlie Gibson and his team at ILM did a stunning job , for the 3 shots they deliver of 1984 Arnie .
There ’s no dialogue .
But it is cool .
Although pointless .
It did cause a momentary buzz of excitement in the theater .
And this is really the only thing besides a few scenes of Anton Yelchin ’s Kyle Reese that are even vaguely compelling in the film .
The action is dead because I do n’t really care about the characters at all .
I ’m not emotionally on board for anyone other than Kyle .
The effects work is top notch .
But it really does n’t matter .
The idea that McG made a John Connor adult leader story that makes John seem worthless is insulting .
No character in the film gets the time to be anything .
Even Anton ’s Kyle Reese – as wonderful as it is – it ’s there and gone , back for a bit , but ordered off screen .
John ’s fight with the Terminator is badly edited .
In one scene you ’ll see the Arnie bot throw John across a room hiting something metal that just folds up from the impact … then the next time you see John , he ’s like a SWAT member , coolly and calmly checking his corners for bad guys .
Beaks asked me , “ did n’t you love the Harvester sequence ? ”
It has some nice action beats – but I did n’t care about it .
It ’s basically sub -ROAD WARRIOR stuff .
And when I say that , I do n’t mean slightly …
One of the reason that amazing action sequence with the big semi worked is that George Miller built that character to be an icon , and he was .
I think that ’s what really kills me about the film .
I wanted to come away from this wanting to believe in John Connor .
He ’s the future ’s EL CID .
A man of legend , and sure – we ’re not quite at that part of the story yet , but hell – John Connor was a bit of a badass as a teenage bastard in TERMINATOR 2 .
Here – he ’s just a man that screams his dialogue and says everything through a headache .
As soon as you realize that Marcus is a MAN built into a robot – you ca n’t help but think of Peter Weller ’s ROBOCOP – and how effortlessly human and heroic that character was .
This film frustrates me , because this was supposed to be epic .
This was supposed to be amazing .
This was something I have wanted to see for a long goddamn time , and it ’s a piece of shit that occasionally looks really good .
I ’m astonished that anyone that loves the first two films could possibly vaguely give this film a pass .
Yes , the craftsmen and the visual effects artists did their job , but the film just left me furious at it .
At a professional level it is superior to WOLVERINE , but in WOLVERINE ’s series – well … frankly the X - MEN movies can’t even begin to compare to how awesome the first two TERMINATOR films are .
And TERMINATOR 3 , is much better than X3 .
But in a way – I feel about this film , the way I do with Ratner ’s X3 .
In both cases , it feels like children playing with material of which they have n’t the slightest grasp of .
They ca n’t conceive of what actually made the material great to begin with .
To them , it ’s the props , the hardware , the most rudimentary iconography .
Not how the characters were LOVED by their creators .
That the first TERMINATOR was a love story first and foremost .
That the second TERMINATOR was a story about an overly protective mom and her son .
This ?
This movie is about how he got that scar – and it is n’t Quint ’s story about the tattoo removal , this is about the time a Terminator scratched my face .
Seriously .
In the same way that Ratner let me down with the Phoenix saga , McG has let me down with the untold epic story of John Connor .
I know nothing I will say will stop you from seeing this film this weekend .
The result will be a frustrating experience for many of you .
Those of you that can divorce the myriad of conundrums regarding everything about this film .
And really , how fucking stupid is Skynet ?
And is it self - aware of how stupid it is ?
At best , it is artificially average intelligence .
At the very least , Skynet is obviously PC based .
I hate the film .
Pure and simple .
I loathe it .
I hated it so much I did n’t want to see my friend ’s faces afterwards .
I just wanted to go home and vent .
I really really hate this film .
I hate how much effort so many great artists and technicians put into a film that ’s this fucking bad .
Ultimately its just shit moving , like a sewer pipe .
I hate that there is n’t a sustained scene or sequence that I love as much as the best moment from TERMINATOR 3 .
I hate that when I left the theater I felt empty and let down .
That I felt like writing a review like this instead of fucking dry humping a great TERMINATOR movie .
This feels like ALIEN RESURRECTION to me .
Something that kills something wonderful for me .
I ’m no longer interested in Terminator .
McG terminated my enthusiasm .
I love the first two films .
At least I ’ll always have that .
Fuck this movie .
At the NCUA , we ’re always looking for ways we can support you in that mission .
We want to give you the tools you need to better serve all of these populations and communities who are being overlooked .
These are worthwhile goals we can work toward without compromising the safety and soundness of any of the institutions under our oversight .

A POLICE officer who was thrown out of the North Yorkshire force despite being cleared of abusing girls as young as nine has lost his High Court bid to be reinstated .
Mark Verity , of Ringstone Close , Clifton Moor , York , stood trial at Leeds Crown Court in March last year , accused of molesting six girls , all under the age of 13 .
The probationary officer , then aged 22 , was found not guilty on all charges , but the High Court heard that his police career was later cut short when the force ’s Chief Constable decided to “ dispense with his services ” on grounds that he was “ not likely to become an effective police constable . ”
Mr Verity ’s lawyers criticised the Chief Constable ’s ruling as unlawful , and accused him of taking into account irrelevant factors relating to the charges of which he had been acquitted .
But top judge Mr Justice Silber said the Chief Constable was entitled to reach the view that Mr Verity “ could not for the forseeable future independently patrol or deal singly with children ” and that the “ safest course of action would be to restrict his duties very significantly so as to make him office bound . ”
He said : “ The Chief Constable must be allowed a substantial degree of deference as he , unlike a judge , knows what constables are expected to do and the risks that the claimant ( Mr Verity ) might constitute to children . ”
The Chief Constable had been entitled to obtain a “ complete picture about whether the claimant could perform any duty which might be expected of a police constable , including dealing with children . ”
Testimonials and “ much material supportive ” of Mr Verity had been placed before the Chief Constable and the judge concluded : “ I was left with the clear impression that the claimant had a fair hearing . ”
Mr Verity , who was suspended from duty for nearly a year before the trial , could not be contacted yesterday for comment .
A team of Harvard scientists has taken an important first step toward the development of new treatments to help people with HIV battle Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( TB ) infection .
In their report , appearing in the July 2009 print issue of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology ( http://www.jleukbio.org) they describe how HIV interferes with the cellular and molecular mechanisms used by the lungs to fight TB infection .
This information is crucial for researchers developing treatments to help people with HIV prevent or recover from TB infection .
" HIV / TB co-infection is a critical global health problem , especially in developing countries , " said Naimish Patel , M.D. , lead researcher on the study and Instructor of Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School .
" We hope that these findings will lead to further studies and possible new therapies for treating or preventing tuberculosis in HIV disease . "
Patel and colleagues made their discovery by extracting immune cells called " alveolar macrophages " from the lungs of otherwise healthy , asymptomatic HIV - positive patients as well as from people who did not have HIV .
In people who are HIV - positive , the macrophages have a decreased response to the TB bacterium when compared to people who did not have HIV .
To learn why , the scientists examined lung specimens from the HIV - positive patients and found increased levels of a molecule called IL - 10 , which elevated the amount of a protein called " BCL - 3 " in alveolar macrophages and that reduced their ability to ward off TB infection .
" HIV and TB represent two of the most significant health challenges in human history and the combination of the two infections is particularly devastating because HIV dramatically increases the severity of TB infection , " said John Wherry , Ph.D. , Deputy Editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology , " There are still many unknowns about how HIV reduces the ability of the body to combat other infections .
This study sheds light on co-infection with HIV and TB , which up to this point , has perplexed scientists and physicians alike . "
Even if he does seek counseling , there is no guarantee that he will be able to move past all of his psychological reservations .
On the other hand , there is no guarantee that there will even ever be a problem once we get to that point .
He was raped without a condom .
That woman stole his virginity , and in a relationship following the rape did , they did not abstain from sexual activity .
He is not a virgin , but he ’s re-devoted himself to purity and to viewing women as valued and not objects .
In that relationship , he had sex to devalue the impact of his rape and he insisted upon a condom because it gave him a sense of control .
I never said he was impotent ; I know he is fully capable .
The doubt lies in his being able to complete the act on the marriage night and potentially beyond .
I plan to not enter into a marriage with him until I can be assured that he has dealt with these issues .
It would be imprudent of me , in my opinion , to not consider marriage a possibility and at the same time continue to be in relationship with him .
Do you suggest I abandon him because of his issues , and refuse to forgive his past misjudgments ?
I may currently hope for the best , but I am not foolish enough to enter into a relationship with him with only my hope as a reassurance .
Our marriage is not pending , and not to take place anytime in the immediate future .
I ’m sorry ; I feel very attacked , which may be my own fault for asking such a question .
These are all things I intend to discuss with a priest prior to our being wed , as well .
I was just curious as to what the good folks here thought on the matter .
When evolution skeptics want to attack Darwin 's theory , they often point to the human eye .
How could something so complex , they argue , have developed through random mutations and natural selection , even over millions of years ?
If evolution occurs through gradations , the critics say , how could it have created the separate parts of the eye -- the lens , the retina , the pupil , and so forth -- since none of these structures by themselves would make vision possible ?
In other words , what good is five percent of an eye ?
Darwin acknowledged from the start that the eye would be a difficult case for his new theory to explain .
Difficult , but not impossible .
Scientists have come up with scenarios through which the first eye - like structure , a light - sensitive pigmented spot on the skin , could have gone through changes and complexities to form the human eye , with its many parts and astounding abilities .
Through natural selection , different types of eyes have emerged in evolutionary history -- and the human eye is n't even the best one , from some standpoints .
Because blood vessels run across the surface of the retina instead of beneath it , it 's easy for the vessels to proliferate or leak and impair vision .
So , the evolution theorists say , the anti-evolution argument that life was created by an " intelligent designer " does n't hold water :
If God or some other omnipotent force was responsible for the human eye , it was something of a botched design .
Biologists use the range of less complex light sensitive structures that exist in living species today to hypothesize the various evolutionary stages eyes may have gone through .
Here 's how some scientists think some eyes may have evolved :
The simple light - sensitive spot on the skin of some ancestral creature gave it some tiny survival advantage , perhaps allowing it to evade a predator .
Random changes then created a depression in the light - sensitive patch , a deepening pit that made " vision " a little sharper .
At the same time , the pit 's opening gradually narrowed , so light entered through a small aperture , like a pinhole camera .
Every change had to confer a survival advantage , no matter how slight .
Eventually , the light - sensitive spot evolved into a retina , the layer of cells and pigment at the back of the human eye .
Over time a lens formed at the front of the eye .
It could have arisen as a double - layered transparent tissue containing increasing amounts of liquid that gave it the convex curvature of the human eye .
In fact , eyes corresponding to every stage in this sequence have been found in existing living species .
The existence of this range of less complex light - sensitive structures supports scientists ' hypotheses about how complex eyes like ours could evolve .
The first animals with anything resembling an eye lived about 550 million years ago .
And , according to one scientist 's calculations , only 364,000 years would have been needed for a camera - like eye to evolve from a light - sensitive patch .
Democrats Wo n’t Investigate Countywide “ VIP ” Loans in Order to Protect Chris Dodd
The Democrats campaigned on being the party of open , honest , and transparent government .
There were several scandals in the Republican party that Democrats were able to capitalize on which helped them regain power .
They promised the American people that if they were elected they would usher in a new age of honest government .
Their rhetoric does n’t seem to match their actions so far .
One needs to look no further than the scandals surrounding Dianne Feinstein , Charlie Rangel , Timothy Geithner , and John Murtha for proof of my statement .
But I will look further , because there is more evidence that the Democrat party is not the party of open , honest , transparent government that they claimed to be .
Democrats are refusing to subpoena the records of Countrywide Financial .
There are two main reasons for this ; those reasons are Kent Conrad and Chris Dodd .
Two of their own have received Countrywide mortgages based on the “ VIP ” system .
Countrywide Financial was made an example by Democrats of what is wrong with the mortgage companies , they were made a sacrificial lamb offered up by the Democrats and painted as a major culprit in the mortgage meltdown .
But Countrywide also had a “ VIP ” program called the “ Friends of Angelo , ” ( Angelo being the CEO of Countrywide at the time ) , if you were a “ friend of Angelo ” you got preferential treatment on your mortgage .
Both Kent Conrad and Chris Dodd were “ friends of Angelo ” and they both indeed got preferential treatment on mortgages .
Both men claim that they did not realize being a “ friend of Angelo ” meant that they received preferential loan treatment .
And now Democrats are refusing to subpoena records that may show us exactly what these men knew .
Coincidence ?
I think not !
How convenient is it for the Democrats to just let Countrywide off the hook ?
How open and honest is that ?
If Democrats truly wanted to be the open and honest party they would subpoena these records regardless of which party might be hurt but I guess protecting the party is more important that being open and honest .
Marmaduke , the world 's most lovable Great Dane , leaps from comic strip fame ( appearing in six hundred newspapers in over twenty countries ) to big screen stardom in this family comedy event .

The fact that two American journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , have been sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in North Korea has focused attention on the network of brutal labor camps in that country which the State Department says hold an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 political prisoners .
Like many aspects of life in North Korea , relatively little is known about what life is like in the labor camps .
In her introduction to a report on the camps by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea , Anne Applebaum , an expert on the Soviet gulags , wrote that the testimony of former prisoners suggests that “ the North Korean camps were built according to a Stalinist model ” and “ continue to be run that way . ”
Ms. Applebaum ’s brief summary of the conditions is harrowing :
As in Stalin ’s time , North Koreans are arrested for trumped - up political “ crimes , ” such as reading a foreign newspaper , singing a South Korean pop song , or “ insulting the authority ” of the North Korean leadership .
As in Stalin ’s time , North Korean prisoners — even children — are given ludicrous and impossible work “ quotas ” to fulfill and are subjected to brutal , irrational punishments .
And , as in Stalin ’s time , North Korea ’s leadership does n’t want anyone to know any of these details , since such revelations not only will damage their foreign reputation but also put their own regime at risk .
The complete text of the report , “ The Hidden Gulag : Exposing North Korea ’s Prison Camps , ” assembled by David Hawk , is available online and includes testimonies from former prisoners and satellite photographs of camp sites .
A State Department report released in February , just a few weeks before Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were arrested while filming a report for Current TV along North Korea ’s border with China , said that throughout 2008 : “ Reeducation through labor , primarily through sentences at forced labor camps , was a common punishment and consisted of tasks such as logging , mining , or tending crops under harsh conditions .
Reeducation involved memorizing speeches by Kim Jong - il . ”
Another source of information on the camps is “ The Aquariums of Pyongyang : Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag , ” a memoir by Kang Chol - hwan , a North Korean defector .
The New Yorker ’s Philip Gourevitch wrote in 2003 that Mr. Kang , who was sent to the Yodok prison camp with his family when he was nine years old , “ describes with something of Primo Levi ’s quiet authority how the brutality of the gulag is the ultimate refinement of the North Korean system . ”
Given how rare glimpses of life in the labor camps is , Mr. Kang ’s account has been studied at the highest levels of government in the United States .
In 2005 James Brooke wrote in a profile of Mr. Kang for The Times that after President George W. Bush read his book , “ at the urging of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger , ” he was invited to the White House “ for a 40 - minute meeting with Mr. Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and the national security adviser , Stephen J. Hadley . ”
Mr. Brooke explained that the camp Mr. Kang grew up in “ was run as a business enterprise , with gold mines , cornfields and logging operations operating entirely on unpaid prison labor . ”
Mr. Kang ’s account of life there includes a description of public executions where prisoners were forced to hurl rocks at corpses , and yell , “ Down with the traitors of the people ! ”
As Mr. Brooke wrote , “ Following the beliefs of the North Korean authorities that political deviance is hereditary , entire families were routinely incarcerated , and still are , recent defectors say . ”
Video obtained by a Japanese television station and posted on YouTube , reportedly showing prisoners at the same camp where Mr. Kang was imprisoned , allows us to see what the perimeter of the camp looks like , but seems to underscore that we can only imagine what life is like inside the barbed wire for so many North Korean political prisoners .
That said , there are , apparently , even worse fates in North Korea than being sent to do hard labor and endure “ re-education . ”
In 2007 , my colleague Choe Sang - Hun explained , in an article about a North Korean named Shin Dong Hyok , who had escaped from the prison camp he was born in , that there are camps where prisoners have no hope of ever being released :
A rally was held this evening protesting the arrival of the US envoys in Israel .
Members of National Union , Likud and Israel Beiteinu led the crowd , which included Kahanists wearing t- shirts saying " Kahane was right , " referring to Meir Kahane ’s ideology of violence against all who stand in the way of the constant expansion of Jewish territory .
The people that attended the rally think that occupying another people and chanting racist slurs at the first black president of the United States ( who was elected by a majority of American Jews who support him ) is their expression of freedom and democracy .
As a humanist and a pragmatist , it can feel very uneasy and unsafe in this country .
While the people opposing settlement expansion get no coverage in the media , those supporting it get plenty .
As we were filming the event numerous people asked us detailed questions about where we are from and what we planned on doing with the footage .
It was striking that MK Michael Ari made a special point to thank Arutz Sheva , the Israel National News .
The coverage they put out is fine , but our attempt to show the world their racism is definitely a no - no .
Their relative self - awareness added a new layer to our understanding of settler insanity .
Most people we talked to did not hesitate to attack Obama and his administration , of which many are Jews themselves .
The general atmosphere of the rally was that Obama is a Muslim and a racist who denies the Jewish people their right to control the Land of Israel .
When asked about American aid to Israel , most replied that this was a separate issue .

1 Introduction
This document provides an overview of the main new features of SPARQL and their rationale .
This is an update to SPARQL adding several new features that have been agreed by the SPARQL WG .
These language features were determined based on real applications and user and tool - developer experience .
1.1 List of Features
The following features have been agreed by the SPARQL WG .
These features have been grouped into Required and Time - permitting features as follows .
1.2 Goals and structure of the document
In the remainder of this document we will present the new features according to the nomenclature agreed by the Working Group :
SPARQL / Query 1.1 : referring to the SPARQL Query Language
SPARQL / Update 1.0 : referring to the SPARQL Update Language
Each feature is described in a common pattern as follows :
Motivations a brief sentence explaining why the new feature was added Description a more complete description of the feature Existing implementation (s ) a list of existing implementations for the proposed feature and example syntax used in the implementation Related discussions links to related discussions of the WG regarding the feature ( mainly issues raised ) and Status the status of the feature , i.e. either required or time - permitting .
This current working draft details only one required features , but motivation and a description is also provided for the time - permitting features .
2 SPARQL / Query 1.1
2.1 : Aggregate functions
2.1.1 Motivations
Aggregate functions allow operations such as counting , numerical min/max / average and so on , by operating over columns of results .
They are currently not taken into account in SPARQL and then require additional scripting to parse query results and get these informations , e.g. the number of triples that satisfy a particular statement .
Hence , a language extension is needed .
2.1.2 Description
In SPARQL / Query 1.0 ( original SPARQL ) , query patterns yield a solution set ( effectively a table of solutions ) from which certain columns are projected and returned as the result of the query .
Aggregates provides the ability to partition a solution set into one or more groups based on rows that share specified values , and then to create a new solution set which contains one row per aggregated group .
Each solution in this new aggregate solution set may contain either variables whose values are constant throughout the group or aggregate functions that can be applied to the rows in a group to yield a single value .
Common aggregate functions include COUNT , SUM , MIN , and MAX .
Aggregate functions are commonly required to perform a slew of application and data - analysis tasks , such as :
Determining the number of distinct resources that satisfy certain criteria
Calculating the average exam score of students grouped by school district
Summing the campaign contributions of donors , grouped by postal code and political party
Applications can typically take a SPARQL / Query 1.0 solution set and calculate aggregate values themselves .
Enabling SPARQL engines to calculate aggregates , however , results in moving work from the application to the SPARQL engine , and will usually result in significantly smaller solution sets being returned to the application .
2.1.3 Existing implementation
The following systems are known by the WG at the time of publication to support one or more aggregate functions :
Garlik's JXT implements COUNT ( ) and AVG ( )
Dave Beckett's Redland implements COUNT ( )
ARQ implements COUNT ( ) and SUM ( ) with syntax like ( COUNT (*) AS ?c ) to fit with expressions .
Bare COUNT (*) allowed .
to fit with expressions .
Bare allowed .
Open Anzo's Glitter engine implements AVG ( ) , COUNT ( ) , SUM ( ) , MIN ( ) , MAX ( ) .
Virtuoso implements AVG ( ) , COUNT ( ) , SUM ( ) , MIN ( ) , MAX ( ) , user - defined aggregates such as VECTOR_AGG or XML tree constructors .
Appropriate GROUP
BY clause is composed automatically , if missing in the original query .
ARC supports COUNT , MAX , MIN , AVG , and SUM .
Several aggregate functions are widely implemented , and implementations tend to project out results like for example :
SELECT COUNT (? person ) AS ?alices WHERE { ? person : name " Alice " . }
return the number of times the a triple of the form _ : name " Alice " appears in the source data .
SELECT AVG (?value ) AS ? average WHERE { ? good a : Widget ; : value ?value . }
2.1.4 Related discussions
Related issues raised by the WG :
[ ISSUE 11 ] : Implicit vs explicit GROUPing
[ ISSUE 12 ] : Presence and syntactic detail of HAVING clause
[ ISSUE 13 ] : Subqueries in HAVING analogous to subqueries in FILTERs
[ ISSUE 14 ] : Which aggregates to include
[ ISSUE 15 ] : Extensibility of aggregate functions
[ ISSUE 16 ] : Dealing with aggregates over mixed datatypes
2.1.5 Status
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
2.2 : Subqueries
2.2.1 Motivations
It is sometimes necessary to nest the results of a query within another query .
It currently requires to get the results of a first query , parse them with dedicated scripts , and then launch the second query .
The Subquery feature would allow to do such nesting in a single SPARQL query .
2.2.2 Description
In SPARQL / Query 1.0 ( original SPARQL ) , to nest the result of a first query into another one , one has to rely on dedicated script (s ) and run separate queries .
For instance , to identify all the people that Alice knows and a single name for each of them , the following script should be done ( in PHP , assuming the do_query function allows to run a SPARQL query and get the results as an array of PHP objects )
$ query = " SELECT ? person WHERE { : Alice : knows ? person . } " ; $res = do_query ( $ query ) ; foreach ( $res as $ r ) { $ person = $ r -> person -> value ; $ query = " SELECT ? name WHERE { ? person foaf : name ? name . } LIMIT 1 " ; }
The Subquery feature will provide a way to nest the results of a query within another query .
That feature could be used , for instance , in the following use cases :
Identifying the 10th latest blog posts created in a weblog , with a single author name for each
Retrieving a list of people with their friends , having only one friend name for each
Limit the number of distinct results retrieved based on the number of resources rather than the number of solutions .
The query form of subqueries has not yet been decided by the WG ( see issues below ) .
2.2.3 Existing implementation(s )
The following implementations are known by the WG at the time of publication to provide a way to run subqueries :
Virtuoso supports both scalar subqueries ( in all places where a variable name may occur ) and subqueries as derived tables .
ARQ includes support for nested SELECTs
For instance , the following query is possible in ARQ , and is equivalent to the script mentioned before .
SELECT ? person ?name WHERE { : Alice foaf : knows ? person .
{ SELECT ? name WHERE { ? person foaf : name ? name } LIMIT 1 } }

2.2.5 Status
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
2.3 : Negation
2.3.1 Motivations
In SPARQL / Query 1.0 ( original SPARQL ) , Negation by failure is possible by combining OPTIONAL , FILTER and !
BOUND .
It is yet difficult to write and can be a burden for learning and using SPARQL .
Hence , dedicated language constructs for expressing negation are desired , as users requested , which the WG agrees with .
2.3.2 Description
Various tasks , such as data validation and social network analysis , can require the checking of whether certain triples do or do n't exist in the graph .
Checking the absence of triples is a form of negation , called Negation by failure ( since it checks if a pattern does not match , and not if it does not exist following the open - world assumption ) and is already possible in SPARQL / Query 1.0 ( original SPARQL ) , using FILTER , OPTIONAL and ! BOUND ( ) , as follows ( to retrieve the ?name of ?x for which no foaf : knows value exists , i.e. identify the name of people who do not know anyone ) .
PREFIX foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?name WHERE { ?x foaf : givenName ?name .
OPTIONAL { ?x foaf : knows ? who } .
FILTER (! BOUND ( ? who ) ) }
Yet , this is not very intuitive to write and learn for users nor does it cater for efficient implementations of negation .
Hence , the Negation feature to be included will provide the support for testing the absence of a match to a query pattern .
Negation can be used in the following use cases :
Identify all people that do not know someone or do not have a particular skill
Identifying any content that has not been assigned a reviewer in a particular review process
Identify customers that did not buy a particular object
The feature would introduce a new operator into the algebra or a new function for filters .
Any existing queries do not use these operators and are therefore unaffected .
2.3.3 Existing implementation(s )
The following implementations are known by the WG at the time of publication to support Negation by failure :
RDF :: Query uses an UNSAID keyword , that was proposed during the first SPARQL WG but not addressed at that time
keyword , that was proposed during the first SPARQL WG but not addressed at that time The SeRQL query language [ SeRQL ] provides a MINUS operator
operator ARQ supports negation thanks to NOT EXISTS operator ( UNSAID ) being an alias for it
operator ( ) being an alias for it SQL provides a NOT EXISTS operator to identify table without a given record
The following example uses SeRQL's MINUS syntax to find the names of all people that do not know anyone , in a similar way to the previous query
SELECT x FROM {x} foaf : givenName {name} MINUS SELECT x FROM {x} foaf : givenName {name} ; foaf : knows { who} USING NAMESPACE foaf = < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
The following example uses the UNSAID syntax :
PREFIX foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x foaf : givenName ?name UNSAID { ?x foaf : knows ? who } }
2.3.4 Related discussions
Related issues raised by the WG :
[ ISSUE 29 ] : Should negation be done via a binary operator on subqueries , a binary operator within graph patterns , or a filter + subquery ?
2.3.5 Status
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
2.4 : Project expressions
2.4.1 Motivations
Being able to return the values of expressions over result bindings , rather than just RDF terms in the store .
2.4.2 Description
In SPARQL / Query 1.0 ( original SPARQL ) , projection queries ( SELECT queries ) may only project out variables bound in the query .
Because variables can only be bound via triple pattern matching , there is no way to project out values that are not matched in the underlying RDF data set .
Projecting expressions represents the ability for SPARQL SELECT queries to project any SPARQL expression , rather than only variables .
A projected expression might be a variable , a constant URI , a constant literal , or an arbitrary expression ( including function calls ) on variables and constants .
Functions could include both SPARQL built - in functions and extension functions supported by an implementation .
There are many use cases that motivate the ability to project expressions rather than just variables in SPARQL queries .
In general , the motivation is to return values that do not occur in the graphs that comprise a query 's RDF data set .
Specific examples include :
Returning the total cost of an order 's line item as the product of two variables : ?unit_cost * ? quantity
Use SPARQL accessors to find the languages used in a dataset : LANG ( ?o)
Returning computed values , such as the current day of the week : ex:dayOfTheWeek ( ex : Today ( ) )
Performing simple string parsing : ex:substring ( ?url , 8 , ex:length ( ?url ) )
TODO : More mention should be made of the connection with subqueries , as the two can be used together to answer many usecases .
2.4.3 Existing implementation(s )
The following systems are known by the WG at the time of publication to support some uses of project expressions :
Garlik 's JXT ( though does n't do CONSTRUCT )
Dave Beckett 's Redland - based storage engines
In ARQ with a slightly different syntax ( AS is part of the ( ) expression ) .
In Open Anzo's Glitter SPARQL engine , with the same syntax as ARQ
Virtuoso , syntax is ( expression ) AS ?alias , the clause " as ?alias " is optional so parentheses around expression are required .
XSPARQL allows XPath / XQuery functions to be used as expressions in CONSTRUCTs as in the example above .
We wish to find names , and whether the person is over 18 .
SELECT ?name ( ? age > 18 ) AS over18 WHERE { ? person : name ? name ; : age ?age . }
Another example , we wish to find the full name of everyone who is interested in trees .
PREFIX foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX : < http://www.example.org/>
SELECT fn:string-join(?givenName , ' ' , ? surname ) AS ?
fullName WHERE { ? person foaf : givenname ?givenName ; foaf : surname ? surname ; foaf : interest : trees . }
This example has made use of a concatenation function from XPath - Functions .
Which functions will be available for value construction in SPARQL is an open issue that will be dealt with on a time - permitting basis .
To return an RDF graph where the first and family names are concatenated to a full name we can use a query similar to the SELECT example from the previous query as a subquery and use a project expression like this :
PREFIX foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
CONSTRUCT { ?x foaf : name ?fullName } WHERE { { SELECT fn:string - join ( ?gn , " " , ?sn ) AS ?
fullName WHERE { foaf : givenname ?
gn ; foaf : surname ?sn . } } }
TODO : It should be established whether any implementations support both subqueries and fn:string - join ( )
2.4.4 Related discussions
The WG has noted that project expressions
is an important way to access the result of aggregate functions ,
can be used to resolve [ ISSUE 4 ] concerning the variable scope between main queries and subqueries .
2.4.5 Status
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
2.5 Query language syntax
2.5.1 Motivation
Certain limitations of the SPARQL / Query 1.0 language syntax cause unnecessary barriers for learning and using SPARQL .
2.5.2 Description
Time - permitting , the SPARQL Working Group will consider extending SPARQL / Query 's syntax to include :
Commas between variables and expressions within a SELECT list
IN and BETWEEN operators to abbreviate disjunction and comparisons within FILTER expressions
2.5.5 Status
This feature is considered as time - permitting only by the WG .
2.6 Property paths
2.6.1 Motivation
Many classes of query over RDF graphs require searching data structures that are hierarchical and involve arbitrary - length paths through the graphs .
Examples include :
Retrieving all the elements of an RDF collection ( structured as a linked list )
Retrieve all of the names of people linked to me transitively via the ex:mother and ex:father relationships ( i.e. all my known ancestors )
What are all of the direct and indirect superclasses of a given owl : Class ?
2.6.2 Description
SPARQL / Query 1.0 can express queries over fixed - length paths within RDF graphs .
SPARQL / Query 1.0 can also express queries over arbitrary but bounded - length paths via repeated UNION constructs .
SPARQL / Query 1.0 cannot express queries that require traversing hierarchical structures via unbounded , arbitrary - length paths .
Time - permitting , the SPARQL Working Group will define the syntax and semantics of property paths , a mechanism for expressing arbitrary - length paths of predicates within SPARQL triple patterns .
2.6.5 Status
This feature is considered as time - permitting only by the WG .
2.7 Commonly Used SPARQL Functions
2.7.1 Motivation
Many SPARQL implementations support functions beyond those required by the SPARQL / Query 1.0 specification .
There is little to no interoperability between the names and semantics of these functions for common tasks such as string manipulation .
2.7.2 Description
Time - permitting , the SPARQL WG will define URIs and semantics for a set of functions commonly supported by existing SPARQL implementations .
See Working Group issue : ISSUE - 2 - http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/tracker/issues/2
2.7.5 Status
This feature is considered as time - permitting only by the WG .
2.8 Basic Federated Query
2.8.1 Motivation
SPARQL is a concise query language to retrieve and join information from multiple RDF graphs via a single query .
In many cases , the different RDF graphs are stored behind distinct SPARQL endpoints .
2.8.2 Description
Federated query is the ability to take a query and provide solutions based on information from many different sources .
It is a hard problem in its most general form and is the subject of continuing ( and continuous ) research .
A building block is the ability to have one query be able to issue a query on another SPARQL endpoint during query execution .
Time - permitting , the SPARQL Working Group will define the syntax and semantics for handling a basic class of federated queries in which the SPARQL endpoints to use in executing portions of the query are explicitly given by the query author .
2.8.5 Status
This feature is considered as time - permitting only by the WG .
3 : Service description
3.1 Motivations
Given the variety of SPARQL implementations , and differences in datasets and extension functions , a method of discovering a SPARQL endpoint 's capabilities and summary information of its data in a machine - readable way is needed .
3.2 Description
Many SPARQL implementations support a variety of SPARQL extensions ( many proposed here for standardization ) , extension functions ( for use in FILTERs ) , and different entailment regimes .
Moreover , the differences in datasets provided by SPARQL endpoints is often hard to grasp without some existing knowledge of the underlying data .
This proposal suggests that these differences may be described by the endpoints themselves , detailing both ( 1 ) the capabilities of the endpoint and ( 2 ) the data contained in the endpoint .
The Service description features can be used in the following uses - cases :
Check the entailment regime supported by a SPARQL endpoint before running a query
Check if an RDF store contains instance of particular class to see if it is worth running a query over it
Check if an RDF store supports a particular extension function
3.3 Existing implementation(s )
The following services are known by the WG at the time of publication to support the Service description feature
RDF :: Query provides service descriptions ( based primarily on the DARQ and SADDLE vocabularies ) referenced in the HTTP response headers of a query
Virtuoso has support for DBPedia VoiD data using a special default - graph of < http://dbpedia.org/stats/void#>, which can be queried using the SPARQL endpoint .
Garlik 's JXT implements something similar to this feature , differences from as described are , the MIME header is " X - Endpoint - Description : " and the URI given is relative to the endpoint : / description .
The following service description is an example of what is provided when querying powered by RDF :: Query using about=1 HTTP parameters , e.g .
http://example.org/sparql?about=1 .

The serviceDescription issue was previously postponed by the DAWG .
3.5 Status
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
The Working Group has resolved to specify a SPARQL / Update language , but may also pursue a HTTP based graph update via the protocol .
This issue is orthogonal to the SPARQL / Update language .
Whether or not there will be a concrete mapping between SPARQL / Update and HTTP based graph update is currently under discussion in the working group .
To change an RDF graph ( either adding , updating or removing statements as well as adding statements from one graph to another or to the default graph of a triple store ) one would currently have to use a programming language and one of several APIs .
In other query languages , notably SQL , there are mechanisms to change the data in the database .
To allow RDF graphs to be manipulated the same way and avoid using third - party APIs , a language extension is needed .
This feature is a language extension to express updates to an RDF graph or to an RDF store .
As such , it uses the SPARQL in both style and detail , reduces the learning curve for developers and reduces implementation costs .
The following facilities are expected to be provided by the SPARQL / Update 1.0 language :
Insert new triples to an RDF graph .
Delete triples from an RDF graph .
Perform a group of update operations as a single action .
Create a new RDF Graph to a Graph Store .
Delete an RDF graph from a Graph Store .
The [ SPARUL ] Member Submission , that contains several examples , have been widely implemented and is considered a starting point for the present work .
The two following examples illustrates some of the features :
PREFIX dc : < http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
INSERT DATA { < http://example/book3 > dc:title " A new book " ; dc:creator " A.N.Other " . }
DELETE { ?book ? p ?v } WHERE { ? book dc:date ? date .
FILTER ( ?date < " 2000-01-01T00:00:00 " ^^xsd: dateTime ) ? book ?p ?v } }
The following systems are known by the WG to support the [ SPARUL ] Member Submission at the time of publication :
ARQ
Virtuoso
Related issues raised by the WG :
This feature is considered as Required by the WG .
By making it possible to update an RDF graph using RESTful HTTP methods , it becomes possible to use either a SPARQL endpoint or a plain Web server to update RDF data .
It should be possible to manipulate RDF graphs using HTTP verbs , notably PUT , POST and DELETE .
By this , clients does n't need to know the SPARQL language to update graphs when it is not needed .
The following systems are known by the WG at the time of publication to support a RESTful update protocol .
Garlik 's JXT supports HTTP PUT and DELETE .
IBM 's Jazz Foundation supports graph update via a RESTful protocol .
This feature is under discussion in the WG .
5 BGP extensions for entailment regimes
5.1 Motivation
Many software systems that support entailment regimes such as OWL dialects and RDF Schema extend the semantics of SPARQL Basic Graph Pattern matching to apply to entailments other than simple entailment .
The formal semantics of these SPARQL / Query extensions are not standardized , and query writers cannot currently be guaranteed interoperable behavior when working with multiple query engines that extend SPARQL with the same entailment regime .
5.2 Description
SPARQL / Query 1.0 defines a mechanism to adapt SPARQL to entailment regimes beyond simple entailment by providing necessary conditions on re-defining the meaning of SPARQL Basic Graph Pattern matching .
Time - permitting , the SPARQL WG will use the existing framework to define the semantics of SPARQL queries for one or more of these entailment frameworks :
OWL 2 with both Direct and RDF Based Semantics , including OWL 2 profiles
RDF Schema
Some dialects of RIF
5.5 Status
This feature is considered as time - permitting only by the WG .

Luis Illades , an owner of the Urban Rustic Market and Cafe on North 12th Street , said he had seen a steady number of applicants , in their late 20s , who had never held paid jobs :
They were interns at a modeling agency , for example , or worked at a college radio station .
In some cases , applicants have stormed out of the market after hearing the job requirements .
" They say , ‘ You want me to work eight hours ? ' " Mr. Illades said .
" There is a bubble bursting . "
The economic crisis and the subsequent scaling back of hipster financial lifelines has also had a detrimental effect on the real estate market in Williamsburg , long the province of people who work diligently to cultivate the look and smell of vagrants living in boxcars laced with excrement while residing in lavish loft apartments .
Ross Weinstein , a managing partner of the Union Square Mortgage Group , has worked with hundreds of Williamsburg apartment buyers in the past two years .
" A lot of the money came from family , " he said .
" That piece , it 's gone for a lot of people . "
In the boom years , Mr. Weinstein said , 40 percent of the mortgage applications he reviewed for buyers in Williamsburg included down - payment money , from $ 50,000 to $ 300,000 , from parents .
About 20 percent of the applications listed investments that gave the young buyers $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 of monthly income .
Mr. Weinstein has been advising two brothers in their late 20s who wanted to buy a $ 700,000 apartment with $ 250,000 from their parents .
But their parents ' investment portfolio has lost so much value that they now can give only $ 50,000 .
Since the brothers make about $ 45,000 a year each , they are now shopping for a $ 500,000 apartment .
For the love of God how will these hipster brothers ever get by in a crappy $ 500,000 apartment ?
We demand that King Obama bail out the hipsters !
How else will they have enough floor space for all their hipster bros from LA to crash when their band is in town to play a CMJ showcase at The Charleston ?
How else can they throw parties without a vacant , darkened room designated specifically for coke - snorting and sloppy blowjobs ?
You do n't really expect them to use their bedrooms for such things , do you ?
This is America , dammit !
If worse comes to worse , perhaps the hipster brothers can subsidize their income with Sesame Street location fees ?

Challenge
PCI - Media Impact , with Red Desarrollo Sostenible , is developing Honduras ' first environmentally - themed radio campaign , " Agua de Angel . "
Now , as political turmoil grips Honduras , the government radio that was broadcasting " Agua de Angel " is no longer doing so .
The show is off the air , and our team in Honduras does not have the means to pay a commercial broadcaster to air the remaining episodes .
Solution
The campaign includes a radio soap opera , interviews with community members , and a variety of educational events .
The production team needs additional funding to revive their environmental campaign and get back on the air .
Long - Term Impact
To reduce the prevalence of water - related diseases , which are the leading cause of death in children under the age of five .
Our campaign raises awareness about these issues and the need to protect local water sources from depletion and contamination .

There are 1,114 days to go now before London opens its doors to the Olympic Games .
For British athletics , that is three years and 18 days in which to find someone to play a starring role in the blue riband event of the track and field programme in 2012 : the men 's 100 m final .
Any kind of a role would represent progress .
In Athens in 2004 and in Beijing last summer there were no British speed merchants going for gold in the final – or for silver or bronze , for that matter .
You have to go back to the Sydney Games of 2000 to find the last British representation in a men's Olympic 100 m final .
A young whipper - snapper by the name of Dwain Chambers finished just outside the medals in fourth .
Darren Campbell was sixth .
Nine years on , Chambers is still the best in Britain – the favourite for the men's 100 m at the Aviva World Trials and UK Championships at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham this weekend .
In the race to become a home contender for 2012 , however , the Belgrave Harrier is strictly a non-runner .
Twelve months ago Chambers was victorious at the Olympic trials in Birmingham , clocking 10 seconds flat , but then failed to win his trial case in the High Court to overturn the British Olympic Association bye - law which precludes reinstated doping offenders from representing Team GB in the Olympics .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
All of which leaves another Londoner in pole position in the fast lane leading to 2012 .
Simeon Williamson is not exactly a familiar name to the wider Great British sporting public – thanks to the controversy that has continued to surround Chambers three years on from his reinstatement after serving his two - year drugs ban .
For the past two years , though , the 23 - year - old Enfield resident has been shaping up as the most likely lad to emerge from Chambers ' shadow as a British force with which to be reckoned on the world sprinting stage .
Winner of the European Under - 23 title in 2007 , the powerfully built Williamson looked on the cusp of a breakthrough last July when he pushed Chambers all the way to the line at the Olympic trials .
He finished 0.03sec behind in 10.03sec .
Only three British men have recorded faster legal times for the 100m : Linford Christie ( 9.87sec ) , Chambers ( 9.97 ) and Jason Gardener ( 9.98 ) .
Membership of the sub -10 second club and a place in the Beijing final appeared to be beckoning Williamson , but sadly it was not to be .
Hampered by an ankle problem in his final preparations for the Games , he failed to get beyond the quarter - finals – a huge disappointment for the hugely - talented Highgate Harrier , who trains with Christine Ohuruogu , the Olympic 400 m champion , under the guidance of former international sprint hurdler Lloyd Cowan at the Lee Valley Athletics Centre in north London .
Still , having spent two months working with former 100 m world record holder Asafa Powell in Jamaica last winter ( and having finished fourth behind the victorious Chambers in the 60 m final at the European Indoor Championships in Turin in March ) Williamson has his eyes on the 10 - seconds barrier again as he prepares for another crack at Chambers at the Birmingham trials for next month 's World Championships in Berlin .
" It was on the cards last year and with my performances this year it 's back on the cards again , " he said yesterday , on a visit to the Alexander Stadium .
" I would like to do it before the World Champs , just to get that feeling in my legs .
When you get to the World Championships then that 's what you 're going to have to do to make the final .
It 's going to have to come if I want to achieve what I want to achieve . "
If it happened to come in Birmingham this weekend it would be a momentous occasion .
No British sprinter has broken 10 seconds on British soil without illegal wind assistance .
In fact , no British sprinter has achieved the feat validly anywhere since Chambers clocked 9.99sec for fourth place in the World Championships final in Edmonton in August 2001 ( Chambers also broke 10 seconds in 2002 , but with steroid assistance ) .
" British sprinting did go on a downward spiral after the whole Dwain [ drugs ] incident but we are getting better now , " Williamson said .
" Everyone 's trying to make an impression now – just to get a name out there in the public and show the world that we are a force to be reckoned with before 2012 comes round . "
It would take a sub - 10 second time to do that , although with sub -9.8 second performers to contend with in Usain Bolt , Powell and Tyson Gay , and with another in Justin Gatlin getting ready to return from a drugs ban next summer ( without a further Olympic bar standing in the way of the American ) , there would still be considerable ground to make up in the medal contention stakes .
Williamson , though , does have a promising pedigree .
He happens to be a second cousin of Germaine Mason , the former Jamaica international high jumper who switched allegiance to Britain three years ago ( thanks to his London - born father ) and soared to silver medal - winning heights in Beijing .
It was because of Mason that Williamson spent last November and December training with Powell in Jamaica .
His cousin shares the same coach as Powell , Stephen Francis .
" It was n't part of a grand plan , to see how the Jamaican sprinters train , " Williamson said .
" It was just something that happened after Germaine said in casual conversation , ' How about you coming out to Jamaica to train ? '
I 've seen the benefits of going out there .
I trained in the morning and in the evening there and I 've done that since I 've come back .
It 's helped me a lot . "
It has probably also helped that Williamson has inherited the genes of his 79 - year - old grandmother .
Pearline Williamson hit the headlines 12 months ago when she chased and caught a twenty - something mugger on the streets of Edmonton , north London .
" I told her not to do that again because it 's dangerous , " her fleet - footed grandson said .
" I told her if someone snatches her purse again just to call the police . "

Being smart does n’t make you any more likely to be rich
If you ’re so smart , why are n’t you rich ?
Although money and mental muscles may seem a natural match , brains , alas , may be more hindrance than help when it comes to getting rich , concludes a new study in the journal Intelligence .
” It is still not well understood why some people are rich and others are poor , ” writes study author Jay Zagorsky of Ohio State University .
“ Luck , timing , parents , choice of spouse and many other factors play important roles in shaping an individual ’s circumstances , ” he acknowledges in his study , which looks for a link between intelligence scores , wages and wealth .
Past analyses have mostly just looked at income , with studies of World War II veterans finding a link between smarts and a better salary .
The controversial 1994 book , The Bell Curve , by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray , went further , arguing that few high - IQ types end up in poverty .
Within a few years , that conclusion was later found lacking by Cornell University economist John Cawley and others .
But what good is it to be smart and have a better salary if you end up broke or spending it all on credit card bills ?
asks Zagorsky .
Looking at the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979′s latest round of survey answers from more than 7,000 randomly - selected participants , he tries to tackle the question of whether better IQs lead to bulging bank accounts and less bankruptcy .
( Funded by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , the NLSY 1979 has questioned the same people 21 times from 1979 to 2004 , with participants now ranging in age from 33 to 41 and almost evenly split between men and women . )
The answer is no .
“ Being more intelligent does not confer any advantage along two of the three key dimensions of financial success ( income , net worth and financial distress ) , ” Zagorsky finds , looking at the data with statistical tests .
Income does weakly correspond to intelligence test scores , he finds , where “ a one point increase in IQ test scores is related to an income increase of $ 346 per year .
But at most , that same one - point increase in IQ leads to “ a net worth increase of at most $ 83 , but probably zero . ”
And when it comes to financial distress , smarts are no help at all .
People with 140 IQ scores ( a score of 100 is average ) missed payments and maxed - out their credit cards more often than their lower IQ counterparts .
They went bankrupt at a rate , 14.1 % , close to the rate of people with an IQ of 80 , 15.2 % .
“ Only among people slightly above - average does an increasing IQ score lead to a reduced chance of financial distress , ” says the study .
“ The survey provides no data to explain why this occurs , ” but Zagorsky offers these explanations for High IQ types getting into financial hot water :
— They might be busier and less focused on routines like paying bills .
— They might lead a lifestyle that is closer to the financial precipice because they feel they are smart enough to get away with the risks of credit card spending and saving less .
— They may have a better memory and are more likely to remember financial mistakes on their surveys .
So much for smarts .
On the plus side , Zagorsky ’s study does offer some comfort for those of us less IQ - endowed folks .
“ Since intelligence is not a factor for explaining wealth , ” he writes , “ individuals with low intelligence should not believe they are handicapped in achieving financial success , nor should high intelligence people believe they have an advantage . ”

There is a man with a gun near an Obama rally .
Here is the video .
This is insane !
Did you see his sign ?
" It Is Time to Water the Tree of Liberty . "
That is from this Jefferson quote :
And what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned from time to time , that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ?
Let them take arms .
The remedy is to set them right as to the facts , pardon and pacify them .
What signify a few lives lost in a century or two ?
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
It is its natural manure .
This is the same exact quote Tim McVeigh was referencing in a shirt he wore ... before bombing the Oklahoma City federal building .
Now , imagine if there was left - winger with a gun waiting for Bush holding a sign that the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood tyrants ?
How long would that guy have lasted ?
You think they'd let him just sit there and wait for Bush ?
And say , " Hey , it 's perfectly legal ! "
Is anyone stupid or disingenuous enough to believe that ?
They would have taken his ass down in a flat second .
They would have infiltrated whatever group he belonged to and monitored his ass for the rest of time .
Now imagine he was Muslim and waiting for Bush with a gun .
What do you think would have happened then ?
Watch Young Turks Here
PS --
One more thought .
What happens the next time two of these guys show up at an Obama rally ?
How about ten of them ?
Twenty ?

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Nearly a year after surviving a plane crash in South Carolina , disc jockey Adam " DJ AM " Goldstein was found dead in his New York apartment Friday afternoon , his publicist said .
He was 36 .
Adam " DJ AM " Goldstein was one of two people who survived a 2008 plane crash in South Carolina .
" The circumstances surrounding his death are unclear , " his publicist , Jenni Weinman , said in a statement confirming the performer 's death .
" Out of respect for his family and loved ones , please respect their privacy at this time . "
Goldstein was found unconscious and unresponsive in his lower Manhattan apartment Friday afternoon , New York police said .
The cause of death would be determined by medical examiners , but " there is no criminality suspected at this time , " a police statement reported .
Goldstein and Travis Barker , the drummer for rock band Blink - 182 , were the only survivors of a September plane crash in South Carolina that left both critically injured .
Four others aboard the plane were killed when the Learjet skidded off a runway during takeoff from Columbia .

" Daily I live with the guilt and grief of what happened that night , what I saw , who was lost and why I was spared , " he wrote in a December post on his Web site .
" I have no words to express the pain that comes with knowing four people died , while I lived . "
In addition to spinning beats at clubs and festivals , Goldstein was known for dating reality - TV star Nicole Richie and singer - actress Mandy Moore .
" I am absolutely heartbroken , " Moore said in a statement .
" For those of us lucky enough to have known him , Adam radiated a contagious exuberance for life and also personified the very definition of a true friend .
To say that he will be missed beyond words is an understatement .
My heart goes out to his loved ones . "

At the time of his death , he had been working on an MTV show about drug addiction that had been scheduled to debut in October .
Goldstein himself had been a crack cocaine addict who said he wanted the show to help others recover .

To conserve power and reduce your electrical bill , you should shut down your computer or put it to sleep when not in use .
But that ’s easier said than done if your Mac acts as a server for files , photos , music , or other resources .
Snow Leopard offers at least one solution to this problem : Wake on Demand .
This is Apple ’s name for a new networking feature that lets a Snow Leopard Mac go to sleep while a networked base station continues to broadcast Bonjour messages about the services the sleeping computer offers .
The base station essentially acts as a proxy for the slumbering Mac. Advertised Bonjour services includes file sharing , screen sharing , iTunes library sharing , and printer sharing among others .
When another computer on the network wants to use one of those Bonjour services , the base station sends a special signal over Ethernet or Wi-Fi to wake the computer in question , which then rouses itself and responds .
Snow Leopard ’s improved speed in waking from sleep helps .
To other computers , the sleeping Mac ’s shared services appear as regular Bonjour entries requiring no additional software .
A Panther , Tiger , or Leopard system or Windows system with Bonjour installed can wake a Snow Leopard Mac .
An awakened Mac goes back to sleep according to Energy Saver settings when it returns to an idle status .
What you ’ll need
Wake on Demand is a useful feature for Mac users who share resources between multiple machines , but it comes with some notable provisos .
The first is the type of equipment you ’ll need .
Apple says you must have an AirPort Extreme Base Station ( 2007 or more recent model ) or Time Capsule ( 2008 or more recent model ) with the current 7.4.2 firmware installed .
Support for Wi -Fi comes with additional limitations .
For starters , it appears only a relatively new Mac can be woken via a Wi -Fi connection .
Older Mac models can be woken only when connected to the base station via Ethernet .
( At this writing , Apple has n’t released a list of models that work over Wi -Fi , but , in testing with colleagues , I found only 2009 models offered the option .
After this article was originally published , a reader tested his 2008 MacBook Pro [ 2.6 GHz Core 2 Duo ] , and found it capable as well .
You can report other pre-2009 models in the comments . )
You can check whether your system supports Wake on Demand via Wi-Fi by opening System Profiler ( go to Apple menu -> About This Mac , and click on More Info ) .
In the Contents list at left , select AirPort ( in the Network section ) .
In the area under Interfaces , look for the text “ Wake on Wireless : Supported . ”
If it ’s not there , the option is n’t available on that Mac .
There ’s a further limitation with Wi -Fi : if you ’ve enabled WPA or WPA2 encryption on the base station to which your Mac is associated , that base station must act as the main base station on the network ; it ca n’t be configured as a bridge , Apple says .
If you ’re not sure whether your base station is bridging network traffic , go to Applications -> Utilities ->
AirPort Utility , connect to your base station , click on Manual Setup , and choose the Internet icon .
If Connection Sharing is set to Off ( Bridge Mode ) , then wake over wireless wo n’t work .
( The most likely reason you ’d have your base station acting only as a bridge is if your broadband modem is already providing network addresses via DHCP . )
Getting started
You enable Wake on Demand in the Energy Saver preference pane .
On desktop machines , Snow Leopard shows a single pane ; on laptops , the option is available in the Power Adapter tab .
Laptops ca n’t use this feature when powered by a battery .
Additionally , laptops must either be open ( not latched ) or have an external display attached to be woken through this method .
For computers that can connect over either Wi-Fi or Ethernet , the checkbox is labeled Wake For Network Access .
In my tests , this option was turned on by default in updated and new Snow Leopard Macs .
Apple notes in a support document that some machines may have this option turned off after upgrading to Snow Leopard , in which case you ’ll need to turn it yourself .
In the case in which a computer has only the Ethernet option , the label reads Wake For Ethernet Network Access , but the option functions the same way ; and if you have a MacBook Air , the option reads Wake for AirPort Network Access .
Apple warns in its support note that your apparently somnolent computer may wake for just a moment to check in with the base station that ’s proxying Bonjour without activating its display , and then quickly go back to sleep .
You can disable Wake on Demand by unchecking the box .
With the option turned off , your sleeping Mac will have its beauty sleep undisturbed and your base station wo n’t advertise the Mac ’s Bonjour services .
How it works
In Leopard and earlier releases of Mac OS X , Apple offered a similarly labeled wake - on - Ethernet option that relied on the Magic Packet , a specially formulated data transmission that Ethernet adapters can be set to listen for in order to wake a computer in a standby mode .
The Magic Packet option is a common feature in Ethernet cards and operating systems .
The flaw with the Magic Packet approach is that you had to use a special piece of software to wake a computer over Ethernet , and it did n’t work over Wi-Fi .
By switching to a Bonjour - triggered , base station - hosted method — which Apple calls Bonjour Sleep Proxy — Apple gives the feature broader reach .
( Earlier this year , Macworld editor Dan Frakes reviewed a free program , WakeOnLan ( ) , that handles the network voodoo for Magic Packets .
In addition to Apple ’s new Wake on Demand option , I ’ve confirmed that WakeOnLan still works with Snow Leopard systems connected over Ethernet . )
The technology behind waking a computer over Wi-Fi is more complicated .
Wi - Fi radios typically shut down when a computer is n’t active ; however , some Wi-Fi-enabled devices employ a standby scanning mode that wakes a radio for extremely brief periods of time to scan for incoming traffic .
This mode typically takes advantage of WMM Power Save , a standard designed to reduce power usage by Wi-fi-capable cellular handsets and portable devices while they ’re not transmitting .
It ’s possible that Apple using technology similar to WMM Power Save to give a Mac ’s Wi-Fi adapter just enough power to monitor for the right kind of alert , and wake the system .
( After this article was originally published , Apple said via e-mail that it is not using WMM Power Save , but provided no additional details . )
If Apple has taken an open approach to waking a Mac over Wi -Fi — that includes the use of Bonjour which Apple invented but does n’t restrict the use of — it ’s good news for Mac users .
In the coming weeks we may see programs developed that allow other software , servers , or routers to wake the slumbering Snow Leopard .

WASHINGTON —
In an apparent sign of reconciliation with his predecessor , President Obama said today he will be sending former president George W. Bush on peace missions to some of the most dangerous parts of the world .
“ These are places where terrorists are set upon killing anyone with an American passport , ” said Obama .
“ They are ruthless butchers who torture and behead indiscriminately .
Roadside bombings are everyday occurrences .
I feel these are the perfect situations in which to send President Bush , with one hand extending an olive branch and the other waving the Red , White and Blue . ”
The itinerary for the former president includes diverse areas such as Darfur , Gaza , Bogota , Congo and other world hot spots taken straight from the U.S. State Department ’s “ Current Travel Warnings ” page .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Bush would maintain high visibility in these regions to demonstrate the willingness of the United States to target international conflict , head - on .
“ President Bush will face our enemies front and center , ” she said , “ confronting these perilous situations directly and openly . ”
Clinton called it a “ perfectly - suited challenge for someone of Bush ’s intellect and esteem , ” saying it would be “ an opportunity to give back to the former president what he ’s given to the American people over the past eight years . ”
The proposed mission has received overwhelming bi-partisan support from Congress .
Sources close to Bush said that while he is honored to be called upon for service by the Obama administration , he feels the undertaking is much more suited for someone with Dick Cheney ’s background and temperament , and will be recommending the former Vice President for the job .

It ’s hard to overstate the threat posed by global overpopulation .
Many of the most serious problems facing the world and region can be traced to it , from global warming to famine to traffic jams on the 405 .
Yet one of the most effective programs for combating it is under siege by the Bush administration .
In a triumph of ideological obsession over rationality , antiabortion advocates , who often oppose any form of family planning , are zeroing in on the United Nations Population Fund .
The fund does not support or promote abortions , though its foes desperately try to link it to them .
The Bush administration cut off all U.S. contributions ( which added up to $ 34 million the previous year ) to the fund in 2002 and , a year later , defunded Marie Stopes International , a British charity focusing on AIDS programs , because it cooperated with the program .
Earlier this month , for the first time in 30 years , the U.S. government failed to participate in the Global Health Conference because it included speakers from the fund .

Now the administration is engaging in a new round of election - year pandering by threatening to terminate financing for UNICEF and the World Health Organization unless they stop cooperating with the fund .
The administration suspended financial support for the program under the provisions of the 1984 Kemp - Kasten bill , which authorizes withholding of funds if an agency “ supports or participates ” in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization .
In President Bush ’s contorted logic , a few computers and automobiles provided to the Chinese government by the U.N. agency constituted support for the country ’s coercive abortion programs .
Bush ignored the fact that , according to a State Department investigative team ’s 2002 report on the U.N. agency and China , “ no evidence ” links the U.N. program to any coercive programs .
Similarly , a British investigative team concluded that it was “ a force for good ” in China .
Though the Chinese government ’s “ one child ” policies are reprehensible , the U.N. program has actually served to dramatically reduce female sterilization , abortion and infant mortality rates there .
Further , although family planning opponents have used the program ’s activities in China as an excuse to cut off funding , the population fund has had similar success in 140 other countries where it distributes contraceptives and educational materials on HIV .

As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell observed in 2001 , the fund is performing a valuable service .
The Bush administration is not only giving the United States a fresh international black eye by attacking the U.N. and other programs that work with the population fund , it is , perversely , encouraging the spread of squalor , misery and death in the Third World .
Barclays is to pay tens of millions of pounds to its investment bankers , who have made huge profits from trading in government debt , derivatives and foreign exchange .
Some of the biggest payouts are expected to go to former Lehman Brothers traders hired by the British bank after it took over Lehman 's US operations at a knockdown price in September .
Some Lehman staff were granted guaranteed bonuses to ensure they stayed with Barclays rather than jump ship and sign up with rivals .
The bonuses are expected to cause outrage among Barclays UK employees , who are being balloted by the Unite trade union on strike action over the scrapping of the firm 's final - salary pension scheme .
Barclays has cut hundreds of jobs since the financial crisis erupted in 2007 .
Protests are also expected from Lehman creditors , who are fighting in the courts on both sides of the Atlantic for money that was owed by the US bank before it went bust .
Barclays stepped in to buy Lehman 's American business for $ 250 m ( £ 153 m ) , while its European arm was sold to Nomura .
The Barclays deal was viewed as a coup for the UK clearing bank which is led by chairman Marcus Agius and chief executive John Varley .
The Lehman acquisition has allowed the British institution to become a major player in investment banking , competing for mandates along with giants of the industry such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan .
Analysts say that Barclays Capital , the bank 's investment arm , has become so profitable that it could account for the lion 's share of the £ 3bn of interim profit that the institution is expected to report in the first week of August .
BarCap 's income is expected to more than make up for write - offs that Barclays is forecast to make against its domestic and commercial lending books .
Brokers say that BarCap 's contribution to 2009 pre-tax profit should rise from 30 % of the total in 2008 to more than two - thirds .
Goldman and Morgan reported a surge in second - quarter profit last week , setting the stage for lavish bonuses at the end of the year .
The return of bonuses - Goldman 's remuneration bill will top $ 20 bn - has caused a political outcry , as big payouts were deemed to have helped cause the credit crunch by encouraging excessive risk - taking and irresponsible lending .
Last week , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said that it " should n't be back to business as usual " for financial institutions .
But investment banks have been able to take advantage of the explosion of activity in the bond markets , where governments are raising billions to cover increased expenditure .
The banks left standing after the financial turmoil are also benefiting from a reduction of competition following the collapse of firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman last year .
Other profitable areas of activity are hedging deals , where financial institutions seek to profit by predicting the future price of currencies , equities or commodities such as oil .
Barclays has pleased investors by avoiding the need for a government bailout , unlike RBS and Lloyds .
But it has been criticised on various fronts : shareholder activists have questioned the huge payouts to staff at its fund management arm , BGI , following the sale of the business to BlackRock for $ 13.5 bn .
Bob Diamond , BarCap chief and chairman of BGI , is in line for a payout of £ 22 m from the sale , while the arm 's chief executive , Blake Grossman , will collect about £ 55 m .
The ballot over strike action at Barclays will be held this summer .
The scrapping of the final salary pension scheme - even for existing members - has been labelled " a betrayal " by Unite .
Leading The Design of APB
By Christian Nutt
Lead designer EJ Moreland comes to Scottish developer Realtime Worlds with a background in MMOs , having worked on titles such as Ultima Online and EverQuest II .
But that background is n't the whole story .
The concept behind much - anticipated PC ( and later , Xbox 360 ) online game All Points Bulletin ( APB ) is more accretive in nature , taking in action games , console and PC innovations , and coming up with its own solutions to gameplay questions .
Here , he talks about the process , the dangers and opportunites in creating an contemporary urban online game outside the typical MMO territory , and working with Dave Jones , the Grand Theft Auto creator who has talked passionately to Gamasutra about the opportunities online gaming offers on multiple occasions .
The interview , conducted at this month 's E3 Expo in Los Angeles , is essential reading for those who would consider breaking the rather staid boundaries of the MMO genre , and also provides a window into the design process for developers who have spent their time working on very disparate genres until this point -- and now are trying to marry them .
One of the most elaborate elements of APB , highlighted extensively in the game 's behind - closed - doors E3 presentation , is its customization options .
Amateur designers will be able to use a complex set of tools to customize clothes , cars , tattoos , and logo designs -- and then , in view of the game designers , be able to trade or sell those designs to the wider player audience .
It 's the urban virtual Etsy , in other words , and has the potential to open up the game to entirely different audiences than the shooter - loving online gamers who you 'd expect to pick it up .
You talked about supporting the APB marketplace with design -- enabling people to design clothing , cars , and stuff like that -- and we 've seen that kind of thing in games like Forza Motorsport .
Attracting and maintaining the sort of audience who wants that experience is an entirely different proposition than it is for the people who just want to shoot each other .
EJ : It 's a bit schizophrenic .
We have a different , diverse skill set on our design team .
We have people that come from an online background , such as myself ; we have people that come from a very heavy action game background , and we actually have a component of the team that we call our " creative team " , that comes from that more social background .
That comes from being able to ... take their inspiration from a wide variety of applications out there .
Things like IMVU , and other types of really social apps .
And they 're the people that are driving how that 's going to work , along with our business team .
So we actually work with the guys that handle the business side and look for ways to really try to pull to those goals of being able to support the creator , versus the game .
From that perspective , it 's also going to require not just having robust and intelligently designed systems , but also the people who would be attracted to them may not be paying attention to APB .
EJ : For us , APB 's release is the beginning , not the end .
We needed something to really crystallize the base concept , and Dave 's always been a fan of contemporary action .
I mean , obviously , as the creator of GTA , this is kind of a natural step for him .
So it started out being , " OK , let 's make this really believable city with a cool action game . "
As we layered the customization , as more and more people got involved , we took a look at it and realized , " Hey , wait a minute ...
This is a whole separate product in and of itself . "
But we really do n't want to dedicate the resources to completely flesh it out both ways , to start with .
So what we 've done is we 've said , " We want to use this to support this great action game -- this really different online type of game -- and then , once the game releases , based on what the players ' feedback is , we 're going to go in every direction we can . "
We 're looking at much more horizontal expansion than reproducing the same content .
So APB is the action district ; the conflict of the city is one part that we 'll continue to support after release .
But we 're looking at things like racing districts , fashion shows , private housing -- you know , everything in between .
It 's just which way the player base wants us to take it , and which bases we want to attract after that .
So we realize that the game has -- it 's not what I would call a " narrow " focus , but it has a very narrow initial potential .
But we want to make sure people understand that there 's much more to it .
We really expect there to be a pretty good portion of our base , even from the initial part , that are just early adopters of just that expression , and customization , and that social aspect .
How do you ensure that you survive that long ?
Because when you look at it that way , MMOs launch ...
I mean , you guys have ambition , and I think , from what I 've seen , you have a really promising game .
I 'm not criticizing the game , but promising games have come and gone .
EJ : Promising games come and go , and I 've actually been involved with the release of three initial MMOs , as well as expansions .
I 've worked on Ultima Online ; I 've worked on EverQuest II ; I 've worked on Star Wars Galaxies ; I 've worked on several MMOs that did n't make it to the light of day .
So , you know , we certainly have a broad experience , and we understand that .
To us , it 's all about initial execution .
It 's why we 're not throwing a bunch of extra features into the game .
We want it to come out , really fulfill its purpose -- really feel like value for its money -- and for people to be really satisfied with it .
We know if we do that , we 'll have all of the opportunity in the world to expand it past that .
So it 's really kind of this trade - off , and it 's really difficult for us , because we 're so excited about all the aspects , but we have to focus in on just an initial set of aspects .
I think a lot of games are -- I do n't want to say " guilty of it " , but they 're not so good at picking what their limitations are .
I think people get inspired and just go crazy ...
EJ : I 've certainly been guilty of doing that exact thing , in a variety of situations .
It 's something that , I think , as a developer , you learn more from your mistakes than you do successes .
So , as the lead designer , and as someone who 's at the top of helping to shape the product , it 's very important to me that we definitely explore those things , and look for the ones that are important enough to include .
But at the end of the day , we need to bring that down to a very focused , very specific set of executed features .
The customization system is something we have to execute on well ; the action game has to be done well .
I mean , everyone thinks that you can release these types of online games , and , " Oh , it can be okay , because it 's online , it 's multiplayer , so it does n't have to be as good as a single player experience . "
And we realize that there are trade - offs , but we want it to be the best it can be , and so it 's all about execution at this point , for us .
It 's why we just now started to talk about the game .
We do n't want to put it out there and let people see it until we feel like it 's ready to be there .
There 's also been a belief where people seem to think that they can release an online game and it can be shaky at first , then improve -- and that idea is over , I think .
EJ : Yes .
It 's absolutely over .
My observation from releasing games is : what you release on day one sets your curve .
Sets your curve , so that no matter what you do , no matter how much money you throw at it , you never really break out of that curve .
So it 's very , very important for us to get that right .
We do n't have the belief that we can ship something incomplete and get it out there .
Now , the reality of the situation is , you know : there 's always the variables that occur as you get the game to ship -- there may be areas that we could do better at .
But the fact of the matter is , we 're very , very focused on the fact that the game has to be executed well .
It has to be stable , it has to be enjoyable , and it has to be worth the money , day one .
Period .
End of story .
You 're talking about " curve " , and I find that an interesting concept .
Because if you look at some games , they start at maybe 800,000 , and then they shrink down to 300,000 , right ?
But then you look at EVE Online , and it started really small , and grown to 300,000 .
And that 's a big victory .
EJ : Absolutely .
How do you look at those sorts of issues ?
EJ : So , EVE
Online is a great game , because what they did is they came out , they did n't have a lot of press , and they had a really dedicated fan base .
So they used that dedicated fan base to get away with what you can't necessarily get away with in a game that 's heavily publicized .
They stayed quiet ; they stayed under the radar ; they built the core features , they built the core player base , and then they just started attracting more and more players .
It 's a growth curve .
That 's not the average curve .
Most games -- that are fairly mainstream , that have a lot of money behind them -- tend to have to make a big splash .
And then they release , and the curve starts high , but it immediately starts to decline .
I 've seen that multiple times -- have actually been a key factor into why it occurred , so I have sins to pay for it in the past .
It 's a tough issue .
One thing that 's interesting is the genre , right ?
Obviously , the high fantasy MMO thing is kind - of ... " tapped out " is not the right word , but there 's super - stiff competition , let 's put it like that .
EJ : Honestly , there 's the 800 - pound gorilla .
I mean , fantasy RPGs have to contend with WoW .
It 's great , well executed , polished ; it has great pedigree now .
And I still play it .
It 's still something that I enjoy in my time .
I'm a fantasy RPG guy from way back , and the reason I got into the industry was Ultima .
That 's why I ended up at Origin in the first place .
So it 's definitely a market that I think still has potential , and I think that there are lots of games that can go in there and make a splash .
But they can't do it by doing the same things as everyone else .
We certainly flirted with the idea of taking this type of franchise and creating a fantasy game , but if we do it , it 's not going to be another MMORPG that has the same mechanics .
We 're going to find a way to make it distinct , just like we have here .
I think that branching out of that genre is sort of uncharted territory in terms of massive games , right ?
I see that you 've done things with the design that are definitely completely removed .
Look at City of Heroes , right ?
It 's a great game , and it has obviously managed to find a really consistent audience , but in the end it's not that much different than skinning another MMO , right ?
EJ : Right .
It was very important for us to not to just skin the game .
We definitely flirted with different ideas on how we wanted to approach it .
But it always came back to the same thing .
We looked at the tags that we place on these things -- we call them MMOs , we call them RPGs -- some games want to make their own acronyms .
To us , we do n't care .
It 's not about how we classify it , it 's about what the game does .
So for us , all we always say is : it 's an online action game that has persistence .
That 's the important part for us .
So , we do n't try to look and see what else is out there , and go , " Well , we should have this feature , or this type of play , because that 's what everyone else is playing ... "
That 's why we do n't have levels ; that 's why we do n't have arbitrary statistics .
We want to try to see what players [ do ] -- what 's important to us is what what we measure from players .
Their artistic ability , their action game skill , and eventually the other types of game types that we introduce with this .
How do you maintain player interest without the carrot - on - the - stick of levels and similar systems ?
I mean , they maintain them in many games because they are a proven treadmill .
EJ : They 're absolutely great .
The whole DIKU - style of RPGs is genius in what it does , but there 's only a certain group of people that really enjoy it .
Now , that 's not to say that they 're [ just the ] 10 million people playing WoW , but it 's finding what works for your game ; finding out how your game works .
For us , we do have functional progression ; we do have cosmetic progression ; we do have things for players to achieve .
It 's always about putting things out there , that work for your game , that players want to continue to achieve .
Some games , like Counter - Strike , have no progression , but they still have achievement .
You know , people created leagues , they created leader boards -- it really goes to what your game is .
Our game is an action game .
For us , most of it's going to be about players comparing each other , and seeing how we can weave achievement into that .
So , as you achieve , you get things that make you more famous .
Again , the game is really about that celebrity .
But there is also , like I said , functional progression .
You do n't get everything up front , you have to earn the types of cars , the weapons ; all that stuff is progression in the game .
This game has a very sophisticated design , from everything I 've seen .
How do you arrive at these designs that have not been seen before in this type of combination , and how do you know it 's going to work ?
EJ : We do n't .
Right .
EJ : That 's part of it .
I mean , I have to say that the person who should get credit for really pushing those boundaries is Dave Jones .
I mean , he 's never been someone who adheres to what 's already out there .
He wanted to make a game , he had vision for it , and he brought people in like me , to go , " Okay , this is the broad vision -- how do we make it practical ? "
And we went through lots of trial and error .
I mean , honestly , we 've gone through the whole gamut of functional progression .
We 've looked at how the action game could work on that many multiplayer .
We 've just continued to iterate and arrive at what we thought was the best way to do it .
And we 're continuing to learn .
Honestly , when we get it out there in beta , we 're going to see what works and what does n't ; what we can change , we 're going to change .
In terms of hard design doc versus prototyping , what kind of balance did you have ?
EJ : I arrived in 2007 , and the game had been going since about 2005 , so they had some definite design ideas and some documentation there .
And what we did was we took a look at that , took a look at where the game was , and started trying to play the game .
And as we learned what we could n't play and what we could play , we started adjusting the design .
Since then , we 've continued to create documentation , and continued to maintain it , but it really is about : we apply something in the game , we see it , we feel it , we touch it , we see how it works , and then we can go , " Okay .
This works .
This does n't . "
Dave 's heavily involved in that .
The whole development team is heavily involved in that .
RTW has the tag on it of being a design - driven company ; what that means , necessarily , is n't that the design team drives the company , it 's that everyone is involved in the design .
It 's my job to maintain and shepherd that .
But , you know , we take the advice and consultation of everyone else involved -- whether it be an artist or a programmer , or an audio guy , or a community person .
All of those people have valid concerns .
We try to address that .
And it 's certainly a unique development environment .
I 've worked at seven other companies , and this is the most unique environment I 've worked in .
Another thing that 's been a concern , I think -- we were talking about how launches can't be like they used to be , and I think betas have shifted , too .
They 've become way more of a marketing tool than they were , and I think that the audience , back in the day , had this understanding that the game was going to be broken in beta , and now the audiences do n't have that .
EJ : When you get feedback in beta , the whole point of the beta is to take that feedback to heart , even if that means making some sacrifices , and looking at your release timings ...
You have to push back and say , " Hey , if these people say it 's not ready , it 's not ready .
We have to fix it . "
So we 're already in what we call our F&F [ friends and family ] phase , where we do have some public involved , but it 's very small and private -- it 's mostly friends of the company , or people that we trust implicitly with the game .
And we 're taking their feedback as well .
We have forums set up , and we have community guys already working on that .
So , to us , beta is where we discover what we did right and what we did wrong , not what we thought out .
Closed beta .
Open beta , we understand is pretty much a marketing exercise .
It 's a stress test and a marketing exercise .
But the early parts of closed beta , we 're going to continue to find people we can trust to look at the game objectively , rather than just expect it to be ready to play .
That 's a good point , about closed versus open , because ultimately you do have to test these ideas .
There 's no real way to do it without having a beta .
EJ : No .
With big online games , you can't have the development team play it and expect to have everything right .
What we use the development team for is a real good litmus test : a lot of the guys are very specific play types .
We do n't have a lot of MMO players on the development team ; in fact most of the ones [ who do ] are people who come from MMO backgrounds , and a few other guys .
So we rely on those guys to tell us what 's wrong with the kind - of persistence and progression -- what feels right from that point of view .
But a lot of our people play action games ; they play console games ; they play very mainstream stuff .
So we use them as a good test for what the usability is like ; what the user experience is like .
We use that as our initial test , and we make our assumptions off that , but as we get it out there , and as beta players start to play , we 're going to listen to what they have to say .
I mean , Dave is committed to this really being a player - driven game through and through .
Not just player - driven in the mechanics that players actually use to play the game , but player - driven in how we take the game from post - release as well as in beta .
The crime theme is a really great target .
It 's really compelling in a lot of media -- there have been some really successful games that , obviously , Dave 's been involved with .
However , this is n't a traditional MMO .
That audience and the people who are familiar and plugged - in to PC gaming may not be as familiar nor as plugged in to this genre .
What do you think ?
EJ : I think what we 're looking at is , we 're looking at establishing this genre for ourselves , and it is this online genre that shares similarities with other ones , but it is different .
We are looking for an audience that enjoys the game .
That may be console guys who do play GTA ; that may be guys who play WoW ; that may be guys who play My Little Pony Online .
The honest truth is : we have some pretty clear business targets about what we want to reach , but the audience is still kind - of an unknown country .
And we think we have a compelling game -- the reaction we get is compelling .
So we believe that we 're going to be able to attract a real core audience that 's going to enjoy it , but we also , certainly , recognize that this is different .
I mean , one of the things that concerns us the most is , between now and release , the message we give about what the game is has to really educate people on what the game is , because it 's different .
I mean , it is truly different .
And I 'm not just saying that to put the cliché out there ; as someone who has worked on a variety of these types of games , it was definitely hard wrapping my head around it .
It 's been one of the best challenges I 've ever had .
So I hope it works out .
One thing that could be a concern is system requirements , on a game like this .
Because I think it could draw a totally different audience , and those are not necessarily the people who are buying giant six thousand dollar PCs .
But it looks really , really good ...!
EJ : Right .
So the good news is , it is -- at our core , we are an Unreal 3 game .
So we have the same system specs as most Unreal games .
But we spent a lot of time reengineering it ourselves , not because we were dissatisfied , but because we were doing some crazy stuff with the streaming and the customization .
The truth of the matter is , we 've spent a lot of time personalizing .
That 's what it 's there for .
I mean , you take an engine off the shelf , you do n't expect it to work right off the bat .
And the games that do do that are pretty mediocre , to be honest .
So we spent a lot of time making our own , and making sure it works for us .
And part of that is optimization .
I mean , it 's definitely going to have bigger system requirements than you typical turn - based fantasy MMO ; we understand that -- and [ it 's ] because of the customization .
But they 're not unreasonable system requirements , in my opinion .
You do n't have to have a brand new machine that has an I7 and dual - core video card .
I mean , I 've seen it run on a GT 7800 Nvidia card ; I 've seen it run on really low spec dual - cores , and and high - spec old P4s .
I guess that 's an engineering question , too , in terms of how the game deals with those system requirements .
Some games just choke on low systems ; some games scale more intelligently .
EJ : So , we certainly are still working on it .
It does choke at times , but that 's just part of the ongoing development .
What we 've actually done is , we 've reduced the fidelity of the look as we good .
Actually , I would say we do n't do standard LOD stuff , we do some pretty clever stuff .
We care about what 's relevant to you rather than what 's nearby you .
So people in your group and people you 're opposed to , we try to keep that detail much higher , even if there are many more people in there .
The matchmaking tech in the game is really interesting to me .
You talked about the hierarchy of the way you find groups to fight with each other and put them together , and that it 's asymmetric , in terms of one really skilled person could be taking out a group of four .
How do you make that work ?
EJ : Well , so , I mean , that 's part of the magic , to be honest .
We 've spent a lot of time on the logic behind that .
We 've got a dedicated gameplay tech team that pretty much focuses on our mission system and our matchmaking , and we have a gameplay design team that basically is joined at the hip with them .
Their whole major charge is making this work .
And a lot of it is just really simple math .
One of the things that we looked at was : you look at how you categorize -- how you get a metric off someone -- and the first thing you think of is , " Oh , well , it 's the equipment that they have , and it 's this , and that ... "
But you know , honestly ?
It 's the last 30 or so missions , and success .
That window , and that metric has been the most accurate thing , and the most predictable thing we 've had .
So , it 's based all around that ..
How about ping and latency issues with such complex multiplayer action ?
The one little secret we have is , we have a pixel - precision shooter , and we 're latency - tolerant .
Now I 'm not going to talk about how we got that , but it 's pretty unique , and we 're pretty proud of it .
So , even ping is n't that big a deal -- for the combat .
For driving , it tends to be a little tougher , since the driving is truly digital , rather than analogue .
Playing driving games on a console , you 've got the thumb sticks , but with the WASD , you hit A and you turn left .
So the driving is not quite so latency tolerant , but the combat is extremely latency - tolerant .
We 've had people who 've played in Korea and been competitive in combat .
So it is absolutely tolerant ... up to a degree .
Now , obviously , after a certain point -- you know , 340 milliseconds , it starts to degrade pretty drastically , but under that , it 's pretty competitive and equal for everyone , whether you have an 80 millisecond ping , a 50 millisecond ping , or a 140 millisecond ping .
Same thing with framerate .
We tend to framerate lock ; we tend to be able to make sure that your technical requirements do n't invade in that too much either .

Yesterday MSNBC 's Contessa Brewer tackled the rantings of Pastor Steven Anderson down at his strip - mall church in Tempe , Arizona , and examined the common - sense connection between this kind of hate - filled rhetoric and the people bringing guns to events featuring President Obama , as well as the various acts of domestic terrorism and right - wing violence that have accompanied the rise in this kind of talk .
The segment featured Evan Kohlmann , an NBC terrorism analyst , who remarked :
Kohlmann : Yeah , it 's amazing that this kind of rhetoric is allowed if you 're a certain kind of person , if you 're a patriotic American you can say whatever you want , no matter how far along the line it comes to inciting people to violence towards other innocent people .
It 's completely unjustified .
But but but but ... does n't Kohlmann know there is no connection whatsoever between the people who fill crazy people 's heads with crazy , provably false ideas and the violent and insane actions that follow ?
That 's what you always hear from the right - wing pundits at Fox , at least .
Which is why you 'll never see this subject discussed at Fox -- except , perhaps , in dismissive tones designed to make excuses whenever the violence does inevitably erupt .
We showed you the interior details two days ago , and those headers of fire a while back , but thanks to an as - yet - unnamed magazine , we 've got what 's supposedly the first look at the upcoming 571 HP V8 - powered Mercedes SLS Gullwing .

The Arms Trade
Yesterday iconoclastic commentator on technology , politics and culture , Stilgherrian , shared an interesting discovery on twitter .
He had come across the website of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) and their Arms Transfer Database .
SIPRI has been monitoring international arms trades since 1968 and in the process have assembled an extraordinary database with details of all international transfers of major conventional weapons since 1950 .
Since March 2007 this database has been available online .
The business of international arms trading is certainly not within my area of expertise , but a rich data - set like this presents a perfect opportunity for a type of data visualization that has not yet appear on the blog : maps .
The SIPRI database provides “ Trend Indicator Value ( TIV ) ” tables which aggregate trade values between countries .
Values are inflation - adjusted , expressed in 1990 US dollars .
Starting with Australia , the data shows that the total value of arms imported by Australia from 1980 onwards exceed exports by a factor of almost 30 times .
Imports are largely sourced from North America and Europe , while exports are spread more broadly and include a range of Asian and Pacific countries .

Needless to say , the distribution of arms transfers in and out of the USA looks very different .
Over the last 30 years , the USA has exported arms to well over 100 countries across every continent other than Antarctica .

Another big exporter of arms to a wide range of countries is the United Kingdom .

Russia offers a rather different distribution of arms transfers .
Russia has exported arms to almost 100 counties , most notably China , but since 1980 has only imported from Germany , Poland and the Ukraine .

I will not offer any further comment on this data , but will leave the maps to speak for themselves .
If you would like to see a map for any other countries , feel free to contact me on twitter , @seancarmody .
I will add them to this flickr image set .
UPDATE : As Mark Lauer correctly pointed out , these maps were originally inaccurate when it came to countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union .
This has now been corrected in the maps above .

Roger Friedman , the Fox News columnist who was sacked after reviewing a leaked copy of X - Men Origins : Wolverine , is taking his former employers to court
The US gossip writer who was fired after reviewing a leaked copy of X - Men Origins : Wolverine hit back at his former employer yesterday , slapping Fox News and its parent company News Corp with a $ 5 m ( £ 3 m ) claim for damages .
For good measure , the lawsuit accuses Fox of " wilful , reckless , intentional and malicious " defamation .
Plaintiff Roger Friedman was sacked from his $ 250,000 - a- year position on 4 April , two days after posting his review on the Fox News website .
Friedman 's dismissal was reportedly ordered by News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch , with a subsequent statement claiming that the company had " zero tolerance for any action that encourages and promotes piracy " .
Friedman 's case was presumably not helped by the fact that Wolverine was itself a Fox production .
However , Friedman 's suit insists that his unauthorised review was tacitly cleared by his editors at Fox News , and claims that News Corp is at fault for indirectly allowing the film to be leaked online .
In recent months , Friedman has also suggested that his dismissal was prompted in part by pressure from the Church of Scientology .
Friedman claims that the organisation objected to the critical tone of his columns and used its influence to have him removed .
In addition to the $ 5 m claim , Friedman is also seeking $ 180,000 in lost wages .
The unfinished version of X - Men Origins : Wolverine appeared online at the end of March .
At the time the film 's star , Hugh Jackman , said that he was " heartbroken " by the leak and likened the incomplete version to " a Ferrari without the paint job " .

A judge in Colombia has sentenced 10 soldiers to 30 years in prison for murdering civilians and passing them off as rebels killed in combat .
The soldiers killed two restaurant workers in 2006 and pretended they were rebel casualties .
The sentences of 30 years were for the soldiers who actually carried out the murders of two young men in a town some four hours from Medellin .
The two men were presented as rebels killed in combat .
The lesser sentences were for the soldiers who helped cover up the murders .
The Attorney - General 's office is negotiating more than 1,000 cases .

A damning report on Australia 's health system , which calls for greater attention to preventative health , has been welcomed by experts .
But some point to major challenges on the horizon .
The report from the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission this week says Australia 's $ 94 billion health system is too focused on illness at the expense of wellness .
Despite increasing health awareness , many Australians do n't make healthy choices because they can't afford to or because of their living environment , the report says .
It says chronic diseases caused by lifestyle or risky behaviours eat up around 70 per cent of the health dollar , yet comparatively little is spent on preventing such diseases .
" We commit less than 2 per cent of the health budget to a problem which consumes a major proportion of health expenditure , " says the report .
" We have a health system skewed to managing sickness rather than encouraging wellness . "
The report recommends the establishment of an independent National Health Promotion and Prevention Agency , early intervention and a rolling series of ten - year goals for health promotion and prevention .
It also calls for better equity in access to health care for Aboriginal people , people in rural and remote areas , as well as those with mental health and dental care needs .
Exciting report
Public health experts have welcomed the report 's focus on preventative health .
" We 're really delighted , " says Michael Moore of the Public Health Association of Australia .
" It 's quite exciting as far as we 're concerned . "
" We 've never seen before a report such as this with a focus on the healthcare system that is also talking about prevention , " says public health expert Professor Rob Moodie , of the University of Melbourne .
" We see that as a huge positive . "
" We need to be much better at building the fence at the top of the cliff , not just being the ambulance at the bottom , " says Professor Moodie , who is chair of the Preventative Health Task Force , whose report is expected to be released soon .
Money matters
Mr Moore says one challenge in implementing the report 's recommendations is the costs in a time of economic global crisis .
" I think the biggest challenge is the money , " he says .
Mr Moore says spending on prevention will not necessarily save money if people live longer as a result of not getting sick , but it does mean that people will have better health and quality of life .
" Prevention still costs money , " says Professor Moodie .
" But it uses the money a lot more effectively "
" We 'll get a better outcome for it by virtue of reduced premature deaths , reduced suffering and better productivity . "
Beyond health
Both men say preventing illness involves changes in a range of policy areas beyond health .
" You can't look at obesity and food without looking at how food is farmed and manufactured , " says Mr Moore .
" These are dealt with by different departments . "
Professor Moodie says the Preventative Health Taskforce will examine policy and levers in the area of transport , sport and recreation , urban planning , education , industry , media and advertising .
" If we want to substantially improve our health then we have to deal with all those sectors and the three levels of government as well .
' Healthy public policy '
Urban public health expert Dr Chloe Mason says what is really needed is " healthy public policy " , in which all government portfolios are responsible for promoting health , not just the health portfolio .
For example , she says , the British Medical Association recognised more than 10 years ago that roads budget needs to be spent more on " health promoting transport " and less on " health damaging transport " .
" It would be a mistake to see all of the money for prevention to be channelled through the health system , " says Mason , an associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures in Sydney .
" There are huge budgets that could be shaped towards more healthy outcomes . "

The core lesson of these events is that the Iranian regime is fragile at the core .
Like all autocratic regimes , it has become rigid , paranoid , insular , insecure , impulsive , clumsy and illegitimate .
The people running the regime know it , which is why the Revolutionary Guard is seeking to consolidate power into a small , rigid , insulated circle .
The Iranians on the streets know it .
The world knows it .
From now on , the central issue of Iran - Western relations wo n’t be the nuclear program .
The regime is more fragile than the program .
The regime is more likely to go away than the program .
The central issue going forward will be the regime ’s survival itself .
The radically insecure members of this government will make no concessions that might threaten their hold on power .
The West wo n’t be able to go back and view Iran through the old lens of engagement on nuclear issues .
The nations of the West will have to come up with multi-track policies that not only confront Iran on specific issues , but also try to undermine the regime itself .
This approach is like Ronald Reagan ’s policy toward the Soviet Union , and it is no simple thing .
It does n’t mean you do n’t talk to the regime ; Reagan talked to the Soviets .
But it does mean you pursue many roads at once .
There is no formula for undermining a decrepit regime .
And there are no circumstances in which the United States has been able to peacefully play a leading role in another nation ’s revolution .
But there are many tools this nation has used to support indigenous democrats : independent media , technical advice , economic and cultural sanctions , presidential visits for key dissidents , the unapologetic embrace of democratic values , the unapologetic condemnation of the regime ’s barbarities .
Recently , many people thought it was clever to say that elections on their own do n’t make democracies .
But election campaigns stoke the mind and fraudulent elections outrage the soul .
The Iranian elections have stirred a whirlwind that will lead , someday , to the regime ’s collapse .
Hastening that day is now the central goal .

Global consumer electronics sales were up 4.2 % last quarter over the first , market researcher iSuppli reports .
Year - over - year sales were down 11 % , but Q2 sales were to $ 71.1 billion from $ 68.3 billion in Q1 .
Sales dropped 25.8 % between Q109 and Q408 .
Part of that plummet had to do with the usual shopping recess after the holidays .
VentureBeat writes that " the data is consistent with sales reports in the chip industry , which also saw sales grow in the second quarter , compared with the first quarter . "
Third quarter sales are expected to rise another 12.5 % and fourth quarter sales are expected to increase by about 10 % over the previous quarter .
Falling prices in categories like digital cameras , flat - panel TVs and game consoles might have helped spike consumer spending , though not always .
Handheld video games , game consoles , camcorders and rear - projection TVs did experience sales declines this quarter .
Overall , iSuppli estimates sales will decline by about 8 % in 2009 .
LogoWatch Canada 's University of Waterloo has caught a light case of the rebranding sniffles , having decided to flush its old brand frontage ( left ) down the toilet of history and unveil an exciting " new marketing - oriented visual identity " ( right ) :
To give students a taste of the coming revolution , the uni is this week unfurling a few banners ( see pic ) which Meg Beckel , vice - president external relations , described as " transitional " .
She explained : “ We are not using the new logo , but we are introducing elements of the new visual identity : the Gotham font , the bolder look , and the colours .
This is an evolution , not a revolution .
We are gradually getting the new look out there , testing it and playing with it . ”
Lovely .
Well , sort of lovely , because according to one student who got in touch with El Reg , the redefined academic logo paradigm has not gone down well with the unwashed masses .
Indeed , revolting alumni have manned the Facebook barricades * en masse to protest a logo they " do not believe ... represents UW 's prestige and degree of professionalism properly " .
Entertaining stuff .

On the Economic Outlook and the Commitment to Price Stability
Dennis P. Lockhart
President and Chief Executive Officer
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
Rotary Club of Nashville
Nashville , Tennessee
July 20 , 2009
For my remarks this afternoon , I 'll talk about how I see the economy at this juncture , the near - and medium - term outlook , and the growing concern about inflation .
Let me add at this point my usual disclaimer that my remarks are my thoughts alone and may not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) .
It 's especially important that I mention this caveat the day before Chairman Ben Bernanke makes his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress .
Tomorrow the chairman will speak for the Federal Reserve System .
Today , I am speaking just for myself , informed by advice from my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta .
Current economy
Current economic conditions are mixed at best , but the economy appears to be in stabilization mode .
Stabilization necessarily precedes recovery .
A recovery has not yet taken hold but should begin before too long .
I 'll start with a look at manufacturing , which has been hard hit in this recession .
Just last week we learned that manufacturing production was down 0.6 percent in June , month over month .
In the past year , manufacturers have cut production by more than 15 percent , and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate dropped to about 65 percent , a record low .
Here in middle Tennessee , manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of employment .
The number of manufacturing jobs here declined by about 12 percent on a year - over - year basis in May , the most recent data available .
I know that many of you here today have directly felt the troubles in this important sector .
Recent indicators of business investment are also down but are a bit less discouraging .
Durable goods orders increased this spring and in May reached the highest levels in four months .
On the other hand , the most recent data showed the liquidation of business inventories continuing , but the pace has slowed .
Consumer spending absorbs about two - thirds of economic output , and the recent picture in this area is mostly negative .
After taking price changes into account , it appears that retail spending fell again in June .
Restaurants , department stores , and building materials retailers all posted month - to - month declines .
Overall , retail results are in line with the ongoing weakness in consumer spending we have been seeing .
There is also indication of worsening consumer confidence .
The University of Michigan 's July report indicated that consumer sentiment fell sharply in recent weeks , reversing the gains seen in May and June .
Growing consumer pessimism has been reported in other survey data .
It appears that expectations of future economic conditions , and particularly employment prospects , are weighing on attitudes .
As for housing , permits and new home starts in June improved markedly compared with previous months , and the large inventory of houses for sale has been pared back somewhat .
But the housing sector is still under great stress .
Reflecting a persistent pace of foreclosures , the percentage of distressed sales remains high — about one in three sales in May .
All in all , this information suggests a slower pace of decline in a still weak residential sector .
Data on the overall economy suggest the same trend of slowing decline .
I , along with my team in Atlanta , believe real gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell slightly in the second quarter .
This performance represents substantial progress coming off a contraction of 5.5 percent ( annualized ) in the first quarter .
The most recent monthly labor market report was disappointing , but employment tends to lag improvements in economic performance .
Nothing in the incoming data has altered our view that the economy is nearing a bottom and will soon begin a very slow recovery .
Financial market healing
If stabilization is to lead to sustained recovery , the health of financial markets is crucial .
In this regard , I see notable signs of improvement .
For example , most short - term money markets have seen rising volume , increased liquidity , and less concern with counterparty risk .
In the corporate bond market , spreads have declined and lowered the cost of capital for investment - grade businesses .
Our credit markets include both banks and the very important securitization markets .
Securitization markets have been coming back gradually from a base late last year of nearly zero .
Total asset - backed security issuance in the second quarter of 2009 was $ 49 billion , which is 14 times larger than during the frozen market conditions of the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Equity markets were up globally in the second quarter .
While the calendar of initial public offerings remains weak , stock issuance in the second quarter tripled compared with the first quarter of 2009 and hit the highest level for the past year and a half .
Much of the recent equity issuance activity was capital raises of large banks .
It 's positive news that the banks participating in the so - called stress tests have raised a substantial portion of the required capital .
Some banks have begun repaying their Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds to the U.S. Treasury .
Also , use of the Fed 's special credit facilities has fallen by $ 500 billion since March of this year .
Despite this progress , the financial sector remains in a fragile state .
So far this year , 57 U.S. banks have failed , including 13 in the Southeast .
Banks in this region suffer from overconcentration of loans backed by residential and commercial real estate .
Outlook
Now , let me speak to the question of the outlook from here .
Often a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity .
Unfortunately , as I look ahead , I do not foresee this trajectory .
I expect real growth to resume in the second half and progress at a modest pace .
I do not see a strong recovery in the medium term .
There are risks to even this rather subdued forecast .
The risk I 'm watching most closely is commercial real estate .
There is a heavy schedule of commercial real estate financings coming due in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 .
The CMBS ( commercial real estate mortgage - backed securities ) market is very weak , and banks generally have no appetite to roll over loans on properties that have lost value in the recession .
Refinancing problems will not directly affect GDP — it 's commercial construction that factors into GDP — but I 'm concerned problems in commercial real estate finance could adversely affect the otherwise improving banking and insurance sectors .
Removing obstacles to growth
I 'd like to elaborate further on my thinking regarding this forecast of an anemic recovery in the medium term .
I will argue that growth is the natural state for the U.S. economy , and growth in the medium term will be slowed by structural impediments that must be removed or attenuated .
Growth is the natural state because market competition requires continuous innovation — product innovation , technological innovation , new business models , and development of new markets .
Businesspeople — especially those in publicly held companies — understand that over the longer term it 's either grow or disappear .
It follows then that resumption and acceleration of growth depends on removal of obstacles .
By obstacles , I mean conditions that get in the way of a natural pace of growth .
I see a number of obstacles whose removal will take some time .
For example , the healing of the banking system will take time .
Working off excess housing inventory will take time .
The reallocation of labor to productive and growing sectors of the economy will take time .
It will take time to complete the deleveraging of American households and the restoration of consumer balance sheets .
In short , I believe the economy must undergo significant structural adjustments .
We 're coming out of a severe recession , and it's not too much an exaggeration to say the economy is undergoing a makeover .
We must build a more solid foundation for our economy than consumer spending fueled by excessive credit — excessive household leverage — built on a house price bubble .
The surviving financial system must find a new posture of risk taking .
The balance of consumption and investment must adjust , with investment being financed by greater domestic saving .
The distribution of employment must adjust to match worker skills , including newly acquired skills , with jobs in growth markets .
Some industrial plant and equipment must be taken offline to remove excess and higher - cost capacity .
As I said , these adjustments will take time and will suppress growth prospects in the process .
I believe the economy will underperform its long - term potential for a while because of the obstacles to growth that must be removed , adjustments it must undergo .
Many observers see substantial slack in the economy that could persist for some years .
Economists ' more formal term for slack is “ output gap . ”
We at the Atlanta Fed see a meaningful output gap developing , but in our view it is smaller than would normally be associated with the weak pace of growth we expect over the next couple of years because all the obstacles to the natural pace of growth already mentioned have brought down the economy 's potential for the medium term .
Inflation risks
This observation leads me to some comments on inflation .
The inflation statistics have fluctuated in recent months , mainly as a result of volatile energy prices .
But the most recent core inflation indicators continue to point to an inflation trend somewhere just below 2 percent — not much different from where it has been for some time now .
At this juncture , my assessment is that inflationary and deflationary risks are roughly balanced .
I do n't believe businesses , broadly speaking , have much pricing power .
I 'm hearing this belief anecdotally .
Recently , our regional executives asked a wide range of business contacts in the Southeast about their ability to raise prices in this economy .
The great majority of respondents reported that they were not able to raise prices , and some are having to renegotiate contracts to lower prices .
Still , I recognize that concerns about inflation risks have recently risen in some quarters , and I would like to comment on those concerns .
Inflation pessimists — those predicting alarmingly higher inflation — point to growing federal deficits and the substantial growth of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet since last October .
More precisely , they note the enormous increase of excess bank reserves on the liability side of the Fed 's balance sheet .
The argument is that surely this rapid growth of the monetary base and balance sheet must translate eventually , and possibly quite soon , into outsized growth of the money supply .
This growth in the money supply is inflationary if not reversed fairly soon .
That 's the argument .
To carry this argument a little further , the concern is that banks will begin to lend the large quantity of reserves that exist today , putting the money into circulation as the economy picks up .
The growth in spending that could result from this increase in money could push against the economy 's capacity constraints in a way that creates inflationary pressures , according to the inflation pessimists .
Altered role of bank reserves
Let me draw attention to an important policy change that has altered the relationship between the quantity of bank reserves and overall spending in the economy .
Since last October , the Federal Reserve has been paying banks interest on their reserve deposits .
This shift means that banks are more likely to hold reserves with the Fed than in the past and less inclined to look for a way to invest or lend excess reserves .
Now banks earn on reserves where previously they did n't .
So now there is less direct linkage between growth in the size of the Fed 's balance sheet and inflationary pressures .
In other words , the absolute size of the Fed 's balance sheet is n't as scary as it was before .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not saying that the current size of the balance sheet is necessarily the most appropriate .
What I am saying is one should not assume at this point that extraordinary measures to shrink the balance sheet are required to contain inflationary pressures .
In addition , let me highlight two points from the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting .
First , the size of the balance sheet is currently expected to peak later in the year and then begin to decrease .
This decrease will occur as various liquidity programs are phased out or decline in use and as long - term asset purchase programs are completed .
Second , the FOMC is actively studying mechanisms to deliberately shrink the size of the balance sheet should the need arise , and to do this without causing disruptions to the economy .
According to the minutes of the last FOMC meeting , a top Fed priority is “ ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time . ”
In my view , some inflation pessimists are not giving weight to the changed mechanics of monetary policy transmission to the broad economy .
For some years now the Fed has used interest rates — interest rate policy — to influence economic activity and inflation .
Paying the banks interest on their reserves allows the Fed to tighten monetary conditions by resetting this floor interest rate without direct manipulation of the size of the balance sheet .
Nonetheless , it 's important that we policymakers remember that rising inflation fears can evolve into inflation expectations on which businesspeople and consumers act .
Modern inflation fighting by policymakers is substantially about anchoring expectations .
The bulwark against rising inflation expectations is the Fed 's credibility .
By this , I 'm referring to the belief that the monetary authorities have the tools — and the commitment — to act against inflation .
I want to assure you the Fed has several tools and is readying itself to act on the balance sheet when the time comes .
And I am very confident of the FOMC 's commitment to price stability .
I recognize , however , it 's easy to say one is committed to act in advance of the need to act .
Circumstances at the time may make the need less clear and the decision more complicated .
So , if the incremental step of announcing a formal inflation target would serve to calm current fears and prove convincing on an ongoing basis , I would favor such a move .
I think that discussion needs to continue .
Let me summarize my argument here today .
The economy is stabilizing and recovery will begin in the second half .
The recovery will be weak compared with historic recoveries from recession .
The recovery will be weak because the economy must make structural adjustments before the healthiest possible rate of growth can be achieved .
While this adjustment process is going on in the medium term , I believe inflation and deflation are roughly equal risks and require careful monitoring .
Slack in the economy will suppress inflation .
And inflation is unlikely to result — by direct causation — from the recent growth of the Fed 's balance sheet .
In any event , the Fed has a number of tools being readied to unwind the policies used to fight the recession , and it will be some time before their use is appropriate .
I will end with those thoughts and would be happy to take your questions .

In a survey of college students , 57 % said their peers use sites such as Facebook , MySpace and Twitter for self - promotion , narcissism and attention - seeking .
TALKIN ' ' BOUT MY GENERATION TALKIN ' ' BOUT MY GENERATION
College students say social networking makes them more narcissistic , a national survey reports today — and they also believe their generation is the most narcissistic of all .
That 's what a majority of 1,068 college students said when asked about narcissism in a poll on social networking sites in June by Ypulse .
TEST YOURSELF : Take the Narcissistic Personality Inventory DR .
DREW Q&A : Is celebrity narcissism a bad reflection for kids ?
More than half ( 57 % ) said their peers used social networking sites such as MySpace , Facebook and Twitter for self - promotion , narcissism and attention - seeking .
And 92 % said they used MySpace or Facebook regularly .
Two - thirds said their generation was more self - promoting , narcissistic , overconfident and attention - seeking than others .
The survey was done with Jean Twenge , associate professor of psychology at San Diego State University and co-author of The Narcissism Epidemic .
Other researchers , however , say self - promotion does n't have to be a negative .
" We all kind of put on our best face when presenting ourselves in social situations , online or offline , " says Nicole Ellison , an assistant professor at Michigan State University in East Lansing who studies social networking .
" When good things happen to me , I put that on Facebook , and when bad things happen , I also put it on Facebook .
It 's a structure to receive emotional support . "
Houston Dougharty , vice president for student affairs at Grinnell College in Grinnell , Iowa , says today 's students are altruistic and care about helping others , which does n't say " narcissism " to him .
" I think there 's a negative connotation to narcissism that I would not want to promote as a description of this generation . "
Social networking is " a celebration of individuality and sort of promotion of one 's own personality , " he says .
But Twenge says her research suggests growing narcissism in Generation Y , based on 40 questions used for decades .
Scoring 21 or more indicates more narcissistic traits , she says .
In the 1980s , one of seven scored in that range ; now it 's one in four .
" We see this change over time in narcissistic traits , but I was very interested to hear whether young people saw that in their generation , " she says .

This is one of those times .
Military vs. Non-Military Durable Goods

Durable Goods Shipments Down 20 %
With that stunning graphic out of the way , please consider some interesting factoids from Why a Recovery May Still Feel Like a Recession .
Durable goods shipments fell by more than 20 percent during this recession , and would have declined further were it not for increased production of weapons .
In no previous downturn since 1958 , when the figures began being recorded , had the decline been as much as 14 percent .
The drop is all the more remarkable because such shipments rose at a relatively restrained rate in the preceding period of economic growth , particularly when military sales were excluded .
In June , seasonally adjusted shipments for civilian purposes were 19 percent below the average monthly figure for 2000 .
Shipments of military items were running 123 percent above the 2000 average .
Those figures are in nominal dollars , not adjusted for inflation .
That fact may exaggerate the trend , since prices of some durable goods , like computers , have fallen over the years .
The North American anime distributor Funimation has announced at its Otakon panel on Saturday that it has licensed the new Casshern Sins and Eden of the East television anime series .
Madhouse remade Tatsunoko's Shinzo Ningen Casshan science - fiction anime classic into a 2008 - 2009 series which just ended in March .
The story follows a cyborg who rises against the robotic armies that have subjugated all of humanity .
Streamline Pictures and ADV Films both released the 1993 Casshan : Robot Hunter animated video remake in North America , and Go Fish Pictures released Kazuaki Kiriya 's 2004 live - action movie remake .
Eden of the East is the latest anime series from Production I.G , Ghost in the Shell : Stand Alone Complex director Kenji Kamiyama , and character designer Chika Umino ( Honey and Clover ) .
The anime series just ended last month with the announcement of two theatrical films .
Funimation will release both the Casshern Sins and Eden of the East television anime series in 2010 .
The company does not know if its Eden of the East release will retain the " Falling Down " opening theme song from the British rock band Oasis .
Funimation has also announced that it will release a Korean live - action film called Daytime Drinking and the Dragon Ball Z " Dragon Boxes " — the same DVD box releases that Japan had produced from the original masters .

Over the next few days , he was constantly online monitoring what other amateurs were seeing as the earth and Jupiter rotated .
When amateurs from Europe to Hawaii started reporting their own glimpses of the black spot , the chatter lighted up around the globe , he said .
By day , Mr. Fuqua , 56 , kept in steady e-mail contact with students in his astronomy club to discuss the significance :

Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , 60 years old , told the graduating class of Butler University last month that boomers have been " self - absorbed , self - indulgent and all too often just plain selfish . "
New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman , 55 , told Grinnell College graduates in Iowa that his was " the grasshopper generation , eating through just about everything like hungry locusts . "
And Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet , at 44 barely a boomer himself , told seniors at Colorado College that the national creed of one generation standing on the shoulders of the next was at risk " because our generation has not been faithful enough to our grandparents ' example . "
We Are Really , Really Sorry Read excerpts from some of the commencement speeches and watch or read the full speech .
" I know you 're looking up here at my generation and you 're thinking , ' Great .
Thanks .
Just when it was our turn , you broke it . '
Well , America is a little broken right now .
The greatest economic turndown since , well , since my grandparents broke it . "
-- Scott Pelley , " 60 Minutes " correspondent , Texas Tech commencement , May 26 , 2009 Video of remarks : * * * " Today , if you are thinking about standing on the shoulders of the past generation , I 'd say ' Please do n't . '
Of course , I do n't mean for a moment that you should not appreciate profoundly the health , wealth , comfort , the great innovations , and the general absence of world conflict which make this age in this nation the luckiest that ever was .
After all , thankfulness is a pillar of The Butler Way .
What I mean to suggest is that you take into the world the values written on the locker room wall at Hinkle , which are not much at all like those associated with the Baby Boom .
That you live for others , not just yourselves .
For fulfillment , not just pleasure and material gain .
For tomorrow , and the Americans who will reside there , not just for today .
That song I mentioned ends with the refrain , " And do n't worry ' bout tomorrow , hey , hey , hey . "
When it comes on oldies radio , please , tune it out .
Do worry ' bout tomorrow , in a way your elders often failed to do . " -- Gov. Mitchell Daniels , Butler University commencement , May 9 , 2009

Full text of remarks
The baby boom generation represents roughly 78 million people born from 1946 to 1964 .
Far from the hope and idealism they expressed when they were coming of age , boomer commencement speakers today -- in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression -- are striking a tone marked with self - recrimination and gloom .
But their apologies fell flat with some students , who wondered why the speakers were n't urging their fellow boomers to do more to clean up the mess they created .
" They have been pretty selfish , but they 're still going to be around , " said Ben Slaton , a Butler graduate .
" They need to do their part . "
The speeches , which were tailored to their audience of early 20 - somethings , understandably dwelled on what younger people could do to help fix the country 's problems .
And no matter what this year 's crop of speakers said , they were likely to encounter skepticism from students entering the worst job market in decades .
Furthermore , these speakers did at least apologize for missteps on their watch , when they also could have pointed to their many accomplishments , from progress shrinking racial and gender divides to stunning advances in technology to the opening up of educational opportunities .
But Neil Howe , an author and historian who has studied the cultural impact of different generations on society , said the raft of apologies sounded like a ploy to absolve a generation of its mistakes .
" You think about what an apology does , it allows you to maintain the moral high ground . "
It was n't supposed to come to this .
In 1969 , a few months before Woodstock helped define her generation , Hillary Clinton repudiated an " acquisitive and competitive corporate life " in her class address at Wellesley College .
She called for " a more immediate , ecstatic and penetrating mode of living . "
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet faulted his generation in college commencement speech .
Tom Kimmell
Initially , that impulse helped propel social movements and bring an end to the Vietnam War , Mr. Howe said .
But the idea eventually " caved in on itself " as boomers focused more on " their own inner voyage " and less on their obligation to society .
In his address at Colorado College , Sen. Bennet , a Democrat , used three figures to make his point about boomers ' failures .
Since the beginning of the decade , annual median family income in the U.S. declined by $ 300 ; health - care costs climbed by 80 % ; and the cost of higher education jumped 60 % .
" We have limited the potential of future generations by burdening them with our poor choices and our unwillingness to make tough ones , " Mr. Bennet said .
That theme echoed around the country .
At Texas Tech University , CBS " 60 Minutes " correspondent Scott Pelley , 51 , told graduates : " I know you 're looking up here at my generation and you 're thinking , ' Great , thanks , just when it was our turn , you broke it . "
Speaking at the Boston College commencement last month , documentary filmmaker Ken Burns compared the divisiveness of this era with the Civil War period .
In an interview , he said the boomers ' tragedy was to " squander the legacy handed to them by the generation from World War II . "
The biggest failure of the baby boomers is that the majority of their generation still live in the past .

Some commencement speakers went beyond castigating their generation 's failures to highlight opportunities presented by the current crisis .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer , 53 , who has criticized his generation as selfish , urged graduates to answer the call to service to build a sustainable energy sector .
Mr. Bennet asked graduates to join him in working for affordable health care .
Stefanie Sanford , an education advocate who has written a book about the interplay between the generations , last month told graduates at Hood College in Maryland that their generation is well - suited to make a difference .
The so - called Millennials , born between 1982 and 2001 , " just want to focus on what works , " she said in an interview .
Julie Meador , who just graduated from the University of Kentucky and listened to the speaker at her commencement apologize for the financial mess her class is inheriting , said she is n't thinking about saving the world just yet .
The 21 - year - old marketing major is earning $ 7.50 an hour as a part - time sales associate at the Gap while looking for a position that allows her to put her degree to use .
" Right now what I 'm thinking about most is finding a good job , " she said .
" My plate is pretty full . "

China to ' reduce ' number of executions
China is to reduce the number of executions it carries out every year to " an extremely small level " , an official said yesterday as the country retained its position at the top of world execution lists .
As usual , yesterday 's New Home Sales numbers were greeted with a range of cheers and derision , as analysts saw in them what they hoped and expected to see .
Among the more objective points about the numbers , meanwhile , were the following :
The sales numbers were better than expected , as has been most housing data of late
Inventories are now approaching normal levels , which should help stabilize prices
Prices are still falling , but at a much slower rate
Sales were no doubt helped by low mortgage rates , the $ 8,000 first - time homebuyer credit , and major incentives from homebuilders , some of which will eventually cease
The housing market is , slowly but surely , healing itself .
Here are some charts and key observations from Asha Bangalore at Northern Trust .
They help put everything in context .
First , new home sales improved again .
Of course , they 're still near historical lows .
Sales of new single - family homes rose 9.6 % in July , after upward revisions for May and June .
Purchases of new homes have risen in five of the first seven months of the year .
Sales of new single - family homes are now up roughly 32 % from a record low reading of 329,000 units registered in January 2009 .
The rate of sales is also falling at a much slower rate ( year over year ) .
Prices are now falling at a much slower rate .
From a year ago , sales of new single - family homes are down only 9.3 % ; it is a significant improvement compared with double digit declines seen in recent months .
The largest drop in the median price of a new single - family home for the cycle was in January 2009 ( - 45.5 % ) .
The median price of a new single - family home was $ 210,100 in July , down 0.1 % from prior month and off by 11.5 % from a year ago .
Inventories have now almost reached the " normal " level .
This bodes well for price stabilization .
The inventories - sales ratio is encouraging because it declined to a 7.5 - month mark , down from a cycle high of 12.4 - months in January 2009 ( see chart 4 ) .
The median of this ratio during 1963 - 2000 is 6 - month supply .
Six Christians were burned alive in Pakistan yesterday when hundreds of Muslims attacked and looted their homes , sparked by rumours that pages from the Qur'an had been desecrated .
The dead , including four women and a child , were killed when Christian homes were torched by hundreds of supporters of a banned Muslim organisation in the Punjabi village of Gojra , in eastern Pakistan .
Tensions have been running high between the two communities over allegations that Christians had defiled pages from the Muslim holy book , despite authorities insisting that the rumours were unfounded .
Television footage from the area showed houses burning and streets strewn with debris and blackened furniture as mobs ran at each other .
There were reports in the local media of exchanges of gunfire between Christian and Muslim communities and that rioters had blocked a railway line .
Pakistani authorities named the Muslim group involved in the violence as Sipah - e - Sahaba , which has been accused of launching attacks against security forces and carrying out bomb attacks in public places in recent years .
Rana Sanaullah , Punjab 's law minister , said that an investigation had been carried out into allegations made during the week that a copy of the Qur'an had been defaced but that no such incident was found to have taken place .
Although the situation had calmed down by Friday , he said yesterday that " some miscreants and extremists entered the city [ on Saturday ] and pushed people toward armed clashes " .
Pakistan 's federal minister for minorities , Shahbaz Bhatti , said he had visited Gojra on Friday and asked police to provide protection for Christians who were facing threats , but accused them of ignoring his efforts .
Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim nation although religious minorities , including Christians , account for about 4 % of its population of 170 million .
The communities generally live peacefully alongside one another , but Muslim militants have periodically targeted Christians and churches in recent years .
The organizers said 150,000 people joined the vigil , tying the record set by the first anniversary vigil in 1990 and dwarfing every subsequent vigil .
The police estimated the crowd at 62,800 , their largest estimate for any vigil except the one in 1990 , which they put at 80,000 .
Hong Kong , returned by Britain to Chinese rule in 1997 , is still semiautonomous and is the only place in China where large public gatherings are allowed to mark the anniversaries of the 1989 protests and killings .
The peaceful assembly spilled out into nearby streets , shutting down traffic .
Inside Victoria Park , thousands listened to songs and speakers who recounted the events on the night of the crackdown .
A half - hour into the vigil , the lights in the park were extinguished and the attendees lighted a forest of white candles in inverted conical paper shields .
Around the park on Thursday , numerous banners in Chinese demanded the vindication of the students and other Beijing residents who perished during the Chinese government crackdown .
There were people of all ages , from gray - haired retirees to young children whose parents accompanied them to explain why they felt so deeply about an event that took place before the children were born .
Gary Leung , a 42 - year - old interior designer , went with his two daughters , ages 8 and 4 .
“ I want to see Tiananmen vindicated , ” he said .
“ I feel very old  I hope the apology will come before I die , and if not , my children will continue the struggle . ”
THERE is still plenty of time for America 's banking strategy to fail miserably — a new round of economic contraction could lead to new troubles for large banks , or inadequate regulatory reform may allow moral hazard plays to sow the seeds of a future crisis — but for now it looks pretty remarkably good .
On top of the return to near normalcy in credit markets , we have the fact that the American government is earning some nice returns on its investments :
In contrast to Switzerland , which sold its 9 per cent UBS stake for a SFr1.2bn ( $ 1.1 bn ) gain last week , the world ’s other large economies – except the US – are sitting on combined losses of $ 10.8 bn relating to their holdings in the equity of listed banks they bailed out over the past 12 months .
The US government , by contrast , is sitting on a paper profit of almost $ 11bn on its 34 per cent shareholding in Citigroup , its only direct stake in a large financial institution .
That comes on top of the gains already banked from TARP repayments :
In spite of criticism of the bail - outs of lenders such as Citi , Bank of America and Wells Fargo , the Treasury has reaped gains from the coupons payable under the troubled asset relief programme bail - out funding , most of which has been repaid .
The government said it had earned an annualised return of 23 per cent from its $ 10bn investment in Goldman Sachs under Tarp .
In June , Goldman returned the $ 10bn and later paid another $ 1.1 bn to buy back warrants attached to Tarp aid .
Morgan Stanley , American Express and other banks have done the same , leaving taxpayers with substantial profits .
The government essentially bet that markets were beset by panic , and that once fear subsided banks would find themselves in better conditions and healthy enough to earn their way out of insolvency .
At this point , even AIG is telling the government it will eventually be able to repay its assistance .
This does n't mean that the government could n't have crafted a better solution to the crisis , but it does suggest that those bemoaning the high cost of the bail - out and basing their estimates on worst case scenarios involving no repayments were way , way off base .

Scientists have known for years that when fishing trawlers drag nets and gear across the ocean bottom they trap or kill almost all the fish , mollusks and other creatures they encounter .
And the dragging destroys underwater features like reefs , turning the bottom to mud .
Now , scientists have used satellite images to show fleets of trawlers leaving plumes of mud behind them like contrails .
They hope the images will focus wider attention on trawling damage , and on the possible uses of satellites to monitor fishing .
One of the researchers , Kyle Van Houtan , who earned his doctorate in environmental science in December at Duke , began the work when he was studying the nesting success of sea turtles and wanted to check the influence of shrimpers , who trawl the bottom for their catch .
He turned for guidance to Daniel Pauly , director of the fisheries center at the University of British Columbia , which maintains an elaborate global database on fishing .
In essence , a prepaid credit card is a debit card .
The cardholder funds the card in advance of a purchase by adding money to the account from which the pre paid card draws money .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using a prepaid credit card .
Advantages of Using Prepaid Credit Cards
The number one advantage to prepaid credit cards is that the applicant does not have to undergo a credit check .
Just about anyone can open an account to enjoy the benefits of a prepaid credit card .
There is no annual fee , zero percent interest and no monthly credit card bills to look forward to .
Prepaid credit cards come in handy when purchasing items online and in person at retail stores .
While the prepaid credit card looks and behaves just like a standard credit card in most cases , one big difference is that the cardholder cannot overspend .
In other words , the credit limit is bound by the amount of money in the bank account .
It ’s a nice way to learn to live within one ’s means .
Disadvantage of Prepaid Credit Cards
Pre paid credit cards do nothing to improve the cardholder ’s credit standing .
Since the credit card activities are not reported to the credit bureaus , individuals looking to build or reestablish credit after a bankruptcy should seek other credit alternatives .
Another disadvantage to prepaid credit cards is that the cardholder may only charge the available limit in the account .
While it is listed as an advantage , it is also a disadvantage .
If an unexpected emergency happens that exceeds the limit in the account , the cardholder may not charge more than the limit in the account and therefore must find other ways to finance the emergency .
Unexpected Prepaid Credit Card Fees
Consumers should shop around for prepaid credit cards because they are not all the same .
Some credit card issuers charge a fee if the cardholder does not open an account with the bank .
Additionally , some banks charge a fee for cards that are not pre-funded through direct deposit .
As with most transactions at an ATM machine , prepaid cards are charged ATM fees , but many cardholders are not aware that many banks charge a monthly fee if the account is inactive for an extended period of time .
Depending on the issuer , cardholders may also incur fees for speaking to a bank teller while others charge fees for customer service calls .
Baby Phat Prepaid Visa RushCard , for instance , charges a one - dollar fee for each online purchase ( capped at a $ 10 per month ) .
They also charge a one - dollar retail purchase fee , which is also capped at $ 10 per month .
It is very important to read the fine print before signing up for a prepaid card .
I do n’t care if Christians pray .
I do n’t care if they think prayer can solve world hunger , end wars , or heal the sick .
I do n’t care if they pray together or pray alone .
I do not care about prayer in the same way that I do care about masturbation .
Prayer , like masturbation , is a personal thing .
Where I start to care , no wait , where I violently appose prayer , is when Christians ask to pray with me .
I view it in the same way I would if somebody asked me to watch them jack off .
Um , no thanks .
Take lunch yesterday .
I have a spot that I enjoy once or twice a week .
I ’m such a regular that the owner will boot people from my table if I walk in to find it occupied .
This happened yesterday with a 80 - year - old man .
I vetoed the owner asking him to move , but my kindness was repaid with the insult and assault of prayer .
He came over to my table when my delicious campechana arrived and offered to pray over my meal with me .
I stood up , looked him in the eye and said , “ That ’s not going to happen .
Mind you damn business . ”
I cannot figure out what possess complete strangers to offer prayer like this .
I eat at this restaurant because I can sit at my table and eat in glorious peace and quiet .
I do n’t even have to talk .
Unless I say something , my normal meal appears like magic .
The disruption of a shared prayer is the exact opposite social experience I ’m looking for .
Christians of the world , just stop this nonsense .
How do you handle these unwanted prayer assaults ?
Ask Chris Rapley , the ebullient physicist and director of the Science Museum in London , why he seems more sanguine about our prospects of taming climate change than many of his peers , and he 'll tell you about the day he first toured the museum 's library and archives .
Surrounded by the thousands of designs and patent applications that traced the great Victorian lurch into modernity , he was struck by the power of human ingenuity .
" It seemed clear that if we could somehow focus all that creativity and energy on clean energy then we 'll be OK . "
Anyone watching an hour or two of the " hearings " in Manchester last weekend on which this report was based could not fail to have been similarly cheered .
The idea behind them was simple : we hear endlessly about the havoc unabated climate change will wreak , about long - term emissions targets and diplomatic wrangling over who will commit to them .
But the countless ingenious ideas for tackling the problem emanating from universities , thinktanks , front rooms and sheds across the planet get rather less attention .
So the Guardian teamed up with the Manchester International Festival to mount a search for the best of them .
Why Manchester ?
As the world 's first great industrial city , it was arguably the birthplace of man-made warming .
So just as Robert Angus Smith pioneered our understanding of atmospheric pollution here in the 1840s , experts and thinkers from around the world would gather in the city to grapple with the longer term legacy of its once mighty mills and factories .
To underscore the project 's connection to the city 's carbon hungry past , the hearings were held in Manchester Town Hall , Alfred Waterhouse 's neo-gothic cathedral to manufacturing and mercantilism .
Above the scientists , entrepreneurs and inconoclasts presenting their ideas , the great vaulted ceiling documented the countries and cities to which the city once dispatched its wares ; outside the mosaic floors were decorated with the bees that embodied its 19th century self - image as a hive of industry .
The hearings themselves were perhaps best described as a cross between a judicial inquiry and an episode of the British TV show Dragons ' Den .
Chaired by Lord Bingham – formerly Britain 's most senior judge – a panel of experts heard half hour pitches from advocates for each of 20 ideas shortlisted following a global appeal for innovative solutions to climate change .
The panel , in consultation with the eminent climate scientist John Schellnhuber , picked the 10 most promising ideas – somewhat reluctantly since our experts felt all of the proposals aired in Manchester were worthy of more consideration .
Now it 's over to you : you can watch short video presentations of each of the ideas featured in this supplement on our website and vote for the ones you think will be most effective .
Better still you might help to implement them by offering support or capital .
The ideas heard in Manchester ranged from the wackier edges of science fiction to well - advanced products poised to roll off production lines .
From the wilder shores came Professor Stephen Salter , an Edinburgh University engineer with a plan to increase the whiteness of clouds using a fleet of remote - control sailing ships spraying a fine mist of seawater into the air .
But anyone tempted to dismiss his plan as the product of a crank who has spent too much time in the shed would do well to note that Salter was the man behind the Edinburgh Duck , a pioneering 1970s design for harnessing wave energy .
Another variation on the marine theme came from former management consultant Tim Kruger who proposed tipping large amounts of lime into the ocean .
This , he claimed , would increase the sea's ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as reduce the dangerous acidity which has also been a byproduct of decades of emissions .
His compelling presentation was only slightly undermined by his own admission that such a plan would currently be illegal .
Mark Capron , a former naval engineer from California , was also frustrated by prosaic legal considerations .
His idea involves farming algae out at sea and then digesting it in thousands of " giant stomachs " under the surface .
The algae would absorb carbon dioxide and produce methane which could be used to produce energy .
The trouble is that he fears building a prototype in his garage would breach local safety regulations .
Among the more developed ideas presented , Peter Scott made the case for simple , super - efficient cooking stoves .
Burning wood ( and other biomass ) for cooking , largely in the developing world , was responsible for 10 - 20 % of global emissions he told the panel .
His stoves could cut the annual CO2 emissions of a household by 1 - 3 tonnes .
The only downside , he noted ruefully , was that a local manufacturer in Malawi had been so successful that he had splashed out on a fleet of SUVs .
" I have n't worked out the CO2 implications of that yet . "
Another idea tantalisingly close to crossing the threshold from brainwave to reality was proposed by entrepeneur Mike Mason .
He described dishwasher sized " ceramic fuel cells " which could produce enough electricity to power a home as well as hot water .
Because they were vastly more efficient than the power stations which produce electricity for the grid , and also obviated the need for hugely wasteful transmission of power along along hundreds of miles of cable , they could achieve massive carbon savings .
And the first domestic models would go on sale next year with a price tag of around £ 3,000 .
Many green activists are intensely sceptical about the search for technological " fixes " , particularly those that aim soley to mitigate the effects of warming .
They warn that trying to invent our way out of trouble is a way of avoiding the changes to our way of life that are really required .
But by no means all the advocates presenting in Manchester placed their faith in technology .
One of the most quietly inspiring presentations came from Rosemary Randall , a Cambridge psychotherapist who had been puzzled by the ability of people at the same time to acknowledge the threat of climate change and in no way change their high carbon lifestyle .
Randall designed a series of " carbon conversations " in which she encourages people to explore their attitude to consumption , identity and status .
People who have been on her course of six meetings typically reduce their emissions by a tonne immediately and then plan to cut in half within two to five years .
Andrew Simms of the New Economics Foundation offered an even simpler prescription : consume less .
It might even make us happier too .
Some of the ideas presented were so lateral that even our panel of seasoned experts looked wide - eyed at times .
An engaging Australian accountant and farmer called Tony Lovell showed photographs of arid , dust - blown landscapes alongside images of lush vegetation .
The difference ?
The farmer on the green side had been forcing his cattle to mimic the great migratory wildebeest herds of the Serengeti .
If some of the schemes outlined in Manchester would once have seemed too radical to attract serious attention from governments and money men , the presence of climate secretary Ed Miliband at the event suggested that policymakers now recognise that they must cast the net for solutions wider than in the past .
Here we lay out the best ideas that our net brought in .
Now , Mr Miliband , what will you do with them ?

PATRAS , Greece , July 13 ( UPI ) --
When Greek police bulldozed a makeshift migrant camp in the western port city of Patras Sunday , they highlighted one of the lesser known consequences of the conflict in Afghanistan .
Most of the camp dwellers were Afghans .
Many had paid several thousand dollars to people smugglers to get there .
The camp had been there for 13 years .
Recently it housed as many as 1,800 refugees waiting to be smuggled by boat to Italy .
Earlier arrests had reduced the number to about 100 when the police struck .
They flattened plastic and cardboard shelters , sparing only a temporary mosque and a tent for volunteer medical services .

Last year Greece arrested more than 146,000 illegal immigrants and 2,000 people smugglers .
Last month , in the wake of the success of the right - wing Laos Party in EU parliamentary elections , the government passed a new , tougher immigration law .
Smugglers now face five years in prison and illegal immigrants can be detained for six months before deportation .
New " reception " centers will be set up to house the illegal immigrants currently scattered around Athens .
Illegal immigration has fuelled a popular backlash in many EU countries , boosting support for right - wing parties such as the British National Party .
It has also heightened tensions between Greece and Turkey , adding to both countries ' list of mutual grievances .
Most refugees , coming from Afghanistan and also Iraq , transit Turkey on their way to the EU via Greece .
When detained they are shipped back to Turkey .
Athens and Brussels have criticized Turkey for not doing more to control illegal immigration .
Turkey has responded that it lacks the resources to do more and is suffering for what is essentially an EU problem .
EU Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot has promised Turkey financial aid to address the problem but has not yet specified the amount or when it will be delivered .
Most of the immigrants arriving illegally in Greece do not plan to stay there .
Most had hoped to get to Italy , with France and Britain being favored onward destinations .
With the destruction of the Patras camp and tighter security against people - smuggling at the port there , more are now likely to head north for the land border with Bulgaria or Macedonia .
The only hope the refugees have to live legally in the EU is to apply and be accepted for political asylum .
However , EU rules require that the application be made in the first safe port of entry .
Once an immigrant has been fingerprinted in Greece he would be sent back there if he made an asylum request in another EU country .
Currently Britain is one of the most favored destinations .
Smugglers tell refugees that the British welfare system will find them work and support them in the meantime .
As a result the northern French port town of Calais has become a magnet for refugees hoping to hide in a truck or even the trunk of a car to slip across the Channel to Britain .
Some 1,500 currently live in shanty camps around Calais much like the one at Patras .
They wash their clothes and bathe in the sea , use their surroundings for toilets and eat at local soup kitchens .
Knife fights between different ethnic groups are common .

Django Hierarchical Tree Data View
Export
The comparison sheet below compares django - mptt and django - treebeard , two Django applications that enable you to easily add support for hierarchical data store to your models .
django - treebeard has the advantage of offering multiple tree storage strategies , all neatly abstracted from using the same API .
However , I personally really prefer the approach taken by django - mptt with respect to the way it keeps track of a node 's parent : by means of a standard ForeignKey .
This is less fragile , and by its smart usage of Django signals django - mptt allows you to modify a node 's parents from anywhere ( including the admin interface ) without having to resort to a custom API call .
My conclusion : if the Nested sets / Modified Preorder approach is applicable to your use case , I would opt for django - mptt .

Google StreetView images are pretty cool , in how you can virtually spin around and see what ’s on a street in all directions .
But far cooler is a Google StreetView “ Holodeck ” simulator that Google has at its Mountain View campus .
Climb into this , and you get StreetView scenes animated , projected on screens all around you , as if you were inside the camera itself .
I first saw Holodeck back in October , and it ’s been kept pretty quiet within the company since .
But now Google has brought it out as part of its Google I /O conference today .
Think of it as CircleVision For Streetview , CircleVision being the popular Disneyland and Disneyworld rides where cameras were used to film in 360 degrees .
Images were then projected on the walls all around the audience and could produce such a sense of montion that people used handrails to keep themselves stable at times .
The StreetView simulator is designed for an audience of one .
It ’s a small circular room with a chair in the middle , with images from the Mountain View area constantly being projected .
Grab a seat , and you can watch yourself drive virtually through the area , in all directions .
It ’s pretty cool .
Google ’s well known for the many toys and attractions it has at the Googleplex , ranging from the Google Whiteboard Master Plan to the dinosaurs on campus to a replica of SpaceShipOne .
Interactively speaking , there ’s a live display of search queries shown in various lobbies and a model of the world showing in light where searches are happening .
But this is one of the coolest new attractions I ’ve seen lately .
Here are some more pictures :

CHICAGO --
As unemployment rises and discretionary income shrinks , millions fewer Americans are driving .
For commuters , that means some of the worst bottlenecks in the country are easing .
Americans drove 8.6 billion fewer miles in January and February than during the same months in 2008 , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation .
Mileage has been declining since the end of 2007 .

New Stoa is now The Stoic Registry
We are returning to our roots .
New Stoa was founded as The Stoic Registry in 1996 and continued with that name until 2009 .
On the 28th of November 2107 , the Stoic Council voted to restore the original name , The Stoic Registry , because it more accurately reflects what we are : a directory and resource for all Stoics and Stoic organizations who wish to be known and recognized .
Please use this link : thestoicregistry.org to find us .
And , remember to change your bookmark to the new URL , because the old will soon expire .
Thank you .
We look forward to hearing from you .

With the long - dated oil futures prices surging past near - term one ( contango ) , we 're back to oil being hoarded at sea in VLCC ( very large crude carrier ) tankers as traders arbitrage near - term vs. longer - term futures contracts .
But just how much oil is currently adrift as a result of such arbitrage ?
Well it seems no one really knows for sure .
Reuters : ICAP Shipping estimated 29 VLCCs were storing crude globally , rising from 24 VLCCs two weeks ago .
It estimated that 10 VLCCs were holding crude in the U.S. Gulf , 10 off the coast of Northwest Europe , seven off West Africa , one in the Mediterranean and one in the Far East .
[ FYI - Each VLCC can carry about 2 m barrels ]
Frontline ( FRO.OL ) , the world 's biggest independent oil tanker shipping group , told Reuters on Thursday around 50 VLCCs were storing crude oil , particularly in the U.S. Gulf and off Europe .
A crude oil trader at a large independent trading house estimated between 70 million and 100 million barrels of crude were stored globally .
The message is simple , expect higher oil prices as your base case .
Gibson Shipbrokers :
In terms of OPEC production and tanker demand , we could now be at a turning point .
Most commentators are suggesting that by the end of this year or the early part of next year there will be a bounce - back in the key economies and so a return to year - on - year growth in oil demand .
Current indications are for an increase in oil demand of 0.5 - 1.5 million b/d next year .
Taking the middle ground and assessing the oil supply / demand balance , this would indicate Middle East OPEC production increasing by close to 1 million b/d over the next 18 months .
The new senator from Minnesota is a comedian , writer and actor who lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and raised a lot of money from friends in Hollywood .
The departing governor of Alaska is a hockey mom from a small backwoods town who likes to hunt and fish .
Yet today , Al Franken looks wholesomely mainstream , while Sarah Palin seems headed for the tabloid fringe .
That unexpected contrast reveals much about the current configuration of Republicans , Democrats and politics in America — a story of two parties that crossed paths while traveling in opposite directions over the past dozen years or so .
Before he entered politics , Franken had a long and highly successful career in television , wielding a sense of humor that could be wicked , outrageous and even offensive .
He was an urban denizen with liberal sensibilities who counted professional wrestlers , college professors , scruffy journalists ( including this one ) and members of the Grateful Dead among his friends .
Even after he signed on as the star host of the progressive Air America radio network , he was primarily an entertainer .
Back around the time that Franken quit “ Saturday Night Live ” for the second time , Sarah Palin entered public life as a civic activist and candidate for local office in Wasilla , Alaska , where she was soon elected mayor .
She was a populist of the right - wing variety , a fundamentalist churchgoer and a scourge of politics - as - usual .
Concerning herself with such conservative staples as government spending , tax cuts , term limits and gun rights , she was a textbook Republican officeholder .
But somewhere along the line , everything changed for both them and their parties .
Franken left showbiz behind to prove himself a serious policy wonk as well as a devoted family man ; Palin transformed herself and her family into a reality television show .
The entertainer became a public servant — and the public servant became entertainment .
How this all came to pass is a complicated story that actually begins long before the political decisions that led to his rise and her fall .
The bookish , wise - guy Al always had a political streak dating back to his college years at Harvard , where he switched from mathematics to political science and graduated with honors .
The telegenic , athletic “ Sarah Barracuda ” embarked on a career as a TV sportscaster in Alaska ’s biggest city before eloping with Todd and moving home to Wasilla .
The reversal of the parties ’ trajectories , in style and substance , may have begun during the 2002 election , a stunning midterm defeat for the Democratic opposition that Republican strategist Karl Rove predicted to be the start of decades of unchallenged rule for GOP conservatism .
That was also the moment when Paul Wellstone , the Democratic senator from Minnesota who had become a national icon of progressive politics , died in a terrible plane crash along with his wife , Sheila , his daughter Marcia and three aides , as he was campaigning for re-election .
In the bitter aftermath of his death , turncoat Democrat Norm Coleman won a special election to succeed Wellstone , and joined the Republican majority in the Senate .
And Franken , a Minnesota native , began to think about whether he might someday run for that same seat to vindicate the legacy of Wellstone , one of his closest friends .
In victory , the Republicans grew increasingly extreme and overconfident , encouraging figures such as Palin to follow their most extreme instincts .
In defeat , the Democrats at last began to refurbish their progressive ideology , reconnect with working American families and rediscover their will to fight .
As an author and radio personality , Franken made a significant contribution to his party ’s renewal .
He was ready for prime - time politics in ways that Palin , the sudden star who could barely utter a coherent paragraph , was not .
Beneath the glittering surface , she exhibited profound weakness .
Behind the joking persona , he showed moral and intellectual strength .
Joe Conason writes for The New York Observer .
The chargesheet submitted in the Chief Judicial Magistrate court in Ernakulam on Friday names Fr Thomas Kottoor as first accused , Fr Jose Puthrukayil as second accused and Sister Sephy as third accused .
The name of fourth accused V V Augustine , a former assistant sub- inspector attached to the Kottayam West police station , has not been included in the list of accused as he had committed suicide .
Charges of murder and destruction of evidence have been slapped against the three main accused .
The CBI case is that Abhaya came down to the kitchen of the convent in the wee hours of March 27 , 1992 when she saw the three accused having sex .
The trio confronted her and one of them struck her with a hand - held axe on the head .
Later , the three of them threw her body into the well .
The CBI now says that Abhaya may have drowned in the well and died .
The chargesheet would be revised after incorporating evidence received from the narco analysis to be done on three more persons .
Legends of Valour
" This game is better than Ultima Underworld ! "
With these words , SSI advertised Legends Of Valour .
How did they reach that conclusion ?
I guess it 's better not to think about it , because this game is far from being even acceptable .
But let 's go through it step - by - step .
The Story
You start as a human , dwarf , or gnome ( your choice ) in a strange city called Mittledorf .
You 're there to meet your cousin , who told you about the great life he was having there .
But unfortunately , he does n't show up , so it seems that you have to live on your own , until ... you become too bored and finish the game .
The Gameplay
The first thing you have to do is to choose your race .
A funny thing , since it has no apparent function - all your stats are the same ; only your appearance changes .
So why choose a race , anyway ?
I 'm still searching for the answer .
Next you 're in your hometown , where you can choose your starting equipment , such as armor , shield , and sword .
Unfortunately , there are no indicators as to how strong a weapon or piece of armor is ; you can only guess by the price , and I 'm not sure if that 's really proportional to its strength .
Next stop : the city !
Once you 're there , you can walk around in real time using your mouse and / or keyboard .
Small buttons at the bottom of the screen can be clicked to operate some functions , like talking to citizens , hurling insults at them , etc .
The managing of the ( far too small ) inventory is also done on the main screen , which remains the only one you 'll see .
The fights are as far from RPG fights as you can get .
Whether you win or lose depends only on how often you can click in a short time , and some luck does n't hurt .
The funny ( or should I say ridiculous ? ) thing is that monsters which wander in your vicinity usually do n't attack you if you do n't walk into them , whereas citizens do it quite often and without any reason .
Of course , you need water and food to live , but once more this game failed to balance the values properly .
Your character needs to drink and eat too often , which quickly becomes very annoying .
Graphics and Sound
LoV does n't really look like a game from 1993 .
Even in 1990 it would have been only average .
Only the introduction contains rendered videos , but without any sense or connection to the game .
While moving through the city , you will recognize mostly one thing : void .
There are no trees or bushes , only some torches standing around .
And in rooms , the only thing to discover are tables ( sometimes certain items lie on them ) .
The NPCs are very ugly and pixelated , too , especially up close .
I do n't know if there is any sound in the game .
I could n't hear anything in Windows and was n't able to start it with DOSBox , but it 's very unlikely that it revolutionized sound in games ( sad but true ) .
Conclusion
Did the developers do anything right in this game ?
If so , I did n't find it .
The idea was surely not bad , but the game was released half - cooked .
With a little re-programming it could have been good , perhaps very good .
Bad luck .
If you still want to download this game , do it - you do n't deserve anything else .
Buddhism , economics and management are all interconnected .
The Dalai Lama believes the financial crisis is a moral crisis .
He says he is a Marxist monk , yet still the Dalai Lama does n’t see an alternative for a free market economy or wealth .
A contradiction ?
Jörg Eigendorf spoke with the Tibetan spiritual leader in his Indian exile .
Anzeige
Getting to the Dalai Lama is a long and treacherous journey .
The religious leader and Tibet ’s head of state lives in exile at the foot of the Himalayas , two hours north of New Dehli by airplane .
Here in Dharamshala his residence lies on an idyllic hill , right next to a Buddhist temple .
Those who want to get to him must go through strict controls performed by both Indian as well as Tibetan security guards .
Even bare fingers are patted down .
Fears over His Holiness are great .
On one hand , the over 50 - year - old non-violent fight for the autonomy of the Tibetan state has made the Nobel Peace Prize winner an international superstar .
On the other hand , the Chinese have seen him as their archenemy since 1959 .
But for years now the monk has shifted his focus from solely the Tibetan question and the fight against violence and has engaged himself in matters of the global economy and the challenge of how wealth can be distributed more fairly .
Shortly before his trip to Germany at the end of July the Dalai Lama warns not only against greed , but also against having too much faith in the state .
Anzeige
WELT ONLINE : Your Holiness , for the Tibetans you are a divine king and you have many followers in the western world who idolize you .
Do you have any weaknesses ?
Dalai Lama : ( laughs )
Yes , I am lazy .
Of course I wake up every morning at 3:30 am and do some excercises , mediate , eat breakfast and meditate again .
This goes on for four or five hours .
In the spiritual regard I am not lazy .
But when I sit in an airplane I always see people reading , writing or working on their computers , preparing presentations .
I never do that – no homework , no preparations .
These are signs of my laziness .
WELT ONLINE : Does it bother you ?
Anzeige
Dalai Lama :
No , because when I prepare for something to intensely I always feel like it is too fake .
I feel much better when I am spontaneous , because it comes from the heart .
WELT ONLINE : Can you imagine how long I spent preparing for this interview ?
Dalai Lama : ( laughs again )
You are German , so everything has to be precise .
Besides , your questions have to be interesting .
If I had to be the one asking questions , I would prepare for it too .
But I just need to answer your questions , and if I do n’t know an answer , I will just tell you .
Anzeige
WELT ONLINE : Ok , how will we solve the financial crisis in the short - term ?
Dalai Lama :
See , this is one of those questions – I do n’t know .
The politicians must decide this .
I am no expert in regards to solving a severe crisis .
The same goes for violence and terrorism .
In the short - term governments will have to act to prevent from endangering its citizens , which is the right thing to do .
But with all the short - term actions we are taking , we should n’t forget the root cause of the problem .
WELT ONLINE : What , in your opinion , is the root cause of the financial crisis ?
Dalai Lama : Greed and gambling .
Many people and companies only have one goal : money , money , and more money .
Greed is ok when you let others profit from it , but greed for oneself is bad , it makes you ill .
The egotistical ambition to always want to earn more money harms both the company and the individual himself .
That is the biggest weakness of many managers – the financial crisis has proven this .
WELT ONLINE :
So it ’s ok for someone to earn a lot as long as they share ?
Dalai Lama :
Wealth is not necessarily a bad thing when it has been earned in an honest manner and neither other individuals nor the environment suffered for it .
As Buddhists we recognize that wealth is a basic prerequisite for a happy life .
But a billionaire also only has ten fingers .
He can fit three or four rings on each finger , but that would look weird .
The satisfaction many millionaires who do n’t share their wealth have in their heads is fictitious and not real .
Rich people should help reduce poverty .
Anzeige
WELT ONLINE : Some managers earn 10 , 20 or even 30 million euros per year .
You really do n’t have a problem with this ?
Dalai Lama : Just like in the music industry or sports there are exceptions .
They can earn as much as they want , as long as it remains transparent and traceable why they earn so much money .
Unfortunately there are only few such people .
It is , however , unacceptable if a chief executive continues to increase his wealth while the company is sliding into bankruptcy , the shareholders lose their savings and the employees lose their jobs or do n’t earn enough to afford a decent standard of living .
WELT ONLINE : Let ’s assume a chief executive discovers that he can develop a software in India for a tenth of the price it would cost in Germany .
In order to do so , he must cut 1,000 jobs in Germany and create new ones in India .
The owners of the company are pushing him to do this .
What should the manager do ?
Dalai Lama :
The manager should consider the situation from all possible angles – the shareholders , the employees , the clients and society .
Yes , even global society .
A good manager must have a clear image of the problem .
This sounds self - evident , but it does n’t happen that often .
Most of the time it is about maximizing profits .
WELT ONLINE : Companies ca n’t survive without profits .
Dalai Lama :
Yes , but companies are living , complex organisms and not profit machines .
The profit should therefore not be the object of a company , but rather a result of good work .
Just like a person can’t survive for long without food and water , a company ca n’t survive without profits .
Not that I would ever reduce the purpose of a human to that , as eating and drinking are the only prerequisites for a meaningful life .
WELT ONLINE : How do you feel about western companies investing in low - cost countries ?
Is that exploitation or does it help the national economy of these countries to close the gap with industrialized nations ?
Dalai Lama :
It depends on the investor ’s incentive .
I do n’t think that many of the companies to invest in Indian or Chinese businesses are really interested in the Indian and Chinese people ’s well - being .
Quite often the interest lies in exploiting cheap labor , which I disapprove of .
Yet if a company has a moral responsibility to improve the quality of life and to help China as a whole , then it is fine to profit from cheap labor .
Global businesses can help China to become more democratic , help it to achieve an independent legal system and help to ensure a freedom of the press .
Anzeige
WELT ONLINE :
You wo n’t make many friends among those against globalization with your argument .
Dalai Lama : I am essentially a supporter of globalization .
In the past societies and countries could seal themselves off from the rest of the world , but today this has become impossible .
When we search for organizations that have the capacity and ability to improve our world , global companies are at the top of the list .
In particular integrated global corporations are in an ideal position to support developing countries to close the gap to leading national economies .
WELT ONLINE : Do you not have sympathy for anti-globalists ?
Dalai Lama : I do when they remind leaders and companies that it is about more than just making profits .
At the same time the growing opposition to globalization is dependent on our reluctance to accept the principle that everything is perishable : Meaning , the fact that everything is subject to permanent change .
For Buddhists this is one of the basic pieces of wisdom that one must accept .
WELT ONLINE :
These liberal attitudes do n’t really fit to someone who once called himself a Marxist monk .
Do you still see yourself as one ?
Dalai Lama :
Yes , I still believe I am a Marxist monk .
I do n’t see a contradiction here either .
In the Marxist theory the focus lies on the just allocation of wealth .
From a moral perspective this is a correct claim .
Capitalism , on the other hand , values the accruement of wealth – the allocation of it does n’t matter here initially .
In a worst case scenario the rich will keep getting richer while the poor keep getting poorer .
Anzeige
WELT ONLINE :
Why is it then that you are so against communism and socialism ?
Dalai Lama : Communism ?
What is communism ?
Is China a communist country ?
( He laughs out loud ) .
I am confused .
The Chinese communists are communists without a communist ideology .
But if you mean socialism , like it first existed in the Eastern Block and now in North Korea and Cuba , I believe it goes against human nature ; it destroys creativity .
It is not enough for people to have just enough to eat , clothes and a roof over their heads .
We need to self - actualize ourselves .
Buddha encouraged entrepreneurs to become successful through dependability and sales skills .
Those who are successful can help others .
WELT ONLINE :
Yet you used to be a long - time admirer of Mao Zedong .
How could you be so wrong ?
Dalai Lama : I am still convinced that Mao Zedong was a Marxist , who wanted to help workers and farmers , in his early years up until the mid-1950s .
In the mid-1950s I spent six months in Beijing and another four months in many other parts of China .
The party leaders , to me , seemed really dedicated to their cause .
WELT ONLINE : What impressed you about Mao ?
Dalai Lama :
He always looked like a farmer – his clothes were old and ruined .
And when he spoke , he did so very slowly , so every word had an importance .
He never beat around the bush , never said niceties ; he always came straight to the point .
All of his party members that I met back then were like that , which impressed me .
WELT ONLINE : How did Mao fail , in your opinion ?
Dalai Lama :
Mao once told that the communist party must endure criticism , and that self - criticism was very important .
Without criticism every system of power is like a fish without water .
But then , in 1957 , suddenly all party officials who dared to criticize were eliminated .
That was the end of Maoism .
The system failed because of its own arrogance and a lack of self - discipline .
The abolishment of private property led to many belongings ending up in the hands of a state that devolved into a party elite which exerted an authoritarian reign – much like aristocrats of the past .
WELT ONLINE :
What role does the state play for you in the economy ?
Dalai Lama :
That is a very hard question .
I do n’t think that equality can be established on a national level .
Nations can cause a lot of damage .
This is why I warn against expecting too much from governments when it comes to the redistribution or regulation of the financial markets .
People will always find ways around rules and laws – even if they are the best rules or laws .
Or do you think it was the lack of regulations that lead to this financial crisis ?
The rules in the United States were good ; but responsible action demands more than law - abidance .
WELT ONLINE :
In your opinion the free market is n’t performing well , and you also do n’t believe in regulation .
So what it is that we need ?
Dalai Lama : I call it a " responsible free market economy ” .
In the end it comes down to every single individual ; it is dependent on each individual ’s sense of moral responsibility , self - discipline , and values .
This financial crisis is n’t purely a crisis of the market economy , but rather a crisis of values .
WELT ONLINE : Alright , so the first thing we must do is send all government leaders and chief executives of large companies to Buddhist convents so that they may learn self - discipline and gain some morals .
Dalai Lama : ( laughs ) :
Three - week seminars in our convents wo n’t achieve much .
It would be like laying a piece of ice on a rock – a little while later the rock would be wet , but nothing more .
The rock will still be there .
No , it ’s unrealistic to expect a rapid systematic change in the global economy .
The changes need to happen within each individual person and within the companies .
This is dependent on the efforts we make in people ’s education ; this is about beginning in Kindergarten and not about a few weeks ’ worth of discussions .
WELT ONLINE :
So what you are saying is that not only mathematics , history and languages need to be focused on in school , but that morality , ethics and religion need to be taught in a much greater scope .
Dalai Lama : History , math , languages and economics – these are all subjects for the brain .
But responsibility – moral responsibilities , responsibilities regarding society – these are things that come from the heart .
This , combined with the power of the brain , is what governments and large companies need .
I will give you an example : we Tibetans believe that our national issue with China can only be resolved non-violently .
This is what we preach from Kindergarten onwards throughout the entire education of an individual .
When a Tibetan is confronted with a conflict , his reaction should immediately be : “ How can I resolve this in dialogue ? ”
It is important to us that young people in our schools understand that violence is the wrong way , that violence cannot solve problems .
This attitude has become a part of many Tibetan ’s lives through education and training .
The same needs to occur in regards to economy and justice .
WELT ONLINE : How many decades or centuries will it take until we are really ready for a “ responsible free market economy ” ?
Dalai Lama :
This financial and economic crisis will help it to happen faster , because those people who only think about money – even dream about it – are affected the most by it .
The crisis is terrible for many people , but it also shows the value of money is limited and the insecurity is huge .
Inner values like friendship , trust , honesty and compassion are much more reliable than money – they always bring happiness and strength .
WELT ONLINE :
But only few people are promoted because they value friendship , trust and compassion .
Is n’t your approach a little idealistic ?
Dalai Lama :
What you are saying is one of the greatest contradictions .
Those who assert themselves often have very little morale , and those who have a good sense of morale often do n’t know how to assert themselves .
This problem , by the way , is much larger in socialism than in economics .
Often times the incompetent were leaders and governed and constricted the competent .
We saw what happens then .
A company that behaves the same way will fail because it wastes so much potential and will never develop its own values .
WELT ONLINE : Every good CEO has prerequisites for a suitable successor , yet finding your successor is much more complicated and extensive .
Do you worry about it ?
Dalai Lama :
No , it ’s not so difficult .
As a simple monk I do n’t need a successor when I die .
And in regards to the role of the Dalai Lama as a government leader : I ceded all of my governmental responsibilities eight years ago – we have an elected government , so this is also not a problem .
This leaves the question of a successor of the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader .
In 1969 I said the Tibetans need to decide themselves whether there will be a 15th Dalai Lama .
I gave suggestions , but I cannot and do not want to get more involved than that .
WELT ONLINE : Can you understand that leaders all over the world would like to meet with you – but do n’t – in order to prevent endangering their economic relations with China ?
Dalai Lama : I think it is fine when a politician weighs all of the options and comes to the decision that abides by the nation ’s interest .
However , many politicians make it too easy for themselves – for them it is only about their own companies earning as much money as possible .
Is this a terrible problem for me ?
Not really .
My main interest is to promote human values like harmony , responsibility and charity .
To do so I need to speak with people , not their leaders .
If a government leader wants to meet with me for spiritual reasons , I ’d be glad to meet with them .
If they do n’t , then they do n’t , and there is no problem with that .
I do n’t travel the world only for my people and the question of Tibet ’s future – I want to reach as many people as I can .
WELT ONLINE : Will this century be marked by China ’s ascent ?
Dalai Lama : China has developed enormous power .
It is the evidence for how well an economy can develop better under more freedom on a corporate level .
What China is missing , however , are values its society can rely on .
The standards that were relevant before the communist revolution are long gone .
And what has taken their place ?
Nothing but money .
The communist elite only think about power and money , and this can be very destructive .
WELT ONLINE : Religion , states and economy have grown increasingly apart .
Do you really believe that religious leaders such as yourself and the pope can change the world for the better ?
Dalai Lama : I do not travel the world as a religious leader .
I am a simple person , a simple monk .
Sure I have more opportunities because I am welcomed as the Dalai Lama and because I have gathered a lot of experience in my 50 years of living in exile .
These are experiences I can share with people .
But the moral principles we are talking about here give me an inner strength , and inner strength gives me inner peace .
This is how I hope to reach out to people .
WELT ONLINE : How do you feel about staying in five - star hotels when you travel abroad ?
Dalai Lama :
To be honest , I do n’t feel comfortable in large hotel rooms .
Sometimes I think there could be a ghost in the room ( laughs ) .
This is why I always ask to be accommodated humbly and simply .
I like places I stay in to be modern , clean and comfortable .
But most of the time I cannot influence where I stay .
WELT ONLINE : Do n’t you get a guilty conscience when you stay in luxury accommodations ?
Dalai Lama :
Why should I ?
When feel good , I can do more for others .
But of course it hurts me when I see poor people .
Once when I was going to bed in Vienna I saw a man lying on the street outside , and when I woke up in the morning he was still there .
I sent him fruits and bread ; even though I know it will only temporarily ease his agony .
WELT ONLINE :
When was the last time you were unfair or unjust ?
Dalai Lama : ( thinks ) : Sometimes I lose my patience , but then I apologize .
It happens sometimes .
WELT ONLINE :
You have written books about how damaging anger is , and still you get angry sometimes ?
Dalai Lama :
Of course .
It is not about eliminating anger , but rather finding the cause for it and working against it .
If you do not understand where the anger comes from and do n’t work against it , the anger will grow .
Anger is a destructive emotion which is based on arrogance .
This is why one must find the cause and counteract it .
WELT ONLINE :
You possess neither a credit card nor a bank account .
Are there any objects that you really need , ones that you ca n’t live without ?
Like for example your home exercise equipment ?
Dalai Lama :
No , there is nothing I ca n’t live without .
I learned this attitude when I was a child .

GREAT GRAINS
" Grains are good for you – they provide a mix of carbohydrate , protein and fat and plenty of fiber .
Experiment with exotic varieties of rice – red and black are beautiful and delicious -- and discover the distinctive flavors and textures of buckwheat groats ( kasha ) and quinoa , grain - like seeds from Eastern Europe and South America . "
I disagree .
I stopped grains completely and noticed my memory became sharper .
I believe there is a relationship between grain consumption , addictions , and Alzheimers disease .

Thyroid function and grains .
E-mail to Mike from Dr. Graham .
Basically , when grains ferment , ( something that almost always happens when they are consumed , to some degree ) acetic acid is formed .
This stimulates the adrenals , and eventually the thyroid into hyperactivity .
What goes up must come down , so the short term hyperthyroidism is followed by long term hypothyroidism , as per the Law of Dual Effect .
" I am sensitive to gluten , which is found in wheat .
What grains are safe for me to eat ? "
A : You can eat brown rice , corn , wild rice and buckwheat ( also called kasha ) , all of which are easy to find .
Less common grains that also are fine -- but you may have to hunt a bit for them - are amaranth , millet and quinoa .
Caution :
If you have a gluten sensitivity , it is not enough to avoid wheat .
You also must stay away from products containing rye , barley and spelt .
Gluten can cause digestive problems in people who are sensitive to it .
Find out why this is so and why Dr. Graham takes an even harder line against ANY grain consumption .

In the fourth of a series of articles marking the outbreak of World War II 70 years ago , the BBC Russian Service 's Artyom Krechetnikov assesses Soviet leader Joseph Stalin 's motivations behind the 1939 Soviet - Nazi pact .
Stalin felt a German defeat would delay the global spread of Communism Soviet government documents released since the USSR 's collapse give us a clear idea of what drove Stalin 's thinking in concluding the non-aggression treaty - the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact - with Nazi Germany .
On 19 August 1939 , just days before the agreement was signed in Moscow , in a speech to a hastily - convened session of the Politburo , Stalin said the " question of war and peace is entering a decisive phase " .
He predicted that the outcome would depend entirely on whichever strategic position the USSR decided to adopt .
Should the Soviet Union form an alliance with France and Britain , he opined , Germany would be forced to abandon its territorial demands on Poland .
This , Stalin suggested , would avoid the threat of imminent war , but it would make " the subsequent development of events dangerous for the Soviet Union " .
Our aim is to ensure Germany can continue to fight for as long as possible , in order to exhaust and ruin England and France
Joseph Stalin in 1939
Should the USSR sign a treaty with Germany , Stalin suggested , Berlin would " undoubtedly attack Poland , leading to a war with the inevitable involvement of France and England " .
Looking ahead , Stalin suggested that " under these circumstances , we , finding ourselves in a beneficial situation , can simply await our turn [ to extract maximum advantage ] " .
What is clear is that Stalin not only appeared unconcerned about the prospect of an attack from Nazi Germany , he actually considered such an attack impossible .
" Our aim is to ensure Germany can continue to fight for as long as possible , in order to exhaust and ruin England and France , " he said .
" They must not be in a condition to rout Germany .
" Our position is thus clear remaining neutral , we aid Germany economically , with raw materials and foodstuffs .
It is important for us that the war continues as long as possible , in order that both sides exhaust their forces . "
Criticism
Many western historians believe that the Anglo - French security guarantees given to Poland effectively turned Stalin into the arbiter of Europe .
On 3 May 1939 , Stalin replaced the pro-Western , Jewish Foreign Minister Litvinov , with Vyacheslav Molotov .
It was a strong signal that he wanted to improve relations with the Nazis .
Pact that set the scene for war Viewpoint :
The Nazi-Soviet Pact Media build up to World War II Official Russian history asserts that Stalin believed that Germany , even if it were to emerge from war as a victor , would be so exhausted that it would be unable to wage war with the USSR for at least a decade .
The Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact drew unequivocal criticism from Communists outside the USSR .
Stalin invited the head of the Comintern , the international Communist organisation founded in Moscow , to explain his thinking .
" Hitler does not understand or want this , but he is undermining the capitalist system , " he said .
" What we can do is manoeuvre around the two sides , push one of the sides to attack the other . "
In a written note to foreign Communist parties , Stalin asserted : " The salvation of English - French imperialism would be a violation of Communist principles .
These principles in no way exclude a temporary agreement with our common enemy , Fascism . "
So was there an alternative ?
In the spring and summer of 1939 , Stalin could have forged an alliance with Western democracies .
Such a move may have prevented a world war , with Europe 's borders remaining unchanged .
The problem with this , for Stalin , was that it would have delayed what he viewed as the " final global victory of Communism " for an indeterminable period .
Stalin 's actions and deeds made it clear that he could not conceive a protracted period of " peaceful co-existence " , the notion that came to determine the Soviet Union 's policy towards the capitalist world after Stalin 's death .
Stalin and Hitler were united by their desire to destroy the old world order , and to rebuild it as they wanted .
Arguably , this made Soviet - Nazi friendship as inevitable as was its rapid , explosive end .

The Wikimedia Foundation has finally released a Wikipedia standalone app for the iPhone and iPod touch .
Distributed for free via the iTunes App Store , Wikipedia Mobile is described as focusing on simplicity and speed .
While Wikipedia Mobile is , indeed , simple and easy to use , the app does n’t award the latter account .
Not in this initial release , anyway .
Wikipedia Mobile does look like it ’s tailored for the iPhone , but the Wikipedia.org website is almost just as optimized for the Apple device , and it ’s considerably faster than the new application .
With Wikipedia Mobile , loading a term like “ Apple Inc. ” can take up to 13 seconds over a strong Wi -Fi connection , while some portions of the page ( statistic tables , or other wide - oriented objects ) may not be displayed properly .
Optimizations for the device are observable on the formatting front , with sub-categories like “ history , ” “ culture , ” “ criticism ” and “ references ” appearing as buttons , in order to save memory .
The touchscreen response ( scrolling ) is fast , I ’ll give it that , but zooming and other multi - touch features are not enabled .
No suggestions are offered either , when doing a search – a crucial feature for search - based apps .
The iPhone OS , however , will suggest correcting the term “ Apple inc ” with “ Apple Inc . ”
Also , the forward arrow does n’t work ( at least not on my phone ) .
But , despite its sluggish performance and lack of a Bookmarks feature , Wikipedia Mobile is convenient and useful , if only just for that daily featured article .
Today ’s topic , for instance , was the Emperor Penguin , which I have learned is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species .
OK , so today ’s topic was not all that fascinating , but I ’ve made my a point .
Also , if Wikipedia Mobile ’s developers come across this review , I ’d like to make a suggestion – a little color here and there would n’t kill anyone .
I get that Wikipedia is white - themed so we can focus on the text and all that , but , as an iPhone app , it would be a heck of a lot more attractive sporting some faint - colored backgrounds , buttons , etc .
Just a thought .

The Anti-Empire Report
If you catch the CIA with its hand in the cookie jar and the Agency admits the obvious — what your eyes can plainly see — that its hand is indeed in the cookie jar , it means one of two things : a ) the CIA ’s hand is in several other cookie jars at the same time which you do n’t know about and they hope that by confessing to the one instance they can keep the others covered up ; or b ) its hand is not really in the cookie jar — it ’s an illusion to throw you off the right scent — but they want you to believe it .
There have been numerous news stories in recent months about secret CIA programs , hidden from Congress , inspired by former vice - president Dick Cheney , in operation since the September 11 terrorist attacks , involving assassination of al Qaeda operatives or other non-believers - in - the - Empire abroad without the knowledge of their governments .
The Agency admits to some sort of program having existed , but insists that it was canceled ; and if it was an assassination program it was canceled before anyone was actually assassinated .
Another report has the US military , not the CIA , putting the plan — or was it a different plan ? — into operation , carrying out several assassinations including one in Kenya that proved to be a severe embarrassment and helped lead to the quashing of the program .
All of this can be confusing to those following the news .
And rather irrelevant .
We already know that the United States has been assassinating non-believers , or suspected non-believers , with regularity , and impunity , in recent years , using unmanned planes ( drones ) firing missiles , in Yemen , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Somalia , if not elsewhere .
( Even more victims have been produced from amongst those who happened to be in the same house , car , wedding party , or funeral as the non-believer . )
These murders apparently do n’t qualify as “ assassinations ” , for somehow killing “ terrorists ” from 2000 feet is morally and legally superior to doing so from two feet away .
But whatever the real story is behind the current rash of speculation , we should not fall into the media ’s practice of at times intimating that multiple or routine CIA assassination attempts would be something shocking or at least very unusual .
I ’ve compiled a list of CIA assassination attempts , successful and unsuccessful , against prominent foreign political figures , from 1949 through 2003 , which , depending on how you count it , can run into the hundreds ( targeting Fidel Castro alone totals 634 according to Cuban intelligence ) ; ) the list can be updated by adding the allegedly al Qaeda leaders among the drone attack victims of recent years .
Assassination and torture are the two things governments are most loath to admit to and try their best to cover up .
It ’s thus rare to find a government document or recorded statement mentioning a particular plan to assassinate someone .
There is , however , an abundance of compelling circumstantial evidence to work with .
The list can be found here .
For those of you who collect lists about splendid US foreign policy post - World War II , here are a few more that , lacking anything better to do , I ’ve put together : Attempts to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments , most of which had been democratically - elected .
After his June 4 Cairo speech , President Obama was much praised for mentioning the 1953 CIA overthrow of Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mossadegh .
But in his talk in Ghana on July 11 he failed to mention the CIA coup that ousted Ghanian president Kwame Nkrumah in 1966 , referring to him only as a “ giant ” among African leaders .
The Mossadegh coup is one of the most well - known CIA covert actions .
Obama could not easily get away without mentioning it in a talk in the Middle East looking to mend fences .
But the Nkrumah ouster is one of the least known ; indeed , not a single print or broadcast news report in the American mainstream media saw fit to mention it at the time of the president ’s talk .
Like it never happened .
And the next time you hear that Africa can’t produce good leaders , people who are committed to the welfare of the masses of their people , think of Nkrumah and his fate .
And think of Patrice Lumumba , overthrown in the Congo 1960 - 61 with the help of the United States ; Agostinho Neto of Angola , against whom Washington waged war in the 1970s , making it impossible for him to institute progressive changes ; Samora Machel of Mozambique against whom the CIA supported a counter - revolution in the 1970s - 80s period ; and Nelson Mandela of South Africa ( now married to Machel ’s widow ) , who spent 28 years in prison thanks to the CIA .
The Myths of Afghanistan , past and present
On the Fourth of July , Senator Patrick Leahy declared he was optimistic that , unlike the Soviet forces that were driven from Afghanistan 20 years ago , US forces could succeed there .
The Democrat from Vermont stated :
The Russians were sent running as they should have been .
We helped send them running .
But they were there to conquer the country .
We ’ve made it very clear , and everybody I talk to within Afghanistan feels the same way : they know we ’re there to help and we ’re going to leave .
We ’ve made it very clear we are going to leave .
And it ’s going to be turned back to them .
The ones that made the mistakes in the past are those that tried to conquer them .
Leahy is a long - time liberal on foreign - policy issues , a champion of withholding US counter - narcotics assistance to foreign military units guilty of serious human - rights violations , and an outspoken critic of robbing terrorist suspects of their human and legal rights .
Yet he is willing to send countless young Americans to a living hell , or horrible death , or maimed survival .
And for what ?
Every point he made in his statement is simply wrong .
The Russians were not in Afghanistan to conquer it .
The Soviet Union had existed next door to the country for more than 60 years without any kind of invasion .
It was only when the United States intervened in Afghanistan to replace a government friendly to Moscow with one militantly anti-communist that the Russians invaded to do battle with the US - supported Islamic jihadists ; precisely what the United States would have done to prevent a communist government in Canada or Mexico .
It ’s also rather difficult for the United States to claim that it ’s in Afghanistan to help the people there when it ’s killed tens of thousands of simply for resisting the American invasion and occupation or for being in the wrong place at the wrong time ; not a single one of the victims has been identified as having had any kind of connection to the terrorist attack in the US of September 11 , 2001 , the event usually cited by Washington as justification for the military intervention .
Moreover , Afghanistan is now permeated with depleted uranium , cluster bombs - cum - landmines , white phosphorous , a witch ’s brew of other charming chemicals , and a population , after 30 years of almost non-stop warfare , of physically and mentally mutilated human beings , exceedingly susceptible to the promise of paradise , or at least relief , sold by the Taliban .
As to the US leaving … utterly meaningless propaganda until it happens .
Ask the people of South Korea — 56 years of American occupation and still counting ; ask the people of Japan — 64 years .
And Iraq ?
Would you want to wager your life ’s savings on which decade it will be that the last American soldier and military contractor leaves ?
It ’s not even precise to say that the Russians were sent running .
That was essentially Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev ’s decision , and it was more of a political decision than a military one .
Gorbachev ’s fondest ambition was to turn the Soviet Union into a West - European style social democracy , and he fervently wished for the approval of those European leaders , virtually all of whom were cold - war anti-communists and opposed the Soviet intervention into Afghanistan .
There has been as much of the same “ causes ” for wars that did not happen as for wars that did .
Henry Allingham died in Britain on July 18 at age 113 , believed to have been the world ’s oldest man .
A veteran of World War I , he spent his final years reminding the British people about their service members killed during the war , which came to about a million : “ I want everyone to know , ” he said during an interview in November .
“ They died for us . ”
The whole million ?
Each one died for Britain ?
In the most useless imperialist war of the 20th century ?
No , let me correct that — the most useless imperialist war of any century .
The British Empire , the French Empire , the Russian Empire , and the wannabe American Empire joined in battle against the Austro - Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire as youthful bodies and spirits sank endlessly into the wretched mud of Belgium and Germany , the pools of blood of Russia and France .
The wondrous nobility of it all is enough to make you swallow hard , fight back the tears , light a few candles , and throw up .
Imagine , by the middle of this century Vietnam veterans in their 90s and 100s will be speaking of how each of their 58,000 war buddies died for America .
By 2075 we ’ll be hearing the same stirring message from ancient vets of Iraq and Afghanistan .
How many will remember that there was a large protest movement against their glorious , holy crusades , particularly Vietnam and Iraq ?
Supreme nonsense
Senate hearings to question a nominee for the Supreme Court are a supreme bore .
The sine qua non for President Obama choosing Sonia Sotomayor appears to be that she ’s a woman with a Hispanic background .
A LATINA !
How often that word was used by her supporters .
She would be the first LATINA on the Supreme Court !
Dios mio !
Who gives a damn ?
All anyone should care about are her social and political opinions .
Justice Clarence Thomas is a black man .
A BLACK MAN !
And he ’s as conservative as they come .
Supreme Court nominees , of all political stripes , typically feel obliged to pretend that their social and political leanings do n’t enter into their judicial opinions .
But everyone knows this is rubbish .
During her Senate hearing , Sotomayor declared : “ It ’s not the heart that compels conclusions in cases .
It ’s the law . ”
The former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , Charles Evan Hughes , would not agree with her .
“ At the constitutional level where we work , ” he said , “ ninety percent of any decision is emotional .
The rational part of us supplies the reasons for supporting our predilections . ”
By Sotomayor ’s own account , which echos news reports , she was not asked about her position on abortion by either President Obama or his staff .
But what if she is actually anti-abortion ?
What if she turns out to be the swing vote that overturns Roe vs. Wade ?
What if she ’s a proud admirer of the American Empire and its perpetual wars ?
American dissidents , civilian and military , may depend on her vote for their freedom from imprisonment .
What does she think about the “ war on terror ” ?
The civil liberties and freedom from torture of various Americans and foreigners may depend on her attitude .
In his 2007 trial , Jose Padilla , an American citizen , was found guilty of aiding terrorists .
“ The jury did seem to be an oddly cohesive group , ” the Washington Post reported .
“ On the last day of trial before the Fourth of July holiday , jurors arranged to dress in outfits so that each row in the jury box was its own patriotic color — red , white or blue . ”
No one dared to question this blatant display of patriotism in the courtroom ; neither the defense attorney , nor the prosecutor , nor the judge .
How can we continue to pretend that people ’s legal positions exist independently of their political sentiments ?
In the 2000 Supreme Court decision stopping the presidential electoral count in Florida , giving the election to George W. Bush , did the politics of the five most conservative justices play a role in the 5 to 4 decision ?
Of course .
Judges are essentially politicians in black robes .
But should we care ?
Do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
Sonia Sotomayor is a LATINA !
Given the large Democratic majority in the Senate , Sotomayor was in very little danger of being rejected .
She could have openly and proudly expressed her social and political positions — whatever they may be — and the Democratic senators could have done the same .
How refreshing , maybe even educational if a discussion ensued .
Instead it was just another political appointment by a president determined to not offend anyone if he can help it , and another tiresome ritual hearing .
The Republican senators were much less shy about revealing how they actually felt about important issues .
It did n’t have to be that way .
As Rabbi Michael Lerner of Tikkun.org pointed out during the hearings : “ Democratic Senators could use their time to ask questions and make statements that explain why a liberal or progressive worldview is precisely what is needed on the Supreme Court . ”
NATO and Eastern Europe resource
No one chronicles the rise of the supra - government called NATO like Rick Rozoff in his “ Stop NATO ” mailings .
NATO has become an ever - expanding behemoth , making war and interfering in political controversies all over Europe and beyond .
The United States is not the world ’s only superpower ; NATO is another , as it surrounds Russia and the Caspian Sea oil reserves ; although the distinction between the two superpowers is little more than a facade .
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the NATO / US 78 - day bombing of Yugoslavia .
On April 23 , 1999 missiles slammed into Radio Television Serbia ( RTS ) in downtown Belgrade , killing 16 employees .
The station , NATO claimed , was a legitimate military target because it broadcast propaganda .
( Certainly a novel form of censorship ; not to mention the fact that NATO could simply have taken out the station ’s transmitter . )
What apparently bothered the Western powers was that RTS was reporting the horrendous effects of NATO ’s bombing as well as passing footage of the destruction to Western media .
To mark the anniversary , Amnesty International recently issued a demand that NATO be held accountable for the 16 deaths .
Amnesty asserts that the bombing was a deliberate attack on a civilian object ( one of many during the 78 days ) and as such constitutes a war crime , and called upon NATO to launch a war crimes probe into the attack to ensure full accountability and redress for victims and their families .
Readers might consider signing up for the “ Stop NATO ” mailing list .
Just write to : rwrozoff [ at ] yahoo.com .
Rozoff scours the East European press each day and comes up with numerous gems ignored by the mainstream media .
But a warning :
The amount of material you ’ll receive is often considerable .
You ’ll have to learn to pick and choose .
You can get an idea of this by reading previous reports here .
In a small Normandy village , surrounded by wheat fields , Gwen Le Berre keeps a Scientology " electrometer " machine in his bedroom .
He opens the large green briefcase and peers at the machine inside .
It looks like a lie - detector from an old TV cop show and Le Berre does n't really understand how it works – he just knows it 's a key piece of kit for the Church of Scientology .
Le Berre , 21 , keeps the machine as a memento of his mother 's life .
Four days before Christmas 2006 , Gloria Lopez , a 47 - year - old secretary , tidied her kitchen , hung out her washing , left her dull , suburban apartment overlooking the railway in Colombes , west of Paris , and walked the 30 metres out on to the tracks .
She stood with her arms outstretched , smiling at the driver of the oncoming commuter train .
He could n't stop in time .
Lopez had left Spain in the 80s to marry Pascal Le Berre , a French secondary school teacher .
The couple had two children together in Normandy , but divorced soon afterwards .
It was just after the split that Lopez – who had always been interested in alternative medicine and esoteric ideas – met some Scientologists and signed up .
The church was to become her life .
Eventually , she moved to Paris , leaving her two children behind , to be nearer the Scientology Centre .
" When she found herself alone after the divorce , her need for a spiritual search was reawakened , " Pascal Le Berre says .
" At the start , Scientology gave her confidence , it gave her the illusion she could be stronger than she thought .
She saw it as helping the world work better – even a way of saving the world . "
Gwen Le Berre had been due to visit his mother to give her her Christmas present two days after she killed herself .
His elder sister , Mathilde , had seen her a few weeks before and , although Lopez had lost weight in recent months , she had seemed in good form .
They were convinced she would have left a suicide note , and went to her apartment , where the shelves were stacked with Scientology books and DVDs , to search for one .
Instead , they found a box of documents in which she had handwritten a series of punishing self - appraisals as part of her membership of the Church of Scientology .
She wrote of how she owed money to the organisation for courses , was struggling to advance up the path to spiritual enlightenment , really wanted to succeed as a Scientologist , and regretted every mistake in her life .
" She even wrote that she had surfed the internet for two minutes beyond her allocated lunch break at work , " Gwen says .
Pascal agrees : " It was as if everything she tried to do was a failure – not advancing up the chain of Scientology courses , but also being distant from her children .
She felt a lot of pain over that . "
Surprised at the lack of bills and other normal financial documents at the flat – where Lopez often housed Scientologist lodgers , and which other church members regularly visited – the family wondered if other documents had gone missing or been removed .
But after reading her tormented writings , Lopez 's children and her ex-husband decided to file a legal complaint against the Church of Scientology for what they claim is its role in her death .
They estimate that in around 10 years as a Scientologist , Lopez spent between € 200,000 and € 250,000 on courses and books – despite her secretary 's salary , which was € 2,000 a month at the time of her death .
Her family also claim that she was counselled by Scientology financial advisers and decided to sell a property she had inherited in Spain , freeing up capital for more courses .
" They stole my mother , " Gwen says .
" I do n't feel I knew my mother apart from in her role as a Scientologist . "
The police investigation into the Lopez case is just one of a series of investigations and legal cases that has led the Church of Scientology to complain of a " climate of hatred " and a state - sponsored " inquisition " against them in France .
Together they have the potential to threaten Scientology 's very survival in France and undermine it elsewhere .
This autumn , not only could its two flagship centres in France be closed down , but the church itself could be convicted of " organised fraud " .
Founded in California in the 50s by the flamboyant science fiction author , L Ron Hubbard , the Church of Scientology claims to offer spiritual self - improvement based on his writings .
From the beginning it attracted controversy .
It vehemently opposes conventional psychiatry , instead favouring Hubbard 's philosophy of mental health , known as Dianetics .
This teaches that a person 's spirit can be cleared of negative experiences and encourages members to progress up " The Bridge to Total Freedom " through a complex " auditing " process , until they reach the most advanced level of spiritual " clarity " .
The movement is fiercely protective of copyright over its teachings and its central idea that humans are descended from Thetans – an exiled race from another planet .
Hollywood members include Tom Cruise and John Travolta , and Scientology now considers itself to be one of the fastest - growing new religions in the world , claiming more than 7,900 churches , missions and groups in 164 countries .
This year the movement was hit by scandal in Florida when senior members defected and alleged routine physical attacks by the church 's leader , David Miscavige – allegations the church denies .
But it is France that is threatening to become the organisation 's nemesis .
Scientology has no religious status in France , and in the 90s it was included in a government inquiry 's list of sects .
The Church of Scientology says it has six churches and six missions in France , totalling 45,000 members .
The French government puts the membership at between 2,000 and 3,000 .
Along with the Lopez case , there is an ongoing investigation into a 2008 kidnapping case in which Martine Boublil , a 48 - year - old Frenchwoman , is said to have been found being held , half naked , on a vermin - infested mattress in a house in Sardinia .
She filed a complaint saying that her brother – an ex-doctor and prominent Scientologist – had kidnapped her , trying to treat her psychological problems himself .
The Church of Scientology and Boublil 's brother , Claude , denies she was kidnapped and described the case as a " tragic family affair " that the media had sought to exploit .
But this May the most serious fraud trial that the Church of Scientology has faced anywhere in the world opened in Paris .
Not only were six important French Scientologists placed in the dock for organised fraud and illegally practising as pharmacists – for selling vitamins classed as medication in France – but , for the first time , the Church itself was accused of organised fraud .
In a historic move , the state prosecutor requested that the judges dismantle and dissolve Paris 's two flagship Scientology premises : the Celebrity Centre and its bookshop in the capital .
The verdict is due at the end of October , and the world is watching .
If the Paris centres are shut , it will limit Scientology 's operations in France and may have implications elsewhere .
In May , Aude - Claire Malton , a former hotel housekeeper , took the stand against the Church of Scientology at the Palais de Justice in Paris .
She described how , depressed after a relationship failed , she met a group of Scientologists at a Metro exit and filled in their personality test questionnaire .
A few days later , the Church of Scientology called her to fix an appointment at the Celebrity Centre .
" They told me I was in a very uneven state , and that they could help me by giving me some courses . "
The first course cost € 20 , but immediately afterwards she was offered a " package " of several sessions for € 4,800 .
She emptied several savings accounts , her life insurance policy , and took out a loan to pay for more courses on the advice of her Scientology personal financial adviser .
Asked by the judge how she could have spent so much , she said : " You have to understand , you 're in the brouhaha of the Scientology Centre where everyone repeats to you : ' You must continue , you 're making progress , you 're going to be able to better yourself , all this is for you . ' "
One of the products she spent money on was a full - time 10 - day " purification " treatment , where she would take vitamins , then go for a run , then undertake two , three or four hours of sauna .
She said she lost four kilos and emerged exhausted .
" I had to do it if I wanted to progress , " she said .
The judge read out a document described as Malton 's Scientology programme : " Move house , get money for life insurance , pay back € 16,000 , resign . "
She said the organisation wanted her to work for them at the Celebrity Centre , where she would get courses as part of her pay .
They wanted her to move into shared accommodation to cut her costs .
But her family and ex-boyfriend stepped in and persuaded her to quit Scientology .
Summing up , the French state prosecutor slammed a " universe of secret rules " and deliberate , planned , fraudulent manoeuvres .
She criticised the movement 's personality tests and electrometers , which she said were designed to impress and deceive members .
When the verdict is handed down in October , it may not only see the dissolution of Scientology 's major Paris branches , but fines of € 4 m and hefty sentences levelled against six individuals , among them Alain Rosenberg , the director general of Paris 's Celebrity Centre and one of the select few Scientologists in France who have attained the church 's highest grade of clarity and enlightenment .
He denied the prosecution 's charges that Scientology was a business that planned to ensnare new members to defraud them .
" I 'm a man of the church and not a director general of a business , " he said .
He defined purification treatments , electrometers and courses in Ron Hubbard 's book Dianetics as " religious services " , arguing that " spiritual elevation " had no price .
Defence lawyers said none of the individuals on trial had made a cent and had acted " out of religious conviction " .
Scientology 's barrister Patrick Maisonneuve argued that while other countries had recognised Scientology as a religion , France was intent on " burning Ron Hubbard 's books in the courtyard of the Holy Chapel as the international community watches in horror " .
Just before the fraud trial began , pianist and teacher Alain Stoffen stoked the controversy surrounding Scientology in France with his book Voyage To The Heart Of Scientology .
It tells the story of his " descent to hell " during more than a decade as a member of the organisation .
A tall , intense man , Stoffen , 48 , sits in his modest flat on the edge of Paris and describes an idyllic upbringing in Brussels , during which he decided he wanted to be a musician , performer , composer – " an artist " .
At 24 , he took a piano teaching job in a Paris music school , which he says was run as a recruiting ground by Scientologists .
Inspired by the fact that his jazz hero , Chick Corea , was a Scientologist , he plunged into Hubbard 's teachings .
His initial communication courses at the Celebrity Centre helped Stoffen overcome his shyness and perform better on stage .
" The results were phenomenal , tangible , concrete . "
He says it 's wrong to assume people who join Scientology are " weak " .
" The people who sign up have a healthy approach , they want to go forward in life , achieve their projects and ambitions . "
At the Celebrity Centre , he felt he was surrounded by an elite membership from the worlds of art and business .
But Stoffen became tortured by his struggle to progress to higher levels of " clarity " and the constant scraping for money to pay for courses .
" You would do everything to pay that sum , it was a question of life and death for us , spiritual life or death , " he says .
" When you 're on the inside , the illusion is perfect .
I was convinced that I was thinking for myself , that I became more authentic , that no one ran my life .
But the reverse was happening .
Without realising , I had been subjected to a real depersonalisation process , a destructuring , so I had become a type of clone .
The aim is to destroy , destabilise the person , make them vulnerable , weaken them on a psychological level and place them in a state of dependence . "
In 15 years , Stoffen says he spent € 45,000 on Scientology courses and books which , he suggests , was not a lot .
" Others spent well over € 300,000 . "
He married and had a child with another Scientologist , but after a painful break - up – " managed " , he claims , by the organisation – he discovered what he called his secret " personal dossier " .
It was , he says , 150 pages long and contained minute details of his personal life , the workings of his divorce and custody of his child , and a programme detailing how to " deal " with him and get more money from him .
" It was a horrible discovery .
I vomited all night . "
He left in 2001 and filed a legal complaint against the Church of Scientology for extortion , fraud , blackmail and illegally practising as pharmacists .
In September 2006 , an investigating judge dismissed the case , but in May 2007 that decision was overturned by an appeals court .
A judicial investigation has been reopened and Stoffen will meet investigating magistrates in September as he waits for the next step in his case .
" When you leave Scientology , you 're totally broken , " he says , " as a human being , financially , morally .
Your own identity is the result of indoctrination aimed at destroying your critical faculties .
When you leave , the feeling of shame and guilt is enormous .
It 's unbearable . "
Agnès Bron , of the French Church of Scientology 's public affairs department , says that " false allegations against Scientology with no proof " mainly come from " apostates " who have left the religion , and that the credibility of apostates must be treated with caution .
She says Stoffen 's " completely deformed image of Scientology " has been used by the media , and the dossier he claims to have discovered had not been secret at all , because all personal dossiers can be consulted by members .
For Bron , the Stoffen case , the Paris fraud trial , the Lopez preliminary investigation and other high - profile complaints against Scientology are indicative of " a climate of discrimination " and " orchestrated campaigns " against Scientology in France , pushed by " extremist and antireligious pressure groups " .
Among those groups she includes the French government agency Miviludes , set up to observe and monitor whether sects and cults break the law or threaten public health .
In a government office attached to the prime minister 's residence on Paris 's Left Bank , Georges Fenech , magistrate and former MP for president Nicolas Sarkozy 's UMP party , sits leafing through his collection of files marked Scientology .
As president of Miviludes , Fenech 's official mission is to monitor every possible type of behaviour by a sect or cult that might fall outside the law .
There are hundreds of small groups being studied from his office , but Fenech is best known as Scientology 's number one enemy .
In 1997 , he was the investigating judge who instructed a major court case against Scientologists in Lyon .
A young father , crippled with debts to the organisation , had killed himself by jumping from a 12th - floor window .
In court , convictions were obtained for manslaughter and fraud .
To Scientologists , Fenech is on a " crusade " against the Church of Scientology , running a sustained press campaign against them and leading a state - sponsored witch - hunt .
" It 's rather flattering , " he smiles .
" It proves that the work we do here is efficient . "
France , with its republican tradition of the separation of church and state , takes the behaviour of sects and cults seriously – perhaps because it has been shaken by a number of major tragedies in recent history , including the mass suicide of members of the cult Order of the Solar Temple .
But a deep scepticism of sects is not confined to government officials .
There was a media outcry in 2004 when Sarkozy , then minister for finance , was suspected of favouring Scientology after his very public meeting with Tom Cruise .
Another followed last year when one of his top advisers , Emanuelle Mignon , said the state 's attitude to Scientology was questionable .
Fenech insists : " Nicolas Sarkozy met Tom Cruise , the international film star , not as the ambassador for Scientology .
The meeting was never a question of Scientology . "
He says the president is " firm " on the issue of sects , and Mignon has given assurances that her comments were taken out of context .
The Church of Scientology argues that secular France is persecuting it for its beliefs as a " new religion " .
Fenech disagrees .
" For France , Scientology is a vast commercial enterprise hiding behind a religious mask , " he says .
" This is not something against the Ron Hubbardian doctrine , or beliefs about intergalactic happenings thousands of years ago .
What we 're interested in is that people are dragged into this movement , lose their liberty , autonomy and sometimes their life . "
He says France protects freedom of religion , " but if a law is being broken , the state will go there .
Religion is n't a protection against the law . "
Back in Normandy , Gwen Le Berre says he has no interest in any kind of campaign against Scientology – he just wants justice and the truth about his mother .
Unable to close the chapter on their grief , the family still pore over what they know of Lopez 's life as a Scientologist : how she joined every possible Scientology group in Paris , how she took her eight - year - old daughter to a children 's Scientology course and her young son to Scientology summer revision sessions , before her ex-husband insisted she stopped talking to the children about the movement until they were 18 .
" When she died , I did n't know much about Scientology .
It was the last thing that came to mind , " her son says .
" If , by bringing a case , we can open people 's eyes , it will have been worth it . "
A new study indicates who is more likely to be promiscuous based on their personality type .
It 's no secret that men are more likely than women to jump into the sack .
But a new study adds some twists to the rules of such casual sex .
The research suggests men are far less choosy about the attractiveness of a potential one - night stand .
For women to be tempted into considering casual sex , the guy better be a hottie .
These results , based not on real - life encounters but rather on interviews , match with past research showing that men lower their standards when it comes to one - night stands .
And it turns out , from the new study , women raise their standards .
Men want sex
Achim Schützwohl of Brunel University in London and his colleagues surveyed nearly 900 students ( split about evenly between guys and gals ) from the United States , Germany and Italy .
Participants were asked to imagine being approached by a member of the opposite sex , described as either " slightly unattractive , " " moderately attractive , " or " exceptionally attractive , " who asked the student to go out , go to their apartment , or go to bed .
Students rated on a scale from 0 ( definitely not ) to 100 ( definitely yes ) how likely they would be to accept each request .
Regardless of the opposite sex 's attractiveness , men were more likely than women to accept all three offers .
For instance , in response to the sex request , men indicated an average likelihood of 46 , a whopping figure compared with women 's average rating of just 4 .
Men were also more likely to accept any of the three offers when the hypothetical woman was moderately or exceptionally attractive than when she was slightly unattractive .
Picky women
Women were more likely to accept the apartment and bed requests from an exceptionally attractive man than from either a moderately attractive or slightly unattractive man .
For instance , female students reported an average rating of about 2 for a slightly unattractive guy , compared with an 8 for an exceptionally attractive suitor .
Such choosiness for short - term sex could be explained by the so - called good genes hypothesis , in which women , for instance , prefer guys who show some feature indicating strong genes that can be passed down to offspring , say the researchers .
While the current study considered general attractiveness , past research has revealed women look for masculine facial features , such as square jaws , when choosing a fling and more feminine facial traits — perhaps because it indicates less testosterone and a more faithful father — in a long - term mate .
( Masculine features can indicate high testosterone , which could mean the guy is strong and healthy — traits women would want to pass on to progeny — but such a guy could also be more likely to cheat , research shows . )
The new results , which will be published online this week in the journal Human Nature , also revealed cultural differences .
Italian men were more likely than Americans and Germans to say they 'd go to bed with the requestor .
German men were also less likely than the other men to accept the apartment or date offers .
Online Cognitive Behavioral Psychotherapy for Depression :
Pretrial assessment screening by telephone for in and exclusion criteria
A face to face appointment with one of the researchers to complete a computerized assessment : SCID and Beck Depression Inventory
Online CBT with a therapist online in real time
Patients were allocated to one therapist
Patients made their own appointments online
Sessions were secured by individual passwords
Patienst and therapists typed free text into the computer , with messages sent instantaneously ; no other media or means of communication were used
So this is how you do online real time cognitive behavioral therapy .
But does it work ?
43 ( 38 % ) patients recovered from depression ( BDI score < 10 ) in the intervention group versus 23 ( 24 % ) in the control group at 4 months , and 46 ( 42 % ) versus 26 ( 26 % ) at 8 months
Why is this important ?
The use of conventional CBT for depression is declining , the use of antidepressants is increasing , many patients referred for psychotherapy never show up , and 505 of those who attending a first visit drop out by the fourth session .
Face to face psychotherapy demands a large amount of time , motivation and is an expensive treatment .
New techniques such as telephone and Internet based therapies are more convenient for patients , better accessible and with lower costs .
The level of live therapist contact is the strongest influence on costs .
The Internet psychotherapy program mentioned above seems to be a good balance between high and non therapist contact .
Between face - to - face contact and self help programs .
Drop out is low and the treatment efficacious .
By increasing access and lowering costs , new com munication technologies could provoke some much - needed disruptive innovation in psychotherapy

Glenn Beck used his popular Fox News show this afternoon to attack the background of Van Jones , a White House environmental advisor who co-founded an African American political advocacy group that organized an advertising boycott of his program .
During his 2 p.m. PDT show , Beck did not address the boycott spearheaded by Color of Change to protest the talk show host ’s remark last month that he believes President Obama is “ a racist . ”
Instead , he spent a large share of his program suggesting that Jones , who co-founded Color of Change in 2005 , is a radical .
Jones now serves as a special advisor for Green Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality .
During a six - minute biographical profile , set to ominous music , Beck said Jones was twice arrested for political protests and has described himself as a " rowdy black nationalist . "
The talk show host cast the piece as part of a broader examination of Obama 's " czars , " special advisers to the president who " do n't answer to anybody . "
" Why is it that such a committed revolutionary has made it so high into the Obama administration as one of his chief advisers ? "
Beck asked .
Christine Glunz , a spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality , noted that Jones has been lauded as an environmental hero and said his entire focus is on “ building clean energy incentives which create 21st - century jobs . ”
“ Glenn Beck is trying to change the subject , ” said James Rucker , executive director of Color of Change , who noted that Jones has not been active with the group in almost two years .
“ The issue is his baseless fear mongering . ”
Beck has gone after Jones in the past .
On July 28 , he called the activist a " self - professed communist " and questioned the role he was playing in the administration .
His latest assault on Jones came as Color of Change announced that it has secured commitments from 36 companies who have pledged not to advertise on Beck ’s popular program , including Wal - Mart and Sprint .
However , some of the companies never had a presence on " Glenn Beck . "
Representatives of Procter & Gamble and AT&T – listed by Color of Change as companies that had signed onto the boycott – told The Times that their companies did not run spots on Beck ’s program to begin with .
While the advertising boycott has generated substantial media coverage , Fox News said it has not impacted the network ’s revenues or Beck ’s audience .
" The advertisers referenced have all moved their spots from Beck to other programs on the network so there has been no revenue lost , " a spokeswoman said .
Since his Fox News show launched in January , Beck has attracted a sizable audience with his strident denunciations of the Obama administration and apocalyptic warnings about the country ’s direction .
Late last month , during an appearance on the morning show “ Fox & Friends , ” he accused Obama of having “ a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture . ”
“ This guy is , I believe , a racist , ” he added .
The flap that ensued did not appear to dampen Beck ’s viewership .
This month , his show has averaged 2.25 million viewers , 99 % more than tuned in during the same period last year , when the network aired “ America ’s Election HQ ” during the time period .
And his ratings are up from July , when Beck 's program averaged 2.05 million viewers .
Fan websites such as Defend Glenn have called for viewers to fight back against the advertising boycott , and some media veterans have denounced the tactic as a suppression of free speech .
The controversy has triggered a broader discussion about the risks to advertisers of running commercials amid the incendiary rhetoric of cable talk shows .
Clorox announced last week that it was pulling its ads off all political talk shows .
" We do not want to be associated with inflammatory speech used by either liberal or conservative talk show host , ” the company said in a statement .
“ After a comprehensive review of political talks shows across the spectrum , at this time we have made a decision not to advertise on them .
Clorox has done very little advertising on political talk shows overall , and given the sometimes inflammatory nature of these shows , we feel our advertising investment is best directed elsewhere . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama accused his critics on Saturday of resorting to “ outlandish rumors ” and “ misleading information ” aimed at derailing his efforts to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system .

Obama struck back at conservative opponents as lawmakers returned home for their August break facing an increasingly rancorous battle over his top domestic legislative priority .
A deal on healthcare has yet to be struck in Congress .
“ As we draw close to finalizing -- and passing -- real health insurance reform , the defenders of the status quo and political point - scorers in Washington are growing fiercer in their opposition , ” Obama said , without naming names , in his weekly radio and Internet address .
“ Some have been using misleading information to defeat what they know is the best chance of reform we have ever had , ” Obama said , adding it was critical for Americans to have all the facts as they meet their lawmakers in home districts .
Obama adviser David Axelrod has coached Democrats in the Senate , where the party has a majority , on how to deal with angry opponents of the healthcare proposals during the month long recess .
Obama ’s aides and fellow Democrats have charged that protests staged at some “ town hall ” - style meetings held by congressional Democrats have been orchestrated by Republican - and industry - backed groups and conservative talk - show hosts , and are calling for a more civil dialogue .
Republican Rep. Tom Price of Georgia took aim at this White House move .
“ When no one is listening to them , sometimes people have to speak up , ” Price said in a statement released on Saturday .
“ Rather than listening to the concerns of those who will face the consequences of the legislation , the White House has laughed off the thought that Americans might have sincere concerns about a plan that relies so heavily on government involvement in health care . ”
Obama ’s push for healthcare reform , which seeks to provide coverage to nearly 46 million uninsured Americans , rein in healthcare costs and regulate insurance practices has been assailed by critics over its $ 1 trillion cost and scope .
Republicans call it a government takeover of healthcare that will drive up the deficit and hurt the economy at a time when the United States is facing its longest recession since the Great Depression .
Democrats who control Congress have feuded among themselves over how to pay for healthcare reform , and Obama ’s public approval rating has slipped as the debate drags on .
Obama says the package is vital to a U.S. economic recovery .
No Republicans have backed the proposals being crafted in Congress .
“ Let me explain what reform will mean for you .
And let me start by dispelling the outlandish rumors that reform will promote euthanasia , cut Medicaid or bring about a government takeover of health care .
That ’s simply not true , ” Obama said in his Saturday address .
“ There are those who ... are trying to exploit differences or concerns for political gain , ” he added .
Obama acknowledged some differences remained to be worked out but insisted that “ we are moving toward a broad consensus ” and reaffirmed his goal of getting the healthcare revamp enacted by the end of the year .
He will keep up his own public relations offensive on healthcare next week when he holds a town hall meeting in Portsmouth , New Hampshire .

Ball fondly recalls the altruism of the Kennedy family who paid for his health care when he was a child .
From the article in Hindu Business Line a publication in India :
Ball narrates an incident from his childhood that sowed the seeds for his passion .
" My godmother was personal secretary to Joseph Kennedy , the father of Jack Kennedy .
As an infant I had cat - scratch fever , and Jean Kennedy - Smith , Jack Kennedy 's sister , asked my parents to take me to a hospital .
When my parents said they could n't afford it , she said she would take care of everything .
And , within five minutes , there were 10 doctors around me .
I think those little interactions that I had as a kid with that family in particular showed me how well power could be used . "
He feels that people should use their abilities to impact others positively , because there is both good and evil in this world .
" Evil exists , and we have to fight it at every turn . "
I must say , what a compassionate clan the Kennedy family has been , and despite their wealth they took it upon themselves to care for a small baby who was , at the very best , tenuously connected to them .
And this interaction with the Kennedy family taught Ball to demonize a healthcare system with a public - option ?
I 'm not sure how such compassion teaches someone to be so selfish and uncaring .
What 's even more amazing is that Joseph Kennedy was dead for some eight years before Greg was born in 1977 , but the compassionate Kennedy clan , according to Ball , cared enough to keep in touch with their deceased patriarch 's secretary 's godson .
Had not Ball 's blue - collar family had this distant connection , what would they have done ?
And what a great bit of irony , considering that Greg is now campaigning against American families getting the health care that they need with his so - called town halls , which are nothing but homespun demagoguery , fake outrage , and misinformation directed at the people he hopes to serve .
Unforunately , I , like most every American , do n't have connections to the Kennedys or any other ultra- wealthy family .
My son , who is on the autistic spectrum , has had more than $ 30,000 in medical bills that two health - insurance companies refused to cover .
It put my family on the brink of financial ruin .
Assemblyman Ball and his family should feel blessed to have such friends to pay for his health care when he was a child .
Would n't Greg Ball want every child to have an opportunity to have to see a doctor when their health is imperiled without bankrupting their families ?
I think it 's time that this Congressional candidate did some sincere soul searching before he spreads more fear and lies about the health - care reform that Ted Kennedy so wanted for all American families .
UPDATE : Thanks for the recs , this is my first time on the list .
My wife and I are also impressed by the depth and quality of the comments to my diary , they 've improved greatly on what I wrote , giving it much more impact .
I 've also crossposted this on my orangization 's blog , Rockland Progressive Dems , pay a visit if you care .
$ 80,000 for every American
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , July 20 , 2009
According to the watchdog overseeing the federal government ’s financial bailout program , the full exposure since 2007 amounts to a whopping $ 23.7 trillion dollars , or $ 80,000 for every American citizen .
The last time we were able to get a measure of the total cost of the bailout , it stood at around $ 8.5 trillion dollars .
Eight months down the line and that figure has almost tripled .
The $ 23.7 trillion figure comprises “ about 50 initiatives and programs set up by the Bush and Obama administrations as well as by the Federal Reserve , ” according to the Associated Press .
In testimony which will be delivered to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee tomorrow , Neil Barofsky , the inspector general for the TARP , will tell Congress that “ the Treasury Department has repeatedly failed to adopt recommendations aimed at making the TARP program more accountable and transparent . ”
According to Barofsky , taxpayers are in the dark as to who has received the money and what they are doing with it .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As we have repeatedly highlighted , the destination of some $ 2 trillion in TARP funds was the subject of a lawsuit filed by Bloomberg late last year after the Fed refused to disclose the recipients .
The suit is still ongoing as Bloomberg attempts to discover names of private financial institutions that received the money .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The American people will ultimately pick up the tab as their dollar is devalued because the Fed lends the money from its own balance sheet or essentially just prints more money , as a San Francisco Chronicle article explained last year .
Wages will not keep pace with inflation and if we add to the equation the raft of new taxes being introduced by the Obama administration , the consequences are clear – another lowering of the living standard for millions of middle class Americans .
Meanwhile , Henry Paulson , one of the chief architects of the bailout and the man who committed financial terrorism by threatening the Congress with martial law and food riots if they did n’t pass the initial TARP package , brazenly pockets $ 200 million in Goldman Sachs profits tax free while handing out billions in ill - gotten gains to his bankster buddies , all this after he pulled a bait and switch by changing the entire focus of the bailout from buying up toxic debt to giving money directly to financial institutions .
We dread to think what the bailout figure will be in another eight months .
Will it triple again to $ 70 trillion dollars ?
How about $ 100 trillion dollars ?
The only thing that can bring an end to the wanton looting is Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Fed , which has received overwhelming support in the House but is being blocked by the bought and paid for traitors in the Senate who would rather see a continuation of the grand larceny rather than real accountability and transparency .
Watch a CNBC discussion of the $ 24 trillion figure below .

I ’m still having trouble keeping solid food down after having been exposed to the Internet Explorer 8 ad that involves a woman projectile - vomiting after accidentally seeing a site her husband had been viewing .
But I ’m moving on from being appalled to trying to answer an important question :
Is it the single worst commercial for a technology product ever ?
Until now , this 1980s spot from Commodore Australia would have been my nominee for that honor :
But looking at it again–hey , it ’s not bad .
Yes , it ’s cheesy–it feels like a Mentos commercial from a time before there were Mentos commercials .
Yes , the combination of the notion of “ Keeping up with the Commodore ” and people smiling vacantly and making cryptic signs makes me wonder if some forgotten cult is involved .
But at least it ’s all cheery , and the song is so infectious that it ’s now stuck in my head , which helps to block out the IE 8 ad .
Another plus : Nobody in it projectile - vomits .
Speaking of vomiting , it ’s worth noting that the Microsoft ad is n’t the first one for a Web - related enterprise that involves spitting up .
The E*TRADE baby tosses his cookies in this commercial , though in a more dignified , less forceful manner–and hey , he ’s a baby :
That ’s a bad ad , but not bad enough to rival the IE one .
Anyhow , the Internet Explorer 8 is revolting on multiple levels ; it demeans both Internet Explorer and its users ; it does n’t even provide a terribly compelling argument for choosing IE , since private browsing is a standard feature in most modern browsers .
It ’s the first ad from Microsoft or any other major tech company I can think of that can accurately be described by the word fetid .
In short , it ’s my new candidate for worst tech product ad of all time .
Any other nominees ?
[ UPDATE : Microsoft has pulled the ad.
Sorry , vomit - lovers … ]

Here 's a story to melt the mind .
Residents in Missouri will get a new fee added to their electric bill for using less energy .
Why are they being charged more for using less ?
The money is spent on promotions by the utilities to get people using less energy .
If electricity consumption grows then the utilities need to build new power plants , which is expensive .
The cost of new power plant is greater than the cost of promoting conservation of electricity .
The EPA estimates that conservation plans like this will add 3 % to electricity rates , but customers participating in the conservation will see their electric bills fall by 20 - 30 % .
While the logic works , once you perform some serious mental gymnastics , this is the sort of thing that illustrates the tricky path going forward for changing energy habits in the country .
And , incidentally , does n't this seem like something stimulus money should address ?
DAVID A. LIEB The Associated Press - JEFFERSON CITY | Some Missouri residents and businesses soon could see a new charge on their electric bills — a fee for using less energy .
Though it might seem illogical , the new energy efficiency charge has support from utilities , most lawmakers , the governor , environmentalists and even the state ’s official utility consumer advocate .
The charge covers the cost of utilities ’ efforts to promote energy efficiency and cut power use .
The assumption is that charging consumers for those initiatives ultimately will cost less than charging them to build the new power plants that will be needed if electricity use is n’t curtailed .
Legislation pending before Gov. Jay Nixon would set the criteria for state utility regulators to approve the energy - savings charges .
If he signs the bill , the new law would take effect Aug. 28 .
When lawmakers adjourned in mid-May , Nixon listed the little - publicized energy legislation as among his proudest accomplishments , describing it as a “ good , good start on an energy policy ” to be developed by his Department of Natural Resources .
“ To save power is the equivalent of making power , ” Nixon said , “ and it ’s a pretty seismic shift ” in Missouri ’s energy strategy .
Usually , regulators allow utilities to recoup the cost of building power plants or buying more power to meet customer demand .
Recently , the Missouri Public Service Commission began allowing some utilities to pass along to customers the cost of programs that reduce demand for electricity .
For example , the commission last week approved a program in which St. Louis - based AmerenUE can offer credits to businesses that voluntarily shut down or scale back their electricity use during peak demand .
AmerenUE will be able to recoup the cost for the program that starts Thursday by increasing the rates it charges business customers .
Kansas City Power & Light Co. already has 19 energy efficiency and demand - reduction programs , said Chuck Caisley , the company ’s senior director of public affairs .
He said the Public Service Commission is allowing the company to recoup up to $ 50 million of the programs ’ costs under a rate plan in effect through 2010 .
One of the company ’s more popular energy - saving initiatives has provided free programmable thermostats to about 34,000 residential customers in Missouri and Kansas .
KCP&L can remotely control the devices to reduce the frequency at which air conditioners run during peak demand times .
The power company overrode customers ’ air conditioners four times last year and twice so far this summer , Caisley said .
KCP&L was among the leading advocates for the Missouri legislation .
“ It will allow us to spend a great deal more on energy efficiency , because it holds us harmless ” for the cost , Caisley said .
The legislation applies to KCP&L , AmerenUE and the Empire District Electric Co. , the publicly traded utilities that serve nearly three - fourths of the state ’s population .
The utilities would have to get approval from the five - member Public Service Commission to pass on the cost of their energy - saving programs .
To do that , the programs must result in an overall reduction in energy use .
The legislation also requires the charges for the energy - saving programs to be listed as a separate line item on customer bills .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that energy - saving programs offered by utilities will add about 3 percent to the average electricity rates .
But it says customers who participate in the programs could save 10 percent to 20 percent on their energy bills , and even those who do n’t participate might save if utilities do n’t have to buy more energy or build new power plants .
“ It ’s one of those rare utility bills that actually works out to everyone ’s benefit , ” said Missouri Public Counsel Lewis Mills , the state ’s official consumer advocate .
Public Service Commission Chairman Robert M. Clayton III said he feared that Missouri ’s heavily coal - dependent electric customers will see a sharp spike in rates if federal climate legislation limiting carbon emissions becomes law .
That makes it even more important for Missourians to reduce their collective energy use , he said .
Although the commission took no position on the Missouri legislation , Clayton said he was fine with the idea of allowing utilities to recoup costs for energy - savings initiatives .
“ Any tool we can give a consumer to reduce their usage is a good thing , ” Clayton said , adding : “ The trick is making sure the expenditure ( by the utility ) is a prudent expenditure and it ’s going to achieve results . ”

An almost perfect real - world hack Posted by Louis Brandy on 03 August 2009
Almost immediately after we bought our house I received a letter in the mail .
The local school district was appealing the tax assessment of my house .
The issue in question was the value of my property in 2002 ( do n't ask , it 's a long story , and a silly law ) .
My property tax is some percentage of the 2002 value of my home , and they thought my assessed value was too low .
Great .
Researching ...
We bought our house in 2009 for almost $ 15,000 less than the previous owners paid for it in 2004 .
I was amazed that the school district thought our taxes should go up despite the fact that the house 's price had gone down .
This was my first piece of evidence , but I needed to understand more about these tax hearings .
Turns out that most people do n't show up to their assessment .
The school districts use your sale price in 2009 , multiply it by some magical number ( say 90 % ) and they argue that is what your house should be assessed at .
This strikes me ( and many others ) as a ridiculous method of determining the value of the house .
Since few people show up , they tend to win and people 's assessments tend to go up .
In order to counter argue , you need to establish what your house was worth in 2002 based on comparable sales that occurred in and around 2002 .
I decided to do some research .
Lucky for me , my county has a website that lets you look up the history of each house ( including when it was sold , and its measurements like sq.footage , number of beds and baths , etc. ) .
The Allegheny Assessment Website
So this website lets you look up details for each house by address .
I tried looking at the history of each house in my neighborhood trying to find , in vain , houses that matched mine and that was sold in 2001 or 2002 .
Actually finding comparables with this website was going to be quite a tedious adventure .
It 's important to note that it 's only by address ( or by parcel number ) .
You can't do things like " show me all the houses that sold in 2002 " .
That would be too convenient , of course .
I wonder how many tax assessment appeals the county and the school districts have won precisely because the website was so difficult to search .
After about 10 minutes of wandering around aimlessly through nearby neighborhoods , I got an idea .
This is why God invented computers .
Let 's build a web scraper .
Scraping the detail pages
The very first thing I noticed was that if you knew the parcel number of a property , you could look up the property with a simple GET request .
Here is an example page ( this is Heinz Field , home of the Pittsburgh Steelers )
Ten minutes later , I had some scripts in python to download all the necessary pages , given a parcel number , and extract all the vitals : address , square footage , sales dates , sales prices , number of bathrooms & bedrooms , lot size , and so on .
The script then dumped that information into a database .
So far so good , now I just needed to get all the parcel numbers for my area .
Getting the parcel number list information
I needed to find the parcel id for every single house in my town .
Their search box would n't let me search for '*'.
Searching for ' A ' in the street address , however , gets you a paginated list of every house in that town on a street that began with the letter ' A ' .
These searches were all conducted with a POST to a single url .
All I had to do was figure out to form these POSTs and how to turn the page .
This is where I hit a speed bump .
The " next page " button on the results page was a javascript call that formed a new POST .
Their POSTs had some " features " ( I believe from some windows web development tool -- _VIEWSTATE , _EVENTVALIDATION were the arguments in the POST ) that made crawling it non-trivial .
The POST required some magical numbers that were formed in javascript .
It probably would n't have been too difficult to grep out the magic numbers and emulate the javascript code in python to formulate a properly formed POST to get the data I needed .
I had a quicker solution .
iMacros
i Macros is a nifty firefox plugin that I 've used from time to time that turns your browser into a scraper .
It 's a heck of a lot slower than doing it from python , but you can " scrape " a page as if you were the user .
This works brilliantly for very simple stateful tasks that require things like cookies or javascript .
In iMacros , I could tell it to record all the parcel numbers on a particular page and then click " next " , and repeat .
I was only about a half hour into my adventure and I already had the necessary scripts to scrape their site .
Not bad .
I let iMacros run for an hour , getting the parcel numbers of every property .
One more hour later I had run my python scripts with the parcel number list and had a database filled with every single house in my town .
I had just ran about 2 hours of constant web requests on a county server to build a database of about 5000 homes .
And now I just posted this information on the internet .
I hope I do n't get arrested .
Comparables , Comparables
Once I had my database , it was time to search .
One SQL statement later I had found every house that had as much square footage , as much lot size , as many bedrooms , as many bathrooms , that was sold in 2000 - 2002 for less than my current tax assessment .
84 results .
Ha ha .
That 's probably too many , huh ?
My town is shaped funny , and so some of these houses on this list were actually quite far away .
Luckily for me , the parcel numbering is fairly sane .
I was quickly able to figure out which parcels were near me based on the first portion of the number .
I removed anything that was too far away .
I ended up with 31 residential homes that were within 4 miles of my house that were sold in 2000 - 2002 that had all better measurements and sold for less than my assessment .
I began printing .
Every one of these houses was better than my house ( on paper , at least ) , very close by , and sold for less than my assessment .
I was going to walk into court and argue that my assessment was too high .
I picked the 7 best to state my case , and printed up detailed reports on each of those as well .
I 'd open with these 7 , make my case that my assessment was too high .
I 'd say we bought our house for less than the previous owners , more proof it was too high .
And if I needed it , I 'd bust out the list of 31 .
Court
I spent most of the night before rehearsing my speech for court .
I was n't rehearsing the part about how they should lower my tax assessment .
I was rehearsing the part where I explained how I got such detailed comparables , how it was totally legal , and how they should n't throw me in jail for " hacking " .
I walked into the courtroom with about 100 pages of documentation in a nifty leather notebook .
31 comparables and 7 of those in detail .
I had absolutely no idea what they would do .
I imagine lawyers or real estate agents have access to databases like this , so they 'd probably just assume I knew someone .
There was the outside chance that no one had ever done anything like this before .
In the room sat two lawyers ( my opponents ) and the guy in charge ( I presume he was a judge ) .
It was n't in a court room but an office adjacent to the court room .
This is basically what happened :
Judge :
What 's your name ?
Me : Louis Brandy .
The judge and opponent lawyers shuffled a lot of papers around .
The two lawyers looked at the their papers for awhile .
Judge , to lawyers : Alright , what are we doing ?
Lawyer :
This appeal was been going on for 2 years , with the previous owners .
They ( me+ my wife ) are the new owners .
They bought it for $ 15,000 less than the previous owners .
That puts their house into agreement with our numbers .
There 's no need to change this assessment .
We will withdraw the appeal .
Judge , to me :
You can go forward , if you want , and I 'll decide what to do with the assessment -- up or down .
They are willing to withdraw the appeal , is that ok with you ?
Ah , crap .
I had a decision to make .
Should I push forward and risk being embarrassed ?
What if I printed up the wrong numbers ?
What if my comparables were garbage ?
What if they had equal comparables to keep my price at the same level ?
Accepting the the draw was the obvious choice .
My only hesitation was that it would ruin my story .
I thought briefly but there was n't really a choice .
I said yes , their withdrawal was fine by me .
I signed the papers and walked out of my hearing .
It took all of five minutes and I said exactly three words .
I showed no one the 100 pages of awesomeness in my little notebook .
Such a good story was going to be wasted on such an anticlimax .
C'est la vie .
War in Sudan 's Darfur ' is over '
Many displaced Darfuris live in camps across the border in Chad
The six - year war between forces loyal to Sudan 's government and rebels in Darfur has effectively ended , the UN 's military commander in the region says .
General Martin Agwai , who is leaving his post this week , said the vicious fighting of earlier years had subsided as rebel groups split into factions .
He says the region now suffers more from low - level disputes and banditry .
The UN says 300,000 people have died in Darfur , but the Sudanese government puts the figure at 10,000 .
Almost three million people are said to have been displaced by the fighting .
Oppression claims Gen Agwai , who led a joint UN and African Union peacekeeping force known as Unamid , said the region now suffered more from " security issues " than full - blown conflict .
DISPLACED IN DARFUR 2006 : 547,420 people fled their homes 2007 : 302,794 2008 : 317,000 2009 ( first six months ) : 137,000 Total to date : 2.7 m Source : UN humanitarian agency Ocha
In pictures : Portraits of Darfur Q&A : Sudan 's Darfur conflict " Banditry , localised issues , people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level .
But real war as such , I think we are over that , " he said .
Gen Agwai said only one rebel group , the Justice and Equality Movement ( Jem ) , posed a real threat but even it no longer had the ability to conquer and hold territory .
Sudan analyst Gill Lusk said his comments were " unhelpful " because they could lead people to believe that Darfur 's problems had been solved .
" There has been a large decline in fighting in Darfur , and that is undoubtedly a good thing for the people , " she told the BBC .
" But it is the government that turns the tap on and off - they can restart the violence whenever they want . "
An aid worker in Sudan also questioned Gen Agwai 's statement .
" If that is true , why do some parts of Darfur remain out of bounds , even for Unamid ? " she asked .
' Strong foundation ' Gen Agwai insists the real problem now is political .
BBC Sudan correspondent James Copnall says that view is shared by many within Sudan .
Although the intensity of the violence has reduced , there is still little prospect of a peace deal .
Last week , US envoy to Sudan Scott Gration said the existence of 26 different rebel factions was a major obstacle to reaching a peace agreement with the government .
He brokered talks which led to four groups agreeing to work together , calling the deal a " very strong foundation for rebel unification " .
The war broke out in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 when rebel groups including Jem attacked government targets , accusing Khartoum of oppressing black Africans in favour of Arabs .
Pro-government militiamen hit back with brutal force , which the US and some rights groups have labelled genocide .
Khartoum denies supporting the militias , but the international court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this year for President Omar al - Bashir accusing him of war crimes .

President Barack Obama today revealed to CNN that he has ordered officials to investigate the infamous Dasht-e Leili massacre which occurred in late 2001 , saying it had never been properly investigated .
Skeletal remains at Dasht-e Leili massacre site
According to Physicians for Human Rights , one of several groups that investigated the killings , up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners captured in the US invasion were killed in the custody of General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
Many were suffocated to death in containers , while others were shot .
Investigators say US troops were present during the massacre .
But as mass graves were discovered and rights groups issued reports , the Bush Administration is said to have repeatedly discouraged any official investigations by the US government into the massacre .
The Red Cross had been calling for inquiries since late 2001 , but was rebuffed by coalition forces .
The issue was seriously complicated by Gen. Dostum being on the CIA payroll at the time .
Dostum has a long history of collaborating with invading forces , getting his military career started with training in the Soviet Union and taking a job in the Ministry of State Security , opposing the then - US backed insurgency .
Dostum turned on the communist government after the fall of the Soviet Union , then quickly turned against the Taliban government that replaced it .
Since the US invasion Dostum has served in several key positions , including chief of military staff before falling out of favor .
He is now a critic of the Karzai government and the US invasion forces , and claims he could destroy the Taliban in six months if given the opportunity .
You can't hear it , but the Earth is constantly humming .
And some parts of the world sing louder than others .
After discovering the mysterious low - frequency buzz in 1998 , scientists figured out that the Earth 's hum is caused not by earthquakes or atmospheric turbulence , but by ocean waves colliding with the seafloor .
Now , researchers have pinpointed the source of the Earth's " background noise , " and it looks like it 's coming primarily from the Pacific coast of North America .
When two waves of opposite direction but similar frequency collide , they create a special kind of pressure wave that carries energy to the ocean bottom .
As these waves pound against the sea floor , they generate a constant vibration with a frequency of about 10 millihertz , much too low for humans to hear but easily detectable with seismometers .
By comparing the intensity of the hum with the height of waves around the world , scientists can track where the buzz is coming from .
Previous studies suggested that waves from both shallow continental shelves and the deep ocean contribute to the Earth 's hum , but new data indicates otherwise .
Based on measurements from a seismic observatory called the USArray EarthScope , most of the hum appears to originate from the Pacific coast of North America , with a smaller contribution from the west coast of Europe .
Waves from the deep ocean do n't seem to make much hum at all .
**
The data for this study , published Thursday in Geophysical Research Letters , was gathered from November 2006 to June 2007 , so humming patterns might be different during the summer months .

One of the core concepts of Django is that of loose coupling .
The Django framework is a well - stocked toolkit filled with great tools which work well together , but it makes no effort to force its most - favored software into your project : you can ignore the existing tools and bring your own , if you so choose .
Comparing BeepBeep to Django , one might suggest that the term micro framework is a polite way of saying that BeepBeep is an empty toolkit .
BeepBeep is able and willing glue between your components , but has a strong Bring - Your - Own - Tools philosophy .
In this tutorial we 'll look at a powerful tool you should consider pairing with BeepBeep : CouchDB
Using CouchDB , we 're going to create a very simple blog where we 'll create blog posts by using a form to send HTTP POSTs , and have simple views for listing all the posts and viewing individual posts as well .
It 's unquestionably feature light , but perhaps a bit concept heavy , so let 's get started1 .
You can look at the completed code in the BeepBeep Examples repository on GitHub .
Dependencies & Setup
First , follow the BeepBeep installation instructions if it is n't already installed .
Next , install and configure CouchDB if you have n't already .
Use new_beep.erl to create the project files for BB_Blog .
cd ~/git/beepbeep/ ./script/new_beep.erl
BB_Blog ../ BB_Blog Install erlang_couchdb from its GitHub repository : git clone git://github.com/ngerakines/erlang_couchdb.git
Then make it and copy the resulting beams into the BB_Blog / deps / folder .
cd erlang_couchdb make mkdir ../ BB_Blog/bb_blog/deps/erlang_couchdb mkdir ../BB_Blog/bb_blog/deps/erlang_couchdb/ebin cp ebin/* ../ BB_Blog/bb_blog/deps/erlang_couchdb/ebin/
Please be aware that erlang_couchdb requires Erlang R12B5 or later , so you may need to update your Erlang installation .
The last step in setup is to verify that the dependencies have been installed correctly .
To do this , first we need to build the BB_Blog application .
cd ~/git/BB_Blog/bb_blog/ make
Then start CouchDB in the background .
couchdb &
And start the BB_Blog app server .
cd ~/git/BB_Blog/bb_blog/ ./start-server.sh
And then test out creating a CouchDB database .
2 > erlang_couchdb : create_database ( { " localhost " , 5984 } , " test_db2 " ) . ok
This means that CouchDB is running , erlang_couchdb is running , BeepBeep is running , and everything is gravy .
Excellent .
If something looks different , please post a comment with the error message you received .
Piecing Together Some CouchDB Functionality
In order to use CouchDB as our document store , we 'll need to create a database .
In order to retrieve documents we 'll want to create a Couch DB view .
We might also want a way to clear out the current documents , a way to retrieve a given document , and so on .
We 'll house this functionality in the file src/bb_blog_utils.erl .
I am going to skim over the details of this file , so if you have n't used Couch DB before , you may want to take a look at the documentation .
- module ( bb_blog_utils ) . - export ( [ create_db / 0 , delete_db / 0 , info_db / 0 , reset_db / 0 ] ) . - export ( [ create_document / 3 , delete_document / 2 , documents / 0 , documents / 2 , document / 1 ] ) .
- define ( COUCHDB_CONN , { " localhost " , 5984 } ) . - define ( BB_BLOG_DB , " bb_blog " ) . % Create a database in CouchDB , and then generate % a CouchDB view for querying documents by slug .
create_db ( ) -> erlang_couchdb : create_database ( ?
COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB ) , erlang_couchdb : create_view ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB , " _blog " , << " javascript " >> , [{ << " entries " >> , << " function ( doc ) { emit( doc.slug , doc ) } " >> } ] ) . %
Drop the database , including all documents and views .
delete_db ( ) -> erlang_couchdb : delete_database ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB ) . %
Retrieve the current status of the database .
info_db ( ) -> io : format ( " ~p " , [ erlang_couchdb : database_info ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB ) ] ) . % Delete and then recreate the database .
reset_db ( ) -> delete_db ( ) , create_db ( ) . % Create a blog entry in the database .
create_document ( Title , Slug , Body ) -> erlang_couchdb : create_document ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB , [{ << " title " >> , list_to_binary ( Title ) } , { << " slug " >> , list_to_binary ( Slug ) } , { << " body " >> , list_to_binary ( Body ) } ] ) . %
Delete a blog entry from the database .
delete_document ( Id , Rev ) -> erlang_couchdb : delete_document ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?
BB_BLOG_DB , Id , Rev ) . %
Retrieve up to the first ten documents in the _blog / entries view .
documents ( ) -> documents ( 0 , 10 ) . % Retrieve documents Offset - Offset + Limit from _blog / entries view .
documents ( Offset , Limit ) ->
Attrs = [{ " skip " , Offset } , { " limit " , Limit } ] , Resp = erlang_couchdb : invoke_view ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB , " _blog " , " entries " , Attrs ) , { json , { struct , Data }} = Resp , Data . %
Retrieve a given document by its slug .
document ( Slug ) ->
Attrs = [ { " key " , lists : concat ( [ " \ " " , Slug , " \ " " ] ) } ] , Resp = erlang_couchdb : invoke_view ( ? COUCHDB_CONN , ?BB_BLOG_DB , " _blog " , " entries " , Attrs ) , { json , { struct , Data }} = Resp , Rows = proplists : get_value ( << " rows " >> , Data ) , [{ struct , Row } ] = Rows , Row .
Now go ahead and make the application again ,
make
You can test the interface out quickly by running ./ start - server.sh and then trying these commands :
26 > bb_blog_utils : create_db ( ) . { json , {struct , [{ < < " error " > > , < < " conflict " >>} , { < < " reason " >>,<<" Document update conflict . " >>} ]}} 27 > bb_blog_utils : delete_db ( ) . ok 28 > bb_blog_utils : create_db ( ) . { json , {struct , [{ < < " ok " >>, true} , {<<" id " >>,<<" _design /_blog " >>} , { < < " rev " >>,<<" 1-800947609 " >>} ]}} 29 > bb_blog_utils : create_document ( " Title " , " slug " , " < p > some text < / p > " ) . { json , {struct , [{ < < " ok " >>, true} , {<<" id " >>,<<" 94f2f8eb0a94959454c3bfdbcdaa54e0 " >>} , { < < " rev " >>,<<" 1-304401008 " >>} ]}} 30 > bb_blog_utils : info_db ( ) . {ok , [{ < < " db_name " >> , << " bb_blog " >>} , { <<" doc_count " >>, 2} , {<<" doc_del_count " >>,0} , {<<" update_seq " >>, 2} , {<<" purge_seq " >>,0} , {<<" compact_running " >> , false} , {<<" disk_size " >>,14595} , {<<" instance_start_time " >>,<<" 1247033421520632 " >>}]
}ok
Now our interface to CouchDB is prepared , and we just need to do ... everything else .
Teaching start - server.sh Some New Tricks
The first step in the reworking will be to make the start - server.sh script a bit more flexible .
After extended it will let us create the CouchDB database , check the status of the database , and also reset the database , all from the command line .
mv start - server.sh manage.sh emacs manage.sh
Replace the current code with this :
#!/bin/sh cd ` dirname $ 0 ` case $ 1 in #!/ bin/sh cd ` dirname $ 0 ` case $ 1 in server ) exec erl - pa $ PWD / ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ ebin - boot start_sasl -s reloader \ -s bb_blog - detached ;; dev_server ) exec erl - pa $ PWD / ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ ebin - boot start_sasl -s reloader \ -s bb_blog - detached ;; create_db ) echo " create database ... " exec erl - pa $ PWD /ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ebin - run bb_blog_utils create_db \ - run init stop - noshell ;; delete_db ) echo " delete database ... " exec erl - pa $ PWD /ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ebin - run bb_blog_utils delete_db \ - run init stop - noshell ;; reset_db ) echo " reset database ... " exec erl - pa $ PWD / ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ebin - run bb_blog_utils reset_db \ - run init stop - noshell ;; info_db ) echo " info for database ... " exec erl - pa $ PWD /ebin $ PWD / deps /*/ebin - run bb_blog_utils info_db \ - run init stop - noshell ;; * ) echo " Usage : $ 0 { server|dev_server|create_db|delete_db|reset_db|info_db} " exit 1 esac exit 0
After saving the file , you can test out the new manage.sh script .
will - larsons - macbook : bb_blog will $ ./manage.sh create_db create database ... will - larsons - macbook : bb_blog will $ ./manage.sh reset_db reset database ... will - larsons - macbook : bb_blog will $ ./ manage.sh info_db info for database ... { ok , [{ < < " db_name " >> , << " bb_blog " >>} , { <<" doc_count " >>,0} , {<<" doc_del_count " >>,0} , {<<" update_seq " >>,0} , {<<" compact_running " >> , false} , { <<" disk_size " >>,4096} ] } will - larsons - macbook : bb_blog will $ ./manage.sh server
Note that the distinction between server and dev_server is that server runs in - detached mode , and dev_server runs in the current console .
Extending BB_Blog to Display Blog Entries
To display blog entries we will need to make two controllers , two implementations of handle_request and three templates .
First let 's create the index page , which will allow users to view all existing blog entries .
Go ahead and open up src/home_controller.erl and replace the curernt contents with :
- module ( home_controller , [ Env ] ) .
- export ( [ handle_request / 2 ] ) .
handle_request ( " index " , [ ] ) ->
Data = bb_blog_utils : documents ( ) , RawRows = proplists : get_value ( << " rows " >> , Data ) , Rows = lists : map ( fun ( { struct , X } ) -> { struct , Row } = proplists : get_value ( << " value " >> , X ) , CleanRow = lists : map ( fun ({ Key , Value } ) -> { list_to_atom ( binary_to_list ( Key ) ) , Value } end , Row ) , CleanRow end , RawRows ) , { render , " home/index.html " , [{ rows , Rows }]} .
This is a bit ugly , largely as a result of the format for deserialized JSON .
It could undoubtedly be cleaned up a bit , but very simply it :
Retrieves the documents from CouchDB .
Transforms the CouchDB documents into an ErlyDLT friendly format .
Renders the home / index.html template with the transformed documents .
A quick debugging tip : if you add lines like :
error_logger : info_report ( Data ) ,
to your BeepBeep code and run in dev_server mode ( i.e. with the server attached to a console ) , then you 'll be able to see the incoming data quite handily .
Sure printing to console is n't the most advanced debugging technique , but it 's rather handy when you 're stuck trying to remember the awkward format of those deserialized JSON datastructures .
Relying on our CouchDB utility functions , the logic here is pretty concise .
Then we need to tweak views / base . html to clean up the default template a bit :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > < meta http-equiv= " content - type " content= " text/html;charset=UTF - 8 " /> < title > BB_Blog : Rational Exuberance </ title > < link href= " / stylesheets/style.css " rel= " stylesheet " type= " text/css " /> </ head > < body > { % block content %}{ % endblock %} </body > </html >
And also tweak views / home /index.html :
{ % extends " ../base.html " %} { % block content %} { % for row in rows %} < div class= " doc " > < h1 >< a href= " / blog / view / {{ row.slug }} / " > {{ row.
title }} </a></h1 > </div > { % endfor %} { % endblock %}
Then make the code and navigate to http://localhost:8000 .
It should display a simple list of blog entries .
Huzzah !
This is a good time to throw away views / home / show.html , since we do n't need it .
rm views / home / show.html
The last step in displaying the blog entries is we want to create a controller and view pair to display the individual entries based on their slug .
Go ahead and create src/blog_controller.erl .
- module ( blog_controller , [ Env ] ) .
- export ( [ handle_request / 2 ] ) .
handle_request ( " view " , [ Slug ] ) ->
Resp = bb_blog_utils : document ( Slug ) , error_logger : info_report ( Resp ) , { struct , Doc } = proplists : get_value ( << " value " >> , Resp ) , CleanDoc = lists : map ( fun ( { K , V } ) -> { list_to_atom ( binary_to_list ( K ) ) , V } end , Doc ) , { render , " blog/view.html " , [ { doc , CleanDoc }]} ;
Since we 're only dealing with one result , the cleaning process is a bit more compact this time .
Next , we need to create the blog / view . html view .
mkdir views / blog emacs views / blog/view.html
And populate it with these contents :
{ % extends " ../base.html " %} { % block content %} < div id= " doc " > < h1 >< a href= " / blog / view / {{ doc.slug }} / " > {{ doc.title }} </a></h1 > < div class= " body " > {{ doc.body }} </div > </div > { % endblock %}
Then make the source once more , jump on over to http://localhost:8000 , and then click on one of the ( or , more likely , the ) document we created earlier to view it in its full glory .
The One Where We Can Create Blog Entries
Now that we can view blog entries , it would be mighty helpful if we could actually create blog entries as well .
So , let 's get cracking on that .
Note that this section introduces something a bit new , which is how to manage data received in POST requests via BeepBeep .
Return to the src/ blog_controller.erl and add this request handler :
handle_request ( " create " , [ ] ) ->
Title = beepbeep_args : get_param ( " title " , Env ) , Slug = beepbeep_args : get_param ( " slug " , Env ) , Body = beepbeep_args : get_param ( " body " , Env ) , case lists : member ( " " , [ Title , Slug , Body ] ) of true -> { render , " blog/create.html " , [ ]} ; false -> bb_blog_utils : create_document ( Title , Slug , Body ) , { redirect , lists : concat ( [ " / blog/ view / " , Slug , " / " ] ) } end .
You 'll also need to change the ending .
to an ending ; on the existing implementation of handle_request .
Then go ahead and create the views / blog / create .
html template ,
{ % extends " ../base.html " %} { % block content %} < div id= " create " > < h2 > Create New Blog Entry </ h2 > < form method= " POST " action= " / blog / create / " > < label for= " title " >
Title : </ label >< input name= " title " >< br /> < label for= " slug " > Slug : </ label >< input name= " slug " >< br/> < label for= " body " > Body </ label ><br /> < textarea name= " body " ></textarea ><br/> < input type= " submit " value= " Create " > </ form > </div > { % endblock %}
With that , make the code , and head off to http://localhost:8000/blog/create/ to get started with your blogging ... your painfully limited and awkward blogging .
The End
With this third BeepBeep tutorial , we 're approaching a point where we 've covered many of the tools needed to create a legitimate web application .
Throughout this tutorial I cut away features that I wanted to cover , because this was really about showcasing using CouchDB with BeepBeep , rather than trying to build a servicable blog application .
As such , due apologies for the minimal ending state , but hopefully it was educational nonetheless .

The successful flight of SpaceShipOne on 29 September 2004 , the first of two flights en route to winning the $ 10 million Ansari X prize , seemed to usher in a new era of space travel – one in which space flight would be affordable , frequent and , perhaps most importantly , accessible to all .
SpaceShipOne was the first crewed spacecraft to be developed privately .
Designed , built and flown on a budget of roughly $ 25 million , it was much cheaper than the multibillion - dollar US government - backed space shuttle .
In its climb to just over 111 kilometres above the Earth , SpaceShipOne broke the world altitude record for a winged vehicle , set more than 40 years earlier by NASA ’s X - 15 rocket plane .
It was also fully reusable , a feature long seen as an essential milestone on the path to a more accessible spacefaring future .
And yet , five years on , it is easy to regard SpaceShipOne as more anomaly than herald .
After making two sub-orbital flights in two weeks , it never flew again : the craft now hangs in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC .
The Spaceship Company , a partnership between SpaceShipOne creator Burt Rutan and airline tycoon Richard Branson has yet to unveil the larger , passenger - ready SpaceShipTwo , although the company has revealed the carrier aircraft needed to launch it on its way to space .

President Obama on Monday called a new GI Bill offering college tuition assistance to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan “ an investment in our own country . ”
The new law is expected to offer veterans $ 78 billion in benefits over the coming decade .
It is the most comprehensive education benefit offered to veterans since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the original GI Bill for World War II veterans in 1944 .
The new GI Bill is “ not simply a debt that we are repaying to the remarkable men and women who have served , ” Obama said at a ceremony at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va .
“ It is an investment in our own country . ”
The maximum benefit available under a law that took effect Saturday will cover the full tuition at a public college or university for four years for each eligible veteran , reservist and National Guard member .
It also offers a monthly housing stipend and as much as $ 1,000 a year for books .

For those attending a private institution or graduate school , about 1,100 schools are offering additional scholarships matched by the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Under the Yellow Ribbon Program , a provision of the new GI Bill , support is available for tuition that exceeds the highest public in - state undergraduate tuition .
The VA already has processed more than 112,000 claims for tuition under the new GI Bill , which the president called a tribute to “ the men and women who have served since 9/11 . ”
“ While our discourse often produced more heat than light , especially here in Washington , they have put their very lives on the line for America .
They have borne the responsibility of war , ” Obama said .
“ And now , with this policy , we are making it clear that the United States of America must reward responsibility , and not irresponsibility .
Now , with this policy , we are letting those who have borne the heaviest burden lead us into the 21st century . ”

Under the new law , service members who agree to serve four more years in the military also can opt to transfer the tuition benefit to their spouse or children .
It ’s anticipated that nearly half a million veterans or family members could participate in the first year .
Though the law has been widely praised by veterans groups , concerns also have been raised that universities and the VA could be overwhelmed because of the complexity of the benefit .
There have been complaints that veterans attending private schools in states that offer low public tuition face a huge disparity in what they can collect .

The benefits range from 40 % of the state tuition for those with at least 90 days but less than six months of service since Sept. 11 , 2001 , to 100 % for those with at least 36 months of aggregate service , or 30 continuous days and a discharge because of a service - related disability .

Dates in Interaction Design – Actual Research !
Introduction
Many web sites – particularly those concerned with travel – ask users to provide one or more dates .
In most cases this is done either by selecting a date from a popup calendar or by entering it as text .
The text field itself will often include a template showing how the date is to be entered , for example dd / mm / yy in the UK ( see the Expedia . co.uk example below ) .
Unfortunately , people in a hurry or those visiting several sites in quick succession – often with differing date formats – may not type dates exactly as requested .
An alarming number of sites still handle this badly from a user - experience perspective .
British Airways , for example , does not allow enough characters in the field to accommodate the full year ( so if 22/07/2009 is entered the field shows just 22/07/20 , which is interpreted as 2020 - thanks a bunch ) .
Lufthansa , on the other hand , takes great exception to the omission of leading zeros .

The really frustrating thing , to my mind at least , is that it would be a lot easier for developers to interpret dates intelligently than to present an error message and reload the page .
( Ajax or Dynamic HTML can make this a little less painful , but not much . )
To compound the foolishness of web sites complaining about dates is the fact that it is really discouraging to potential customers to have to spend time dealing with such pedantries .
People have been writing dates for several thousand years and while there are important variations ( like the order of day , month and year ) omitting leading zeroes or providing more digits in the year than asked for ( as in the BA example ) is only a problem when it comes to poor interaction design .
The Study
To investigate this issue , I conducted a survey in June 2009 of nearly 1,000 people , asking them simply how they would write a given date ( ‘ the second of August this year ’ was how it was phrased ) .
They typed their answer into a free - format text field .
Respondents were then invited to choose the closest ‘ template ’ date from a list of 32 – half of which were in day / month / year order and the other half month / day / year ( ‘ other ’ was the final option ) .
Participants were recruited from a number of US and UK email lists , mostly HCI , usability and user - experience related .
For this reason , list members were also asked to distribute the participation request to non-technical colleagues , friends and relatives .
The Results
988 valid responses were received ( a small number of ambiguous results were deleted ) .
Responses were checked and adjusted so that the ‘ template ’ date selected matched the date entered in the type - in field .
The results are charted below by date format : month / day / year ( 435 responses ) , day / month / year ( 518 responses ) and year / month / day ( 30 responses ) .
The percentages shown are relative to each group .
( Note that the actual punctuation used in the type - in fields may differ from the templates .
For example , some dates were written 2 -8-09 .
Also , the use of ‘ 2nd ’ has been taken simply as ‘ 2 ’ .
In all cases , the order of date fields , the use of month – numeric , abbreviated or full – and the presence or absence of leading zeros has been accurately reflected in the results . )
% Participants by Date Format ( month / day / year order , n = 435 )
% Participants by Date Format ( day / month / year order , n = 518 )
% Participants by Date Format ( year / month / day order , n = 30 )
As can be seen from the above , a wide variety of date formats were invoked .
Participants who used month / day / year ordering had a slightly stronger preference for a purely numerical date with no leading zeros in the month or day ( 8/2/09 ) but the close second used the full month name ( August 2 2009 ) .
These two categories accounted for 53 % of that group .
Participants using day / month / year ordering were somewhat less ambivalent in their most popular format : full month name with no leading zero ( 2 August 2009 ) .
The next three runners - up were permutations of numerical dates with and without leading zeros .
Those who used year / month / day ordering ( of which there were only 30 ) mostly preferred the ISO standard date format ( 2009-08-02 ) .
Numerical summaries of the use of leading zeros , month and year designations appear in the tables that follow .

( Notes on the tables : Leading zeros are counted for day and month fields .
There is only one leading zero possible when the month is not written in Arabic numerals .
FullYear is 0 for ‘ 09 ’ and 1 for ‘ 2009 ’ .
Five participants wrote the year as ‘ 9 ’ , for but simplicity of analysis , these were counted as ‘ 09 ’ . )
Finally , to ascertain whether technically - minded participants might favour certain characteristics of date formats over others , respondents were asked if their main field or work or study was in science or technology .
Responses were on a five - point scale from ‘ 1 = strongly agree ’ to ‘ 5 = strongly disagree ’ ) :
DateFormat * SciTech Crosstabulation SciTech Total 1 2 3 4 5 DateFormat month / day / year Count 160 93 17 62 103 435 % within DateFormat 36.8 % 21.4 % 3.9 % 14.3 % 23.7 % 100.0 % day / month / year Count 228 101 25 82 82 518 % within DateFormat 44.0 % 19.5 % 4.8 % 15.8 % 15.8 % 100.0 % year / month / day Count 18 10 1 0 1 30 % within DateFormat 60.0 % 33.3 % 3.3 % .0 % 3.3 % 100.0 % Total Count 406 204 43 144 186 983 % within DateFormat 41.3 % 20.8 % 4.4 % 14.6 % 18.9 % 100.0 %
This table shows that 62 % of respondents had a scientific or technological leaning ( categories 1 and 2 ) .
However , aside from a small number being prone to using year / month / day format , separate analyses of variance show no significant relationships with factors such as the use of leading zeros , month or year designations .
Discussion
Overall , 76 % of respondents made no use of leading zeros .
So , it ’s official – do n’t reprimand users for failing to supply leading zeros in date fields .
Other results are interesting but less useful in interaction design : 54 % of all respondents used Arabic numerals for the month and 62 % preferred full four - digit years to the two - digit variety ( these are measured independently so it is no surprise that the total is more than 100 % ) .
So , if you are dealing with dates and users have no artifact to work from ( such as a credit card ) , numeric dates with a four - digit year might be the way to go .
However , if you are asking people to enter dates from another source ( credit card , form , email and so on ) do take account of what they are looking at and allow for variations .
In any event , only complain if you really cannot make sense of what has been entered .
( Do not take this as a license to use three drop - down fields .
This is very inefficient compared to typing a date in .
Also , do n’t forget that your solution needs to work for assistive technologies such as screen readers . )

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 4 , 2009
On July 3rd , 2009 , Governor Sarah Palin announced her intent to resign her gubernatorial duties and transfer the powers of Governor to Lt. Governor Sean Parnell .
Almost immediately afterwards , several unscrupulous people have asserted false and defamatory allegations that the " real " reasons for Governor Palin ’s resignation stem from an alleged criminal investigation pertaining to the construction of the Wasilla Sports Complex .
This canard was first floated by Democrat operatives in September 2008 during the national campaign and followed up by sympathetic Democratic writers .
1 .
It was easily rebutted then as one of many fabrications about Sarah Palin .
Just as power abhors a vacuum , modern journalism apparently abhors any type of due diligence and fact checking before scurrilous allegations are repeated as fact .
The history of the Wasilla Sports Complex is publicly known .
Contrary to the insinuation that as Mayor of Wasilla , Sarah Palin " personally " oversaw bidding , construction , funding and accounting for the project ( and thus , the allegation goes , " embezzled " from the project ) , the truth is far more mundane , and publicly available :
Curtis D. Menard was instrumental in spearheading the effort from conception to realization of the Wasilla Sports Complex .
He directed the steering committee that was responsible for placing the issue before the voters of Wasilla and subsequently passed .
He remained chairman of that committee through the design and construction of the facility .
He was an ardent supporter and leader of civic , educational and athletic endeavors within the community as well as an advocate of the continued success of the Sports Center .
http://www.cityofwasilla.com/...
Thus , as any basic fact checker would learn , the Mayor of Wasilla is not listed as " chair " of the Steering Committee .
As Mayor , Governor Palin did appoint the committee , another fact readily verifiable , and she was publicly on record supporting the need for such a facility — as was most of Wasilla .
" Wasilla weighs sports facility " published December 6 , 2001 and available at http://www.adn.com/...
While her public support of this project was deemed pivotal by many , the actual construction , bidding , financing and other day - to - day management of the project was not in her scope of authority as Mayor .
In addition , Sarah Palin was then criticized by some of not showing enough interest in the project .
The Frontiersman reported that at a public meeting with the Chamber of Commerce , an opponent of the project " accused Wasilla Mayor Sarah Palin of staying quiet about the arena because of her campaign for Lieutenant Governor . "
" Sports Arena Campaign gets Rolling " http://www.frontiersman.com/... ( February 22 , 2002 ) .
Further , this was a highly public project , approved by the voters , and subject to public bid requirements .
As described by the City of Wasilla itself :
The city uses competitive means for the purchase of all goods and services as required by Wasilla Municipal Code 5.08 .
The city also utilizes contracts and price agreements established by the State of Alaska , the Western States Contracting Alliance and other cooperatives or agencies when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the City .
The city believes in open , fair competition and strives to ensure that all vendors have equal opportunity to compete for city business .
The City of Wasilla operates under a decentralized purchasing system .
This means purchasing decision up to $ 5,000 is made independently by the departments in the city ( with the exception of Management Information System purchases ) .
When the estimated amount for goods or services is between $ 5,000 and $ 9,999 , departments are required to obtain three quotes prior to purchase .
The departments may utilize the services of the Purchasing / Contracting Officer ( PCO ) for this process or may do it themselves ; however , when this processed is selected , the PCO must sign off on the final product prior to purchasing or contracting .
For purchases beyond $ 10,000 , the city requires all departments to contact the PCO who will utilize the city 's bid process according to Wasilla Municipal Code 5.08 .
The bid process is initiated through either an Invitation to Bid ( ITB ) , utilized when the city knows the specifications for the purchase ; or a Request for Proposal ( RFP ) , utilized when the exact specifications or process is unknown .
http://www.cityofwasilla.com/...
Accordingly , the Sports Complex was publicly bid , in accordance with City and state law , and was accounted for in the time and manner all public projects are handled .
The Mayor of Wasilla , be it Sarah Palin , or her successor , did not handle the funds , or the materials , for this project .
To thus suggest she " embezzled " is as false as it is impossible .
The additional claim of " proof " of wrongdoing is the allegation that the Palins purchased building materials from Spenard Builders Supply — and that this company may have provided supplies for the Sports Complex .
Prior to the construction of Lowe ’s and Home Depot within the last few years in Wasilla , Spenard Builders Supply was the primary building supply company in Wasilla .
It can hardly come as a surprise that it would sell materials to small homeowners or that it would also bid to supply commercial contracts .
One would be hard pressed to find a home , cabin or outbuilding in the Mat - Su Valley in which Spenard Builders Supply did not sell at least some of the materials .
The Palins built their Lake Lucille house using Todd as the general contractor .
Todd ’s family owns a hardware and building supply business in Dillingham .
He is no stranger to construction , or to rolling up his sleeves and doing work .
The Palins used a combination of personal savings , equity from the sale of their prior home , and conventional bank financing to build the house — like millions of American families .
The deeds of trust are recordable public records .
Basic journalism and fact checking would confirm this .
The Sports Complex was built in 2002 .
It is now 2009 .
While the Federal Government has a process to follow , and that process sometimes takes time , we can categorically state that we are not aware of any " federal investigation " that has been " pending " for the last seven years .
We are aware of no subpoenas on SBS regarding the Palins .
We are aware that the Federal Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have been helpful , responsive and diligent in prosecuting the email hacker and in cleaning up Alaska ’s corrupt legislators .
To be blunt — this " story " was alleged during the campaign , evaluated then by national media and deemed meritless .
Nothing has changed .
To the extent several websites , most notably liberal Alaska blogger Shannyn Moore , are now claiming as " fact " that Governor Palin resigned because she is " under federal investigation " for embezzlement or other criminal wrongdoing , we will be exploring legal options this week to address such defamation .
This is to provide notice to Ms. Moore , and those who re-publish the defamation , such as Huffington Post , MSNBC , the New York Times and The Washington Post , that the Palins will not allow them to propagate defamatory material without answering to this in a court of law .
The Alaska Constitution protects the right of free speech , while simultaneously holding those " responsible for the abuse of that right . "
Alaska Constitution Art. I , Sec. 5 . http://ltgov.state.ak.us/...
These falsehoods abuse the right to free speech ; continuing to publish these falsehoods of criminal activity is reckless , done without any regard for the truth , and is actionable .

Governor Sarah Palin
Hidden within the language of the House Democrats ’ Health Care Bill is a provision that would effectively destroy the market for private health insurance :
It did n’t take long to run into an “ uh - oh ” moment when reading the House ’s “ health care for all Americans ” bill .
Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal .
When we first saw the paragraph Tuesday , just after the 1,018 - page document was released , we thought we surely must be misreading it .
So we sought help from the House Ways and Means Committee .
It turns out we were right :
The provision would indeed outlaw individual private coverage .
Under the Orwellian header of “ Protecting The Choice To Keep Current Coverage , ” the “ Limitation On New Enrollment ” section of the bill clearly states : “ Except as provided in this paragraph , the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day ” of the year the legislation becomes law .
So we can all keep our coverage , just as promised — with , of course , exceptions :
Those who currently have private individual coverage wo n’t be able to change it .
Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers .
In other words , if this bill passes , you would be able to keep your current health insurance as Obama promises , but you would n’t be able to make any changes to it beyond adding or deleting new dependents , and the insurance company would n’t be able to increase premiums for specific risk groups without raising everyone ’s premiums by the same amount , and they wo n’t be able to accept any new customers under the existing plan .
Instead , they ’d have to offer plans that comply with the rules set forth in the Democrats ’ bill .
This is a great move for the US .
It cuts out companies offering extortionate plans to vulnerable citizens .
They ’ll have to comply with the new rules .
On the new scheme , you ’ll be able to Compare private health insurance quotes in seconds !
You can read the language for yourself , just go page 16 .
Ed Morrissey is spot - on in describing what the impact of this part of the legislation would be :
[ It ] will have the effect of forcing millions of people into the public plan whether they want it or not .
Even worse , if insurers get barred from attracting new customers — which this clause outlaws — then they will eventually see their rolls drained , thanks to the natural flow of the market as employers drop plans and skip the expense of offering medical insurance .
It wo n’t take long at all for insurers to exit the market and leave the field for just the public plan , which will automatically get the customers of each individual insurer as they close up shop .
Does this bill outlaw private insurance ?
Literally , no , but in practical terms , it makes it an endangered species and creates an American single - payer system by default .
The good news ?
It looks like the Blue Dog Democrats are joining Republican efforts to fight the worst parts of Obamacare :
Centrist Democrats are threatening to oppose their party ’s healthcare legislation unless House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) accepts changes that make the bill more to their liking .
Seven Blue Dogs on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have banded together to draft amendments that they ’ll co-sponsor in the committee markup , which starts Thursday .
Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) , the Blue Dogs ’ point man on healthcare , says if those changes are n’t accepted , they ’ll vote down the bill .
“ We cannot support the current bill , ” Ross said .
“ Last time I checked , it took seven Democrats to stop a bill in Energy and Commerce . ” …
Blue
Dogs think the bill fails to do enough to reduce healthcare costs , jeopardizes jobs with a fee on employers that do n’t provide health insurance , and would base a government - run healthcare plan on a Medicare payment system that already penalizes their rural districts .
Here ’s hoping that they can stop this monstrosity because , if it passes , it ’s game over .
A Quebec - based soldier says his tour of duty in Afghanistan may be in jeopardy after he was roughed up by Fredericton police officers outside a downtown night club .
Luc Begin , who was in Fredericton celebrating his engagement , has filed a complaint over the incident with the local police and the New Brunswick Police Commission , alleging that he was assaulted .
Begin , normally based at CFB Valcartier in Quebec , told CBC News in an interview on Thursday that he is supposed to go to Afghanistan in October 2010 .
But the infantry private said he suffered a broken vertebra in his back during the altercation and that could cost him his tour of duty .
" I feel bad because [ going to Afghanistan ] is part of my job , " he said .
" Serving my country just like those police — it 's part of their job to protect people , not to beat them up . "
Witnesses , including one with video footage , support Begin 's story .
Just before 1 a.m. on Saturday , Charles LeBlanc , a local blogger , was walking in Fredericton 's downtown bar district when he saw several police officers with Begin in front of Sweetwaters .
LeBlanc captured part of the incident with his video camera .
" He did n't resist .
They walked him about 15 feet and they forced him on the ground , " LeBlanc said .
In LeBlanc 's video , a police officer is heard yelling , " Stop resisting , " and Begin replies , " I 'm not resisting . "
The video shows two officers holding Begin while a third drives his knee into him at least four times .
Barry MacKnight , the chief of the Fredericton police , said on Thursday afternoon that the RCMP will conduct a criminal investigation into Begin 's complaint .
MacKnight said it is important that the Begin probe be seen as impartial and " as open as possible . "
" This is a very important investigation .
This is an important matter .
We take all these complaints against our members seriously , in particular allegations of criminal wrongdoing , " he said .
" So the investigation will take as long as it takes .
Of course , part of my request to the RCMP , I 'll tell you , is that all efforts be made to do it in a very timely manner . "
MacKnight has suspended with pay one of two officers identified by name in Begin 's complaint .
He said this incident , and another alleged assault on a soldier in May , do not " define " the members of his police force .
He also said there 's no pattern of hostility between police and soldiers .
" Any implication that there is an ongoing systemic cultural problem between national defence employees and the Fredericton police is completely baseless , " he told reporters on Thursday .
Complaint filed
In a written complaint , Begin says he did nothing to provoke the reaction .
Begin , who is teaching at the infantry school at CFB Gagetown and is normally posted at CFB Valcartier in Quebec , said he was mistakenly identified by bar staff as a customer who had caused problems two weeks earlier .
As he was leaving the club , he said a police officer asked to speak with him .
Begin said he tried to explain that he was not the person they were looking for , saying he was not in Fredericton when the previous incident happened .
He said he was thrown to the ground and police officers started to hit him and knee him .
Andrew Bedford , another witness of the incident , said he read Begin 's complaint on CBCNews.ca .
" What he was saying matched up with what I saw , and that what happened was n't justified , " he said .
" They said he was resisting arrest .
I did n't see any resisting arrest . "

Has Skype ’s VOIP encryption been broken ?
August 28 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
I have explained before that the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) and other intelligence agencies have found it impossible to intercept Skype ’s instant messaging and voice traffic .
Like other voice - over - Internet protocol ( VOIP ) communications providers , Skype uses technology that converts audio signals to data , and transports them through most of the Internet infrastructure in binary , rather than audio , format .
Furthermore , Skype uses very complex algorithms to encrypt its customers ’ communications .
Skype has repeatedly pointed to the technical complexities of VOIP communications , arguing that it is often technically impossible to facilitate communications interception requests by government authorities .
There are rumors among communications interception specialists that the NSA is offering billions to anyone who can come up with a reliable eavesdropping model for Skype .
Remarkably , on August 25 , a Swiss software developer released what he claims is the source code of a program for tapping into encrypted Skype communications .
I do n’t know whether the source code ( essentially a trojan ) is effective .
He claims it is .
If this is confirmed , then several people in Fort George F. Meade , Maryland , will be really close paying attention .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Goldman Sachs Group , already under fire for reaping record trading profits in the aftermath of the financial crisis , is now fighting to defend one of its biggest sources of revenue -- commodities trading -- with regulators considering setting limits on Wall Street speculators .
Representatives of the firm , along with those of other big investment banks , are scheduled to appear at a series of hearings held by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission starting Tuesday -- part of the Obama administration 's biggest move yet to clamp down on commodities speculation , which has roiled the prices of everything from oil to corn and wheat in recent years .
At issue for Goldman Sachs GS , +2.32 % is a major exemption it enjoys from limits on trading in certain types of agricultural commodities .
Such an exemption is usually reserved for traders classified as " hedgers , " such as farmers or food producers who depend on stable prices for their businesses .
Goldman opened the door for investment banks to apply for a similar status when it won the first exemption 18 years ago to help its big institutional clients in commodity - index trading , or investment in a range of commodities by tracking a major index .
The result , according to some members of Congress , has been a surge in all commodity speculation in the past few years , pushing oil prices near $ 150 a barrel and gold prices above $ 1,000 an ounce .
Speculators ' index trading is " creating price disruptions for producers and consumers , " said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , late last month after the release of a 247 - page report documenting how index traders have made large purchases on the wheat - futures market in Chicago and pushed up futures prices over the past few years .
It 's time for regulators to " change course , rein in commodity index traders and clamp down on excessive speculation that is disrupting commodity prices , " he added .
Besides considering removal of the special exemption , the CFTC , the U.S. futures market regulator , is also thinking of adopting position limits on all commodities , not just in agriculture .
The move could curb the growth of some major commodity exchange - traded funds .
The CFTC " must seriously consider setting strict position limits in the energy market , " said CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler , who worked for Goldman for nearly 20 years before being confirmed in May as the new head of the CFTC .
He added that he has called his staff to research and outline " every authority available to the agency " to protect the markets and the public . "
See related story .
The commission has planned to hold three hearings , including the one Tuesday .
Representatives from Goldman and J.P Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , +1.01 % , the two biggest holders of derivative assets , are scheduled to attend the second hearing on Wednesday .
“ Goldman opened the door for investment banks when it won the first exemption 18 years ago to help its institutional clients in commodity - index trading . ”
' Unintended ' consequences
Goldman argues that any new limits will severely impact liquidity in commodities markets , hurting both large and small investors by reducing their access to these markets .
The bank derives almost half of its revenue from trading commodities , currencies and bonds .
( It does n't break out commodities by themselves . )
" Attempts to regulate volatility have rarely -- if ever -- succeeded , " said Steven Strongin , a Goldman managing director , in testimony delivered last week to a Senate committee regarding Levin 's wheat report .
" Yet they often have unintended and significant consequences . "
Brad Hintz , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. , estimated that commodities trading accounts for about 8 % to 9 % of Goldman 's revenue .
While the percentage is not as big as fixed - income trading , it 's an important sector for Goldman because " there are only a handful of major players . "
" It 's a powerful , powerful piece of the firm , " said Hintz .
The CFTC 's rule - making process is still in its early stages , and it's not clear whether the hearings will ultimately lead to the adoption of new rules .
Michael Duvally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs , declined to comment .
At the crux of the debate are the so - called commodity index investments , the total value of which has been estimated by MarketWatch at about $ 150 billion .
See earlier story on the analysis .
The business started in 1991 , when Goldman advised a big pension fund to invest $ 100 million in commodities by tracking the widely followed GSCI , as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has come to be known .
The swap
The investment was essentially a bet on the index :
If the index rose , Goldman would be required to make payments to the pension fund .
To protect itself against the risk , Goldman , through its commodities - trading arm J. Aron & Co. , planned to establish similar buying positions in commodities futures markets .
If commodity prices rose , Goldman 's gain in futures markets would offset the payments it had to make to the pension fund .
The so - called swap plan had a major obstacle .
Federal rules limit the number of positions a trader can take in some agriculture commodities , such as corn , wheat and soybeans .
While no limits were set in other commodities , the agricultural limits would sabotage the whole swap plan , since index investment covers a range of commodities and a limit in one represents a limit in the whole investment plan .
J. Aron applied for exemption , arguing that the firm should not be treated as a speculator but as a " bona fide hedger " -- a classification usually reserved for farmers , processors or food producers who enter the futures market to hedge their risks in physical commodities trading .
The CFTC , in a letter to J. Aron dated Oct. 18 , 1991 , granted J. Aron the exemption .
A copy of the letter was obtained by MarketWatch .
See the CFTC letter .
Similar exemptions were granted to other swap dealers , most of them big investment companies .
With the help of swap dealers , more institutional investors have diversified their portfolios into commodities to hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar .
Their positions have grown so large that legislators and analysts said the trend was pushing commodity prices to levels that could n't be justified by fundamentals .
See earlier story on passive investment .
In a statement released earlier this month , CFTC Chairman Gensler said the agency is considering " applying position limits consistently across all markets and participants , including index traders and managers of exchange - traded funds . "
Goldman 's Strongin , in testimony before Levin , said passive investment in commodity markets is " a crucial source " of market liquidity , and it was " inappropriately characterized as speculators with no real economic interest in these markets . "
Strongin , who had served as a member of the policy committee for the GSCI index , said index investors " rarely invest based on short - term speculative market views " and " aim to earn a reasonable long - run return . "
Setting limits
While the CFTC is considering withdrawing the exemption , it 's also considering whether to expand speculation limits to cover all commodity futures , such as oil , metals and natural gas .
Such limits in all commodities could pose another blow to Goldman , which makes billions of dollars in direct commodities trading .
Goldman 's revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities trading stood at $ 6.8 billion in the quarter ended in June , or nearly 50 % of the quarter 's total revenue .
Setting rules on commodities speculation is " certainly not good news for Goldman , " according to Jeffery Harte , analyst at Sandler O'Neill .
" But the devil is in the details .
How are you going to specifically define speculators ?
We just do n't know yet . "
The impact of expanding speculative limits to all commodities would jeopardize the unlimited access to futures markets that some popular commodity exchange - traded funds now have .
The United States Oil Fund USO , +2.23 % and the United States Natural Gas Fund UNG , +0.54 % , the two biggest energy ETFs , hold significant positions in energy futures .
Putting position limits on energy futures could also hamper the ability of producers and refiners to hedge their risks .
Energy users and retailers sometimes go to a swap dealer to make customized trades , instead of using a standardized futures market .
The swap dealer will then go to the futures market to hedge its own risk .
" I will be concerned about artificially limiting the size of positions , " said Jeffrey Mayer , chief executive manager of MXenergy , one of the biggest independent retailers of natural gas in the U.S.
" The CFTC should make sure all positions are reported and the categories be broken down more carefully to sort out speculators from commercial hedging interest . "
The CFTC had said it will enhance its weekly Commitments of Traders report to separate and categorize swap dealers .
The improved COT report also will distinguish professionally managed market positions , such as those of hedge funds .
China protest reels in around 140 dead , 800 injured
Chinese police authorities and Muslim Uighur protesters clashed in China ’s Xinjiang region on Sunday , leading to the deaths of at least 140 people , with more than 800 others injured .
Local media are reporting that the number of deaths resulting from the incident is still climbing .
Authorities have put the city of Urumqi under marshal law since Monday , when more than 1,000 protesters armed with knives and sticks started burning buses and cars in the city ’s main bazaar .
The Sunday protest was calling for the arrest of the Han Chinese murderers of two Muslim Uighur men who were killed in a fight between the two ethnic groups when an Uighur male was supposedly wrongfully accused of assaulting a female Han Chinese in the toy company where they were employed .

There ’s nothing like science for giving that objective , white - coat flavoured legitimacy to your prejudices , so it must have been a great day for Telegraph readers when they came across the headline “ Women who dress provocatively more likely to be raped , claim scientists ” .
Ah , scientists .
“ Women who drink alcohol , wear short skirts and are outgoing are more likely to be raped , claim scientists at the University of Leicester . ”
Well there you go .
Oddly , though , the title of the press release for the same research was “ Promiscuous men more likely to rape ” .
Normally we berate journalists for rewriting press releases .
Had the Telegraph found some news ?
I rang Sophia Shaw at the University of Leicester .
She was surprised to have been presented as an expert scientist on the pages of the Daily Telegraph , as Sophia is an MSc student , and this is her dissertation project .
It ’s also not finished .
“ We are intending on getting it published , but my findings are very preliminary . ”
She was discussing her dissertation at an academic conference , when the British Psychological Society ’s PR team picked it up , and put out a press release .
We will discuss that later .
But first , the science .
Shaw spoke to about 100 men , presenting them with various situations around being with a woman , and asking them when they would call it a night , in order to explore men ’s attitudes towards coercing women into sex .
“ I ’m very aware that there are limitations to my study .
It ’s self report data about sensitive issues , so that ’s got its flaws , participants were answering when sober , and so on . ”
But more than that , she told me , every single one of the first four statements made by the Telegraph is a flat , unambiguous , factually incorrect misrepresentation of her findings .
Women who drink alcohol , wear short skirts and are outgoing are more likely to be raped ?
“ We found no evidence that that women who are more outgoing are more likely to be raped , this is completely inaccurate , we found no difference whatsoever .
The alcohol thing is also completely wrong : if anything , we found that men reported they were willing to go further with women who are completely sober . ”
And what about the Telegraph ’s next claim , or rather , the Telegraph ’s reassuringly distant and objective assertion that it is scientists who are now claiming that women who dress provocatively are more likely to be raped ?
“ We have found at the minute that people will go slightly further with women who are provocatively dressed , but this result is not statistically significant .
Basically you ca n’t say that ’s an effect , it could easily be the play of chance .
I told the journalist it is n’t one of our main findings , you ca n’t say that .
It ’s not significant , which is why we ’re not reporting it in our main analysis . ”
So if the Telegraph are throwing blame around with rape , who do we blame for this story , and what do we do about it ?
On the one hand , we ’re not naturally impressed with the newspaper .
“ When I saw the article my heart completely sank , and it made me really angry , given how sensitive this subject is .
To be making claims like the Telegraph did , in my name , places all the blame on women , which is not what we were doing at all .
I just felt really angry about how wrong they ’d got this study . ”
Since I started sniffing around , and Sophia complained , the Telegraph have quietly changed the online copy of the article , although there has been no formal correction , and in any case , it remains inaccurate .
But there is a second , less obvious problem .
Repeatedly , unpublished work – often of a highly speculative and eye - catching nature – is shepherded into newspapers by the press officers of the British Psychological Society , and other organisations .
A rash of news coverage and popular speculation ensues , in a situation where nobody can read the academic work .
I could only get to the reality of what was measured , and how , by personally tracking down and speaking to an MSc student about her dissertation on the phone .
In any situation this would be ridiculous , but in a sensitive area such as rape it is blind , irresponsible , coverage - hungry foolishness .
Update :
Via @jackofkent , here are the articles Richard Alleyne of the Telegraph has written about recently .
I ’m not saying anything .
I ’m just saying .
Is all .

Lashed by liberals and threatened with more government regulation , the insurance industry nevertheless rallied its lobbying and grass - roots resources so successfully in the early stages of the healthcare overhaul deliberations that it is poised to reap a financial windfall .
The half - dozen leading overhaul proposals circulating in Congress would require all citizens to have health insurance , which would guarantee insurers tens of millions of new customers -- many of whom would get government subsidies to help pay the companies ’ premiums .
“ It ’s a bonanza , ” said Robert Laszewski , a health insurance executive for 20 years who now tracks reform legislation as president of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates Inc .
Some insurance company leaders continue to profess concern about the unpredictable course of President Obama ’s massive healthcare initiative , and they vigorously oppose elements of his agenda .
But Laszewski said the industry ’s reaction to early negotiations boiled down to a single word : “ Hallelujah ! ”
The insurers ’ success so far can be explained in part by their lobbying efforts in the nation ’s capital and the districts of key lawmakers .
The bills vary in the degree to which they would empower government to be a competitor and a regulator of private insurance .
But analysts said that based on the way things stand now , insurers would come out ahead .
“ The insurers are going to do quite well , ” said Linda Blumberg , a health policy analyst at the nonpartisan Urban Institute , a Washington think tank .
“ They are going to have this very stable pool , they ’re going to have people getting subsidies to help them buy coverage and . . . they will be paid the full costs of the benefits that they provide -- plus their administrative costs . ”
One of the Democratic proposals that most concerns insurers is the creation of a “ public option ” insurance plan .
The industry launched a campaign on Capitol Hill against it , grounded in a study published by the Lewin Group , a health policy consulting firm that is owned by UnitedHealth Group .
The lobbyists contended that a government - run plan , which would have favorable tax and regulatory treatment , would undermine private insurers .
Opposition increased this month when boisterous critics mobilized at town hall meetings held by members of Congress home for the August recess .
The attacks , supplemented by conservative critics on talk radio and other forums , drew national attention .
Leading insurers , including UnitedHealth , urged their employees around the country to speak out .
Company “ advocacy hot line ” operations and sample letters and statements were made available to an army of insurance industry employees in nearly every congressional district .
Some insurers supplemented the effort with local advertising , often designed to put pressure on specific members of Congress .
Late in the spring , Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina -- the home state of several conservative Blue Dog Democrats -- prepared ads attacking the public option .
Leading Democrats have fought back , with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) last month calling the industry “ immoral ” for its past treatment of customers and suggesting insurers were “ the villains ” in the healthcare debate .
Still , recent support for the public option has declined , and the stock prices of health insurance firms have been rising .
Undermining support for the public option was n’t the only gain scored by insurance lobbyists .
In May , the Senate Finance Committee discussed requiring that insurers reimburse at least 76 % of policyholders ’ medical costs under their most affordable plans .
Now the committee is considering setting that rate as low as 65 % , meaning insurers would be required to cover just about two - thirds of patients ’ healthcare bills .
According to a committee aide , the change was being considered so that companies could hold down premiums for the policies .
Most group health plans cover 80 % to 90 % or more of a policyholder ’s medical bills , according to a report by the Congressional Research Service .
Industry officials urged that the government set the floor lower so insurers could provide flexible , more affordable plans .
“ It is vital that individuals , families and small - business owners have the flexibility to choose an affordable coverage option that best meets their needs , ” said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the industry ’s Washington - based lobbying shop .
Consumer advocates argue that a lower government minimum might quickly become the industry standard , placing a greater financial burden on patients and their families .
“ These are a bad deal for consumers , ” said J. Robert Hunter , a former Texas insurance commissioner who works with the Consumer Federation of America .
Meanwhile , companies would probably see a benefit by providing less insurance “ per premium dollar , ” Hunter said .
“ It would be quite a windfall , ” said Wendell Potter , a former executive at Cigna insurance company who has become an industry whistle - blower .
Consumer and labor advocates acknowledged the industry ’s lobbying success .
In the first half of 2009 , the health service and HMO sector spent nearly $ 35 million lobbying Congress , the White House and federal healthcare offices , according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics .
With more than 900 lobbyists , that sector -- whose top spenders are insurance giants UnitedHealth , Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna -- was poised to spend more than in 2008 , a record lobbying year .
UnitedHealth spent the most , $ 2.5 million in the first half of 2009 , and hired some of Washington ’s most prominent political players , including Tom Daschle , the former Senate majority leader who served as an informal health policy advisor to Obama .
“ They have beaten us six ways to Sunday , ” said Gerald Shea of the AFL - CIO .
“ Any time we want to make a small change to provide cost relief , they find a way to make it more profitable . ”

Hundreds of people have been gathering to pay their respects to what they believe is an image of the Virgin Mary in a tree stump in Co Limerick .
There have been nightly vigils in the grounds of Holy Mary Parish Church in Rathkeale after workers spotted the similarities while cutting down trees .
Those visiting the site believe it depicts an image of the Virgin Mary and believers have come in their hundreds to pray and light candles .
A spokesman for the Limerick diocesan office said the ' Church 's response to phenomena of this type is one of great scepticism . '
' While we do not wish in any way to detract from devotion to Our Lady , we would also wish to avoid anything which might lead to superstition , ' said Fr Paul Finnerty .
Rathkeale Community Council Graveyard Committee chairman Noel
White said workmen sprucing up the church land saw the image when they cut the tree .
' One of the lads said look , our Blessed Lady in the tree , ' Mr White said .
' One of the other lads looked over and actually knelt down and blessed himself , he got such a shock . '
' It was the perfect shape of the figure of Our Lady holding the baby , ' he said .
Now thousands have signed a petition to try to keep the stump in the grounds permanently .
However not everybody is convinced .
' It 's only a tree ' said local parish priest Father Willie Russell .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
City officials in Tehran have agreed to investigate claims that bodies of protesters killed in the unrest that followed Iran 's disputed presidential election were secretly buried in the nation 's largest cemetery , Iranian media reported Sunday .
The city council has formed a committee to look into the allegations reported last week by a reformist news site , said council spokesman Khosrow Daneshjou , according to the Iranian Labor News Agency .
The charges against Iran 's government are the latest by reformists who claim protesters arrested in the aftermath of the June 12 election were raped and tortured .
The government rejected such reports , but still pledged to investigate them if there was evidence .
Last week , Norooz News reported that at least 28 people who died in the violence that followed the June 12 election were buried anonymously in Tehran 's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery .
The Web site said the secret after - hours burials were done in July at section 302 of the cemetery .
A parliamentary committee also was formed to investigate the reports , lawmaker Hamid - Reza Katouzian said in response to the allegations of the secret burials .
Daneshjou , of the Tehran city council , denied any wrongdoing at the cemetery , saying : " Every day there are deaths of individuals in Tehran , whose bodies are unidentified ... "
However , the accusations specifically focus on the bodies of those involved in the protests , who may have died in the streets or in prison .
The government has put the post- election death toll at about 30 , though reformists say it is more than twice that figure .
On Sunday , both Norooz News and Parleman News -- a newsgathering arm for the Path of the Imam ( Khomeini ) faction in parliament -- reported the identity of one woman , Saeida Agahpour , whose family said she was secretly buried in section 302 after authorities took her from her home .
Both sites reported that services were held for Agahpour at the cemetery Saturday , with opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi present .
Moussavi was the chief political rival to hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who was declared the overwhelming winner of the election .

This web site aims to provide an overview of resources concerned with probabilistic modeling , inference and learning based on Gaussian processes .
Although Gaussian processes have a long history in the field of statistics , they seem to have been employed extensively only in niche areas .
With the advent of kernel machines in the machine learning community , models based on Gaussian processes have become commonplace for problems of regression ( kriging ) and classification as well as a host of more specialized applications .

Small claims court is just what it says , a court where small claims are settled in front of a judge .
Many times someone will find themselves in a legal dispute over a contract , damages , wages or a number of other reasons .
The disputed amount does n’t warrant hiring a lawyer but is enough to justify a legal action .
That is why there is small claims court , yet many people think that they cannot represent themselves in a court of law .
That is exactly what happens in small claims court , people represent themselves .
It usually works very well , as long as you are prepared , and is n’t nearly as hard as you might think it is .
Some of the reasons you might find yourself considering filing a legal action in small claims court could be not getting paid your proper amount of wages , a contract dispute for labor , getting your security deposit back from your landlord or damages to your property from a former tenant for example and hundreds of other reasons .
The amounts involved do n’t justify hiring and paying a lawyer .
This is a general outline of a small claims court since each state and sometimes counties have their own small claims court rules .
These limits range from $ 1,500 in Kentucky and Rhode Island to $ 15,000 in Delaware and Georgia .
What about Lawyers in Small Claims Court
Lawyers are not allowed in small claims court under most rules .
There are exceptions , if your opposition is an attorney , you can request that you have a lawyer represent you .
Since it is somewhat unfair to be a non-lawyer and be in small claims court against a lawyer .
But you do n’t have to have a lawyer represent you since the rules of small claims court favor the average person , the person who is not an attorney .
If you have legal questions you need answered , you can consult an attorney outside of the courtroom before you sue and or before you go to small claims court .
Be Prepared
Sometimes you are n’t the person suing in small claims court , but the person being sued .
You have to be prepared either way .
Being prepared enhances your chances of winning your case .
Being prepared gives you confidence and being prepared makes you look professional .
As lawyers like to say , make sure you have all of your ducks lined up .
I have seen people in small claims court look far more professional than many lawyers do .
To fully prepare yourself in small claims court you should do and have the following :
All paperwork and evidence you will need .
Know all the state statutes you will be using in your case .
Have everything neatly sorted and ready to read and to hand to the judge .
Make sure you are suing in the right county .
This is known as the venue , and usually you sue in the county where the violation took place .
Make sure everyone is properly served .
Hire a professional process server and have that person serve everyone you are suing separately .
If you are suing Mr. and Mrs. John Doe , have each of these people served separately .
Each person you are suing needs to be served with their own set of legal papers .
You cannot serve anyone yourself , so hire a process server or even a county sheriff to serve the papers .
You have the power to subpoena paperwork , records and people as witnesses or anything else you might need to prove your case .
For this , you will go to the court and fill out a form , then a judge will review your subpoena request and if granted you can once again use a process server to serve these subpoena papers to the proper person .
Nolo Press has books about small claims court for each state .
You should consider getting one of these for your state and familiarize yourself with everything you need to know about your state laws .
Appeals in Small Claims Court
You can appeal the judge ’s decision if you should lose , and if you win the opposing party can also appeal .
In some states if you lose and you appeal , you must pay the amount you lost into a bond to the court before you can appeal .
Limit the amount of coffee you drink before going to court .
You do n’t need to be that nervous and you never know when your case will be called .
Just because it is set for 9 AM does n’t mean you will be called at that time , you might not get called until 11:30 .
You would hate to be in the bathroom when it ’s your turn .
Dress and look as neatly as possible , be comfortable , polite and confident .
You can be all of those things since you are prepared .

Daimion Pinnock here , SCEA Producer for the WipEout franchise .
As some of you may be aware , the WipEout franchise has been around for a while now , and continues to improve with each new update .
We released WipEout HD last year in stunning 1080 p for $ 19.99 , and it received strong reviews .
This year we have a new release for you all , which is called WipEout HD Fury !!
We announced it the day before E3 , and I ’m sure that you ’ll be very impressed with what the guys at Studio Liverpool have been able to do .
Starting off a small series of posts , I ’m happy to introduce some cool exclusive information about the making of the game and the Fury add - in , coming straight from Dave Glanister , WipEout Fury Ship designer on the WipEout HD development team .
Hello everyone , my name is Dave Glanister and I ’m the WipEout Fury Ship designer , here to give you a little insight into how we created the look of the ships .
Our main aim for the new WipEout Fury ships was to modernize their visual look whilst keeping the DNA of each existing individual team .
On previous WipEout games , a key feature for ship design was its dynamic straight edge and triangular silhouette .
For PSone and PSP this key element was the best way to achieve a great design without using a huge amount of polygons .
Our approach for the Fury ships was to keep the dynamic straight edge design but add to it by dividing the ships body panels up into three main layers .
This new addition to the ships allowed us to overlap , interlock and weave the main ship panels together to achieve a more complex look .
By taking this approach it allowed the designs to show gaps , grooves and negative windows of space that were in - turn filled with real time PS3 self shadows .
This made the ships appear lighter and more hover like without reducing the ships scale or bulk .
To evolve the designs further we replaced the nut and bolt element to the WipEout HD ships by building clean simplified inter-locking mechanical shapes .
This suggested fewer components in the ships build .
Also it gave the ships a tailor - made look and also suggested that the ships parts had been created with new and advanced material .
When viewing the ship design side on , the body panels have been purposely angled forwards to help create a dynamic appearance even when stationary .
As a result the ship ’s profile fights against the horizontal lines of the track ’s surface which helps communicate the notion of an anti-gravity spacecraft .
To help identify the Fury ships within a race we added a second layer to the cockpit .
This gives the impression of extra pilot protection .
Well also placed a blue emissive tint to the cockpit glass which adds energy , notion of power and focal point to the core of every ship design .
That ’s it from me !
Hope you enjoyed reading about what I do :)
I understand that we ’ll have another update for you on WipEout Fury next week by another member of the team here .
In the meantime , have a great weekend .
Andrew Couch rides his bike Monday along a road near his home in Longmont , Colo .
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter By Ed Andrieski , AP
As more riders take to the roads on bicycles , more states are giving them a bigger chunk of pavement — 3 feet to be precise — so they wo n't get swiped by cars .
A Colorado law recently signed by Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter not only requires motorists to give riders at least a 3 - foot - wide berth , it also makes it illegal to throw things at riders , says Dan Grunig , executive director of Bicycle Colorado .
Previously , he says , police could only cite a motorist if they actually hit the rider .
" Cyclists need to be treated with respect and not surprise , " Grunig said .
Tim Anderson , 52 , of Fort Collins , Colo. , says he often is harassed by drivers while riding his bike .
" It ca n't always be that the fastest , heaviest vehicle wins , " he says .
MORE : Cyclists , motorists clash on rights to road The Colorado law is similar to several passed or considered this year in Lousiana , Wisconsin , New Jersey and Texas .
• Louisiana passed a 3 - feet - to - pass law in June .
Motorists who fail to give riders enough room to pass can be fined up to $ 50 .
The law also makes it unlawful to harass , taunt or maliciously throw objects at cyclists .
• Wisconsin lawmakers in June eliminated a requirement that bicyclists ride 3 feet away from parked cars .
The law also prohibits motorists from opening car doors without checking for cyclists .
• New Jersey 's General Assembly passed a 3 - feet - to - pass bill on June 25 .
It is now being considered by the Senate transportation committee .
• Texas lawmakers passed a 3 - feet - to - pass lawbut Republican Gov. Rick Perry vetoed it in June , noting that drivers already face penalties for reckless or careless driving .
A Washington , D.C. , law that took effect March 26 , 2008 , also requires motorists give riders 3 feet of space when passing .
Joe Mizereck of 3 FeetPlease.com says other states with the laws include Arkansas , Maine , Tennessee , Florida , Connecticut , New Hampshire , Oregon , Illinois , Minnesota , Utah , Wisconsin , Arizona and Oklahoma .
The number of bike commuters rose from about 483,145 in 2003 to about 664,859 in 2007 , a 37.6 % increase , according to the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey .
Not everyone supports the new laws .
Larimer County , Colo. , Sheriff James Alderden , who testified against Colorado's 3 - feet - to - pass law , called them " basically impossible " to enforce and said he thinks some bicyclists , " cop an attitude " when it comes to following traffic laws .

A new study into the social networks of Tasmanian devils may help prevent the further spread of an extinction - threatening disease .
The research , published in Ecology Letters , has produced an intricate social network of devil social relationships , revealing how disease can spread through a population .
The Tasmanian devil is the largest marsupial carnivore in existence , yet it is threatened with extinction from a unique infectious cancer known as devil facial tumour disease ( DFTD ) .
Devils are usually solitary animals , and the disease is thought to spread through biting when devils interact aggressively around prey carcasses and during mating season .
A Tasmanian - based team , led by Rodrigo Hamede from the University of Tasmania , have used radio collars to discover the structure of the devil 's contact network , providing an understanding of inter-devil encounters which have a profound effect on the transmission of the disease .
" Measuring individual contact patterns in wild animals is difficult , particularly for nocturnal forest - dwelling species , " said Hamede .
" However this information is critical for understanding animal sociality , disease dynamics and for building epidemiological models . "
Previous studies of devil 's social contacts have been limited to rare field observations during feeding , and since devils mate underground it has also been difficult to gather information on individual mating contacts .
The team attached proximity sensing radio collars to adult devils in Narawntapu National park , a 25 - km² area containing a disease - free devil population .
The collars were fitted to 46 sexually matured devils , 23 males and 23 females .
The collars logged when and for how long any two devils were in close proximity .
The data was downloaded in the field whenever an animal was re-trapped and was used to measure association preferences and the frequency of inter-devil contacts .
" Understanding networks of contacts is crucial because it is usually the case that a small number of highly connected individuals , or ' super spreaders ' , are responsible for the majority of disease transmission , " said Hamede .
" Once these individuals are identified actions such as targeted treatment or culling may control the disease . "
The resulting data revealed that despite devils being solitary animals all individuals were connected to a single social network meaning that all of the collared devils were connected to all other individuals .
This reveals how DFTD is able to spread easily across the entire population .
As predicted some individuals played a very active role within the network demonstrating the threat of ' super spreaders ' .
Also contact between female devils was seen to be more common than association between males , who appeared to make efforts to avoid each other .
While devils are thought of as promiscuous the data revealed preferred associations between male - female pairs representing males guarding the females , demonstrating a further threat of disease through prolonged contact .
" The first stage of disease transmission is the contact between susceptible and infected individuals , " concludes Hamede .
" The radio collars allowed is to measure the contacts that occur at this critical stage .
The fact that all individuals are connected to a single network shows that the disease is capable of spreading to each individual in the population once one individual is infected . "

Real Networks plans to submit a Rhapsody iPhone app to Apple this week , the company announced in a Sunday blog post .
Real Networks plans to submit a Rhapsody iPhone app to Apple this week , the company announced in a Sunday blog post .
" When will Rhapsody be on the iPhone ?
Or , when will Rhapsody be on Android ?
Well , we FINALLY have an answer : hopefully , very soon , " wrote Real 's Lacy Kemp .
Real will submit its application for an on -demand streaming version of Rhapsody for the iPhone and the iPod Touch .
" Until now , nothing exists like this exists here in the states , " Kemp wrote .
" There is nothing quite as satisfying as needing to hear a certain song RIGHT NOW and being able to scratch that itch . "
Rhapsody subscribers will be able to sign into the app with the same username and password they use on the PC .
Non-subscribers will be provided with a limited time free - trial period , Real said .
Real provided a video demo of the application , which lets users search for specific songs in Rhapsody 's library of 8 million songs , or browse by genre , what 's new , or popularity .
Tap your selection and the song will start to play .
All songs will include additional data on the musician or band , including access to their YouTube page , images , biographies , other available albums and songs from the same artist , top tracks , and an artist sampler .
You can also find related artists or radio stations .
A " press and hold " menu will let you add content to a queue or personalized library .
You can re-arrange , add , or delete songs in a particular queue , and save that queue as a playlist .
It remains to be seen if Apple will approve the application .
Kemp admitted that it will allow her and other Rhapsody customers to avoid paying 99 cents for a download in the Apple iTunes Store .
" I can't even count the number of times I 've wanted to hear a song on my iPhone and guiltily plopped down $.99 to iTunes to please my impatient self , " she wrote .
Real is also working " diligently " an Android app .
" Once we 're done there , we plan to turn our sights on more mobile platform and carrier app stores , " Kemp wrote .
Hopefully this endeavor will be a bit more productive than the company 's RealDVD debacle .
Earlier this month , a federal judge found that the company 's DVD copying program violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the terms of its DVD CSS license .
Further , in the last several years the Internet has seen a proliferation of “ bum fight ” videos , shot by young men and boys who are seen beating the homeless or who pay transients a few dollars to fight each other .
Indeed , the National Coalition for the Homeless , which works to change government policies and bring people off the streets , says in its new report that 58 percent of assailants implicated in attacks against the homeless in the last 10 years were teenagers .
Michael Stoops , the group ’s executive director , said social prejudices were “ dehumanizing ” the homeless and condoning hostile treatment .
He pointed to a blurb titled “ Hunt the Homeless ” in the current issue of Maxim , a popular men ’s magazine .
It spotlights a coming “ hobo convention ” in Iowa and says : “ Kill one for fun .
We ’re 87 percent sure it ’s legal . ”
With victims wary of going to the police , statistics on the attacks are often incomplete .
But surveys show much higher rates of assault , rape and other crimes of violence against the homeless than almost any other group , said Professor Levin , of California State , who worked on the new report .
Recognition of the problem is spurring legislative action .
“ More and more , we ’re hearing about homeless people being attacked for no other reason than that they ’re homeless , and we ’ve got to do something about it , ” Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson , Democrat of Texas , said in an interview .

Ms. Johnson introduced a measure in the House last week to make attacks on the homeless a federal hate crime and require the F.B.I. to collect data on it .
( The Senate voted last month to expand federal hate crimes to include attacks on gay and transgender victims , another frequent target . )
It 's up to a group of guinea pigs to save the world in G - Force .
Zach Galifianakis ( who was apparently still hung over from The Hangover when signing on to do this picture ) plays Ben , a government researcher who has spent years training genetically - engineered guinea pigs to be secret agents .
What , you may ask , can guinea pigs do to help the government ?
Well , Ben has them infiltrating the home of Saber ( Bill Nighy ) , the billionaire owner of an electronics conglomerate who has plans to take over the world by having all his products rise up Transformers - style and do his bidding .
A team of superspy guinea pigs taking on household appliances ?
This has to be the stupidest idea ever .
The team is led by Darwin ( Sam Rockwell ) and also includes Juarez ( Penelope Cruz ) , Blaster ( Tracy Morgan ) , and Speckles ( Nicolas Cage ) .
( This is one of those animated features where the big - name actors are clearly just reading lines and cashing a paycheck .
They do n't even try to deliver actual voice performances , as the stars of Shrek or any of the Pixar movies did . )
When the government shuts Ben 's operation down , Darwin and crew escape , only to end up in a pet shop where they meet another guinea pig called Hurley ( Jon Favreau ) , who helps them escape so they can continue their mission with or without approval .
Honestly , I 'm not sure why anyone wanted to make this film , because the whole thing is just lazy .
The plot about Saber 's world domination goes absolutely nowhere ; it 's merely a hook on which to hang a lot of dull action scenes .
( The character even disappears from large chunks of the story . )
There are chases , and moments where characters dangle from great heights , and plenty of explosions .
None of it is noteworthy , save for the fact that all the characters are guinea pigs .
That alone is not enough to make the action scenes exciting or compelling .
Neither are the endless scenes of guinea pigs flying through the air in slow motion , their little arms and legs flailing helplessly .
The attempts at humor in G - Force are even worse .
Did you know that guinea pigs fart ?
Well , the film sure does , and it reminds of that fact on a regular basis .
Mike 's Movie Rule # 215 :
If a movie resorts to using farting animals as a source of comedy , it 's because the writers are really desperate .
Here 's another example : Juarez is purchased at the pet store by a young girl , who takes her home , makes her listen to bad Jesse McCartney music , and puts her in makeup and costumes .
Juarez catches her own reflection in the mirror and proclaims , " I look like Paris Hilton 's Chihuahua ! "
If you think this is funny , then G - Force will be the best movie ever made in your eyes .
I am stunned to learn that the director is Hoyt Yeatman , a two - time Oscar winner in the special effects category .
Why I am surprised ?
Because the special effects in G - Force are awful .
I never believed the CGI critters were sharing space with the real humans .
They also have a surprising lack of expressiveness , which makes them instantly forgettable .
The best family films are full of imagination , wonder , and memorable characters .
This one possesses none of those things .
When Disney released its live - action remake of 101 Dalmatians a number of years back , a curious thing happened : there was a sudden increase in pet adoptions of the breed , followed immediately by an upswing in cases of neglect .
The theory was that kids , pumped up by the movie , badgered their parents into getting them a Dalmatian , then lost interest when something else came along .
If G - Force is a hit , I predict that adults will dutifully buy guinea pigs for their children , who will then be crushed to discover that the animals actually do little more than eat and poop all day .
Parents , you 've been warned .
A final note : G - Force is being shown in both 2 - D and digital 3 - D formats .
I saw it in 2 - D , and that 's the preferred format because it 's one less dimension for the movie to suck in .
( out of four )
G- Force is rated PG for some mild action and rude humor .
The running time is 1 hour and 25 minutes .
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because they wanted to control the Pacific Ocean .
The Japanese purpose was to destroy Pearl Harbor to make the Americans force less , useless and purposeless .
The outcome resulted in the opposite .
So that US would surrender and not fight back in WW2 .
Essentially , the Japanese attack the US Navy at Pearl Harbor so that the United States would not be able to interfere with Japan 's expansion in the Pacific .
While the attack slowed the US response , it did not prevent intervention .
All 8.5 million pupils in the UK would be immunised against swine flu at immunisation posts in every school , under plans being studied by ministers , the Guardian has learned .
In the biggest mass vaccination since the 1964 operation against smallpox , school nurses , health visitors and GPs would deliver the injections to five- to 16 - year - olds at all 33,700 schools .
The move would be part of a concerted government effort to minimise the harm caused by the expected second wave of the pandemic this autumn .
" The general principle of schools being the ideal , logical place to do this is well established .
They have captive audiences , " said one senior source involved in Whitehall planning .
While written parental approval would be necessary , high demand is expected , as long as the vaccine has been declared to be safe .
However , the huge scale of the task has led to questions about whether there would be enough health professionals available to administer the jabs .
For example , there are just 1,447 school nurses for the 25,000 schools in England .
The move comes as fresh doubts about the government 's H1N1 preparedness timetable were raised yesterday when the World Health Organisation said that a clinically tested flu vaccine would not be ready this month , contrary to ministerial assurances .
Dr Marie - Paule Kieny , director of the WHO vaccine research initiative , said results from clinical tests on a new vaccine were not expected until September .
Vaccines would then require regulatory clearance before being given to patients in Europe .
Her remarks cast serious doubt on a number of statements by the health secretary , Andy Burnham , and the chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , who have said the vaccine will be available this month .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said : " The manufacturers have told us that we can expect the first supplies of the vaccine from Baxter in August and from GlaxoSmithKline later in September .
This is not the DH 's schedule – it is led by the manufacturers . "
But GSK admitted that it has yet to start clinical trials on people .
" We are still at the discussion stage and are not putting a date on when clinical tests will start , " a spokesman said .
The first wave of the pandemic appears to be on its way out .
The number of new cases of swine flu in England and Scotland has fallen significantly , according to figures released by the Health Protection Agency yesterday .
England recorded an estimated 30,000 new cases last week , down from 110,000 the week before , and in Scotland the estimated number of new cases fell from 1,500 to 1,050 .
Nine more people in England have died , taking the death toll to 36 .
Donaldson warned against complacency and said he was " pretty certain " of a second wave in the autumn .
The vulnerability of children to the H1N1 virus , the need to keep the pressure off family doctors ' surgeries , and easy access to so many young people means schools are likely to be used .
Vaccinating a primary school might take several hours but a secondary school several days .
Experts believe the second wave may start building up in England once schools return in September .
But inoculation of pupils could not start until large supplies of the vaccine are available – which would be the start of October at the earliest , say health department sources .
They also say that under - fives , another priority group , will be immunised at GPs ' surgeries .
The Department of Health said last night that the exact form of the immunisation strategy has not yet been agreed .
" We have not said that schools will deliver the vaccination programme for swine flu .
Decisions have not been made on how the vaccine programme will be delivered , and the chief medical officer has said that he expects GPs to be the bedrock of the programme , " the spokeswoman said .
전국의 법학교수 165명이 8 일 촛불재판에 개입한 신영철 대법관의 행동을 헌법유린행위로 규정하고 탄핵소추를 요구했다 .
앞서 전국 26 개 고등·지방 법원 중 17 개 법원의 판사 495명 이 " 신영철 대법관의 당시 행위는 재판권 독립을 침해했다 " 고 결의한 바 있다. 이번에 전국 법학교수들은 ' 신영철 대법관의 재판개입에 대한 법학자 선언 ' 발표를 통해 그간 촉구해온 '자진 사퇴'를 넘어 더 분명하고 단호하게 ' 국회 의 탄핵 소추'를 요구했다 .
이미 민주당과 민주노동당은 신 대법관에 대한 탄핵 소추를 발의할 계획을 밝힌 상황이다 .
" 헌법이 명령한 사법권 행사 침해 행위 ... 마땅히 탄핵 소추해야 " 이들은 선언문을 통해 " 신영철 대법관이 재판 개입을 통해 국민이 공정한 재판을 받을 권리를 침해하고 자유민주주의의 핵심인 사법권의 독립을 훼손했다 " 며
" 신영철 대법관의 탄핵소추와 사법제도의 근본적 개혁을 강력히 촉구한다 " 고 밝혔다.
이들은 또 신 대법관이 자신의 행위를 ' 사법행정권 ' 행사의 일환으로 변명한 것에 대해서도 " 헌법이 명령한 '사법권 의 행사'를 ' 사법 행정'과 동격의 가치로 취급할 수 없다 " 고 단호하게 잘라 말했다 .
이들은 " 헌법은 국민의 사법권의 행사를 위임한 법관에게 헌법과 법률에 의하여 양심에 따라 독립하여 재판하도록 명령하고 있다 " 며
" 이러한 헌법적 명령의 이행과 재판에 ' 부 수 '되는 집행업무인 사법행정이 동격의 가치로 취급될 수 있는 여지가 없음은 자명하다 " 고 비판했다 .
또 " ( 사법행정권 행사가 ) 일반 추상적인 제도 개선을 논의할 수는 있지만 특정한 부류의 사건들을 '행 정'적 차원에서 처리하는 것은 재판의 독립에 정면으로 배치되는 것 " 이라며 " 서울중앙지방법원 을 비롯한 각급 법원 판사들이 판사회의를 통해 한결같이 신 대법관의 행위를 명백한 재판권 침해로 확인한 데에 대하여 우리 법학자들도 그 뜻에 공감한다 " 고 밝혔다.
특히 이들 법학자들은 " 재판개입 이 객관적으 로 확인된 이 시점에도 당사자인 신 대법관은 자진 사퇴를 거부하고 이 사건에 대한 대법원장의 대응 또한 기대에 미치지 못하다 " 며
" 드디어 국민들은 법관이 어떤 외부의 간섭도 없이 공정하게 자신의 사건을 재판하는 것이 아니라 상급법관의 외압에 따라 재판할 수도 있다는 합리적 의심을 하기에 이르렀다 " 고 비판했다 .
이들은 이어 , " 이와 같은 상황은 자유민주주의의 기초를 뿌리째 뒤흔드는 중대한 헌정위기라 고 아니할 수 없으며 따라서 하루빨리 헌법이 정하는 절차에 따라 해소되어야 한다 " 며
" 국회는 마땅히 신 대법관에 대한 탄핵소추권을 발동하여 국민대표기관으로서의 소임을 다하여야 한다 " 고 촉구했다 .
" 근본 원인은 '사법부의 관료화 ' ... 척결 없다면 제 2 의 신영철 대법관 사태 발생 " 이들 법학자들은 또 " 이번 사태의 근본 원인은 ' 사법부의 관료화 '에 있다고 생각한다 " 며
" 불합리한 법관인사제도 의 개선을 비롯하여 사법부의 관료화를 척결하기 위한 사법제도의 근본적인 개혁이 없이는 제 2 의 신 대법관 사태를 막기 어려울 것 " 이라고 우려했다 .
이들은 " 대법원은 그간의 사법파동과 이번의 판사회의를 통해 제기된 법관들의 요구 및 국민들의 사법부 개혁의 열망에 대해 지금이라도 겸허한 자세로 해결의 의지를 표시하고 실천적으로 답하여야 하며 , 국회도 또한 이를 뒷받침하기 위한 법률의 정비에 나서야 한다 " 고 촉구했다 .
이들은 끝으로 " 국민의 공정한 재판을 받을 권리를 보장하고 사법권의 독립을 회복하기 위해 " 서 ▲ 국회의 신영철 대법관 탄핵소추 ▲ 법관인사제도 개혁 및 대법관 인적 구성의 다양화를 위한 법원조직법 등 법률정비방안 제시 ▲ 대법원의 재발방지를 위한 구체적이고 실천적인 방안 제시 등 3 가 지 항목을 요구했다 .
" 탄핵 소추하지 않은 국회도 , 직권남용죄 수사권 발동하지 않은 검찰도 문제 있다 " 이번 선언에 참여한 정태욱 인하대 교수는 8 일 < 오마이뉴스 > 와 한 전화통화에서 " 신영철 대법관 사태는 법학 교수의 입장에서 굉장히 심각하다 , 법질서를 심각하게 침해하고 있다 " 면서 " 인권위 수호 모임 등이 중심이 돼 교수들의 동의를 얻었다 " 고 밝혔다 .
그는 이어 , " 판사들도 일관되게 신 대법관의 행위를 재판 개입 행위라 비판하는데 지금까지 버티고 있는 신 대법관을 상식적으로 납득할 수 없다 " 고 비판했다 .
또 " 이용훈 대법원장이 지난 5 일 전국 법원장 회의에서 ' 감내하 기 힘들 것'이라고 한 것은 사퇴하라는 말 아니냐 " 고 반문했다 .
선언문 초안을 작성한 임지봉 서강대 교수는 " 신 대법관의 행위는 재판권을 정면으로 침해한 중차대한 문제로 이렇게 흐지부지될 문제가 아니다 " 며
" 이에 동의하는 몇 분 교수님들이 지난 주 몇몇 교수들에게 개인적으로 동참 의사를 묻는 이메일을 보냈는데 대부분이 동의해주셨다 " 고 말했다.
그는 이어 , " 의외로 많은 교수들이 참여해주셨다 , 아마 전국 법학 교수들 전체의 의사를 물었다면 ( 참가 숫자는 ) 더 늘었을 것 " 이라고 덧붙였다 .
김승환 전북대 교수( 한국헌법학회 회장 ) 는 " 재판 개입은 사법권 침해이고 이는 법치국가 원칙을 침해하고 국민의 기본권을 침해한다 " 며
" 신 대법관의 행위는 어쩌다 일어난 일이 아니라 대한민국은 민주공화국이라는 헌법 1조를 뒤흔드는 것 " 이라고 비판했다 .
김 교수는 특히 " 이에 대해 헌법 수호 책무를 지닌 국회는 신 대법관을 탄핵 소추하지 않는 등 자신의 책무를 방기하고 있고 , 직권남용죄를 저지른 신 대법관에 대해 수사권을 발동하지 않은 검찰도 자신의 책무를 다하지 않고 있다 " 며 다른 국가기관들의 책임도 물었다 .
그는 또 " 법원 징계위원회의 최고 징계 수위는 정직 3 개월이다 , 그 정도로 법관의 신분을 확실하게 보장하는 것은 그만큼 사법권 독립에 대한 책임이 크기 때문 " 이라며 " 자신의 책임을 버리고 재판권 행사를 위임한 국민의 신뢰를 깬 신 대법관은 당연히 물러나야 한다 " 고 말했다 .

Anyone still of the opinion Italy ’s not going through a fascist comeback ?
This is unbelievable .
After a wave of ugly rhetoric and dubious policies , a number of northern Italian councils run by the far - right Northern League ( Silvio Berlusconi ’s biggest coalition partner in government ) have gone on the rampage against anything foreign .
Top of the list , the town of Capriate , 20 miles from Milan , where the council announced a ban on kebab and ‘ ethnic ’ shops from the town centre .
The news has n’t reached the foreign press yet , so you ’ll have to be able to understand Italian if you want to find out more here and here .
In a nutshell , a council ordinance tabled by the Northern League bans all ‘ ethnic ’ shops and businesses from Capriate town centre .
Most stunning is the motivation offered by the Chair of Trade and Safety at the local council : “ This is not a racist decision [ of course , ed. ] .
The town centre is short of parking space and those businesses would worsen traffic congestion ” .
The ban is a direct consequence of last June ’s ruling by the Lombard Regional Assembly ( also governed by Berlusconi ’s coalition ) which granted local councils power to shut down businesses that are deemed “ incompatible ” with the “ local context ” .
“ We could n’t just sit down in front of the invasion of kebab shops , internet cafes and Chinese restaurants that are sucking the identity out of our town centres ” , explained Northern League Assembly Members Daniele Belotti and Giouse ’ Frosio .

Call it irreversibility , call it time 's arrow , call it the second law of thermodynamics .
Fact is that everything evolves in such a way that things get more messy .
Disorder rises .
Entropy increases .
We do not observe the opposite happening .
Heat flows from from hot to cold , not the other way around .
Fluids mix but do n't unmix .
Shattered pieces of crystal do n't reassemble into a vase .
Yet the laws of physics tell us that when studying the evolution of physical systems in all its microscopic details , there is no preferred ' direction of time ' .
The fundamental laws of physics obey time symmetry .
For every forward evolution there exists a time reversed evolution .
Both evolutions are equally valid and equally likely .
Reverse all velocities in Newton 's dynamics and the system traces back its history .
The laws of physics tell us that forward and reverse directions of time are absolutely indistinguishable down to the minute and microscopic details .
Yet , we all know that when we are watching a movie we can quickly tell whether the movie is displayed in reverse or not .
We seem to have manouvred ourselves in a paradoxial situation
Enter Ludwig Boltzmann , the posthumously famous Austrian physicist who was tragically ahead of his time and - following many years of struggle to get his ideas accepted by the scientific establishment - died by suicide in 1906 .
Boltzmann left a legacy that is now much better understood .
He provided us with the guidance and the tools to marry the time - reversible laws of physics with the time - irreversible behavior we observe in our everyday world .
At the heart of Boltzmann 's theories is a statistical approach towards the description of nature .
In particular , Boltzmann showed that the thermodynamic entropy of a system , the amount of energy no longer available to do physical work , can be defined rigorously in a statistical way .
In simple terms , Boltzmann 's entropy S is the minimum length of the encoding you need to fully describe the state of the system .
It is the amount of info ( number of bits or digits ) you need to trace back the history of the system .
The following ' Fibonacci fleas model ' should make this more concrete .
Consider a dozen fleas feeding on nine cats ( targets labeled ' 1 - 9 ' ) and a human ( target ' 0 ' ) .
At discrete intervals , the fleas jump from one target to the other according to a sequence of 12 digit integers being generated .
These integers represent the states of our discrete dynamic model by enumerating the locations of the fleas .
For instance ,
504,328,976,279
means flea number 1 is located on cat 5 , flea 2 can be found on human 0 , flea three on cat 4 , and so on up till flea 12 who is located on cat 9 .
If the next state is
432,522,910,327
we observe a synchronized jump with the first flea jump from cat 5 to cat 4 , the second flea from the human to cat 3 , etc .
The generation of these integers in this discrete model follows a simple time - symmetric mechanics : based on the last two numbers generated , the next number is three times the last minus the one - but - last .
If the number computed exceeds 999,999,999,999 or becomes negative , it is mapped into a 12 - digit positive integer by adding or subtracting the appropriate multiples of 1,000,000,000,000 .
So referring to the number generated at timestep t as W ( t ) , we have :
W( t+1 ) = 3 W( t ) – W ( t - 1 ) ( mod 1,000,000,000,000 )
It is important to stress at this point that the dynamics is indeed time - symmetric as this equation can also be written as :
W( t - 1 ) = 3 W( t ) – W ( t+1 ) ( mod 1,000,000,000,000 ) .
Starting from W(0 ) = 0 and W ( 1 ) = 1 , this reversible arithmetic in forward mode yields the even Fibonacci numbers :
0 , 1 , 3 , 8 , 21 , 55 , ...
whilst the odd fibonacci numbers are generated when starting from W(0 ) = 1 and W( 1 ) = 1 :
1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 13 , 34 , 89 , ...
Let 's start with the latter initial condition , and see what happens to the distribution of fleas .
We write the full 12 digit numbers so as to make explicit the location of each flea .
We observe :
W(0 ) = 000,000,000,001
W(1 ) = 000,000,000,001
W(2 ) = 000,000,000,002
W(3 ) = 000,000,000,005
W(4 ) = 000,000,000,013
W(5 ) = 000,000,000,034
W(6 ) = 000,000,000,089
W(7 ) = 000,000,000,233
and so on .
We can now track the total number of fleas on the human ( the number of zeros in the 12 - digit numbers )
Obviously , starting at t = 0 with all the fleas on the human ( twelve zero's ) , the number of fleas on the human gradually decreases .
This trend continues untill after 28 steps a state is reached that has no fleas on the human :
W( 28 ) = 139,583,862,445
From that moment on the number of fleas on the human fluctuates around values close to zero :
W( 29 ) = 365,435,296,162 ( no fleas bothering the human )
W( 30 ) = 956,722,026,041 ( two fleas )
W( 31 ) = 504,730,781,961 ( two fleas )
etc .
Let us now focus on the entropy of this flea dynamics .
Recall that we defined entropy as the minimum number of digits needed to re-trace the system 's history .
To be able to do this , one needs just the last two flea - state numbers .
Using these two numbers we compute all preceding numbers simply by applying the same dynamics in reverse direction ( second equation above ) .
So what does this tell us about the entropy S ?
Having reached state 29 , retracing the history requires the two full 12 - digit numbers W ( 29 ) and W ( 28 ) or an entropy of 24 digits .
The same is true once the dynamics has brought us beyond t = 29 .
However , when the dynamics has evolved no further than some earlier time , this is no longer true .
As an example , consider the evolution to t = 7 .
We need the two numbers W( 6 ) and W ( 7 ) to retrace the full history .
So that is again two times twelve digits , right ?
Wrong .
You only need a total of 6 digits ( S = 6 ) as ignoring the leading zero's ( which are irrelevant for computing the dynamics ) both numbers have only three digits .
Carefully counting the number of digits in subsequent pairs of W - numbers whilst ignoring the leading zero's , we observe the entropy to increase to its maximum value S = 24 digits in about 28 timesteps ( see figure ) .
Now this is interesting .
The irreversibility paradox manifests itself in its full glory in this simple fleas model .
Using nothing more than a very simple fully time symmetric Fibonacci - type dynamics , we observe an ' arrow of time ' in the form of an entropy that increases in one direction , and decreases in the reverse direction .
It should now be clear what is causing the entropy increase with time .
Entropy increases simply because te system started in a specially prepared low - entropy starting state .
There is no paradox related to the fact that the dynamics is reversible .
This can be observed more clearly by continuing the reverse dynamics into negative times .
This results into a perfectly time - symmetrical plot of entropy ( red curve ) and number of fleas on the human ( blue curve ) .
In his superb book “ The Emperor 's New Mind ” Roger Penrose takes this reasoning further and applies it to the universe and its origin .
He stresses the fact that the universe started off at what he refers to as a ' ridiculously tiny entropy ' state .
Based on a closed universe model ( a universe that eventually collapses into a big crunch ) and some holographic considerations , he comes to the conclusion that the creator had to select some 10 ^123 digits each to a unique value such as to create a universe with the known low entropy as we witness it today .
In other words , only one out of 10 ^ ( 10 ^123 ) possible initial universes had the right properties for the universe to evolve with a second law of thermodynamics as powerful in effect as in our universe .
These are no mind boggling figures .
These numbers are simply incomprehensible .
In a future blog I will revisit this issue and present you with a simple model for an expanding universe that in terms of entropy behaves in a remarkably different way .
FOR seven decades Colin Hughes has been struggling to keep up with conversations swirling around him .
Born with narrow eustachian tubes unable to drain fluid from his middle ear , the retiree from Mudgee has never been able to hear properly .

He has endured seven bouts of surgery , and is unable to wear conventional hearing aids , which sit inside the ear canals , for more than a few hours because they cause inflammation .
A lifetime on antibiotics has left him resistant to all but the most powerful , and depression plagues his days because he cannot participate fully in family life .
But within a few weeks Mr Hughes will become one of the first Australians to use new bone - anchored hearing aids designed to adjust to noisy environments , quiet conversations or the complex varying rhythms and pitch of music .

Reader Lindsey H. sent me a copy of a book called Vaught ’s Practical Character Reader , apparently published in 1902 and revised in 1907 by Emily H. Vaught .
Also available on Amazon .
The book can best be described as an application of the theory of physiognomy , which is the idea that you can tell all kinds of things about a “ person ’s character or personality from their outer appearance ” ( wikipedia ) .
Some images from Vaught ’s book :
The book is full of images in which the features stereotypically associated with Northern and Western Europeans , or the mythical Aryan race , are associated with sincerity , honestly , a work ethic , and every other positive character trait , whereas large and especially hooked noses and small , hooded , or almond - shaped eyes were indications of negative traits .
Here we learn that the broadness of a person ’s face tells you whether they are vicious or harmless :
The text does not explain whether the implication is that all Native Americans are vicious and all Blacks are harmless , or if these are just examples and those races would have just as much variety as we see among Whites .
For those of you who are considering procuring yourself a wife , Vaught provides some tips on picking out a woman who will be a good mother ( the same general head shape indicates a good father as well ) :
Avoid at all costs a man or woman with this head shape ( notice the pointed nose , larger ears , and smaller eyes compared to the image above , in addition to the apparently super - important head protuberance ) :
Also , based on the illustrations , apparently men who wear bowties are good fathers but those who wear neckties should arouse your suspicion .
There is also a section titled “ How to Pick Out a Good Child , ” which I intend to take with me next time I am child shopping .
The back page advertises other books available from Vaught ’s press , including Human Nature Year Book from the Human Science School and the new Text Book on Phrenology , which addresses “ Heads Faces Types Races . ”
I have seen examples of physignomy and phrenology before , and images of their practitioners measuring people ’s heads and facial features , but I have never before seen an entire book devoted to it .
These pseudosciences were taken quite seriously at the time , with “ experts ” showing that Africans and African Americans , for instance , had facial features that proved them to be less civilized and intelligent than those of European descent and that Jews were inherently deceitful .
Thanks a ton for sending it in , Lindsey !

WASHINGTON 
The nation 's largest group of atheists and agnostics filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday to stop the engraving of " In God We Trust " and the " one nation under God " from the Pledge of Allegiance in the new Capitol Visitor Center .
The Freedom From Religion Foundation , a Wisconsin - based church - state watchdog group , claimed the engravings are unconstitutional and would exclude the 15 % of Americans who identify themselves as non-religious .
" We are effectively being told that we are political outsiders ... because we do n't trust in God , " said Annie Laurie Gaylor , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
The House and Senate passed resolutions this month approving the inscription of the mottos in prominent areas of Capitol Visitor Center , which serves as the entrance and security screening for tourists .
Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , who sponsored the bill in the Senate , said historical references to God should not be censored for political correctness .
" The Founders based the Constitution and our laws on religious faith and principles that clear the way for individual freedom , " he said in a statement .
" Our true motto , ' In God We Trust , ' expresses this fact , and we cannot allow a whitewash of America 's religious heritage . "
However , Gaylor said the mottos are inaccurate since " In God We Trust " and the insertion of " under God " into the Pledge of Allegiance were adopted in the 1950s as anti-communist measures .
" They wanted this up there because they think God is the foundation of our government , " Gaylor said .
" Boy , are they misinformed . "
Rep. Louie Gohmert , R - Texas , reminded colleagues Tuesday that the Washington Monument displays the words " Praise be to God " in Latin on the side that faces the Capitol .
He said " every day when the first rays of God 's sun hit the very first thing in this Nation 's Capitol , " those words are illuminated .
Rep . Steve King , R - Iowa , added in a statement , " Our Judeo - Christian heritage is an essential foundation stone of our great nation . "
In a separate suit , Gaylor 's foundation is also suing defendants President Obama , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Shirley Dobson of the National Day of Prayer Taskforce for proclaiming the National Day of Prayer in May .
Gaylor said the proclamations violate the separation of church and state .
U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb of Wisconsin has denied motions by the Obama administration to dismiss the case .
With Spain 's economy in freefall and loans squeezed , desperadoes are resorting to robbing banks to solve their personal credit crunch .
Bank robberies have risen by 20 per cent in two years , Spain 's banking association says ; and those who adopt the tactic of the stick - up to pay their debts are novices rather than hardened criminals .
" In recent months , it has become apparent that Spain is suffering from an increase in bank robberies , " Francisco Perez Abellan , the head of criminology at Camilo Jose Cela University in Madrid , told The New York Times .

" We are seeing people committing offences through necessity , first - time offenders who can no longer continue to maintain their lifestyle and so turn to crime , " he said .
Instances where counter clerks are tied up at gunpoint while masked raiders empty the safe have become so common that Spain 's government , prodded by the bank employees ' trade union , has classified bank robbery as an occupational hazard .
Jose Manuel Murcia , the head of workplace health and safety in the financial sector for the Workers ' Commissions union federation , said : " There 's unemployment , there 's hunger and there 's money in the banks , and the three factors combine .
" Banks are denying credit , so companies are having problems ...
People can't pay their mortgages .
So it 's ... logical to rob a bank . "
Typical among novice robbers is the building contractor identified as Ausencio CG , who allegedly stole € 80,000 ( £ 69,000 ) from four banks before he was caught attempting his fifth hold - up near Barcelona in February .
He told police he had used the money to pay his workers and fund his daughter 's studies in London .
Other new bandits were low - skilled workers from eastern Europe or Latin America , drawn to Spain during the building boom , who were now unemployed , Mr Perez Abellan said .
" They bring new skills that increase the level of violence and the speed of the bank robbery . "
Four South American painters kidnapped a bank manager in Barcelona in March , held him overnight and forced him to hand over € 150,000 from the vault .
They were caught last month in their painters ' overalls , guns and bullets in their car , as they tried a final heist before returning home .
More than three weeks after Iran 's disputed presidential election , at least 33 journalists are behind bars this weekend .
Iran now has more journalists in prison than any country in the world , says the charity Reporters Sans Frontiers .
Dozens of foreign journalists were booted out of the country or arrested following the election , and the entire editorial staff of one Iranian newspaper was incarcerated .
But if the Iranian government had hoped to block the spread of information , it was hopelessly thwarted by Twitter and mobile phone cameras in the hands of ordinary Iranians , who transmitted nuggets of information and images to the internet as the violence began .
By clamping down on recognised journalists , Iran unwittingly unleashed a multi-headed hydra of citizen journalists chronicling events at the frontline .
So it was timely of Google to launch a site last week promoting amateur journalism .
YouTube Reporters aims to " help citizens learn more about how to report the news , straight from the experts " .
Videos have been posted by professionals such as Bob Woodward , the Washington Post reporter who co-broke the Watergate scandal and Nick Kristof of The New York Times .

Newspapers have long been accused of hastening their own demise by giving content away free online , so it 's perhaps even odder for professional journalists to be queuing up to give away their trade tips .
But this is a pivotal moment in the democratisation of the media .
The Daily Mail and General Trust launched its Local People network last week , unveiling the first of 50 community websites .
The aim is to build a network of sites in which readers contribute content by uploading stories and images .
It is yet another example of the growth of collaborative journalism already exploited by US sites such as The Huffington Post and The Daily Beast .
What emerges from many of the tutorials posted on YouTube Reporters so far is , ironically , the case against it .
Stories need verification , say the old hands .
The first principle of journalism may be to gather information but , as Bob Woodward stresses , more important still is the checking for accuracy .
While the Tehran riots highlighted the value of eyewitness accounts , credibility remains a problem .
One tweet reported a massacre that never happened .
Yet with few journalists on the ground , news agencies were forced to compose a picture of unfolding events from the evidence available .
Even the US government became dependent on the stream of live tweets , asking Twitter to postpone maintenance work on their server until the riots were over .
It was , says Arianna Huffington , founder of the Huff Po , a " defining moment for new media " .
Huffington is among those who have contributed to YouTube Reporters .
Her site , which boasts 13,000 citizen journalists , ran a live blog during the riots , reporting events within minutes of them happening .
This has prompted fears the site is lending credibility to potentially false information , although Huffington denies this , pointing out that she employs a news editor who " curates " reports as they come in , " adding value " by filtering and weaving them with wire copy .
" It was the only way to circumvent what the Iranian regime was trying to do , which was to control all information , " she says .
Huffington says the challenge ahead is not how to save newspapers but how to preserve journalism .
To that end , she has established , with other donors , a £ 1.2 m fund for investigative reporting which will fund 10 staff reporters .
Saving journalism is also what prompted Tina Brown , the former editor of Vanity Fair , to launch the Daily Beast .
She says the tipping point for internet journalism has been reached , and believes advertising will begin to follow .
" The internet was founded by geeks so visually it was n't a good place to advertise , " she told the BBC , " But as websites become more attractive they become more attractive to advertisers .
Big ticket advertisers have yet to come aboard .
We 're breaking through in that area by creating a brand that is so attractive that advertisers want to be a part of it . "
While newspapers wait to see whether Brown is proven right , many are concentrating on clawing back free content from the net , with at least three national newspapers looking into re-erecting pay barriers .
The way in which the story of Michael Jackson 's death was broken , via free - to - view gossip website TMZ , is a timely reminder of the threat to traditional media .
Meanwhile in Iran , as the 33 journalists ponder their fates , the threat to journalism must seem rather more immediate .

If you did n’t already know , Larry Johnson has a new blog , complete with a ridiculous moving illustration of his likeness with blinging earrings .
On this blog , L.J. has posted some interesting material , but yesterday he dropped his most interesting post to date .
Apparently , fellow NFL star Darren Sharper has been hating on L.J. on Twitter .
The problem is that Sharper ’s tweets are a mix of textspeak and ebonics ( and apparently he ’s now been suspended ) , so they ’re tough to decipher .
Nonetheless , I ’m going to try my hand at translating Sharper , aka Silky “ Hater of the Year ” Johnson …
DeeNice42 : u shud preach that to 27 , he always on some shit in da clubs .
he got shit pendin’ n thems just the ones who actually said sumthin .
smhabout 23 hours ago
Translation : You ’re talking to Larry Johnson ?
You should be scared sh**less .
He ’s always in trouble for slapping around women at nightclubs , and those are just the ladies who decided to come forward .
Homeboy is a regular Ike Turner .
DeeNice42 : yous a good woman then … but b careful wit that no self control shit cause he a big dude n u but like a buck - two - five .
hope he dnt put his about 23 hours ago
Translation :
You ’re a good woman .
Be careful , though , because L.J. is a big ass dude who likes to slap chicks around / spit drinks in their faces .
Hope he has n’t whooped that ass already .
He ’s the black Tom Sizemore when it comes to abusing women .
DeeNice42 : he still got almost a buck on ya , so dnt preach him too much lol .
he been to nyc yet or wut .. about 23 hours ago
Translation :
He has 100 pounds on you , so watch what you say or he ’ll punch you right in the mouth .
Has he made a booty call to see you in NYC yet ?
DeeNice42 : oh good , did he bless ya wit some bling , expensive dinners n all that …about 23 hours ago
Translation :
So he did come through and hook up with you .
You better have gotten some jewelery and expensive dinners out of those you - know - what payments .
Do your thing gold digger .
Take him for all he ’s worth .
DeeNice42 : no matter if ya into bling or not , we come tru d town of a honey she gotta b taken care of u feel me .. by any mean necessary .
about 22 hours ago
Translation : L.J. did n’t buy you bling ?
Dude ’s got no game .
Actually I have no game , but I ’m rich and I ’m letting you know that I will spoil your ass and do anything else necessary in order to get with you .
That includes throwing a fellow NFL player who would break me in two under the bus on the world ’s biggest social networking site .
When it comes to hating , I step into the phone booth and emerge wearing spandex and a cape .
DeeNice42 : dinner n clubbin ’ man u easy to please .
any nigga do that for ya ’.
im tellin u when we come tru d town of a honey she gets spoiled … about 22 hours ago
Translation : Did I mention that Larry Johnson is cheap ?
Not me .
Me and my crew will give a gold digger exactly what she wants .
One of those referee - lookin’ Foot Locker employees can take you to dinner and then the club .
L.J. might as well work at Foot Locker .
Do n’t you want to get spoiled by a sucker like me ?
Even though L.J. is still in my doghouse , I gotta take his side on this one .
Smearing a fellow pro athlete ’s name all over Twitter to the point of libel just to impress some hoochie ( and if you search his old Twitter name you see a bunch of chicks trying to holler , so that is n’t off base ) was a pathetic move by Sharper .
Larry Johnson may be an asshole / prima donna / hasbeen , but Sharper looks like a coward and a hater .
It also amazes me that these athletes do n’t seem to think about the repercussions of their social networking .
It ’s as if Sharper thought nobody else would see this .
Anyway , I found this whole thing very amusing .
It took some work to translate Sharperese , but I think I have it down now .
So , if anybody is looking for a translator , I ’m your man .
We ’ll keep you posted on the Johnson - Sharper beef .
Unfortunately , the Chiefs and the Saints , Sharper ’s new team , do n’t play this season .
Regardless , Sharper better have his head on the swivel .
L.J. ’s got almost a buck on him , too .

Fight DVD Religion Coding !
What is DVD Religion Coding ?
All major film studios and distributors recently announced their support for introducing a system of DVD Religion Coding to new DVD releases .
Under this system , new DVD players will contain hardware constraints restricting them to playing only DVDs encoded with a compatible Religion Code .
This proposal has the official backing of The Vatican , leaders of most Protestant Christian sects , several influential Rabbinical Councils , and many other world religious leaders .
The theory behind Religion Coding is that it allows film distributors to market films selectively to target audiences with different release schedules .
Government censorship authorities also see it as a useful way of re-packaging , re-rating , or in some cases re-cutting films to suit the sensibilities of different religions .
What Are the Proposed Religion Codes ?
Under the proposal for the DVD Religion Coding scheme , the world 's faiths will be divided into 8 Religion Codes as follows :
Religion 1 - Catholic
- Catholic Religion 2 - Protestant
- Protestant Religion 3 - Muslim
- Muslim Religion 4 - Eastern European Orthodox
- Eastern European Orthodox Religion 5 - Jewish
- Jewish Religion 6 - Hindu / Buddhist
- Hindu / Buddhist Religion 7 - Shinto / Taoist
- Shinto / Taoist Religion 8 - Other
The Religions Codes are represented by logos , as shown .
How Does The System Work ?
When you buy a new DVD player , you will need to inform the retailer of your religion .
You will be permitted to buy a player encoded for that religion .
When you buy DVDs , you will need to check the Religion Code Logo on the back of the packaging to determine which Religion Code is encoded on the DVD .
Your player will only play DVDs encoded with the same Religion Code .
It will be possible with many models of DVD player to perform a hardware modification which puts the player into so - called " atheist " mode , in which it will play DVDs with any Religion Coding .
Such modification is however safely achievable only by people with electronics knowledge , and voids the warranty on the player .
So Why Should I Care ?
DVD enthusiasts around the world decry the Religion Coding scheme as counterproductive , anti-competitive , and socially divisive .
Consider the following points :
With staggered release schedules for the different Religion Codes , it will be all too easy for film distributors to decide that the minor religions will not provide them with enough profit to justify a release in that Religion Code .
For example : Independent film and religious analysts predict that the catalogue of titles available to Religion 4 ( Eastern European Orthodox ) will in the long run comprise only about 35 % of the titles available in the more profitable Religion 1 and Religion 2 markets .
Titles popular in one Religion Code , but of limited appeal to members of other religions , may be unavailable to those other religions .
This fosters religious isolationism and hinders the free exchange of cultural variety between peoples of differing beliefs .
DVD purchasers , presented with an array of DVD titles , may neglect to check the Religion Code on a prospective purchase and be disappointd when they get it home and realise it will not play on their player .
People who convert religions will be left with a collection of DVDs encoded for their former religion , which will be useless in any new DVD player they may purchase .
There is a potential for increased sectarian tensions between religions forced to share Religion Codes , such as Anglicans and Lutherans , not to mention the inappropriate and arbitrary combining of two completely different religions in each of Religion 6 and Religion 7 .
Smaller religions forced into the Religion 8 category may resent being treated as unimportant .
This Religion Code also has potential for serious conflict between such widely varying faiths as Scientology , Wicca , and Satanism .
Non-religious DVD purchasers may resent being classified in Religion 8 , in effect assigning them a de facto religion .
Minority religions in countries dominated by another religion ( such as Hindus in the USA , Catholics in Saudi Arabia , or Muslims in Japan ) may have extremely limited or non-existent local retailers stocking DVDs for their Religion Code .
What Can I Do About This ?
Plenty !
Write letters to your Government representative ( Member of Parliament , Congressman , Senator , etc ) telling them how concerned you are over these issues .
Many members of Government have been deliberately kept in the dark on this issue , so be sure to explain the scheme to them , as well as detailing your objections .
Mention the DVD Religion Coding Scheme proposal to your priest or pastor .
Many of the lower clergy are unaware of this proposal , and would justifiably be upset by its implications .
Urge them to take up the issue with their senior clergy members .
Bring the subject of DVD Religion Coding up in conversations with staff and other customers in the shops where you see DVDs being sold .
A lot of people have not yet heard of the proposal , and will appreciate your informed appraisal and opinion .
UPDATE : Some places are now selling religion - free DVD players !
Gay activists are outraged after Xavier High School , a Catholic school in Albury , Australia published an anti-gay piece by a former student in its alumni newsletter .
" Writing in a letter to the editor in the newsletter , former Xavier student Matt Price entreated “ a world free from homosexuals ” , who he said lived lives devoted to drugs and sex .
His letter called for businesses not to employ homosexuals , with Price revealing that he lobbies CEOs with his message .
Price , who claims to be a ‘ cured ’ homosexual , said his new ‘ heterosexual ’ life allowed him to “ lead / heal my spiritual life in the way I was guided as a child " ( SX News ) .
This letter to the editor should never have been published as it incites violence and gives credence to the dangerous and unsuccessful efforts by the " ex - gay " movement .
This sends a horrible message to gay youth at the high school and reinforces negative self thoughts and can inflict unnecessary harm .
Urge the school to apologize for publishing this heinous piece .

A new - generation extremely large telescope will be built in Hawaii .
The project is expected to be finished by 2018 .
The new telescope will feature one primary mirror measuring 30 meters in diameter and composed of 492 segments .
With such parameters , the telescope will have nine times the collecting area than any other telescope on the planet today , making the Thirty - Meter Telescope the largest in the world , even greater than the famous Hubble Space Telescope .
It will provide scientists with a new view of some of the oldest galaxies in the universe , stars and planets that orbit them .
It is worth mentioning that five sites were selected in the race for building the telescope and Mauna Kea in Hawaii was one of them .
To select the best site , scientists carried out a global satellite evaluation of atmosphere and climate variables , choosing Hawaii and Cerro Amazones in Chile the two most suitable sites .
Finally the board decided that Mauna Kea is the winner .
For more information on science and space please visit www.infoniac.com/science.
" The atmospheric conditions , low average temperatures , and very low humidity will open an exciting new discovery space using adaptive optics and infrared observations , " outlined Edward Stone , Caltech physicist and vice chairman of the TMT board .
At the moment the project is awaiting approval from the state .
In addition , $ 100 million is required for the construction of the telescope .
The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation will provide an extra $ 300 million .
TMT is the project that united the forces of Caltech , the University of California and ACURA , a group of Canadian Universities .
More information is available here .
Other large telescopes that are to be constructed in the near future include the European Extremely Large Telescope with a diameter of 42 meters and Giant Magellan Telescope with a primary mirror measuring 24.5 meters across .
Both telescopes are expected to be completed by 2018 .

The first one is the Snow Leopard that comes in the box and Apple 's site .
The second one , which shows clear traces of blood around his mouth , is the one that ships inside Mac OS X Snow Leopard , as a desktop background .

Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( seen with Sens. Chuck Grassley and Max Baucus ) chairs the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , to which the AARP 's angry letter was addressed .
AARP threatens sens .
on health care
Horse trading in Washington is infamous .
But it 's rare to catch a glimpse of the horse in the midst of the trade in real time .
Friday was one of those rare exceptions when the powerful lobby for seniors , the AARP , sent a memo to Senate officials threatening to yank support for the chamber 's health committee 's version of reform if it did n't get what it wanted on another provision in the bill related to biogeneric drugs .
Advertisement
The sharply worded memo , sent through an e-mail obtained by POLITICO late Friday , illustrates the hardball politics and dealmaking going on behind the scenes as Congress considers a trillion - dollar overhaul of the health care system .
In the Thursday e-mail sent to Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee health policy staff director David Bowen , AARP lobbyist Nora Super spells out the deal :
" I cannot recommend a letter of support or a major grass - roots effort in support [ of the health care reform bill ] .
Indeed , people will probably have to be critical , particularly about that provision .
I hope you wo n't force us to do that on such an important bill that I know you all have worked so hard on , " she wrote in the e-mail .
" Again , AARP wants to be supportive ; however , we also need to feel as if the concerns of our members have been heard , " Super wrote .
Senate committee spokesman Anthony Coley said of the e-mail : " We do n't comment on private conversations , especially those with allies who share our belief that health reform should reduce costs , protect choice and guarantee high quality , affordable health care for all Americans . "
At issue is the creation of a federal approval process for generic biologics , drugs such as insulin that are proteins made by living organisms .
Name - brand drug makers want exclusive rights to sell biologics for 12 to 14 years before a similar generic version can be marketed .
AARP is pushing for a shorter window .
" We believe strongly , along with many other consumer , business , labor , insurance , [ pharmacy benefit managers ] , and provider groups , that a double digit exclusivity period is simply too long and therefore not acceptable .
We would be explicitly negative if this is the bill the Committee reports out , " Super wrote .
In an interview on Friday , Super said her e-mail to Bowen was intended to express disappointment about the direction the committee was headed on a key AARP priority .
" That was n't what I would perceive as a threat , " she said .
" It was a private correspondence .
I 'm not going to talk to you about what it did or did n't mean .
It was n't meant to be a story for the press . "
In the e-mail , Super tells Bowen that the high prices of biologic drugs are a major problem for seniors and that lowering their cost is more important to AARP 's membership than drug re-importation .
" I believe AARP could have not been more clear throughout this process that prescription drugs is one of our number one issues for our members , " she wrote .
" Thus , we are having trouble understanding reports that so many Committee Democrats — led by your team - refuses [ sic ] to budge on this issue . "
A senior pharmaceutical industry lobbyist , who opposes the AARP - sought changes , said the e-mail illustrates that the seniors ' organization , which offers insurance products and could stand to gain from cheaper drug prices , puts its business interests before its public policy concerns .
" The worst kept secret in health care circles is that AARP is more about its insurance wing than it is about seniors .
If this is n't the smoking gun , I 'm not sure what is , " the lobbyist said .
" I can't believe that AARP would threaten the Senate with pulling its support for health reform for their insurance wing .
They say they have a firewall .
Some firewall , huh ? "
But AARP spokesman Drew Nannis called the charge bunk .
" Our push for health reform will continue for more than 40 million members and it is n't surprising that any discussion about lowering drug prices might draw the ire of the pharmaceutical industry , " he said .
" Any assertion that products that bear AARP 's name somehow dictate policy is ridiculous . "
About a dozen residents of Maurice Avenue on the north end of an island of La Crescenta homes known as Briggs Terrace found themselves Saturday afternoon in the middle of the road , taking stock of their ominous situation .
( An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to Maurice Avenue as Maurice Street . )
They were surrounded by fire on three sides , and there were no firefighters or law enforcement in sight .
One asked a question that was on everyone ’s minds :
Is anybody leaving ?
All of them shook their heads no .
The evacuation order had come down after nightfall for the Briggs Terrace area , a century - old collection of homes in the Craftsman and cabin style , along with newer stucco custom models .
“ We started thinking smart and came up with a plan , ” said Greg Lievense , 54 , an engineer at nearby Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The group broke up into teams of three with an agreement that no one would be alone for the duration of the emergency .
One neighbor began stockpiling ladders and flashlights .
" We broke up into ‘ ember shifts , ' " Lievense said .
Die von Schwarz - Rot beschlossenen Web - Sperren haben bei der SPD erneut einen interparteilichen Meinungsstreit ausgelöst .
Die Sozialdemokraten finden dabei nach wie vor keine einheitliche Linie zu dem heftig umkämpften Vorhaben .
So hat Gert Weisskirchen , außenpolitischer Sprecher der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion , das vom Bundestag Mitte Juni abgesegnete Gesetz zur Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten in Kommunikationsnetzen in einem Blog der Süddeutschen Zeitung befürwortet .
Zugleich liebäugelte er mit einer Ausdehnung der noch nicht in Kraft getretenen Online - Blockaden auf Hassseiten .
Eine solche Ausweitung " sollte klug bedacht werden " , betonte der Außenpolitiker , um etwa Antisemitismus besser zu bekämpfen .
Der Verhandlungsführer der SPD - Fraktion für das Vorhaben , Martin Dörmann , hatte während des Gesetzgebungsverfahrens dagegen immer wieder die strikte Einschränkung des geheimen Filterverzeichnisses auf kinderpornographische Angebote betont .
Baden - Württembergs SPD - Chefin Ute Vogt würde das Rad der Geschichte nun am liebsten zurückdrehen .
" Ich selbst bedauere es , dass wir diesem Gesetz in der großen Koalition zugestimmt haben " , sagte sie dem " Mannheimer Morgen " .
Viele Abgeordnete hätten sich offenbar noch nicht intensiv genug mit dem Thema befasst .
Sie wüssten nicht , inwieweit Internet - Sperren " zielführend sind – und inwieweit eben nicht " .
Die Zustimmung der Genossen zu der Initiative sei wohl nur zu erklären mit der Angst vor der Schlagzeile : " SPD will nichts gegen Kinderpornogaphie tun " .
Vogt , die nicht im Bundestag sitzt und somit nicht an der Abstimmung über das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz beteiligt war , freut sich daher über die " Piraten " in der eigenen Partei : " Ich bin froh , dass wir in der SPD eine junge Gruppe haben , die sich mit dem Internet beschäftigt .
Und die warnen , dieses Gesetz würde nur einen Schritt hin zur Zensur im Netz bedeuten . "
In diesem Sinne bedauert es die SPD - Vertreterin aus dem Ländle auch nicht , dass das Vorhaben sich wegen der Prüfung durch Brüssel verzögert .
Dabei geht Vogt sogar davon aus , dass das Gesetz wegen des Auslaufens der Legislaturperiode und den Neuwahlen im September " wohl nicht mehr in Kraft treten kann " .
Diese Ansicht wird von der Bundesregierung und vielen Rechtsexperten aber nicht geteilt .
Der sächsische Wirtschaftsminister Thomas Jurk von der SPD ließ sich in einem von der Freien Presse organisierten Chat derweil gegenüber einem von ihm ausgemachten " Piraten " trotz seines abgelegten Eids auf die Verfassung zu einer gewagten Aussage verleiten : " Wenn wir gegen das Grundgesetz verstoßen , weil wir Pädophilen unmöglich machen kinderpornografische Bilder aus dem Internet herunterzuladen , dann nehme ich das in Kauf " , erklärte der SPD - Spitzenkandidat für die Landtagswahl in Sachsen .
" Ich persönlich hoffe darauf , dass wir das Problem lindern , wenn wir den Kunden von Kinderpornografie das Leben schwerer machen . "
Wenn deshalb irgendwo auf der
Welt nur ein Kind nicht für pornographische Bilder missbraucht werde , habe sich der vielfach als Wegbereiter für umfassende Zensurmaßnahmen kritisierte Vorstoß gelohnt .

Read more about the idea behind this blog .
Sarah Palin , via her Facebook page , is the latest to spread the most bizarre rumor about what is in the health care legislation that is being drafted on Capitol Hill . :
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s “ death panel ” so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their “ level of productivity in society , ” whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil .
Yes , such a system would indeed be downright evil .
Which is why no one is proposing anything like it .
Let ’s repeat :
No one is proposing anything like it .
What is being considered was explained by President Obama at a July 28 AARP town hall meeting :
Q I have heard lots of rumors going around about this new plan , and I hope that the people that are going to vote on this is going to read every single page there .
I have been told there is a clause in there that everyone that ’s Medicare age will be visited and told to decide how they wish to die .
This bothers me greatly and I ’d like for you to promise me that this is not in this bill .
THE PRESIDENT : You know , I guarantee you , first of all , we just do n’t have enough government workers to send to talk to everybody , to find out how they want to die .
I think that the only thing that may have been proposed in some of the bills — and I actually think this is a good thing — is that it makes it easier for people to fill out a living will .
Now , Mary , you may be familiar with the principle behind a living will , but it basically is something that my grandmother — who , you may have heard , recently passed away — it gave her some control ahead of time , so that she could say , for example , if she had a terminal illness , did she want extraordinary measures even if , for example , her brain waves were no longer functioning ; or did she want just to be left alone .
That gives her some decision - making power over the process .
The problem is right now most of us do n’t give direction to our family members and so when we get really badly sick , sadly enough , nobody is there to make the decisions .
And then the doctor , who does n’t know what you might have preferred , they ’re making decisions , in consultation with your kids or your grandkids , and nobody knows what you would have preferred .
So I think the idea there is to simply make sure that a living will process is easier for people — it does n’t require you to hire a lawyer or to take up a lot of time .
But everything is going to be up to you .
And if you do n’t want to fill out a living will , you do n’t have to .
But it ’s actually a useful tool I think for a lot of families to make sure that if , heaven forbid , you contract a terminal illness , that you are somebody who is able to control this process in a dignified way that is true to your faith and true to how you think that end - of - life process should proceed .
You do n’t want somebody else making those decisions for you .
So I actually think it ’s a good idea to have a living will .
I ’d encourage everybody to get one .
I have one .
Michelle has one .
And we hope we do n’t have to use it for a long time , but I think it ’s something that is sensible .
But , Mary , I just want to be clear : Nobody is going to be knocking on your door ; nobody is going to be telling you you ’ve got to fill one out .
And certainly nobody is going to be forcing you to make a set of decisions on end - of - life care based on some bureaucratic law in Washington .
MAG , or Massive Action Game , was announced in 2008 during Sony ’s E3 Press Conference .
Due to the game achieving what was considered to be unachievable by providing a 256 - player online competitive FPS environment , many have speculated that the game would be quantity over quality .
And what better way to dispute that accusation than to host a public beta .
So far the beta has received a lot of positive feedback , so hopefully the quality has spoken for itself .
However , the 256 - player environment is n’t the only high - quantity element of the game .
MAG will also be home to dozens of different weapons to choose from .

I ’ve mentioned this before here on Booksquare .
There ’s an odd thing that happens when someone learns you ’re a published author .
This can be friend or complete stranger it does n’t matter .
Once they know you have a book on the shelf they now have a complete license to ask you anything .
This can be your sex life .
How much money you make .
Whether you get along with your co-workers .
Stuff many people would be horrified to ask , say , their dentist .
I was given a roll of “ Oklahoma Author ” stickers by my local Romance Writers Chapter .
Once my book is on the shelves , I go out and obsessively sticker every copy of my book within driving distance ( which is not as far as it used to be ) .
So , I ’m at a Wal - Mart by my house and see the now familiar large fan that allows me to spot my book yards away .
Yes , Booksquare , I went to Wal - Mart ( and ran down the aisles touching product ) .
Anyway , I ’m down on the floor with all the books scattered about me as I sticker them .
A woman casually walks by .
Walks away .
Walks back .
I ’m sure she ’s security .
Finally she asks me what I ’m doing .
After I assure her I ’m not defacing the books ( sort of ) she asks me questions # 1 .
Did you get a lot of money ?
My friend Gena Showalter told me to expect this question .
A lot .
Someone told me once to turn it around , ask the person how much THEY make .
I can never remember that suggestion when this actually happens .
Usually I just smile and babble something incoherently .
So , is there a lot of sex in this book ?
Is it really smutty ?
This question used to really irk me .
My book also has plot , dialogue … bunch of other stuff I learned in school .
I work hard to deliver a good story .
Sex is only a small part blah blah blah – I ’m sure you get the picture why this is irritating .
Now – how I answer this depends on which response I think will make you buy my book .
( Acquaintances of mine might be rethinking past conversations . )
Now my husband gets versions of this question .
I ’ve suggested he just look really , really tired .
Sigh heavily and say “ yes ” .
Is your husband really romantic ?
Is your house like that ?
It takes every once of effort on my part not to laugh and laugh and laugh .
I ’m married to an engineer , need I say more ?
I ’m curious , is there a particularly romantic profession out there ?
Actually , my husband gets off the hook in that department .
I ’m a romance writer , I can turn taking out the trash into a romantic gesture .
So , Brenda Hiatt did a lot of work on answering the question just how much authors make .
You can see it here .
DENVER , Aug. 26 ( UPI ) --
While eight of 10 Americans say they favor a public health insurance option , fewer than four in 10 can define what that option is , an AARP survey indicates .
The poll , conducted by Penn , Schoen and Berland Associates for AARP , was presented Tuesday in Denver , the Denver Business Journal reported Wednesday .

While results suggest strong agreement among respondents that healthcare delivery and payment must change , it also indicated less agreement on whether the matter required higher taxes or insurance premiums , said Charlie Cook , a political analyst in Washington .
Under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform proposal , a public option would be offered as one choice in a cafeteria - style menu of health insurance packages available to consumers .
Some opponents of the public option say it would lead to government - run healthcare .
Congress is deep in partisan and philosophical debate over the shape of healthcare reform , with criticism of Obama 's plan that includes a public insurance option coming from both Republicans and conservative Democrats .
Poll results indicated nearly 65 percent of those surveyed said they oppose increasing taxes to pay for covering the more than 46 million uninsured Americans , the business journal said .
However , a majority polled said they believed all people should be covered and 73 percent said they are unwilling to see private health insurance premiums rise to cover those costs .
The nationwide poll surveyed 1,000 adults identifying themselves Democrats , Republicans or independents this month .
No margin of error was provided .
In fact , we 're thinking it 's time they updated the psychological diagnostic manuals with this list of new disorders that only seem to kick in once the person opens a web browser .
The Internet makes people crazy .
We all know this .
The guy on the message board who just called you a shitclown for owning a different video game console than him probably would have been perfectly polite had you met in real life .

Like serial killers , these people seem pretty normal at first .
For hours or even days , they 'll carry on funny , charming conversations in a forum or comment section .
But then something , anything , sets him off and he devolves into a tantrum that would make Christian Bale say , " Dude , calm down !
Jesus . "
In Real Life it 's Called ...
Intermittent Explosive Disorder .
Out in the real world , IED is an impulse control disorder that can make a person act like their entire family has been murdered just because Burger King forgot to put their fries in the bag .
They 're prone to fits of uncontrollable rage in situations that do n't call for it .

This guy just found out the movie he wanted to go to is sold out .
And while it only affects around six percent of people in real life , on the Internet you run into one of these in almost every comment section .
And nothing sets them off like a mild hit to their ego :
IED Guy :
Hey guys I made this Photoshop , can I get some constructive criticism ?

A simultaneously hilarious and disturbing example of this made internet headlines in mid-June , when somebody emailed a congressman 's office and accidentally referred to his assistant Elizabeth as " Liz , " prompting an explosion of 19 furious emails in which Elizabeth demanded that she be called by her full name .
So Why Does it Happen on the Internet ?
First , there 's the obvious :
Most of us suppress our real - life spurts of rage for fear of getting punched in the face by the person we 're screaming at .
Second , on the Internet , where your looks , job , income and fancy clothes wo n't buy you any respect , some people seem to think they have to protect their reputation like an old west gunslinger : shooting down anybody who calls them out .

But then there 's the third , and least obvious reason , which is that without tone of voice and body language , it 's hard to convey mere annoyance or mild anger , without the fear that the person you 're conveying it to just plain wo n't notice .
So they think they have to crank it up to a 10 every time they 're crossed , even if they do n't mean it .
That 's probably the weirdest part , that these people who are SCREAMING INSULTS IN ALL CAPS are often at the same time sitting in a cubicle somewhere , sipping coffee and conversing pleasantly with the person next to them .
I ’ve been following the Encephalon blog carnival for many moons , so I was honored to be asked to host the 74th edition of what has become the premiere showcase for the best of the best in brain and mind blogging .
We ’re rabid Monty Python fans here at Neuronarrative , so this edition is crafted in the tradition of that estimable show without equal .
And here we go …
One , being the number of the first section .
Cognitive Daily starts off the carnival with an excellent post called Even non-musicians can express musical intentions with just one note , which addresses the question :
Does it take a music expert to convey emotion through music , or can anyone do it ?
Per usual , Cognitive Daily does a thorough job of pointing us to the answer , and you ’ll come away knowing you ’ve definately learned something .
And while we ’re talking about emotion , let ’s silly walk on over to Generally Thinking where we find a post entitled Six Success - Enhancing Behaviours that Good Moods Bring
You , which discusses research that teases out six quite pragmatic results of maintaining a sunny disposition .
Leaves me thinking that it ’s mighty important to always look on the bright side of life .
Over at Brain Stimulant , you ’ll discover a trenchant discussion of Free Will and the Brain , which does n’t only delve into the neuroscience behind one of humanity ’s perennial questions , but also a bit of quantum mechanics and a generous portion of philosophy of mind .
Weighty stuff this , indeed .
Before we go on , one question …is this the right place for an argument ?
Good .
Now , where were we ?
Ah yes …
I shall now taunt you a second time !
The Neurocritic comes in with two entries , and both warrant mention .
The first is called None of Us are Saints that discusses the case of Albert Fish , serial child killer and cannibal who was executed in 1936 .
He planned a notorious kidnapping and murder in a meticulous fashion but suffered from religious delusions .
Was he sane or insane ?
The second entry is entitled A New Clitoral Homunculus ?
( you read that correctly ) about a serious fMRI study that mapped the somatosensory representation of the clitoris in 15 healthy women .
The study involved electrical stimulation of the dorsal clitoral nerve ( all very clinical , no sexual arousal involved .
At least none that we can mention here ) .
For stimulation of a completely different sort , take a wander over to AK ’S Rambling Thoughts and read Concepts , Cognition , and Anthropomorphism , an erudite exploration into how the use of symbols and concepts significantly predated the development of language .
Fasten your seatbelts because it ’s a solid read .
Right !
By the way , with all the reading we brain and mind bloggers do , have I mentioned how much my brain hurts ?
I could really use a good Brain Specialist !
Three shall be the number of the section that you shall count , and the number of the counting shall be three .
Neuroanthropology brings us an excellent post called In Praise of Partial Explanation ( and Flowcharts ) , a stalwart defense of the use of flowcharts and diagramming .
Let me tell you something fellow readers , you ’ll not find a more thorough and readable discussion of flow charts and diagrams and how they enable us to make sense of complicated topics .
Quote me on that .
At Sharp Brains , we ’re treated to a piece entitled Preparing Society for the Cognitive Age that ’s reprinted with permission from the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience .
Discussing the latest questions in the brain fitness field , the article suggests that advances in brain health in the 21st century are not unlike the remarkable advances in cardiovascular health in the 20th century .
Good stuff .
Also from Sharp Brains , we have a worthwhile interview with the CEO of the AAA Foundation on a new cognitive based driver safety program called DriveSharp .
Cutting edge and immensely relevant .
Now here ’s a question you do n’t hear every day :
Why do schizophrenics smoke cigarettes ?
That ’s the topic on tap at Brain Blogger , and it ’s addressed splendidly .
Dopamine , attention , memory and sensory gating all cross paths in this well - referenced piece .
You ’ll finish wanting to learn more , and the author has provided the sources to get you there .
Here ’s another question :
What sort of delusion , do you think , leads one to want to become a lion tamer ?
And now onto the last scene .
A smashing scene with some lovely acting .
Neurospeculation brings us a post entitled A new test for semispatial neglect about an article in the Annals of Neurology that originated from a question asked in a high school classroom .
I wo n’t give away the punchline , but let me say that they ’ve got some smart students at Eastchester High .
Channel N Video gives us a video submission called Schizophrenic Man Terrifies Kids at Party , below .
You can read more about the video at the excellent site , Channel N , right here .
Finally , the always engaging Dr. Shock brings us a brief but informative post entitled Motives for Online Gaming that covers a study focused on , as the title suggests , why young adults play online video games .
Here ’s a hint : it ’s more than just about wearing cool headsets and virtually pistol whipping noobs .
Thanks to everyone who submitted entries for this edition — it has been my distinct pleasure to host .
The next edition of Encephalon will be hosted by Ionian Enchantment on September 14th , back on its regular fortnightly schedule .
Send your entries to encephalon.host@gmail.com .
Now , carry forth with your search for the Grail .
Just remember , do n’t risk another frontal assault from the rabbit …it ’s dynamite !
( nudge , nudge , wink , wink , know what I mean ? )
LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
An important Viking hoard of jewels and coins unearthed in England by a father - and - son team of treasure hunters in 2007 has been acquired by two museums and will go on display next month .
An undated handout picture released on August 27 , 2009 shows some of the hundreds of items from a Viking hoard of jewels unearthed in England by a father - and - son team of treasure hunters in 2007 .
REUTERS / The British Museum / Handout
The Vale of York hoard , valued at 1.1 million pounds ( $ 1.8 million ) and dated at 1,000 years old , includes objects from Afghanistan , Ireland , Russia and Scandinavia , underlining the global spread of cultural contacts during medieval times .
The York Museums Trust in York , northern England , and the British Museum in London bought the treasure , which they say is the most important find of its kind in Britain for 160 years .
“ This find is of global importance , as well as having huge significance for the history of England and Yorkshire , ” said Jonathan Williams , keeper of prehistory and Europe at the British Museum .
Robert Bewley , director of operations at the National Heritage Memorial Fund which contributed half the money needed to buy the hoard , added that the find “ provides us with a unique and wonderful snapshot of troubled times in Britain and Europe . ”
The hoard contains 67 objects and 617 coins , many of which were contained in a gilt silver vessel made in Europe in the middle of the ninth century .
It was probably intended for use in church services , and was believed to have been looted by Vikings from a monastery or given to them as a tribute .
Because it was kept in a lead container , it is well preserved .
The hoard contains coins relating to Islam and the pre-Christian religion of the Vikings , as well as to Christianity .
Experts believe the hoard was buried for safekeeping by a wealthy Viking leader during unrest that followed the conquest of the Viking kingdom of Northumbria by the Anglo - Saxon king Athelstan in 927 .
The Viking army conquered Northumbria in 869 and it remained under Viking control for nearly 60 years .
It is the largest and most important Viking hoard found in Britain since that discovered at Cuerdale , Lancashire , in 1840 which contained more than 8,000 objects .
For David Whelan and his son Andrew , who made the discovery , it was a treasure hunter ’s dream come true .
They found the hoard using metal detectors in a field near Harrogate in January , 2007 , and reported their find to the authorities , as required under law .
“ Being keen metal detectorists , we always dreamt of finding a hoard , but to find one from such a fantastic period of history is just unbelievable , ” they said in a statement .
“ The contents of the hoard we found went far beyond our wildest dreams . ”
They will divide the proceeds from the sale with the owner of the land where it was found .
Highlights of the hoard will go on display at the Yorkshire Museum in York from September 17 to November 1 before moving to the British Museum .

copy©unts
Blowing the whistle on advertising cunts - one cunt at a time .
It 's surprising how much software today still does n't support international characters out of the box .
Even in Slovenia it 's common to get to a brand new web site where one form or the other will not allow Slovenian characters ( č , ž and š ) to be entered .
Recently I was told by one Slovenian company that their " computer " only supports English letters when I complained that my name was misspelled on their correspondence .
While Unicode has been established as a standard way to represent most of the world 's writing for most than 15 years now , it still often gets supported as an afterthought and even then it 's usually more of an ugly hack .
However , even if you 're writing software from the bottom up with Unicode in mind you often have to communicate with other legacy systems that will only accept 7 - bit ASCII .
In that case , you want to choose the path of least surprise for the user ( No , replacing all characters outside of ASCII with " ? " is not it ) .
transliteration : the act or product of transliterating , or of representing letters or words in the characters of another alphabet or script .
Or , in this case particular case , finding the sequence of ASCII characters that is the closest approximation to your Unicode string .
For example , the closest to string " Tomaž " in ASCII is " Tomaz " .
Some information is lost in this transformation , of course , since several Unicode strings can be transformed in the same ASCII representation .
So this is a strictly one - way transformation .
However a human reader will probably still be able to guess what original string was meant from the context .
The same transformation can be useful when trying to match a proper Unicode string stored in some database with a string that was entered by a user with an US keyboard that is too lazy or ignorant to properly spell a foreign word ( another one of my pet peeves , by the way ) .
Sean M. Burke wrote
Text :: Unidecode , a wonderful Perl module that performs Unicode transliteration I described .
However , since I mostly write Python code at work , I kept missing an equivalent library in Python .
So , here 's my port of Sean 's module to Python .
I took the most convenient path and did pretty much literal translation , with most of the work done by a simple script that converted character tables from Perl to Python syntax .
The use is pretty straight forward and it works even on more complicated cases :
from unidecode import unidecode print unidecode ( u" \u5317\u4EB0 " ) #
That prints : Bei Jing
You can get the source directly from a git repository :

To install , use the classic Python trick :
$ python setup.py install $ python setup.py test
Update :
The repository above is no longer available .

If you 're going to use this for anything mission - critical , the original documentation is still a good read .

As I put together my recent post on the role of boosted intelligence in meshing infinite human aspirations with a finite planet , it brought to mind a theme that has been tugging at me for years now .
It ’s the question of how to blend data , uncertainty and values to produce a worldview and way of life in a time of great change , risk , opportunity and complexity .
As an introduction to this question , I offer below a version of a talk I ’ve been giving of late , named after this blog .
It may be the only time you ’ll see the word puberty in a discussion of environmental sustainability .
To a modest extent , I ’m trying to take the approach Murray Gell - Mann has extolled in discussing the value of taking a “ crude look at the whole . ”
The answers are starting to emerge , in large part thanks to the ongoing discussion here ( in other words , largely thanks to you ) .
But for now , here ’s a framing of the question .
9 Billion People + 1 Planet = ?
At a quickening pace , humanity is etching its signature across the Earth , diverting waterways and downing forests , spreading pythons to the Everglades and American bullfrogs to Bordeaux , extracting minerals used in cellphones from a last patch of gorilla habitat , altering the atmosphere , knitting the land with roadways and the sky with contrails .
For two generations , the nascent environmental movement railed against this process .
Like many , I was weaned on that scary sensibility .
Population was a ticking bomb .
Spring threatened to be silent .
I still admire those who led the call for cleaning up the mess people had created in the rise and spread of industrialized , consumptive living .
But lately I ’ve come to see those recent dirty decades less as malfeasance ( mind you , there have been plenty of dubious actors ) and more as an inevitable phase , a transition as natural — and volatile — as puberty .
The real question is , what comes next ?
As its moment on Earth has arrived , H. sapiens , one of nature ’s great experiments , has necessarily had to have a selfish , muscle - flexing , exuberant adolescence .
It is only natural for a young person to break things , burn things , kill things , to be mean and even nasty sometimes , if only to learn how that attitude can bite back .
In a youth ’s life , mistakes are not only inevitable ; they are vital .
In fact , by one measure we truly are a teenage species at this moment .
There are currently about 1.2 billion humans between the ages of 10 and 19 .
Some demographers have recently concluded that this so - called “ youth bulge ” could well constitute the largest single generation that will ever exist ( as long as humans are restricted to this planet , at least ) .
This pulse of youth is not only intensifying pressures on resources , but also providing fodder for extremist movements and contributing to social unrest as employment fails to keep up .
If provided with education and opportunity , however — perhaps as simple as a micro-loan of $ 200 to buy some tools — those in this generation can be a force for progress .

We all know , at a personal level , the pivot point I ’m talking about .
One winter when I was 12 or so , growing up in a Rhode Island suburb , a friend invited me over to his house to try out his BB gun .
My dad had one on the small sailboat we cruised around in during the summer , which we used to perforate tossed soda cans so they would sink to the seabed .
( This was before recycling . )
Behind his house , Doug and I crouched on the cement steps leading from the basement with a different intent .
We took turns aiming at the chickadees and titmice that flitted in the trees and on the clothesline strung in his back yard .
I pulled the trigger .
A ball of feathers fluttered wildly and fell to the snow , flinging flecks of blood and downy tufts in every direction on the whiteness before it lay still and died .
Every detail of that little murder was welded indelibly in my brain .
I have great respect for the hunters I know who hone their woodcraft carefully and shoot to kill –- and eat .
But after I shot that bird , I never shot at a living thing again .
There comes a time in almost everyone ’s youth when those remarkable human traits , self - awareness and empathy , catch up with potency , when you pause and reflect , when you first look back at the muddy tracks you just left across a floor and conclude that you are the person who needs to mop things up .
Most people go through this transition successfully and become responsible citizens .
Most of us would not leave the scene of an accident .
Now it may be humanity ’s turn to go through the same kind of transition .
All species that have preceded people as planetary powerhouses never had to worry about such a coming of age because , as far as we can tell , they had no inner mirror or global view .
They pressed on like bacteria on agar or rust on iron , pushing out to peripheral zones where only the absence of essentials prevented them from advancing .
People have eternally pressed outward as well , but with a difference .
Through the rise of human civilizations , individual communities came to the realization that they could not be perpetually wanton , that they had to store seed for spring , that if they stole from their neighbors they would probably be robbed in kind , that if they stained a river and sickened those downstream , there was nothing to prevent the next upriver village from fouling their waters .
Over time , norms evolved .
Neighboring countries followed suit , entering peace pacts and economic agreements .
And most recently came global treaties , first to establish mutually beneficial rulebooks for issues like the treatment of prisoners of war , more recently to foster fairness in trade and enact shared standards for protecting the globe ’s commons –- its atmosphere , biological veneer and seas .
But , so far at least , these have just been baby steps .
That is not surprising .
After all , one could argue that it has just been 40 years since we really got our first good look at ourselves .
Some have even put a date on that epiphany , December 24 , 1968 , which happens to be right around the time I shot that little bird .
If there ever was a moment in human history that put all of our travails and disputes in context , it came on that day , when Frank Borman , Jim Lovell and Bill Anders , the three astronauts on Apollo 8 , became the first humans to orbit the Moon .
Anders had spent nearly an hour photographing craters and other features on the surface , charting possible landing sites for subsequent flights .
When he was done , Borman began adjusting the spacecraft ’s attitude , tilting the nose back up in line with the horizon .
As he did so , an object came into view floating in space just above the blazingly bright pocked moonscape .
It was the first “ Earthrise ” ever witnessed by human eyes .
The reactions of Borman and the others were captured in a tape recording .
“ Oh my God , ” Anders exclaimed .
“ Look at that picture over there !
Here ’s the Earth coming up ! ”
One of the resulting photographs set Earth in sobering isolation in a way that its inhabitants had perhaps never appreciated before .
Interestingly , while the mission planners at NASA had anticipated virtually every activity of the astronauts , hour by hour , minute by minute , they had not foreseen the simple emotional power of looking back at the fertile home planet over the barren shoulder of its sterile moon .
From that point on , our worldview has been steadily enriched , as ever more expeditions , satellites , and sensors have been lofted into space or deposited in the oceans to study , photograph , and measure everything from plankton blooms to urban sprawl .
Observations in real time are only one facet of the self - awareness revolution .
Ever -expanding understanding of the planet ’s distant and recent geophysical and biological past has helped put the human impact on the planet in context , and opened our eyes to natural perils that have only been hinted at in the blink of an eye we call history .
Some of our actions are the equivalent of faint static behind the stronger signal of natural variations in droughts , storms and the like .
But other research has shown that human actions have put us in the planetary driver ’s seat even though we have not yet passed driver ’s ed.
Scientists have recently concluded that people are the dominant force shaping ecosystems .
We have up - ended the oceans ’ web of life , removing 90 percent of the mass of great predatory fishes that were there a century ago .
And , through the use of pesticides , genetic manipulation and antibiotics , humans are now said to be the dominant influence on natural selection , the engine of evolution .
Perhaps most consequentially in the long run , we are altering the insulating power of the atmosphere by raising the concentration of a trace , but influential , greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , more than a third in 150 years .
We are well on the way at least to doubling its concentration compared to levels that were the norm for more than 800,000 years and likely far longer .
A century of science has built a robust understanding that this trend is nudging the planet ’s thermostat in ways that are already perceptible and could be disruptive both for us and for ecosystems from the tropics to the poles .
The view ahead is afforded by the newest scientific tool : simulation .
For three centuries , science relied on two practices to advance : observation of the world and experimentation to test hypotheses about what made things work .
But because there is only one Earth , and it is already in the midst of a planet - size experiment – the buildup of greenhouse gases – the only way to test various outcomes is to build mockups of the planet using equations .
The ongoing explosion of computer power has allowed geophysicists to construct ever more detailed mathematical “ stunt planets ” that can be subjected to all kinds of abuses that could not be done safely or responsibly on the real Earth .
Integrated with lessons from the past and observations of current changes , the models — while still highly imperfect — have created a picture of a planet that will be increasingly under our sway for generations , indeed centuries , to come .
Not only is knowledge exploding in volume , but it is also spreading around the world as satellites , fiber - optic cables , and other communication links knit communities and the global knowledge base .
This is happening at every level of society .
Governments have initiated the first Global Earth Observation System of Systems , an attempt to link satellites and other environmental monitoring technologies into a single database .
Squatters in shantytowns in Africa and Asia now are linked by the Internet through a network of “ Shack Dweller ” associations , through which they trade information on common issues .
Cell phones allow Kenyan farmers , still lacking a lamp at home , to get the price of corn before heading to market .
Hundreds of millions of computer users have downloaded their own personal worldview , Google Earth .
There was a Russian geochemist , Vladimir Vernadsky , who in the 1930 ’s foresaw a day when the globe evolved from simply being a common habitat for myriad species to being what he called a “ noosphere , ” a planet of the mind , a place where ecology and enlightened human intelligence meld .
We ’re nowhere near anything like that .
But the turbulence of our times , reflected in everything from terrorism to the thawing of the iconic frozen seascape of the Arctic , hint that a great transformation , for better or worse , is in the offing .
To some extent , this transition boils down to a question :
What do we want to be when we grow up ?
How to Remortgage
I was doing some research the other day and came across a word I had honestly never heard of : remortgage .
I had no idea what it was so I thought I would do an article explaining what it is for my readers out there that had n’t heard of a remortgage either .
What is a remortgage ?
You ’ve heard of a remortgage — you just do n’t know it .
A remortgage is also called a refinance .
( The light bulb went on for me . )
At the end of the day with a remortgage you pay off your current home mortgage balance with a new loan .
That new loan , of course , usually comes with a lower interest rate or some other perk that gives you the incentive to give up your current mortgage .
Steps to Remortgage
There are certain steps you need to take to remortgage , or refinance , your home .
These are the basic steps you ’ll have to go through .
Assess Your Current Mortgage Situation
Before you can decide what type of remortgage loan you want you need to understand how your current loan is structured .
You need to know :
current balance
current interest rate
current payment
current term ( is it a 15 - year or a 30 - year mortgage ? )
Once you ’ve gathered this information ( which you should know already ! ) you can make an informed decision moving forward .
Compare Rates
There are tons of ways to compare rates .
Call your local banks and credit unions and speak with a loan officer .
Check Bankrate.com ’s mortgage rate section to get an idea of what you should be paying .
Look at different national bank websites as they generally list generic rates .
Remember as you do your research that the rate you end up with is dependent on many variables such as your credit score , the amount of the loan compared to the value of the house ( loan - to - value ratio ) , and the individual bank .
Consider Remortgage Costs
You also must consider how much a remortgage is going to cost you .
If the closing costs involved with getting a new loan are too high , it might make sense to stay in the higher interest rate loan .
That sounds crazy , but here ’s an example .
Let ’s say to close on a loan that will drop your rate 1.00 % and save you $ 100 per month you will pay closing costs of $ 5,000 .
That means it will take 50 months of saving that $ 100 you get every month from refinancing to pay for the closing costs .
That ’s over 4 years of diligent saving .
Is it worth it ?
You have to decide .
Will you be in the house more than 4 years ?
If you plan to never move again then sure it makes sense — you ’re still saving $ 100 .
But the cost is high and you might want to shop around some more .
Get Appraisal
Once you ’ve decided on a lender to work with they will send out an appraiser to value your home .
Up to this point you ’ve probably given them figures about how much you paid for the home , what you think it is worth , and how homes are selling in the neighborhood .
If you ’ve got a ton of equity in your house this is n’t something to be worried about .
Only when you get close to the loan ratios that would break a deal ( you ’ve got less than 10 % equity , or something like that ) should you start to worry .
An appraiser simply comes out and measures the home to verify square footage , and then gives an assessment as to the value .
Is your yard trashed ?
Is the siding in need of replacement ?
Or have you upgraded everything and it really stands out as a great home in the neighborhood ?
All these ( and many more ) will affect the value of your home .
( And the value of your home affects how much money you can get to refinance with . )
Close the Remortgage Deal
This falls under the should - be - easy - but - is - kind - of - stressful category .
You ’ll go to the closing office and bring your check for remortgage closing costs .
The bank and title agent will be there .
You ’ll sign away your life — again — on a mortgage .
In 30 minutes or so you walk away , new mortgage , interest rate , and lower payment in hand .

The first panicky retreat in the war on free speech in the UK has begun .
As I wrote last week , the British Chiropractic Association is suing science journalist Simon Singh for saying that chiropractors practice " bogus " medicine .
Instead of defending what they do with research and testing , they are acting to silence Singh and chill anyone else who may want to expose what they do .
This attack on free speech has been rippling outward over the past few days , and now there is an ironic twist : the McTimoney Chiropractic Association has strongly warned its practitioners to take down their websites and replace any information on their techniques with just brief contact information .
Why would they do that ?
Because of what we consider to be a witch hunt against chiropractors , we are now issuing the following advice :
The target of the campaigners is now any claims for treatment that cannot be substantiated with chiropractic research .
The safest thing for everyone to do is [... ] [ i ] f you have a website , take it down NOW .
Heh .
Gee , why the heck would anyone want to make sure that a chiropractor -- a person who will be futzing around with your spine -- be able to substantiate their claims with ( gasp ) RESEARCH ?
It 's very telling , is n't it , that the McTimoney group is n't telling its people to only stick with proven methods , but instead to take down any claims that might get them sued .
Interesting .
If you go to the McTimoney website , all it has now is a terse note with contact information , with no other information on the technique at all .
Interesting .
Of course , this being the web and all , the missing websites are archived and can be found online .
Very interesting !
And the word is spreading ; this is on Quackometer , Sys - Con Media , and ChiropracticLive .
You can expect to see it lots of other places soon as well .
Maybe the British Chiropractic Association and other such practitioners should have looked up the Streisand effect before acting .
But then , " Ready , fire , aim ! " is the mantra for a lot of groups like this .
The backlash has begun , folks .
Let 's make sure it keeps going .
Nationalism is the culprit
One of the comments on my previous article on Sri Lanka for Le Monde diplomatique ’s blog was : “ Please write objectively on other conflicts too . ”
So here I ’d like to discuss the concept of revenge , and reflect on how the legitimate fight for human rights can transmute into terrorism when tainted by perverted fantasies of nationalism .
The non-violent civil - rights protests in Northern Ireland were hi-jacked by the Provisional IRA who appointed themselves protectors of the Catholic community and hitched the issue to their own nationalist agenda of a united Ireland .
Is there an inevitable regression from Northern Irish Catholics suffering discrimination , to innocent English ( and Irish ) people being blown to giblets while enjoying a drink with friends ?
In Sri Lanka , militant separatism gained strength and developed into terrorism when Tamils ’ grievances were not addressed through the normal democratic process .
Inaction by successive governments led to action by militants which led to reaction from the ill - disciplined and ineffective security forces .
Like the Black and Tans in Ireland , who burned villages in reprisal for rebel actions , Sri Lankan soldiers responded to the killing of comrades by killing innocents .
The horrific anti-Tamil violence of July 1983 accelerated the emigration of Tamils from Sri Lanka , which in turn strengthened the position of the LTTE against other Tamil groups because of diaspora funding .
Where is the proportionality between unfair university admission quotas and a 30 - year war and 100,000 dead ?
What was the connection between discrimination against Tamils and extortion and drug trading ?
How did the Sinhala - only policy lead to the assassination of Tamil politicians and the maiming of small children ?
How can a recurrence of such conflict be prevented ?
“ Revenge does n’t know how to choose between the guilty and the innocent ” .
Slavko Goldstein wrote that in his book , 1941 : The Year That Keeps Returning .
Goldstein is a Croatian Jew and describes the ethnic tensions during the second world war in former Yugoslavia .
Goldstein ’s father , who was a communist as well as a Jew , was taken away by the Ustashi , the ruling elite of the Nazi puppet state of Croatia , and never seen again .
The Ustashi began rounding up Serbs in April 1941 .
Extermination camps were set up in the woods and ravines of the Velebit Mountains .
One camp at Jadnovno lasted 55 days and held 4,000 Serbs and Jews .
Of those , 3,999 were killed ( one escaped ) by taking them to the edge of a pit where they were bludgeoned with sledgehammers and axes .
These events were remembered in the 1990s when Milosevic , in his push for a Greater Serbia , massacred Muslims and Croats .
The poet , Charles Simic comments : “ Once more , the culprit was nationalism , that madness of identifying with a single ethnic group to a point where one recognises no other duty other than furthering its interests even if it means placing its actions beyond good and evil .
Many the world over believe this is the only way ; that the survival of their people justifies any crime they commit .
They find the scruples of those who cringe at the shedding of innocent blood in pursuit of some noble cause naive and repugnant ” .
Benedict Anderson wrote : “ It is the magic of nationalism to turn chance into destiny ” .
Nations “ loom out of an immemorial past ” and “ glide into a limitless future . ”
Or , in the words of Ernest Gellner : “ Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self - consciousness : it invents nations where they do not exist . ”
Paul Ignotus , meanwhile , wrote of Hungary : “ A nation is born when a few people decide that it should be . ”
Irish historians like Roy Foster have deconstructed their nation ’s foundation myths : “ The construction of ‘ advanced ’ Irish nationalism at home relied on buttressing from abroad , and so did the creation of Irish identity . ”
As large and influential Irish communities were established in the US and Britain , the Irish diaspora kept alive the fairy tales .
Sinister men rattled collection boxes in north London pubs “ for the boys ” .
Americans dreamed about their romantic Irish roots and gave money to Noraid for IRA arms .
Nationalists in Ceylon such as AE Goonesinha were stimulated by accounts of Parnell , Davitt and the Irish freedom movement and closely followed Irish events in the late 19th and early 20th century .
Sinhalese Buddhist thinkers such as Ratmalane Sri Dharmarama thero and the Tamil disciple of William Morris , Ananda Coomaraswamy , wrote of an ancient , highly developed Lankan civilisation .
Another Sinhalese , Anagarika Dharmapala , wistfully dreamed of a dazzling past : “ We must wake from our slumber …
We were a great people ” .
The Tamil political leader , Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam , wrote in his diary : “ Thought much of the unhappy conditions of our country and what a glorious thing it would be for Ceylon to emulate and excel her great past . ”
Modern - day Sri Lankans might echo Adamantios Koraes ’s 1803 remarks about his contemporary Greeks ’ relation to their classical ancestors .
He said : “ We must either try to become again worthy of this name , or we must not bear it . ”
Sinhalese and Tamils , just like the Irish and countless other “ nationalities ” , delude themselves with the false memory syndrome of ancient glories and rights , which , unfortunately , are too often defined by hatred of “ the other ” .
The film critic Mark Cousins has noted the current prevalence of vengeance as a theme in movies .
One of the questions of our time is how a tribe that has been harmed finds peace .
Filmmakers ’ answer seems to be to return harm to those who harmed .
Movies seem to give comfort by ventilating an audience ’s feelings of impotence .
Armchair warriors get some satisfaction by keeping anger alive and espousing vengeance as if life were a movie , the pain of the wounded and incarcerated a matter relevant to their own egos .
Action and reaction – will the cycle never be broken ?
Debates on blogs often generate more heat than light .
One despairs about reconciliation in Sri Lanka when one reads comments like this : “ While you are at the praying mood also pray that the Transnational Tamils will be merciful on the Sinhalese when they are done with the ground work for a bigger and more deadlier struggle against you , your racist Sinhalese sisters and brothers led by your majesty the King Mahinda ” .
Tough guy at the keyboard without even good grammar !
On the other side there are many expressions by bloggers of distasteful Sinhalese triumphalism .
In 1938 the Irish nationalist , Stephen Gwynn , wrote : “ We know in Ireland , and probably they know in Poland , in Slovakia and in Russia , and in a score of other countries where revolution has succeeded , what is the cost of victorious hate . ”
There comes a time when truth and reconciliation has to take the place of endlessly rehearsing grievances from centuries back , as the Irish were prone to do .
Sectarian killings in Northern Ireland sporadically continued long after the IRA gave up their arms , but peace now seems the norm .
Only this week loyalist paramilitaries announced that they had renounced violence ( tell that to the Roma that they terrorised into leaving Ireland ) .
In Sri Lanka , the grievances are still present and sharp and will take skilful and sensitive action by the victorious and currently popular government to manage .
Ernest Renan wrote that nationhood requires forgetting many things .
He cited the massacre of Huguenots on St Bartholomew ’s Day as a symbol of the kind of thing France needed to forget in order to be a nation .
Will Sri Lankans be able to forget the many horrors of recent decades and forge a new nation combining all cultural histories as successfully as the Sri Lankan cricket team ?

FedEx's new " multimillion - dollar marketing campaign " does n't tout the delivery company 's service or speed .
It accuses rival United Parcel Service ( UPS ) of receiving a government bailout .
FedEx 's website BrownBailout.com claims UPS is " quietly seeking a Congressional bailout designed to limit competition for overnight deliveries . "
One marketing executive said the campaign may backfire on FedEx , as " this is clearly not a bailout as most consumers and business people would define it , which is writing a check to a troubled business . "
At issue is " a provision in a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill " that would reclassify some FedEx employees under the National Labor Relations
Act , making it easier for them to form unions .
UPS , which is " heavily unionized , " is already classified under the Act.
UPS spokesman Malcolm Berkley said that FedEx " uses the fact of the labor law it is currently under inappropriately as a lever when talking to UPS customers , particularly when we 're negotiating our contracts . "
UPS is n't responding to the FedEx campaign , but the Teamsters union , which represents 240,000 UPS workers , is .
A Teamsters press release accuses FedEx CEO Fred Smith of spending " millions of dollars on misleading ad campaigns and high - priced lobbyists [ rather ] than allow[ing ] workers a real chance to form a union . "
It ’s ‘ Victory Day ’ again in North Korea – or to be precise , the ‘ Day of Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War , ’ over the United States and United Nations .
For those who have wondered how Pyongyang has come to call the 50 - year standoff a ‘ victory , ’ South Korea ’s Daily North Korea , staffed by people who have escaped the land of Kim Jong - il and work to alert the outside world to what ’s going on there , offer this explanation .
For the Daily North Korea , Yoo Gwan - hee writes in small part :
“ The North always promotes the Korean War as ‘ victorious ’ primarily because it was Kim Il - sung who preemptively attacked ; so if the North were to concede defeat , the subsequent failure to spread Communism across the Korean Peninsula would fall directly on him .
“ According to Volume 12 of The Complete Works of Kim Il- sung , which has greater legal and moral influence than the Constitution , the Korean War is recorded as a war in which the North was invaded .
“ North Korea maintains that thanks to the war , Pyongyang was able to humiliate the United States , a great power that takes pride in its long history of victory in war .
From North Korea ’s point of view , inflicting this humiliation alone is worthy of the word ‘ victory . ' ”

South Korea – Daily North Korea – Original Article ( English )
“ With the devotion of the Chosun People who opposed the American military invaders and Seungman Rhee ’s gang of puppets , the war to liberate the Fatherland has resulted in our victory . ”
So reads a decree issued by Kim Il - sung dated July 27th , 1953 ( Order No. 470 of the Chosun People ’s Army ’s Supreme Commander ) .
Sanford admits affair
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , crying at times , admitted Wednesday to having an extramarital affair with an Argentine woman
" I 've been unfaithful to my wife , " Sanford said at a state capitol news conference hours after he returned to the country from a visit to his mistress in Argentina .
It began very innocently , " he explained , saying he had known the woman for eight years .
But the relationship with somebody he only called a " dear , dear friend " developed into an adulterous relationship in the past year .
He said he seen his mistress three times since they began the affair or , as he put it , " since the whole sparking thing . "
Sanford said the two met via " a casual email back and forth . "
In disclosing his affair , Sanford also announced he was resigning his post as Chairman of the Republican Governor 's Association .
Taking questions from reporters , Sanford said his wife knew about the relationship before his trip last week and that " they had been working through this thing for about the last five months . "
He shed tears as he explained how helpful one friend had been .
He also choked up when he said : " This has been selfishness on my part . "
Sanford 's admission caps an extraordinary week in which he was revealed to having been in Argentina and not , as his staff said , hiking on the Appalachian trail .
Before disclosing his relationship , Sanford apologized profusely to a number of family and friends as well as his staff .
" I 've let down a lot of people -- that 's the bottom line , " Sanford said .
In what were at times rambling remarks during an 18 - minute news conference , Sanford delved into the nature of sin and explained his affinity for " adventure trips . "
He said that he spent " the past five days of my life crying in Argentina so I could repeat it to when I came back here . "
He requested a " zone of privacy " for his family , who are out of the capital and in the governor 's Sullivan 's Island , S.C. , beach house .
The four centers cited in the report are the Lansing Residential Center and the Louis Gossett Jr. Residential Center in Lansing , and two residences , one for boys and one for girls , at Tryon Residential Center in Johnstown .
Officials at the centers also routinely failed to follow state rules requiring reviews whenever force is used , the report said .
In some cases , the same staff member involved in an episode conducted the review of it .
And even when a review determined that excessive force had been used , the staff members responsible sometimes faced no punishment .
In one case , a youth counselor with a documented record of using excessive force was recommended for firing after throwing a youth to the ground with such force that stitches were required on the youth ’s chin .
But after the counselor ’s union intervened , the punishment was downgraded to a letter of reprimand , an $ 800 fine and a two - week suspension that was itself suspended .
The federal inquiry began in December 2007 following a spate of incidents at some of the 28 state - run juvenile residential centers , which house about 1,000 youths .
In November 2006 , an emotionally disturbed teenager , Darryl Thompson , 15 , died after two employees at the Tryon center pinned him down on the ground .
The death was ruled a homicide , but a grand jury declined to indict the workers .
The boy ’s mother is suing the state .
During the same period , a separate joint investigation by the state inspector general and the Tompkins County district attorney found that the independent ombudsman ’s office charged with overseeing youth prison centers had virtually ceased to function .
In a report by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union issued in September 2006 , New York ’s youth residential centers were rated among the worst in the world .
Those scandals spurred a drive within Ms. Carrión ’s department to overhaul the system .
It reconstituted the ombudsman ’s office and issued clearer policies on the use of physical force , leading to a sharp drop in instances where restraints were applied .
Mermaids , Centaurs and Sam Brownback
Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) — an ardent anti-abortion activist — is worried that the Obama administration 's loosening of restrictions on stem cell research will result in the creation of a new race of bio-engineered " human- animal " hybrid freaks .
Or beautiful mermaids .
The bill — modeled on an inexplicably overlooked effort by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal — would ban the creation of " part - human , part - animal creatures , which are created in laboratories , and blur the line between species . "
The legislation , he says , " is limited in scope " and would n't limit the use of some animal parts for human use , including porcine pig valves .
Despite giving no concrete examples of what such hybrids would look like ( i.e. Spider - Man ) , he 's got 20 co-sponsors including one Dem , Mary Landrieu ( D - La . ) .
" As our nation suffers through the greatest economic decline in a generation and our country 's brightest minds are working tirelessly to reverse course , what does Sen. Brownback propose ?
Banning mermaids , " quipped Chris Harris of Media Matters .

THE just - introduced ( and just - canceled ) Pontiac Solstice coupe is already assured a place in automotive history , and not only because its fleeting production run lasted mere months .
This new targa - top Solstice is the last of the Pontiacs , the final breath of a brand that failed to adapt to a changing world .
Once - proud Pontiac is being phased out by General Motors , its parent , and will be gone in 2010 .
The Solstice coupe , a fixed - roof variation of the four - year - old roadster , is Pontiac ’s last new model .
It could become something of a collector ’s item .
“ We expect that total production will be in the neighborhood of 1,100 units when we cease operations at the Wilmington plant by the end of July , ” Jim Hopson , a Pontiac spokesman , wrote in an e-mail message .
All Solstice coupes will have sequential ID numbers , so owners will know exactly which car of the 1,100 they have .
The coupe I tested was the hot GXP version , which comes with a 260 - horsepower 4 - cylinder engine .
Its window sticker of $ 31,045 created an expectation of polish and comfort that I felt , considering the price , it failed to deliver .
Methane was found at surprisingly high levels in the Los Angeles atmosphere ( Image : David Iliff ) Los Angeles full of uncatalogued emissions ( Image : The TruthAbout / Colin / Flickr
The Los Angeles metropolitan area belches far more methane into its air than scientists had previously realised .
If other megacities are equally profligate , urban methane emissions may represent a surprisingly important source of this potent greenhouse gas .
Atmospheric researchers have long had good estimates of global methane emissions , but less is known about exactly where these emissions come from , particularly in urban areas .
Advertisement
To fill this void , a research team led by Paul Wennberg , an atmospheric chemist at Caltech in Pasadena , estimated methane emissions for the Los Angeles region , then subtracted all known sources of methane , such as livestock , landfills and sewage .
They ended up with an enormous amount of methane – about 0.14 to 0.34 megatonnes per year , or up to half of the total emissions that could not be accounted for by known sources .
‘ Put a stopper in ’
“ There ’s a sizeable amount of emissions that seem not to be catalogued right now , ” says Wennberg .
“ You ’d like to find out what ’s the source , so you can put a stopper in it . ”
If other urban areas have a similar share of uncatalogued emissions , then these unknown urban sources would account for 7 to 15 per cent of global methane emissions from human activity .
This extra methane may result from higher than expected leakage from landfills , sewage treatment plants or natural gas pipelines , or it could be natural seepage from oil wells or other geologic sources , the researchers say .
Carbon clues
A separate study now underway by Amy Townsend - Small , a biogeochemist at the University of California at Irvine , may help pinpoint the source .
She has been measuring the carbon isotope composition of methane released from different sources – for example , natural gas and other geologically old methane should be devoid of carbon - 14 , a relatively short - lived radioactive isotope .
Townsend - Small plans to use these measurements to calculate what proportion of emissions come from each source .
“ It seems likely that we ’ll be able to use isotopes to distinguish between urban sources , ” she says .

After noticing these manifestations of brilliant light and the others , or after leaving them unheeded , he goes on continuously as before with the act of noticing the bodily and mental processes as they become evident at the six sensedoors .
While thus engaged in noticing , he gets over the corruptions relating to brilliant light , rapture , tranquillity , happiness , attachment , etc. , and his knowledge remains concerned exclusively with the arising and passing away of the processes noticed .

DETROIT 
The cash - for - clunkers program turned out to be a boon for Asian automakers and the small cars they specialize in .
While American government officials hailed the monthlong program , which ended this week , as an overall stimulus to the economy , the biggest winner was Toyota , which accounted for 19 percent of all sales and had two of the top three best - selling models .
The Transportation Department said Wednesday that participants in the clunkers program bought 690,000 new vehicles .
About $ 2.9 billion of the program ’s $ 3 billion was distributed in government vouchers , which were worth $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 toward new - car purchases .
Detroit ’s three automakers  General Motors , Ford and Chrysler  accounted for 38.6 percent of the vehicles sold .
That figure is substantially less than the 45 percent combined market share that the Detroit companies posted in the first seven months of the year .
Don`t listen to them .
Listen to God .
Don`t try to appease people who just want you to conform to what they believe .
On this kind of silly stuff , don`t let people tell you that you are wrong .
It could be wrong for them , but okay for you .
Just like credit cards are bad for some but okay for others .
This stuff is trivial .
I love R&B myself and God has not made me feel at all like it is wrong for me .
God will let you know .
I used to listen to really Heavy Metal music .
When I got saved I listened to the lyrics and got sick literally .
If you truly want to follow God He is going to put you on the right path .
Follow God and The Bible .
God Bless you and give you Wisdom
Arnold Schwarzenegger was one of the first action movie stars of the 80s .
Perhaps he was one of the first action movie stars , period .
His predecessors to that title – Steve McQueen ?
Clint Eastwood ?
– had dramatic credits to their name as well as escapist fare ( Papillon , Play Misty For Me , etc ) .
But Arnold Schwarzenegger will never direct Million Dollar Baby .
Explosive action movies sit at both the beginning and end of his range .
Consequently , not many critics take Schwarzenegger seriously as an actor .
He ’s a muscle - bound lunk , they claim .
He ’s nothing but a stony face and some catchphrases .
He always plays the same role .
But what if that ’s deliberate ?
TWO STOOD AGAINST MANY
Ten thousand years before the tribes of Abraham , in the time between when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the sons of Aryas , a Cimmerian named Conan explored the world .
He robbed temples , led brigands and slew sorcerers .
He explored tombs , broke curses and rescued princesses .
By the time his destiny was fulfilled , he wore the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon his troubled brow – king by his own hand .
In his old age , after foiling a plot by rival factions to usurp his throne , King Conan received a vision from Crom , ancient and terrible god of the Aquilonians .
Crom applauded the valor with which Conan had lived .
As a reward , Crom gifted Conan with immortality .
Conan , a man as capable of melancholy as mirth , blanched with horror .
“ Should I live a thousand years while everyone I know turns to dust ? ” he cried .
“ Should I see the kingdom I have saved vanish from the Earth ?
Why would you do this to me ? ”
“ Because , ” Crom intoned , “ in your hour of need you both called for my help and cursed my name .
And so I grant you this gift and curse – that you will live until a greater warrior defeats you , or until the end of time . ”
COME ON !
KILL ME !
I ’M HERE !
KILL ME !
Aquilonia vanished beneath the sands .
So did Hyboria , Stygia , Kush , Mesopotamia , Phoenicia and Sparta .
Yet Conan endured .
For fifteen thousand years Conan wandered from one nation to another , seeking wisdom and selling his sword .
His accent became a strange mixture of every European tongue – an impenetrable Central European slur .
Finally , Conan migrated across the Atlantic to the New World .
He fought for the Colonies .
He fought for the Union .
He fought against Hitler .
And he always won .
In the Eighties , John “ Dutch ” Matrix was the last generation of a family that had served in the U.S. military for over a century .
In reality , of course , he was the same man – having fought for the same country though a series of fake identities for countless years .
But Matrix had found a cause he believed in and a renewed willingness to fight .
Central America changed all that .
Dispatched to the jungles of Valverde , Matrix and his commando unit encountered a creature beyond their nightmares – an alien predator that could turn invisible , vault dozens of feet at a time , and kill at a distance with advanced weaponry .
Matrix knew , as soon as he saw the skinned remains of the other rescue team , that he was facing something that could slaughter his entire team .
But he pressed on .
Not because he owed his friend Dillon any favors .
Not because he valued his mission .
But because he thought he ’d found a warrior that could kill him .
After the alien picked his commandos off one by one , Matrix engaged it in single combat .
He taunted the hunter , hoping to find an honorable death .
“ Come on , ” he begged .
“ Come on !
Do it !
Do it !
Come on .
Come on !
Kill me !
I ’m here !
Kill me !
I ’m here !
Kill me !
Come on !
Kill me !
I ’m here !
Come on !
Do it now !
Kill me ! ”
But the alien could n’t beat him , and Crom had made Matrix incapable of suicide .
So Matrix walked out of the jungle , taking Anna ( the guerilla ’s prisoner ) back to the States .
He abandoned the warrior lifestyle , married Anna , and settled down to something he ’d avoided for one hundred and fifty centuries – a family .
Anna died young , leaving Matrix alone in the hills of Los Angeles with his adopted daughter Jenny .
He thought he had escaped an eternity of war .
But his past exploits in Valverde caught up with him .
President Arius kidnapped his adopted daughter , forcing him back into action .
Matrix knew a life of peace was forever beyond him .
So he continued wandering .
I ’M NOT INTO POLITICS .
I ’M INTO SURVIVAL
Let ’s pass over his brief stint as a small town sheriff , or when he posed as the result of genetic engineering to topple a government conspiracy with the aid of a local hustler .
Instead , let ’s follow the man called Conan , or Matrix , to the year 2019 .
Conan / Matrix , now going as “ Ben Richards , ” topples the privatized Department of Justice when he leads a riot on the set of The Running Man .
The United States faces its greatest internal threat since the Civil War .
Food riots , already at a violent pitch , turn into massacres .
Politicians can’t show their faces without getting shot at .
And hundreds of millions of Americans watched Ben Richards shoot Killian out of a rocket - sled on live television .
The Eternal Warrior became the face of revolution .
In the face of imminent collapse , the U.S. turned to a last - ditch hope : Cyberdyne Systems .
“ Skynet is the least of what we can offer , ” the Cyberdyne lobbyist remarked in an untelevised committee hearing .
“ How about a series of robots with unshakable loyalty to the Department of Justice ?
Robots with superhuman strength , bulletproof titanium frames , and state - of - the - art targeting systems .
We can make them look and act like humans , too , blending in with law - enforcement pers – ”
“ You can make them look like humans ? ”
The Cyberdyne lobbyist cleared his throat .
“ Ah , that ’s what I ’ve been told , yes . ”
“ Can you make them look like specific humans ? ”
“ Well … with enough prep and some matching funds from DoD , I suppose we … ”
“ Ben Richards . ”
A hush fell over the committee chambers .
“ We want an army of peacekeeping robots that look like Ben Richards .
The face of the new revolution .
Let ’s put this ‘ hero ’ to bed once and for all . ”
I’LL BE BACK
Skynet became self - aware .
It launched the first round of missiles .
The nuclear holocaust came .
John Connor fought back .
When John Connor and his resistance fighters breached Skynet ’s headquarters , they saw , to their horror , the temporal displacement unit had already been completed .
Skynet had sent two Terminator units into the past – a basic T - 800 to kill Sarah Connor , and the advanced “ liquid metal ” T - 1000 to kill a young John Connor .
“ We ’ve got these two captured T - 800s , ” Sergeant Kyle Reese suggested .
“ They ’ve got an organic shell .
Let ’s send them back to stop the others . ”
“ Yes … wait , no , ” Connor said .
“ Kyle , I need you to protect Sarah . ”
“ Why do – ”
“ Trust me on this one . ”
Connor sent Kyle to protect his mother , and the first T - 800 to stop the T - 1000 .
But while he deliberated on what to do with the second captured T - 800 , something incredible happened .
“ You must send me back , too , ” the Terminator said .
“ When ? ”
“ As far back as the system will allow .
Thousands of years into the past .
Before recorded history . ”
“ What will you do there ? ”
“ I will guard the human race , ” the Terminator promised .
“ I will guide its development from chaos into civilization .
I will live on the outskirts – a warrior without a home , eternally wandering .
And maybe , when Cyberdyne comes around , I ’ll be ready for them . ”
STEEL ISN ’T STRONG .
FLESH IS STRONGER
The time portal hurled the Terminator with Ben Richards ’ face as far into the past as it could .
The shock of traveling a mere sixty years through time could stun a normal human , but the shock of traveling thousands of years would kill one .
Even the Terminator barely survived .
When it awoke , it had no memory of its past .
It had vague recollections of escaping slavery and worshiping a god who lived under a mountain .
It knew that its barbaric love of combat was tempered by a desire to protect the human race .
And it knew that it had a destiny – to become king by its own hand .
And so the Terminator , calling itself Conan once more , continued its long and lonely march through history .
Having forgot that it was a machine , it lived as a man .
He is the guardian of our species , defending us from our own base desires .
He will never stop .
He will never leave us .
He is Conan the Cimmerian , John Matrix , Ben Richards and the Terminator .
He is the Eternal Warrior .
Q . What do I do when my current Firearm Certificate expires on 31st July 2009 ?
A . Do nothing until you receive a letter from the Garda Commissioner which will extend your current firearms certificate for at least three months and a maximum of twelve months .
This extension will be free of charge .
You will be informed in the letter when you can apply for a new 3 year firearm certificate under the new legislation
Q. Will there be a limit on the number of firearms an individual may have licensed ?
A . There is no limit .
However , new minimum security standards will now be required of holders of firearm certificates in relation to the provision of secure accommodation for their firearms .
The level of security is dependent on the number of firearms certified to an individual .
Q. Who can apply for Training Certificate ?
What is the age limit ?
Can a trainee use any firearm ?
A . Any person over 14 years of age can apply for a firearms training certificate .
The training certificate does not entitle the holder to actually own a firearm and the certificate can only apply to a non-restricted firearm .
The person must always be under the supervision of a specified person over 18 years of age who holds a firearm certificate in respect of it .
The training certificate shall continue in force for 3 years unless revoked .
Q . Where can I get a new application form for a Firearms Certificate and who do I apply to ?
A . All application forms that apply to the new firearms legislation can be obtained at any Garda Station or on www.garda.ie

If the application refers to a restricted firearm , the superintendent shall forward the application to the chief superintendent of that division .
Q. How much is a new Firearms Certificate and what is its duration ?
A . All new firearms certificates will cost € 80 and will remain in force for 3 years from the date it was granted unless revoked .
The collection of fees will be outsourced to An Post and no money will now be accepted at Garda Stations for firearms certificates .
Q . Where can I get more information in relation to Firearm Licensing ?
A. The Garda Commissioner has issued Guidelines as to the practical application and operation on the firearm acts 1925 - 2009 .
These Guidelines should be read as an aid to recently enacted firearms legislation , in particular the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and the Criminal Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions Act ) 2009 .
The Guidelines are available on www.garda.ie
Großes Whuffie an Somlu fürs Finden des Textes , den man laut der Quelle frei abdrucken darf .
Na , da lasse ich mich doch nicht lange bitten und bringe den
Text dann auch komplett .
Nach dem Umbruch , das wird etwas länger …
Update 22.07 . : Jetzt gibts auch die dazugehörigen Quellen !
Hartz IV nach der Bundestagswahl 2009 : Was bringt die Bundestagswahl für Erwerbslose , Erwerbstätige ALG II - Bezieher und von Erwerbslosigkeit bedrohte Bürger ?
Am 27 September 2009 findet die Bundestagswahl statt .
Da entscheidet sich , was die nächsten 4 Jahre für uns bringen .
Wir , die Redaktion von ‚gegen - hartz.de ‘ & die Moderatoren vom Hartz IV Forum ‚hartz.info ‘ , haben uns entschlossen einen indirekten Wahlaufruf zu starten .
In Zeiten der Wirtschafts - und Finanzkrise zeichnet sich schon jetzt ab , wer für die Schulden der Banken und Konzerne zahlen soll : Nämlich diejenigen , die schon nichts mehr haben .
Noch schrecken die derzeitigen Regierungsparteien davor zurück , soziale Einschnitte vorzunehmen , auch wenn schon einige „ Vorboten “ erkennbar sind .
Jeder kennt die Geschichte vom Boten , der den Befehl zu seiner eigenen Hinrichtung überbrachte .
Wir haben den Vorteil , dass wir uns vorher darüber informieren können , was in diesem „ Schreiben “ steht , wir haben es in der Hand : Schluss mit Sozialabbau !
Schluss mit der Verletzung der Menschenrechte !
Schluss damit , dass immer die Kleinen die Zeche zahlen sollen !
Was wir wollen : informieren und aufklären ,
was wir nicht wollen : polemisieren oder abschrecken .
Deshalb haben wir uns selbst die Frage gestellt :
„ Was haben Erwerbslose , Erwerbstätige ALG II - Bezieher und von Erwerbslosigkeit bedrohte Bürger nach der Wahl von den einzelnen Parteien zu erwarten ? “
Wahlaussagen sind von allen Parteien schnell gemacht .
Wir wollen hier diese Aussagen so sachlich und objektiv wie möglich zusammenfassen und wiedergeben .
Eine komplette Analyse der Regierungsprogramme und Vorhaben der Parteien würde den Rahmen hier sprengen , deshalb haben wir uns nur auf den durch diese Frage begrenzten Bereich konzentriert und die Kernaussagen der Parteien dazu zusammen gefasst .
Rechtsextreme Parteien
Wahlprogramme rechtsextremer Parteien haben wir hier nicht berücksichtigt .
Unserer Meinung nach sind diese Parteien weder als „ Protestpartei “ noch als ernst zunehmende politische Kraft anzusehen .
Hinter vermeintlichen sozialen Aussagen steht nur der pure Konkurrenzkampf , Rassismus und Entsolidarisierung der Menschen .
Sozialabbau ist ein Problem , dass alle Menschen betrifft .
Wir machen keine ethnischen Unterschiede .
CDU / CSU
Die CDU / CSU ist der Meinung , dass der ALG II Regelsatz zu hoch ist .
Auch wenn im Wahlprogramm dazu keine konkrete Aussage getroffen wird , ist also mit einer direkten oder indirekten Regelsatzkürzung zu rechnen .
Die CDU / CSU will laut Regierungsprogramm für ALG II Empfänger „ Anreize zur Arbeit “ schaffen , mit denen ALG II Empfänger dazu motiviert werden sollen , besser bezahlte Jobs zu suchen .
Dahinter verbirgt sich nichts anderes als die von CDU / CSU schon lange geplante Reduzierung der bei ALG II Empfängern vom Erwerbseinkommen abzuziehenden Freibeträge .
Ebenfalls will CDU / CSU die Pflicht zur Gegenleistung im SGB II gesetzlich verankern .
Konkret sollen arbeitslose ALG II Empfänger per Gesetz dazu verpflichtet werden , ihre Arbeitskraft im Austausch für ihr ALG II kostenlos zur Verfügung zu stellen .
Wer sich weigert , soll kein ALG II erhalten .
Dazu sollen die sog .
1 € Job umfangreich ausgebaut und deren Beschränkungen auf den öffentlichen Sektor entfallen , so dass auch ein Einsatz von 1 € Jobbern in der Privatwirtschaft endlich legal wird .
Dahinter verbirgt sich das bereits von CDU / CSU unter dem Begriff „ Workfare “ bekannt gemachte und von Interessengemeinschaften der Wirtschaft ( INSM , IFO ) entwickelte Modell , das u.a. auch eine weitere Bindung des ALG II an solche 1 € Jobs beinhaltet : ein Teil des ALG II soll als „ Grundlohn “ gezahlt werden , den der ALG II Empfänger durch 1 € Jobs dann zur vollen Regelsatzhöhe aufstocken kann bzw .
muss , wenn er überleben will .
FDP
Die FDP will den ALG II Regelsatz um 30 % kürzen und begründet dass damit , ALG II Empfänger wären grundsätzlich zu Faul zum Arbeiten und wer mit dem kargen Regelsatz nicht auskommt , soll gemeinnützige Arbeiten ausführen und damit sein ALG II aufstocken ( siehe Workfare bei CDU / CSU ) .
Die FDP trägt im Übrigen auch die anderen Vorhaben der CDU / CSU zum Sozialabbau mit .
SPD
Laut dem Regierungsprogramm will die SPD durch mehr und besser qualifizierte Vermittler in den ARGEn Arbeitslose besser vermitteln .
Sie will außerdem einen flächendeckenden Mindestlohn und ein gebührenfreies Bildungssystem einführen , sowie soziale Bürgerrechte garantieren .
Was die SPD unter Letzterem im Einzelnen versteht , darüber hat sie sich leider nicht ausgelassen .
Der Kündigungsschutz soll erhalten bleiben , Leiharbeiter mehr Rechte und gleiche Bezahlung wie Festangestellte erhalten .
Die Ausnutzung von Praktikanten als kostenlose Arbeitskräfte soll gestoppt werden .
Das ALG II soll bedarfsgerecht bleiben und bei Bedarf erhöht werden .
Altersvorsorgevermögen soll beim ALG II generell und unabhängig von seiner Höhe geschützt werden .
Die Linke
Die Linke will einen flächendeckenden Mindestlohn sowie gleichen Lohn für gleiche Arbeit , auch bei Leiharbeitern , einführen .
Der Kündigungsschutz soll ausgebaut werden .
Die Arbeit von Praktikanten soll bezahlt werden müssen .
Die Kinderbetreuung soll gebührenfrei werden .
„ Hartz IV “ soll abgeschafft und durch eine bedarfsdeckende und sanktionsfreie Mindestsicherung ersetzen werden .
Dazu soll der Eckregelsatz beim ALG II auf bedarfsdeckende 500 € erhöht und jährlich an die Lebenshaltungskosten angepasst werden .
Der Regelsatz für Kinder und Jugendliche soll angehoben werden .
Jugendliche ALG II Empfänger sollen wieder ab 18 Jahren einen eigenen Hausstand gründen dürfen .
Kinderzuschlag und das Kindergeld sollen auf je 200 Euro erhöht und letzteres nicht auf ALG II angerechnet werden .
Der Sanktionsparagraph 31 , die Aussendienst - Schnüffelpraxis , die U25 - Regelung und die Erbenhaftung im SGB II sollen ersatzlos gestrichen werden .
Wohnkosten sollen endlich lt.
BSG - Rechtsprechung übernommen werden .
An Umzugsaufforderungen sollen , gemäß der BSG - Rechtsprechung , hohe Anforderungen geknüpft werden , werden diese nicht erfüllt , muss der Leistungsträger die Kosten ungekürzt weiter zahlen .
Das Grundrecht auf eine menschenwürdige Wohnung soll ins Grundgesetz .
Die Bedarfsgemeinschaft wird wieder abgeschafft und durch das Individualprinzip ( Vertikalmethode ) ersetzt .
Der max .
Vermögensfreibetrag soll auf 20.000 € und der Altersvorsorgefreibetrag auf 700 € pro Lebensjahr erhöht werden .
Zur Bezahlung der Steuergeschenke der aktuellen Regierung und dem Schuldenabbau sollen die Steuern auf hohe Einkommen und Erbschaften sowie Konzern - Gewinne erhöht werden .
Eine Börsenumsatzsteuer und die Vermögenssteuer soll ( wieder ) eingeführt werden .
Alle , die Einkommen erzielen , sollen in die Rentenversicherung einzahlen , ohne Ausnahme .
Das Renteneintrittsalter soll wieder auf 65 Jahre gesenkt werden .
Eine deutlich über dem Bedarfsminimum liegende Grundrente soll garantiert werden .
Alle Berufsgruppen sollen in die gesetzliche Kranken - und Pflegeversicherung einzahlen .
Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen
Die Regelsatzerhöhung für Kinder und eine eigenständige Kindergrundsicherung werden gefordert , ebenfalls eine Stärkung der Rechte von Arbeitslosen .
Wie dies im Einzelnen aussehen und verwirklicht werden soll , darüber werden keine Angaben gemacht .
Langzeitarbeitslose sollen statt ALG II unbefristete sozialversicherungspflichtige Jobs im öffentlichen Bereich bekommen .
Der Eckregelsatz soll auf 420 Euro erhöht und an die Preisentwicklung der Lebenshaltungskosten angepasst werden .
Auch hier soll eine Gegenleistung dafür vom ALG II Empfänger gefordert werden , wobei aber keine Sanktionierung der Regelleistung stattfinden soll .
Die Freibeträge vom Erwerbseinkommen sollen erhöht und die Bedarfsanteilsmethode zugunsten der Vertikalmethode abgeschafft werden .
Warum zur Wahl gehen ?
Das waren die wichtigsten Eckpunkte der Regierungsprogramme der Parteien hinsichtlich Erwerbsloser , Erwerbstätiger ALG II - Bezieher und von Erwerbslosigkeit bedrohter Bürger .
Mit diesen Informationen sollte jede/r seine Wahl treffen können , sofern diese Eckpunkte für ihn ausschlaggebend sind .
Deshalb unsere Aufforderung an alle Erwerbslose und von Erwerbslosigkeit bedrohte Bürger , sowie an alle Bürger , die den weiteren Sozialabbau , mit dem die Milliarden an Steuergeschenken finanziert werden sollen , verhindern möchten : Bitte geht zur Wahl und wählt für mehr soziale Gerechtigkeit !
Wir kennen die alltägliche Ohnmacht , nichts gegen die menschenunwürdige Politik ausrichten zu können .
Doch wenn man sich dem Schicksal ausliefert , hat man auch nichts „ gewonnen “ .
Jeder der nicht oder ungültig wählt , unterstützt direkt die Parteien , die er nicht wählen würde , weil nämlich der Partei , die er sonst gewählt hätte , seine Stimme fehlt oder die anderen Parteien dadurch im Vorteil sind .
Parteien , die etwas gegen menschenfeindliche Politik und Sozialabbau unternehmen könnten , fehlen damit eure Stimmen , um eine Gegenmacht aufzubauen und dieses verhindern zu können .
Und wenn ihr keiner Partei traut , wählt zumindest das kleinere Übel !
Aber wählt und ergebt euch nicht blind einem Schicksal , das ihr ändern könntet – anders wie der Eingangs erwähnte Bote .
( Ein Aufruf der Redaktion von ‚gegen - hartz.de‚ & die Moderatoren vom Hartz IV Forum ‚hartz.info‚ , 16.07.2009 , Abdruck frei und erwünscht )
What causes food poisoning ?
Food poisoning occurs because of several reasons .
The first is the bacteria that resides on the food that you consume .
Second , is the temperature of the area that the bacteria was living on ( make sure your food never reaches the temperature 4 degrees to 58 degrees ) .
Last , time and how much there is for the bacteria to grow .
These three elements can be the cause of a very sore tummy and know .
Now for the food poisoning remedies I tried ...
( How to treat food poisoning right below ! )
Tasty Apple Cider Vinegar
So a few minutes after the food poisoning showed its ugly head , I needed a remedy , my friend blurted this out to me .
He basically said , " Apple cider vinegar equals a happy tummy . "
I told him to run to the store and pick some up .
When I returned , I took 1 table spoon of the stuff .
Wow , the taste is so interesting -- you will see .
In my head I thought he was full of it .
However , to my surprise , in about 10 to 20 minutes I was cured .
Really ?
This stuff is amazing .
I then asked my friend , if this did n't work , what food poisoning remedies would you have used ?
He said well there is only one , activated charcoal .
Activated Charcoal
He said that he had food poisoning one night and tried this remedy .
The activated charcoal helped control all his vomiting and diarrhea almost instantly .
It apparently absorbed all the bad bacteria in his stomach .
Not really sure , but he said it worked .
There you have it , your food poisoning remedies .
If your sickness get worst or these remedies do not work for you , I really recommend that you go see a doctor -- just my little tip .
You do n't want to lose all your fluids and wither away into nothing because of bad food .
There is so much of life to see still .
Well , until next time .
A poll conducted by the liberal blog Daily Kos is making rounds on the Web and being used to persuade Montana ’s Democratic Sen .
Max Baucus , chair of the Senate Finance Committee , to support a public option when crafting health care reform legislation .
Kos hired Research 2000 to poll Montanans about their view of Baucus ’ actions on health care reform thus far .
I doubt our senior senator likes its findings :
Do you approve or disapprove of Senator Max Baucus ’ actions on health care ?
All : 42 % Approve ; 44 % Disapprove ; 14 % Not Sure
Dem : 34 % Approve ; 55 % Disapprove ; 11 % Not Sure
Rep : 49 % Approve ; 38 % Disapprove ; 13 % Not Sure
Ind : 41 % Approve ; 42 % Disapprove ; 17 % Not Sure
Do you favor or oppose creating a new public health insurance plan that anyone can purchase ?
All : 47 % Favor ; 43 % Oppose ; 10 % Not Sure
Dem : 78 % Favor ; 15 % Oppose ; 7 % Not Sure
Rep : 23 % Favor ; 66 % Oppose ; 11 % Not Sure
Ind : 48 % Favor ; 41 % Oppose ; 11 % Not Sure
Supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi have worn green ribbons in protest
After a week of unprecedented mass protests in Iran over the presidential election results , the BBC's John Simpson reflects on the parallels between the 1979 revolution and current events .
The last time I found myself in Valy Asr avenue in Tehran , shouldering my way through a shouting , sweating , half - excited , half - frightened crowd - in order to get television pictures of a fire that was sending up a column of choking black smoke into the sky - it was 1979 and I was 30 years younger .
Things have changed a bit now , of course .
Back then , people did not have mobile phones to hold up in the air and take snapshots or videos of what was going on and send them round the world .
There were not nearly so many young women among the demonstrators .
Then , people did not automatically spot who I worked for .
Now , vast numbers of people in Tehran watch BBC television news broadcasts in English and Persian , and it is hard to get through a crowd without being spotted .
Of course it is all different in one way .
These people are not protesting against an absolute monarch who has been trying to force Western - style modernisation on to a mostly conservative population .
Instead , they are furious that their ultra-conservative government should - as they see it - have insulted their intelligence by fixing the result of the presidential election in such a crude way .
Revolution parallels Tehran has seen mass demonstrations by all sides since the disputed election
Of course , even to suggest there might be any similarities at all with the revolution of 1979 enrages the government here .
But if you remember those days as well as I do , you can spot the parallels at once .
The demonstrators are very much the same mixture of educated , well - to - do north Tehraners and lower - middle class .
They are often more religious people who do not have a lot more in common with each other than a dislike of the way the government tells them how to live their lives , and a feeling that there is serious corruption and inefficiency at the top .
The big difference is that in 1979 , the tough , heavily - bearded ultra-religious characters you used to see marching in the demonstrations are now on the other side .
They are known as the basijis , the shock troops of the Islamic Revolution .
They are the ones who shot down eight demonstrators , in a crowd which was attacking their barracks near Azadi Square a few days ago .
Rife speculation President Ahmadinejad swept to power in 2005
Yet although the comparison between the things that happened in the streets then and what is happening now is very striking to someone who has seen them both , there are deeper and more important parallels .
The Shah could never decide whether he was an autocrat or a liberal ; increasingly isolated , he would swing backwards and forwards , first shooting down the protesters and imposing martial law , then offering concessions .
On Thursday , President Ahmadinejad - having earlier accused the demonstrators of acting like angry football fans - told the nation on television that he only meant the violent ones , and that his election victory belonged to everyone .
A lot of people here are speculating that the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic , the spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei , is leaving Ahmadinejad to twist in the wind , having realised that he has become so unpopular he could bring down the whole structure of Islamic power .
And then a contrary view says that it is really all about the moderate religious and political leaders trying to save the system by ditching Khamenei as well as Ahmadinejad .
Complex coalition Ayatollah Khamenei has strongly denied the election was rigged
When I go out into the streets now and see the crowds with their green ribbons and scarves and face - paint and balloons , it occurs to me that I am looking at a coalition of interests as complex as the one that marched along the same streets 30 years ago .
Then , liberal , middle - class , Westernised people joined in the marches eagerly because they thought the religious leaders under Ayatollah Khomeini would bring about a better Iran .
Now they are joining in because they think the marches in support of Mir Hossein Mousavi will bring down the Islamic Revolution .
Yet for his part Mr Mousavi hopes he can rescue the Islamic Revolution and make it better .
I remember interviewing him in the 1980s , and I cannot say he impressed me then as being particularly liberal ; rather the contrary .
But he is certainly different now .
The Tiananmen uprising is a reminder that not all student revolts succeed
So who is going to win ?
In late 1978 I would go from earnest discussions with the revolutionaries in the streets , and talk to British and American diplomats who would promise me that the Shah would get out of this one as he had got out of so much trouble in the past .
Ten weeks later he had gone and the revolutionaries had won .
But just because people seem brave and attractive and believe intensely in freedom , that is not enough to make sure they will get rid of the system they have come to hate .
It did not happen in Tiananmen Square , after all .
In other words , just because I watched a revolution happen here 30 years ago , it does not mean that very much the same sort of people marching through exactly the same streets will automatically win now .
Or if they do , it will take more than simply marching .

Is it because she is fleeing prosecution for knowingly submitting a forged document to a federal court ?
Is it because she is secretly an Israeli agent working to undermine Barack Obama ?
Is it because she fears that black men in suits and sunglasses are coming from Washington to kill her ?
I do n't know the answer , but " birther queen " Orly Taitz was indeed interviewed by MSNBC from Tel Aviv on Aug.
3 - only two days after submitting , to a federal district court in California for " authentication , " a document alleged to be Obama 's Kenyan birth certificate now pretty conclusively proven to be a forgery .
Following her gleeful release of the document on Aug .
1 , Taitz must be a little surprised by the speed at which it has been picked apart on the internet and shown to be an almost certain forgery .
I do n't know what the penalty might be if it is determined that Taitz knowingly submitted a forged document to a federal court for the sole purpose of doing political harm to the President of the United States , but it is the one good reason I can think of why she would so suddenly leave the country at what only two days ago seemed ( at least to her and her demented followers ) to be her moment of triumph .
While she may indeed fear that black Men in Black are coming to kill her , I would seriously question the theory some have suggested that she might be an Israeli agent working to undermine Obama , if only because I assume the Israelis would be smarter than to entrust such a task to such an obvious nutjob as Orly Taitz .
Taitz appears haggard and even more disturbed than usual in her MSNBC interview with David Schuster , who charged in a question at the end of the interview that Taitz refused a ride to MSNBC 's affiliate in Tel Aviv the same day because the driver appeared to be a Muslim .
A Soviet - born holder of dual US / Israeli citizenship , Taitz is on record with the Orange County Register stating that Israel should not merely defeat but " exterminate " its Arab enemies , whatever " collateral damage " may occur among innocent Arab civilians ( see also Tablet ) .
Having wondered previously why an immigrant from the former Soviet Union would be as obsessed with Obama 's birth certificate as any down - home American redneck , I 'm beginning to to think it might just be a case of Transatlantic Islamophobia .
Orly Taitz claims that she is merely a " lawyer , " with a purely " legal " interest in the details of Obama 's birth , but I obviously suspect there 's more to her Obama birth obsession than this or mere insanity .
Taitz hails from a milieu of Soviet - born Israelis among whom far - right , anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment runs much stronger by most accounts than among the general Israeli population , as numerous Israeli and international sources have observed .
Witness the rise of Avigdor Lieberman , Soviet - born leader of the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party , made up mostly of other Soviet - born Israelis with strongly anti-Arab views , many of whom live not in Israel itself but in West Bank settlements ; and many of whom really , really do n't like Barack Hussein Obama .
Could this be why she has found so much in common with Islamophobic American rednecks who think that Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya ?
Could it also be that America 's best interests are not those she has most at heart in her dogged efforts to undermine our president ?

When Microsoft rolled out the New Xbox Experience ( NXE ) dashboard update last year , one of the selling points was the prospect of more frequent incremental updates as opposed to the bi-annual blow outs they ’ve opted for in previous years .
Certainly it appears to have been easier for them to drop in more content and additional “ apps ” like 1 vs 100 , but with Fall on the horizon a significant preview of the dashboard update was released this week to more or less anyone who wanted to sign up for it .
As usual improvements vary in terms of size and significance .
Headline grabbing features announced at E3 like Twitter / Facebook integration , Games on Demand , Last .
Fm & Zune Video Marketplace are not included at present but everything else from this nicely formatted list is .
Although I initially did n’t think so , the guide is a little bit zippier and browsing the marketplace is a huge improvement when it needs to load content from the Xbox Live servers .
Ashamed as I am to admit it , the radio - controlled warthog prop for my avatar was too impossibly cute not to have , even at 320 space bucks .
The avatar marketplace has certainly garnered a mixed reaction but the scope is certainly there for games to award avatar items like this much like achievements and I would expect plenty of titles to exploit the opportunity .
Speaking of achievements , I ’m definitely a fan of the new achievement browser and accompanying summary tile showing your percentage gamerscore completion .
The ability to compare this with friends would be a logical expansion hopefully coming in a subsequent update .
For the time being though , you ’ll have to console yourselves with the stamp showing how long you ’ve been a gold member .
Living outside the US , I have n’t seen one of the controversial SilverLight video ads and could n’t test the new Netflix features but feedback from friends appears to be largely positive and allaying any fears that the dashboard would soon resemble a bad day on MySpace .
Another friend was also made up with the new video display options over - ride which helped fix a long suffering HDMI problem .
Even long term critics of the procedure for canceling a gold membership should be pleased now that you can be notified in the dash when your subscription renews or even turn off auto renewal altogether .
So in short , something for everyone .
For me however , the stand out addition is the ability to rate content on Marketplace .
Oft requested since the amount of content began to expand rapidly , it is , in theory at least , exactly what the service has been crying out for .
Whilst the NXE went some way towards making marketplace easier to navigate , content can still be buried several layers deep with no indication as to its quality .
Now , rating a piece of content can be done quickly and easy taking only a few presses of the A button .
Initial indications appear to suggest this design has encouraged a lot of people to make use of it .
One area where this should make an immediate impact is the Xbox Live Indie Games channel .
Rebranded and with a new pricing structure to differentiate it from Xbox Live Arcade , it now comprises over 360 games on the service .
Like all user - generated content , the 95 % of poor , “ my first game ” type experiences used to drown out the decent and hidden gems that are there .
This was so much of a problem , A Microsoft MVP even set up Xbox Indies to help highlight the better content .
A quick glance now at the top rated section in the new dash shows a good selection of the better games on the service .
Job done .
Xbox Live Arcade however , might be a different story .
With Microsoft enforcing a consistent quality bar for XBLA submissions , the variation in game quality is much narrower .
Certainly the present top 20 rated games are all solid efforts , I ’ve bought 9 of them for starters but with the rating scores comprising of 4.5 and a bit to 4 and a bit , we ’re getting into splitting hairs .
Much like the gamertag feedback system , if everything is rated “ good ” does it become useless ?
How much of a problem this might be remains to be seen .
I do n’t imagine many users log on to iTunes and opt to browse the entire set of music rated about 5 stars in the hope of finding something new .
Former XBLA Portfolio manager David Edery recently shed some light on the subject in a keynote at Develop ; -
Consoles are currently missing a lot of the long tail enablers , he continued .
Without an Amazon - like recommendation engine , user ratings , ease of search and more dynamic pricing functionality allowing selective discounts and bundling , the long tail on digital download services will struggle to grow .
It can be said that with the introduction of ratings and marketplace soon to be offering games at price points varying from $ 1 to full retail prices , Microsoft have addressed two of these already with better search at least , surely in the pipeline .
A better picture then , is likely to become clearer over time – well after the new update has been in the hands of everyone and bedded in for a few months but with full digital distribution of bigger and more expensive games lurking just round the corner , the evolution of Microsoft ’s virtual store front will be watched with interest .
This artists rendering made available by the TMT Observatory Corporation shows the proposed Thirty Meter Observatory .
A consortium of U.S. and Canadian universities on Tuesday , July 21 , 2009 announced it has decided to build the world 's largest telescope in Hawaii .

( AP ) -- Hawaii was chosen Tuesday as the site for the world 's biggest telescope , a device so powerful that it will allow scientists to see some 13 billion light years away and get a glimpse into the early years of the universe .
The telescope 's mirror - stretching almost 100 feet in diameter , or nearly the length of a Boeing 737's wingspan - will be so large that it should be able to gather light that will have spent 13 billion years traveling to earth .
This means astronomers looking into the telescope will be able to see images of the first stars and galaxies forming - some 400 million years after the Big Bang .
" It will sort of give us the history of the universe , " Thirty Meter Telescope Observatory Corp. spokesman Charles Blue said .
The telescope , expected to be completed by 2018 , will be located atop a dormant volcano that is popular with astronomers because its summit sits well above the clouds at 13,796 feet , offering a clear view of the sky above for 300 days a year .
Hawaii's isolated position in the middle of the Pacific Ocean also means the area is relatively free of air pollution .
Few cities on the Big Island mean there are n't a lot of man-made lights around to disrupt observations .
The other finalist candidate site for the Thirty Meter Telescope was Chile 's Cerro Armazones mountain .
Richard Ellis , astronomy professor the California Institute of Technology and a Thirty Meter Telescope board member , told reporters in a conference call that Mauna Kea is at a higher elevation , its air is drier and its average temperature fluctuates less during the course of the day - all helpful factors for those using the new telescope .
The telescope will be built by the University of California , the California Institute of Technology and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy .
The current world 's largest telescopes also are located atop Mauna Kea , but the size of their diameters are about three times smaller than the Thirty Meter Telescope .
Current telescopes also do n't routinely offer views of hundreds of planets orbiting around other stars and stars that are near the sun like the new telescope will .
But it may not hold the world 's largest title for long .
A partnership of European countries plans to build the European Extremely Large Telescope , which would have an 138 - foot mirror .
The group is considering sites in Argentina , Chile , Morocco and Spain .
It plans to decide on a location next year and be able to host its first observation in 2018 .
Another group of universities plans to finish the Giant Magellan Telescope , also around 2018 , with an 80 - foot mirror in Las Campanas , Chile .
Rolf Kudritzki , the director of Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii , said Hawaii 's northern hemisphere location will help the Thirty Meter Telescope complement other large telescopes planned for Chile in the southern hemisphere .
" I think all of the astronomers in the world can be happy because in principle now the two largest telescopes will be able to cover the whole sky .
And for research that 's an important decision , " he said .
It will also be a special boon to Hawaii astronomers , who will be allotted a share of the TMT 's observation time .
Kudritzki said his colleagues held an impromptu celebratory party Tuesday .
But the decision invited protests from some Native Hawaiian and environmental groups .
Native Hawaiian tradition holds that high altitudes are sacred and are a gateway to heaven .
In the past , only high chiefs and priests were allowed at Mauna Kea 's summit .
The mountain is home to one confirmed burial site and perhaps four more , and environmentalists oppose the telescope on the grounds it would hurt some endangered species .
" This the kind of legacy they want to leave ?
They just keep building on our mountain , " said Kealoha Pisciotta , president of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou , a group with family and religious ties to the mountain .

Rep. Charles Boustany ( R - La. ) asserted that an " interesting development " is taking place underway that , if true , could effectively remove Democratic leadership from the driver 's seat on healthcare reform legislation in the House .
" There 's an interesting development occurring behind the scenes , wherein moderate Democrats -- so - called " Blue Dog " Democrats -- and business - friendly new Democrats are actually starting to have conversations with us to build a coalition from the center outward , to actually really come up with substantive and well - founded healthcare reform , " Boustany said during an appearance on Fox News .
" And that 's the only way to do this . "
In other words , Sherrod Brown and Sheldon Whitehouse wo n't themselves join a plan that " will offer benefits that are as good as those available through private insurance plans -- or better , " as the Ohio and Rhode Island liberals put it in a recent op - ed .
And even a self - described socialist like Vermont 's Bernie Sanders , who supports a government - only system , would n't sign himself up .
Of course , they also qualify now for generous Congressional coverage .
Most Americans wo n't have the same choice .
Some will be transferred to the new entitlement as it uses its taxpayer bankroll to dominate insurance markets .
Others work for businesses that will find it easier to dump their policies and move employees to the federal rolls .
Democrats also know that the public option will try to control health spending by squeezing payments made to doctors and hospitals , and by not paying for treatments that Washington decides are too expensive , which will result in inferior care .
No doubt Mr. Dodd acceded to the Coburn amendment to blunt such objections , and in any case he 'll strip it out later in some backroom .
Judd Gregg was the only GOP Senator to oppose it , on humanitarian grounds .
As he told us in an interview , the public option " will be so bad that I do n't think anyone should be forced to join . "
When I was growing up there were always enough powerful Democrats in the South -- many of them committee chairmen -- to prevent progressive legislation , particularly when it came to race relations , despite large Democratic majorities in Congress .
Sound familiar ?
Look at this ad .
It 's being run by the DNC -- to pressure conservative Democrats who are trying to water down health care reform on behalf of special interests who donate to their campaigns and want them to work with the Republican minority to sabotage the public option .
It 's amild ad and it does n't name any names -- unlike the Blue America ads targeting corrupt Arkansas reactionary Blanche Lincoln .
But the ad is running in 15 media markets all of which target members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who are seen as likely to vote with Big Insurance instead of with working American families .
12 of the 15 markets are represented by Democrats !
Here are the markets and the targets : Savannah - John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA ) Palm Springs - Mary Bono Mack ( R - CA ) who , ironically , is being opposed by Steve Pougnet , a Democrat who seems to have an ugly Blue Dog bent and is possibly not much more reliable when it comes to representing working families than she is !
Seattle - Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) Nashville - Bart Gordon ( Blue Dog - TN ) , although this also serves notice on the slimiest of the House Democrats conspiring with the GOP , Nashville Blue Dog Jim CooperBloomington - Baron Hill ( Blue Dog-IN ) Sacramento - Jerry McNerney ( D - CA ) Salt Lake City - Jim Matheson ( Blue Dog - UT ) New Orleans - Charlie Melancon ( Blue Dog -LA ) Pittsburgh - Mike Doyle ( D - PA ) and Tim Murphy ( R - PA ) Charlotte - G.K. Butterfield ( D - NC ) Little Rock - Mike Ross ( Blue Dog - AR ) Columbus - Zach Space ( Blue Dog-OH ) Marquette - Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) Grand Rapids - Mike Rogers ( R - MI ) and Fred Upton ( R - MI ) Medford - Greg Walden ( R - OR ) Reactionary Democrats are not taking this lying down and some are joining the GOP We Hate Obama Team .
Blue Dog Zack Space has responded to the DNC TV spots by sending out an extremely misleading newsletter to his constituents claiming that he " has been targeted by right wing extremists who want to block health care reform .
The Congressman is hearing from them this week . "
We need to get him some clown makeup .
Several of the worst and most corrupt of the Blue Dogs are conspiring with the Republicans to work together to completely wreck Obama 's health care agenda .
According to yesterday 's Is it ?
Today ' sran an interesting Op - Ed on their shockingly right - wing editorial page about how one of their heroes , Oklahoma nutcase Tom Coburn managed to win narrow approval for an admendment in the Senate health committee ( 12 - 11 ) " that would require all Members and their staffs to enroll in any new government - run health plan .
" Thepoint was that even some of the best progressives on the committee voted against it .
( Among Dems only Chris Dodd , Barbara Mikulski and Ted Kennedy voted yes . )
Sounds like a lot of game playing on all sides and it also sounds like Congress should lose all health care for themselves and their families until they pass a bill for all Americans -- and that their health care should be part of that bill , just like everyone else 's .
I bet this is the first time I 'd be agreeing with Tom Coburn on anything -- except he 's just being a big ole drama queen and he does n't agree with any of this anyway ; he just wants to embarrass Democrats , not a bad idea in this case either .
Labels : health insurance , public option , Tom Coburn
The odd “ right - wing obsession ” with President Obama ’s birth certificate is spreading , said Joe Garofoli in the San Francisco Chronicle .
First , Rep. Mike Castle ( R , Del. ) had to fend off an angry “ birther ” at a town hall meeting ( watch video ) , then “ border - obsessed ” CNN host Lou Dobbs jumped on the “ birther ” train .
Thankfully , Rep. John Campbell ( R , Calif. ) got “ a beat - down ” from Hardball ’s Chris Matthews for pandering to the GOP ’s “ wacko wing . ” ( watch video )
The “ birthers ” are both “ a fringe movement and something greater , ” said Marc Ambinder in The Atlantic .
No “ important Republicans ” believe this “ extremely thoroughly debunked ” conspiracy theory ( although Rush Limbaugh is flirting with it ) , but some local lawmakers and an unknown number of GOP voters do .
As midterm elections approach , Republicans have a tough choice : alienate the “ birthers ” or reveal the “ narrowness of their base . ”
Given the “ momentum conservatives are building against ObamaCare , ” this “ blather ” about the birth certificate is foolish , said Allahpundit in Hot Air .
It also obscures an important point : “ the natural - born requirement is probably the single dumbest operative provision in the Constitution . ”
Perhaps after Obama leaves office we can finally abolish it .
Look , this is n’t “ just some conspiracy theory along the lines of 9/11 truthers and alien cover-ups , ” said Larry Amon in Examiner.com , and it is n’t going away until Obama produces his long - form birth certificate .
Personally , I ’ve let this “ very important ” issue go , but only because Obama will never release the information , so we ’ll never know .
AP : Whatever else happens on health care , it may be a good reason to phase out Social Security .
The Christian right is making a fresh push to force religion onto the school curriculum in Texas with the state 's education board about to consider recommendations that children be taught that there would be no United States if it had not been for God .
Members of a panel of experts appointed by the board to revise the state 's history curriculum , who include a Christian fundamentalist preacher who says he is fighting a war for America 's moral soul , want lessons to emphasise the part played by Christianity in the founding of the US and that religion is a civic virtue .
Opponents have decried the move as an attempt to insert religious teachings in to the classroom by stealth , similar to the Christian right 's partially successful attempt to limit the teaching of evolution in biology lessons in Texas .
One of the panel , David Barton , founder of a Christian heritage group called WallBuilders , argues that the curriculum should reflect the fact that the US Constitution was written with God in mind including that " there is a fixed moral law derived from God and nature " , that " there is a creator " and " government exists primarily to protect God- given rights to every individual " .
Barton says children should be taught that Christianity is the key to " American exceptionalism " because the structure of its democratic system is a recognition that human beings are fallible , and that religion is at the heart of being a virtuous citizen .
Another of the experts is Reverend Peter Marshall , who heads his own Christian ministry and preaches that Hurricane Katrina and defeat in the Vietnam war were God 's punishment for sexual promiscuity and tolerance of homosexuals .
Marshall recommended that children be taught about the " motivational role " of the Bible and Christianity in establishing the original colonies that later became the US .
" In light of the overwhelming historical evidence of the influence of the Christian faith in the founding of America , it is simply not up to acceptable academic standards that throughout the social studies ( curriculum standards )
I could only find one reference to the role of religion in America 's past , " Marshall wrote in his submission .
Marshall later told the Wall Street Journal that the struggle over the history curriculum is part of a wider battle .
" We 're in an all - out moral and spiritual civil war for the soul of America , and the record of American history is right at the heart of it , " he said .
Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network , which describes itself as a " counter to the religious right " , called the recommendations " troubling " .
" I do n't think anyone disputes that faith played a role in our history .
But it 's a stretch to say that it played the role described by David Barton and Peter Marshall .
They 're absurdly unqualified to be considered experts .
It 's a very deceptive and devious way to distort the curriculum in our public schools , " he said .
Quinn says that the issue is likely to lead to a heated political battle similar to the one in which the religious right tried to force creationism onto the curriculum .
While it was n't able to inject religious theories in to the classroom , the Texas school board did make changes to teaching designed to undermine lessons on evolution such as introducing views that the eye is so complex an organ it must have involved " intelligent design " .
" I think , as there was with science , there 's going to be a big political battle , " he said .
Social studies teachers will meet shortly to consider the panel 's views and make their own recommendations to the board of education which has the final say .
The board is dominated by conservatives who appointed Barton and Marshall to the panel .
Other states will be watching what happens in Texas carefully as the religious right campaign seeks new ways to insert God in to the classroom after the courts limited the extent to which creationist theories could intrude on the teaching of biology .
But religion is not kept out of schools entirely .
Many children recite the pledge of allegiance in class each morning which includes a reference to the US as " one nation under God " .
The panel made other recommendations .
Barton , a former vice - chairman of the state 's Republican party , said that Texas children should no longer be taught about democratic values but republican ones .
" We do n't pledge allegiance to the flag and the democracy for which it stands , " he said .
And while God may be in , some of those he influenced are out .
According to a draft of guidelines for the new curriculum , Washington , Lincoln and Stephen Fuller Austin , known as the Father of Texas after helping to lead it to independence from Mexico , have been removed from history lessons for younger children .
There 's no doubt that history education needs a boost in Texas .
According to test results , one - third of students think the Magna Carta was signed by the Pilgrims on the Mayflower and 40 % believe Lincoln 's 1863 emancipation proclamation was made nearly 90 years earlier at the constitutional convention .
US scientists have demonstrated a nanoconstruction approach that allows the creation of self - assembling DNA ’origami ’ folded in an array of different shapes , from bent rods to toothed gears .
The researchers say their work opens up new possibilities for engineering nanoscale tools and devices .
In nature , DNA adopts many different forms but gaining precise control over its shape in synthetic systems has proved challenging .
The new study , led by Hendrik Dietz , now at Technische Universit ?t M?nchen in Germany , shows that targeted changes to the base code can be used to finely tune the twist and curvature of a bundle of DNA helices .
Importantly , says co-author William Shih of Harvard University , the advance allows scientists to produce continuously curved structures as opposed to kinked structures .
’ I think , with a little bit of imagination , having control over curvature is actually a fundamental advance in nanofabrication capability , ’ he says .
’ Imagine if you had a world where you could only build with straight elements - you would not be able to make a wheel .
A more subtle point is that it ’s very challenging to maintain rigidity over a kink , which is often a weak point . ’
The team ’s strategy is based on DNA bundles being divided into blocks of regular lengths by crosslinks between the helices - ’ staples ’ .
The staples constrain the shape of the bundles so that systematically inserting or deleting bases causes the DNA to twist and bend .
As Shih explains , the net effect of adding or removing material is expanding or contracting , the result being that the whole structure bends to accommodate the change .
According to Paul Rothemund , who studies DNA nanostructures at the California Institute of Technology , the approach is so unexpectedly simple that it could have been worked out in a high school maths class .
’ I thought that it would be several years before we reached the mastery achieved here and that it might require some serious computer modelling , ’ he says .
’ I think it can now truly be said that we can make any shape that we desire out of DNA . ’
Shih believes that gaining precise control over the structure of DNA will lead to major steps forward in the development of custom instruments for biology and biophysics .
’ We ’re designing tools on the nanoscale and an advantage of that is you can use self - assembly and make lots of them , whereas with optical traps or atomic force microscopy you ’re basically stuck with one at a time , ’ he says .
Hao Yan , a bio - nanotechnology specialist at Arizona State University , says the level of quantitative control over twisting and bending is impressive .
He thinks
Shih ’s work could serve as a standard for creating new types of mechanical DNA and proteins .

( Update : : Here is the " official " blog post from pmichaud - which pretty much makes my rambling superfluous . )
Yesterday Patrick Michaud announced that he 'll release a special version of Rakudo called Rakudo star in Spring 2010 .
Sadly I was not present , but as minor minion I picked some things up on IRC and want to provide some backgrounds .
Alias bitched about the term " Spring " , which is a rather regional thing and of course he is right .
I 'd like to clarify that we are talking about spring on the northern hemisphere , so the release will probably be between March and June .
The idea behind this release is to provide something more shiny than our usual development releases , get good press for it , and motivate lots of people to use it .
We need that for several reasons :
A release is the only way to get good testing from a wide audience ; we learned as much from the perl - 5.10.0 release , for which many new bugs were only found after the release .
Many Perl 5 programmers are vaguely excited about Perl 6 , but wait for a " real thing " before they spend more time on it .
We want to show these people that Rakudo has become a " real thing " by now , and implements much of the language .
We want to encourage hackers to port their Perl 5 modules to Perl 6 .
For them it's a good way to learn Perl 6 , for the rest of the community it provides a valuable ecosystem .
Perl is a good example of how a great collection of libraries can greatly enhance a languages popularity - we'd like to have such a bonus for Perl 6 too .
Currently the Rakudo developers mostly focus on features that are either at the very heart of Perl 6 , or that are needed for bootstrapping .
Examples for the first category re the object model , multi dispatch and regexes / grammars .
The second category covers features like contextual variables , proto regexes and longest token matching .
I expect the focus to ( temporarily ) shift towards other features , like improved module loading / importing and maybe speedups .
But still there are areas that not yet actively pursued - the roadmap does not even mention concurrency / threads .
So we hope for volunteers to step up and champion their pet projects .
In the last few months various pieces of PR helped to bring more people into the Perl 6 community .
I hope that the Rakudo star release will boost that and will help to form a healthy Perl 6 community .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. home loans failed at a record pace in July despite ongoing federal and state programs to avoid foreclosures , which have severely strained housing and the economy .

Foreclosure activity jumped 7 percent in July from June and 32 percent from a year earlier as one in every 355 households with a loan got a foreclosure filing , RealtyTrac said on Thursday .
Filings -- including notices of default , auction and bank repossession -- have escalated with unemployment .
“ July marks the third time in the last five months where we ’ve seen a new record set for foreclosure activity , ” James J. Saccacio , Realty Trac ’s chief executive , said in a statement .
“ Despite continued efforts by the federal government and state governments to patch together a safety net for distressed homeowners , we ’re seeing significant growth in both the initial notices of default and in the bank repossessions . ”
More than 360,000 households with loans drew a foreclosure filing in July , a record dating back to January 2005 , when RealtyTrac started tracking monthly activity .
Notices of default , auction or repossession have reached nearly 2.3 million in the first seven months of the year -- with more than half a million bank repossessions , the Irvine , California - based company said .
Making timely payments keeps getting harder for borrowers who have lost their jobs or seen their wages cut .
The unemployment rate is 9.4 percent and President Barack Obama has said he expects it will hit 10 percent .
Obama ’s housing rescue is gaining traction in altering terms of loans for struggling borrowers , but slowly .
Earlier this month the U.S. Treasury Department detailed the progress of the top servicers in modifying loans and prodded them to step up efforts to stem foreclosures .
SUN BELT STILL SUFFERING
States where sales and prices surged most in the five - year housing boom early this decade remain hardest hit .
California , Florida , Arizona , Nevada accounted for almost 57 percent of total U.S. foreclosure activity in July .
Illinois had the fifth - highest total filings , spiking nearly 35 percent from June , in an example of how moratoriums often delay rather than cure an inevitable loan failure .
Default notices spiked by 86 percent in July , from artificially low levels the prior two months .
A state law enacted on April 5 gave delinquent borrowers up to 90 extra days before foreclosure started , Realty Trac said .
Michigan ’s foreclosure activity fell 39 percent in July from June , mostly due to a 66 percent drop in scheduled auctions .
A state law that took effect July 6 freezes foreclosure proceedings an extra 90 days for homeowners who commit to work on a loan modification plan .
Other states with the highest foreclosure filing totals last month included Texas , Georgia , Ohio and New Jersey .
Nevada had the highest state foreclosure rate for the 31st straight month , with one in every 56 properties getting a filing , or more than six times the national average .
Initial notices of default fell 18 percent in the month , with a new Nevada law taking effect on July 1 requiring lenders to offer mediation to homeowners facing foreclosure .
Scheduled auctions and bank repossessions each jumped more than 20 percent , however , boosting overall foreclosure activity in the state by 4 percent from June .
California , Arizona , Florida , Utah , Idaho , Georgia , Illinois , Colorado and Oregon were the other states with the highest foreclosure rates .
No one will be happier than Microsoft about Google 's vanity venture to market computers with a Google - brand OS .
It gives us the illusion of competition without seriously troubling either business , although both will obligingly huff and puff about how serious they are about this new , phoney OS war .
Since both of these giants are permanently in trouble with antitrust regulators - they 're at different stages of IBM - style thirty years legal epics - that 's just the ticket for them both .
Google 's failure to dent the Microsoft monopoly will simply notch up another failure for Linux ( whose fans are quite happy to work for The Man , as long as it's not the Man from Redmond ) - and it 'll do nothing for consumers .
How so ?
Because the computing problems we 'll have tomorrow will still be the same ones we have today .
It 's a pity , really .
There 's certainly a gap in the market for new classes of devices , somewhere between a phone and a full - blown laptop .
Pocket communicators with built - in connectivity , and a better keyboard than a phone , could be far preferable to any " converged " device on the market today , even the sainted iPhone .
Think of the old Psion 3 or 5 pocket computer on steroids , offering a lovely QWERTY keyboard for messaging , a screen that 's good enough for browsing and a photo album , and small enough to fit in a jacket pocket .
Today 's netBooks really do n't have instant - on yet , nor an optimal UI - and in a pell - mell competitive market where margins are squeezed , they 're getting bigger , heavier and more expensive .
But these are both niches , at the end of the day , and do n't need Linux underneath .
And because they 're niches , they wo n't seriously challenge Microsoft 's hegemony in the desktop market .
The idea of a desktop running a thin OS served by the cloud is fine - until you want to do image processing , or make music or videos .
You do realise there 's more to a PC than updating your Facebook profile , right ?
The extent of image processing in the cloud begins and ends with ICanHazCheeseburger .
You really can't fault its ability to move the funny caption around - and change its colour !
Get back to me when there 's real - time video scrubbing , rendering or multiple levels of Undo .
Linux is a fine OS until you get to the applications - ah , yes ... GIMP - and integration with the real - world , doing stuff your Mum needs to do .
To make Linux n00b - friendly , Google would need to impose Google UI guidelines and do the hard work itself on a range of applications , because the cloud equivalents are n't there and Linux consistently fails to pass the consumer test .
Why you 're being conned
There are some clues here that tell us Google really is n't serious about VanityOS - or whatever it decides to call it .
Android would have been a much better choice - it 's easy for OEMs and ISVs to work with , and developers love the rapid - development cycle of an interpreted language .
( Yes , I know you can compile native code that sort - of - works - the beauty is in the development environment . )
Google does n't really have a lot of faith in its own cloud computing applications if it needs to take a huge multiuser OS and strip out the innards , just as a backup .
After a couple of years of pronouncements we 'll be exactly where we are today .
Google will still be setting the price for internet advertising thanks to its " black box " psuedo- auction , and Microsoft will still be pre-installed ( or pre-warez 'd ) on almost every desktop in the world .
Large corporations approaching maturity need something to keep them busy , and when they 're not angling for pieces of state action , they 'll often reach agreements like this .
Here , they 're inventing " competition " . ®

Boey draws on styrofoam coffee cups with a sharpie pen .
Those of us who have a tendency to doodle on whatever surface is handy may not think that surprising , but the degree of skill and work that he puts into his unusual medium is outstanding .
His subjects range from cartoons to detailed stippled portraits to elaborate decorative drawings inspired by the style of Japanese prints .
The drawings use the entire circumference of the cop , connecting with themselves in a continuous band .
The flicker set of his cup drawings features them set against a mirror and also often includes multiple views of the same cup .
There is a photo sequence of his process and a video as well .
Boey ’s cups sell in galleries for $ 120 to $ 220 and are sometimes placed in plastic cases .
There is an article on him on the OC Register .
You ’ll often hear disparaging remarks about unorthodox art materials , particularly when they ’re not “ archival ” .
I dont ’ know about the Sharpie ink , but Boey ’s styrofoam “ canvas ” , as any eco - warrior will tell you , will last for a long long time .
Addendum : The Sharpie blog has an interview with Boey

As the campaign to audit the Fed is picking up momentum in the halls of Congress , reflective of the majority support by the people , several mainstream media outlets have taken their familiar positions to fulfil the role of compliant corporate lackeys they have become accustomed to .
But it is to no avail .
The campaign for liberty has clearly grown wings that spread far and wide , outflanking both the left and the right as it ascends to ever greater heights .
Whatever happens next , the enemies of liberty will be hard put to it , trying to sprinkle sleeping dust into the eyes of the giant who stretches his arms to meet the dawn .
James Pethokoukis .
In a recent attempt at discrediting Ron Paul ’s bill HR 1207 , Reuters columnist James Pethokoukis strings together ludicrous straw men arguments to convince the sheeple that everything is fine so go back to sleep .
“ Most Americans ” , Pethokoukis states , “ surely do n’t realize that the non-policy aspects of the Fed are already audited by the GAO , nor have they watched the Fed chairman ’s twice - a- year testimony , ( … ) , in front of House and Senate committees . ”
This is a hilarious argument , for the incidental testimonies provided by the Fed boss usually raise more questions than they answer ; and besides , the ones demanding a proper audit of the Fed are usually the same ones prone to dissecting its cryptic musings with their hands in their hair .
The columnist goes on to claim that both the occasional congressional grilling as well as the minutes published by the Fed provides enough transparency to satisfy critical observers : “ Bernanke ” , he states , “ is clearly not operating in the shadows from some undisclosed location . ”
You have to love the logic behind his curious little trifle , far exceeding the usual allowance of stupidity .
It is no different than claiming someone standing in a shadowy corner of a dark alley at noon is actually standing in the full light of day .
As the author moves from fallacy to fallacy , he predictably arrives at his final and most ludicrous position : “ The effect on the economy might not be beneficial , either .
Even if the result of the Fed bill is only more aggressive congressional questioning and criticism , financial markets might well fear the bank would start taking congressional wishes into account when making policy . ”
We can’t have that , now can we .
According to James Pethokoukis , it will be absolutely detrimental if the people ’s representatives in Congress would be able to influence the actions of a private central banking cartel .
Telling enough , the author then quotes none other than JPMorgan ’s house economist Michael Feroli who was heard to remark that an audit “ could immediately push up borrowing costs even if the audits are only a symbolic increasing of congressional oversight of monetary policy . ”
If the bill , God forbid , should evaporate in the senate , then a great victory will have been achieved nonetheless .
A recent Rasmussen poll has showed a staggering 75 percent agreeing with Dr. Paul ’s stance on the Federal Reserve .
Never before has the pressure been building up against the secretive banking cartel in the current measure , so even the entire effort should fail to reach its conclusion , it will not have been in vain .
With more and more light shining upon the Federal Reserve and its secretive operations , and an increasing amount of people realizing that all is not well , the push for liberty will be victorious any way you slice it .

La commission sur la contribution climat - énergie ( CCE ) , présidée par Michel Rocard , prône une facturation de la tonne de CO 2 émise à 32 euros dès 2010 , selon une information publiée mercredi 22 juillet par le quotidien Les Echos .
" En gros , il s'agit de ça " , a confirmé l'ancien premier ministre socialiste sur France Inter .
" Mais je rappelle que c'est un avis et que le gouvernement reste maître de sa décision , qu'il prendra au moment où nous ferons le projet de loi de finances pour 2010 . "
En 2030 , cette taxe atteindrait 100 euros , écrit le quotidien , qui s'est procuré la version provisoire du rapport que la commission doit remettre au gouvernement vendredi 24 juillet .
Appliquée aux carburants , cette CCE reviendrait à 7,7 centimes supplémentaires par litre de sans - plomb et 8,5 centimes pour le gazole .
Des compensations seraient instaurées " pour les ménages les plus modestes ou les secteurs les plus touchés " , mais elles devront être partielles , " le plus forfaitaire possible " et transitoires , poursuit le quotidien économique .
Des précautions qui ne suffisent pas à convaincre l'opposition .
Le PS a notamment déploré que les ménages soient " les principaux contributeurs " de la taxe .
Laurence Rossignol , la secrétaire nationale à l'environnement et au développement durable , reconnaît l'existence d'un " consensus " de principe , mais estime que " la mise en place d'un tel dispositif ne peut pas être une recette fiscale d'aubaine , consistant à compenser le manque à gagner lié à la fin de la taxe professionnelle " .
Les Verts déplorent eux aussi que les ménages soient " les premiers payeurs " .
De façon générale , les écologistes estiment que les conclusions de la commission représentent " un petit pas " mais " manquent d'ambition compte tenu de l'urgence climatique et sociale " .
De son côté , l'UFC - Que Choisir a dénoncé un " hold - up fiscal sur le mode de la vignette automobile des années 1960 - 1970 " .
Dans un communiqué , l'association de défense des consommateurs souligne qu'elle " combattra ces propositions qui , si elles étaient adoptées par le gouvernement , constitueraient le pire des scénarios pour le pouvoir d'achat des consommateurs " .
En réponse à ces premières critiques , le ministre de l'industrie , Christian Estrosi , a jugé qu'il fallait " toucher le moins possible au pouvoir d'achat et à la consommation des ménages " .
" Il faut cibler au plus juste pour ne pas mettre en difficulté l'emploi , ni notre activité économique " , a ajouté le ministre , qui était l'invité de " Questions d'info " de LCP - An , La Chaîne parlementaire Assemblée nationale .
INCERTITUDE SUR L'ÉLECTRICITÉ
Michel Rocard a souligné qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une charge destinée à améliorer le financement de l'Etat .
" On va taxer un certain nombre de comportements , principalement celui qui consiste à utiliser des énergies d'origine fossile dont le fait de les brûler produit du gaz à effet de serre , ce qui revient (...) à transformer la planète en poêle à frire " , a - t - il défendu .
La compensation pourrait prendre la forme d'une " allocation forfaitaire peut - être basée sur l'éloignement " , afin de ne pas pénaliser " les ruraux et les banlieusards qui utilisent beaucoup plus leur voiture " , a - t - il avancé .
" Il faut un signal qui change les comportements , l'objet n'est pas de martyriser les gens dans leur pouvoir d'achat " , a souligné Michel Rocard .
Selon Les Echos , cette CCE rapporterait près de 8,3 milliards d'euros l'an prochain , dont 4,3 milliards à la charge des ménages .
Michel Rocard souhaiterait , " pour marquer la visibilité du projet " , que la loi de finances établissant la CCE annonce son taux pour les cinq années à venir , écrit le quotidien .
En fin de matinée , l'ancien premier ministre a précisé à l'AFP qu'il souhaitait que l'électricité soit également couverte par la CCE .
" La table ronde n'est pas arrivée à un accord [ sur l'électricité ] et je vais prendre moi la responsabilité de dire qu'il vaut probablement mieux étendre " la CCE à ce secteur , a déclaré M. Rocard .
" La sagesse veut que la CCE permette de dissuader la consommation d'énergie excessive en général " , a - t - il insisté .
" Mais la vérité , c'est que les études ne sont pas encore suffisantes .
Il faut continuer le débat et l'approfondir sur les effets induits , du fait de faire ou ne pas faire " , reconnaît -il .
L'argument contre est que les producteurs d'électricité sont déjà soumis au système européen des quotas pour leur production d'origine fossile , explique - t - il , ce qui exclut l'électricité d'origine nucléaire ou hydraulique , non émettrice de gaz à effet de serre .
Le réseau Sortir du nucléaire avait dénoncé un peu plus tôt l'exonération de l'électricité issue de la fission de l'atome dans la CCE , ainsi que l'affirmait le journal Les Echos .

Every Wednesday , we highlight rarely - remembered but interesting games for our " Games Time Forgot " series .
As an American , I feel a little weird writing this week 's Games Time Forgot column on a game that has never made it over to the shores of the United States , but I 'd really like to take this opportunity to talk about a Japanese game called Pulseman .
Here 's the lowdown : Pulseman is a pretty well - loved platformer by those who have had the opportunity to play it .
It was made late in the life of the Mega Drive by popular developer Game Freak , and released only in Japan .
It is possibly the most beautiful game for the system , and it ain't half bad to play either .
What is this game ?
How do I know it 's forgotten if I 'm not Japanese ?
I probably do n't , but you can read more about Pulseman and why I believe it qualifies past the jump anyway .
Story :
It all begins when a scientist named Doc Yoshiyama programs a new brand of artificial intelligence he calls C - Life .
The first " person " created with this AI is a woman who is capable of thinking and feeling .
After spending so much time working on this digital woman , Yoshiyama falls in love with her and downloads himself into the computer so that they can be together .
While he is happy for a while , and even has a child with her , the decision to live in cyberspace is ultimately a bad one , as his mind becomes corrupted after spending too much time there .
He eventually returns to the real world , changes his name to Doc Waruyama , and starts wrecking the place with his robotic creations .
The half human , half C - Life son of Yoshiyama , Pulseman , is around 16 years old by the time his father begins to terrorize the human world .
Because of his heritage , he is able to freely travel through both worlds .
This makes him the only person in the world capable of stopping his father and his group of troublemakers , the Galaxy Gang .
Gameplay : Outwardly , Pulseman looks like a Mega Man clone .
But other than the ball of energy the titular hero can shoot from his hand , they are two very different characters and games .
Pulseman is quite a bit bigger and more red than Mega Man , but he is also much weaker , only being able to withstand three hits from enemies before dying .
There are health restorative items scattered across the levels , but they only restore one hit point .
The biggest difference lies with Pulseman 's dependency on electricity .
He always has a small electrical attack , but with enough stored power , the attack changes in appearance and functionality .
Electricity can be generated either by running long distances without stopping , or by performing a dash move with two taps of the directional pad .
The charged attack does not do more damage than the uncharged one , but it does travel through enemies , giving Pulseman the ability to hit many enemies with just one shot .
He also has a low kick and jump kick .
Pulseman can jump , obviously , but not very high .
This is where an electrical charge comes in handy again .
After generating some energy , a move called the Volteccer ( Volt Tackle ) can be used .
This move shoots Pulseman up into the sky diagonally .
While this can give a much needed boost to higher areas of the map , it can also be used to bounce around a level in an invincible ball of sparks .
As long as there are solid objects to reflect off of ( that are n't enemies ) , one could technically stay in the Volteccer form forever .
On top of everything else , this form allows Pulseman to travel through things like wires and bolts .
Pulseman is a platformer with all of the above moves at the player 's disposal .
The game goes back and forth from the real world to the virtual almost constantly , so that the scenery and gameplay switch up at a nice pace .
The levels span all sorts of areas , from a futuristic Japanese city to the Great Barrier Reef , the latter of which is one of a few water levels .
Speaking of water , Pulseman is able to swim , but the water greatly hinders his ability to retain electricity .
He is unable to do any of his electric attacks while underwater , and can only slap enemies for half the usual damage .
This is a very interesting weakness to have to work around at certain points throughout the game .
Why you 're probably not playing it :
If you 're American , you 're probably not playing Pulseman because it was never released in cartridge format outside of Japan .
We did have a small chance to play it legally -- the game graced the Sega Channel as an exclusive for a short while .
But this offering was probably for naught .
The majority of people ( myself included ) did not have access to the service because it was limited to very specific areas of the country .
Those who did get to play it probably forgot what it was once the Sega Channel was gone .
If you 're any other nationality , you 're probably not playing it for one of several reasons .
The first is that it was one of the last games made for the Mega Drive .
Like many of the other Games Time Forgot , Pulseman is another solid example of the theory that the closer a console is to its " death " , the less its new games sell .
The Sega Saturn was released in Japan the same year , which I can only assume caused many Japanese gamers to leave their Mega Drives and any new games for the system in the dust .
The advent of 3D gaming was an especially unfortunate time for any new 2D games , no matter how much advantage the latter games were able to take of their last - gen console .
Another reason is that , again , the game was never released outside of Japan .
Or , it was n't until about a week ago .
On July 3rd , all Wii Virtual Console shops outside of America ( and Japan , who already got the game two years ago ) saw the release of an untranslated Pulseman .
But now that it 's so widely available , does anyone know what this old game is ?
Will anyone buy it after all these years ?
Maybe the shiny graphics will attract some people , but who knows how sales will go .
If coverage of the release is any indication of how things are going , the game will not sell well at all .
Going back to the game 's relationship with America , there is currently no US release date for the game for VC .
Whether or not the game will ever make it here is unknown .
It may fall upon the shoulders of Europe ; if they see good sales , perhaps the US will also get Pulseman .
But really , does anyone even know enough to care either way ?
It 's not the best game ever ( it 's a little too much style over substance , in my opinion ) , but those who have played it will tell you that it is a pretty cool game in its own right .
But to be what it is ( a Mega Drive game that 's nearly on par with the original Sonic games ) , it 's very strange that its release to the rest of the world happened with such a small amount of fanfare , especially after being confined to Japan for over 15 years .
I actually did n't know about this VC release until after I started writing this article .
I had gone into it with the knowledge that this was a game forgotten by time , but I was having some trouble explaining exactly why because of what little I knew about the game outside of what it is and how it plays .
But then I saw mention of the VC release on Wikipedia , and the wheels started to turn .
I tried looking for more information on it , but was left pretty empty handed .
Why has n't anyone said anything about the release of this game to the rest of the world ?
Sure , Americans are still left out , but ( almost ) worldwide releases of Japanese games like this one are normally surrounded with plenty of hullaballoo .
There has n't been so much of a chirp about Pulseman , and that in itself is probably the biggest clue in to its abandoned status .
For whatever reason , Pulseman has long been kept away from the rest of the world .
It was denied the chance to become a standout title around the world and transcend time .
And today , just like the day it was released , it remains unpromoted and largely ignored .
But here at Games Time Forgot , we would like to let all of you know that the title is available for download on the European Virtual Console .
You might want to get it .
There was a time when most aspiring musicians had the same dream : to sign a deal with a major record label .
Now , with the structure of the music business shifting radically , some industry iconoclasts are sidestepping the music giants and inventing new ways for artists to make and market their music  without ever signing a traditional recording contract .
The latest effort comes from Brian Message , manager of the alternative band Radiohead , which gave away its last album , “ In Rainbows , ” on the Internet .
His venture , called Polyphonic , which was announced this month , will look to invest a few hundred thousand dollars in new and rising artists who are not signed to record deals and then help them create their own direct links to audiences over the Internet .
“ Artists are at the point where they realize going back to the old model does n’t make any sense , ” Mr. Message said .
“ There is a hunger for a new way of doing things . ”
It lives .
It lives !
After almost five centuries , a legendary , artificial monster , which has intrigued scientists and art historians for decades , cranked back into life in central France this week .
The monster in question is a friendly - looking , curly - maned , almost life - sized , mechanical lion , which can walk , and move its head and shake its tail and open its jaws .
The original was designed in 1517 by a 16th - century special effects man , who later achieved fame as a painter ( but was also musician , philosopher , engineer , architect , scientist , mathematician , anatomist , inventor , architect and botanist ) .
Leonardo da Vinci left only a rudimentary sketch of his robot lion but it has been reconstructed in full - size for the first time by a French - based , Venetian - born designer of automatons , Renato Boaretto .
Using contemporary accounts and the other mechanical sketches left by the great artist , the 66 - year - old has built a spectacular clockwork toy over 6ft long and four feet high , which can walk and wag its tail and simulate roaring movements of its head .

Leo 's lion was created to demonstrate an old man 's prowess and to flatter and amuse a French king .
Even in the technology - sated early 21st century , it is impressive .
In the early 16th century , it was the highest of hi-tech , up to 300 years ahead of its time .
The Da Vinci cat prowls again this summer – and until 31 January next year – as part of an exhibition on the many links between Leonardo and France .
The exhibition is at the beautiful Château du Clos Lucé , in Amboise , beside the River Loire , where Da Vinci passed the last three years of his life and died in 1519 .
François Saint Bris , president of the Château du Clos Lucé and Parc Leonardo da Vinci , has plans to turn the house and grounds into a cultural theme park , devoted not to just Leonardo but all the achievements and figures of the Renaissance from Shakespeare to Machiavelli .
M. Saint Bris commissioned the robot lion from Mr Boaretto as a way of explaining the range and versatility of the artist 's talents .
" Leonardo was , as well as everything else , a kind of George Lucas of the early 16th century , " M. Saint Bris said in an interview .
" His special effects were legendary . "
The Leonardo da Vinci and France exhibition at Clos Lucé has brought off another coup .
Four original Leonardo sketches , drawn at the château in the artist 's final years , have been allowed out of the Gallerie dell ' Accademia in Venice for the first time and have returned to the place where they were created .
There are also reproductions of other celebrated Da Vinci drawings from the Royal collection in Britain , including a sketch of the royal château at Amboise seen from the artist 's bedroom at Clos Lucé .
The French king François I – great rival of England 's Henry VIII – brought Leonardo to France in 1516 as court painter , philosopher and architect but also as court mécanicien or engineer .
The ageing Italian master was paid 700 gold crowns a year .
He was given the new Château du Clos Lucé as his home and instructed to " think , work and dream " .
Contemporary accounts of Leonardo's mechanical lion , or lions , are somewhat confused but he appears to have designed at least three .
In around 1509 , he created a robot lion for the triumphal entry to Milan of the previous French king , Louis XII .
This could rear on its hind legs and present lilies – the French royal symbol – but it could not walk .
The second lion , designed just before Da Vinci moved to Clos Lucé , could walk under is own power and move its head .
It was presented to François I when he visited Lyons in 1515 .
When the king stepped forward and tapped the lion with his sword , its body opened and presented him with lilies .
The second Leonardo lion may , accidentally , have changed the course of art history .
King François
I was so impressed that he invited Leonardo to come to France the following year .
The artist arrived by mule , carrying with him several paintings , including the Mona Lisa , which remains in France until this day .
The lion presented this summer is based on descriptions of a third animal , designed in 1517 when Leonardo was at Clos Lucé .
Despite the many notebooks and scraps of paper left behind by Leonardo – including plans for a mechanical knight – there is no surviving description of how the walking lion walked .
Carlo Pedretti , the eminent Leonardo scholar who has overseen the exhibition , wrote : " The irony of the whole thing is that there is not a single hint in Leonardo 's manuscripts of this ( which may be his ) greatest technological invention ...
Imagine to have a lion walk .
This is top technology ! "
The automaton - maker Boaretto has studied other Leonardo manuscripts , including the artist 's many advanced studies of how to improve the mechanism of clocks .
" My big problem was to try to get inside Leonardo 's mind and to try think as he might have thought , based on the technology which existed or that he envisaged in his sketches for other machines , " M. Boaretto said .
" Leonardo 's big problem was to give such a heavy machine – 50 or 60 kilos – enough power in one motor in a limited space to walk forward and to move its head and tail . "
The technology which M. Boaretto concluded that Leonardo used to solve this conundrum involved a complex meshing of gears , pulleys , chains , wheels , pendulums and axles .
The pendulum technology looked forward to the early 17th century and the axle – which makes the lion 's legs move – presages methods not fully developed until the late 18th and 19th centuries .
The reborn lion is wound up by a large crank , or key , in a chamber on its right side .
The Clos Lucé handyman , Fabrice Madier , is called away from his work in the grounds to turn this handle whenever visitors request to see the lion walk .
Once fully wound , the animal shuffles forward for up to ten paces , twirls its tail , rotates its head and displays its fangs : a spectacle fit for a king .

Virginia Court Strikes Down Law Against Sex by Singles
AP January 15 , 2005 Also see Virginia and Six Other States Still Classify Cohabitation as Illegal
The Virginia Ruling suggests sodomy law is unconstitutional as well , but leaves it alone .
RICHMOND : Supreme Court on Friday struck down an ancient and rarely enforced state law prohibiting sex between unmarried people .
The unanimous ruling strongly suggests that a separate anti-sodomy law also is unconstitutional , although that statute is not directly affected .
The justices based their ruling on a U.S. Supreme Court decision voiding an anti-sodomy law in Texas .
" This case directly affects only the fornication law but makes it absolutely clear how the court would rule were the sodomy law before it , " said Kent Willis , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia .
" It 's a strong message to legislators that they must repeal Virginia 's sodomy law , " he said .
" Now both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court have spoken on essentially the same issue . "
Virginia 's anti-sodomy law prohibits oral and anal sex even for married couples , but gay - rights advocates say the statute is only used to target homosexuals .
Legislators for years have rejected efforts to repeal the law .
They left it on the books again last year even after the Lawrence v. Texas decision held that such laws is unconstitutional .
" We find no relevant distinction between the circumstances in Lawrence and the circumstances in the present case , " the Virginia justices said in voiding the fornication law .
The court said , " decisions by married or unmarried persons regarding their intimate physical relationship are elements of their personal relationships that are entitled to due process protection . "
The ruling stemmed from a woman 's lawsuit seeking $ 5 million in damages from a man who infected her with herpes .
She claims the man did not inform her that he was infected before they had sex .
Richmond Circuit Judge Theodore J. Markow threw out the lawsuit , ruling that the woman was not entitled to damages because she had participated in an illegal act .
The Supreme Court reinstated the lawsuit .
" The ruling recognizes that a sin greater than fornication is not telling someone you have a sexually transmitted disease and then not practicing safe sex , " said the woman 's lawyer , Neil Kuchinsky " The rule now should be : If not asked , do tell . "
The law against fornication had been on the books since the early 1800s but was last enforced against consenting adults in 1847 , according to Paul McCourt Curley , attorney for the defendant in the lawsuit .
Curley said he sees nothing wrong with having laws on the books , even if they are not enforced , that say , " these are the ideals and morals of the state of Virginia . "
He said the ruling sends a message that virtually anything goes even adultery as long as sex is consensual .
However , the justices noted that their ruling " does not affect the commonwealth 's police powers regarding regulation of public fornication , prostitution , or other such crimes .
