Menendez Poker Bill : Details , Analysis and Reactions
The full text of Senator Robert Menendez ’s ( D - NJ ) bill that seeks to regulate online skill games ( the Internet Poker and Games of Skill Regulation , Consumer Protection , and Enforcement Act ) is now public , and the reaction from the poker community at this point has been largely positive .
The basic gist of Menendez ’s bill : the US Federal Government would establish a regulatory body for the licensing and taxation of the online skill game industry .
The system would not override current state laws that it might contradict .
The primary avenue for government revenue would be a 10 % tax on all deposits made to sites .
This revenue would be split evenly between the states and the federal government .
The primary difference between Menendez ’s bill and a similar bill that seeks to establish a national regulatory framework written by Barney Frank : Menendez ’s bill is limited in scope to cover only skill games , while Frank ’s bill looks to cover all online games , as well as sports betting .
Menendez offers the following bright line for what constitutes a skill game and what does not in his bill : “ Bets and wagers made with respect to games in which success is predominantly determined by the skill of the players and in which the bets and wagers are between the participants can and should be treated as distinct from other bets and wagers made with respect to games in which success is not predominantly determined by the skill of the players [… ] ”
Supporters are apparently hoping that the tighter focus will moot some criticism from powerful opponents of Frank ’s bill such as the NFL .
Menendez makes a nod to such concerns later in the bill : “ Longstanding Federal policy against gambling on professional , scholastic , or amateur sporting events , and all criminal laws prohibiting such gambling , should remain in full force and effect . ”
Menendez also provides a direct revenue path for State governments ( unlike Frank ) , an apparent attempt to motivate them to support the bill ( or at least to not opt - out of participation should the bill pass ) .
Which bill does a better job of beating back the UIGEA ?
Gaming legal expert I. Nelson
Rose had this to say about the two bills in an article published on Compatible Poker : “ Interestingly , Menendez does a better job than Frank , who is , after all , Chair of the House Financial Services Committee , in trying to fix up the mess caused by the UIGEA .
He would require the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( ” FinCEN ” ) to make up a list of every website that takes bets from the U.S. that is not licensed .
Anyone , including law enforcement agents , sports organizations and players can ask for this list , and get detailed information about owners and operators .
But the real kicker is that all payment processors , or at least those within reach of the U.S. federal government , will then be on notice that they cannot transmit any money to these website operators .
All of the other regulations issued under the UIGEA will be redone . ”
Despite the duplication , PPA Chairman and former Senator Alfonse D’Amato reacted positively to the bill : “ The PPA is pleased that Senator Menendez chose to introduce his bill to license and regulate Internet poker and include additional consumer protections .
His continued support for protecting the Internet freedoms of poker players specifically , and Americans generally , is greatly appreciated . ”
There ’s also an interesting bit in Menendez ’s bill that might be designed to get fuller cooperation from current online poker giants such as PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker , who no doubt have concerns that their current operations might threaten their ability to gain a license down the road : “ The Secretary of the Treasury may not deny an application for a license under subchapter V of such title , as so added , that is submitted by an applicant during the 90 - day period beginning on the date that the Secretary begins accepting applications under such subchapter because the applicant operated an Internet game - of - skill facility , in interstate or foreign commerce , in which bets or wagers were knowingly initiated , received , or otherwise made by individuals located in the United States , without a license issued to such person by the Secretary under such subchapter . ”
In english :
You ca n’t be denied a license simply because you ran a room in the past that accepted US wagers .
Other interesting bits : the legal age for participation would be 21 , and taxes on player ’s winnings would be on net winnings ( winnings minus losses ) for the year , not on a session - by - session basis .
As for unlicensed sites , the tax on deposits ( which would be the responsibility of the player ) would be a whopping 50 % .
PPA board member Rich Muny had this to say about the bill in a thread on 2+2 : “ We ’re also seeing a lot of state and federal action against us .
It ’s quite clear to me that this will not stop .
While I ’m pretty sure we ’ll always be able to play , it ’s not obvious that the status quo going forward ( i.e. , if we fail to pass any legislation ) will be any better than the status within an opt - out state .
I recommend we all continue to fully endorse , support , and fight for these bills while working for the changes we ’d like to have .
After all , that ’s the best way to get the bill we want .
We also need to keep momentum to pass the UIGEA delay bill .
If the final bill is unsupportable , poker players can at that time pull support . ”
In short : this bill has some advantages over the Barney Frank bill , but will still be a seriously uphill battle legislatively .

Article by Chris Grove .
Politics and science have become entangled on numerous occasions over the past several years .
Conservatives have grown increasingly skeptical of the scientific evidence for human - induced climate change , even as climate scientists argue that this evidence is incontrovertible .
Battles over the teaching of evolution in the public schools have continued to generate controversy .
And most scientists say they believe claims that the Bush administration suppressed some research findings by government scientists .
This issue resonates strongly with scientists , but not with the general public .
An overwhelming majority of scientists say they have heard a lot ( 55 % ) or a little ( 30 % ) about claims that the Bush administration did not allow government scientists to report findings that contradicted administration policy .
By contrast , just 10 % of the public heard a lot about the claims and 34 % heard a little ; most say they have heard nothing at all about it .
About three - quarters of scientists ( 77 % ) believe the claims about the Bush administration are true , while just 6 % say they are false .
And virtually all of the scientists who say these claims are true – 71 % of scientists overall – believe that these practices occurred more often during the Bush administration than during previous administrations .
Among the public , most of those who heard about the claims about the Bush administration and science say they are true , but this constitutes a relatively small proportion of the public overall ( 28 % ) .
And just 17 % of the public says that , compared with previous administrations , the Bush administration more often prevented government scientists from reporting research findings that conflicted with the administration ’s point of view .
Scientists and Politics
A large majority of the public ( 76 % ) and nearly all scientists ( 97 % ) say that it is appropriate for scientists to become actively involved in political debates on controversial issues such as stem cell research and nuclear power .
Among the public , substantial majorities of Democrats ( 80 % ) , independents ( 76 % ) and Republicans ( 75 % ) say it is appropriate for scientists to take an active political role on such issues .
While older Americans ( those older than 50 ) and less educated people are somewhat more likely to see scientists ’ political involvement as inappropriate , majorities in all major demographic and political groups find this appropriate .
Most Americans do not see scientists as a group as particularly liberal or conservative .
Nearly two - thirds of Americans ( 64 % ) say they think of scientists as “ neither in particular ” ; 20 % see them as politically liberal and 9 % say they are politically conservative .
In contrast , most scientists ( 56 % ) perceive the scientific community as politically liberal ; just 2 % think scientists are politically conservative .
About four - in - ten scientists ( 42 % ) concur with the majority public view that scientists , as a group , are neither in particular .
The scientists ’ belief that the scientific community is politically liberal is largely accurate .
Slightly more than half of scientists ( 52 % ) describe their own political views as liberal , including 14 % who describe themselves as very liberal .
Among the general public , 20 % describe themselves as liberal , with just 5 % calling themselves very liberal .
Most scientists identify as Democrats ( 55 % ) , while 32 % identify as independents and just 6 % say they are Republicans .
When the leanings of independents are considered , fully 81 % identify as Democrats or lean to the Democratic Party , compared with 12 % who either identify as Republicans or lean toward the GOP .
Among the public , there are far fewer self - described Democrats ( 35 % ) and far more Republicans ( 23 % ) .
Overall , 52 % of the public identifies as Democratic or leans Democratic , while 35 % identifies as Republican or leans Republican .
Majorities of scientists working in academia ( 60 % ) , for non-profits ( 55 % ) and in government ( 52 % ) call themselves Democrats , as do nearly half of those working in private industry ( 47 % ) .
Gaps in Political Values
The gap between the scientists ’ political views and the public ’s is seen across a broad spectrum of topics and issues .
A far smaller share of scientists ( 40 % ) than the public ( 57 % ) agrees with the statement “ when something is run by the government , it is usually inefficient and wasteful . ”
Scientists also are less likely than the public to say that business strikes a fair balance between profits and the public interest : Just 20 % of scientists express this view , compared with 37 % of the public .
And while 78 % of scientists say that the government has a responsibility to care for those unable to care for themselves , a smaller majority of the general public ( 63 % ) agrees .
Just 14 % of scientists agree that “ we have gone too far in pushing equal rights in this country . ”
That compares with 41 % of the public .
Just a third of scientists – but a majority of the public ( 53 % ) – agrees that “ the best way to ensure peace is through military strength . ”
( For more on the public ’s political values and belief , see “ Independents Take Center Stage in Obama Era , ” May 21 , 2009 . )
Religious Belief and Affiliation
The United States is a highly religious nation , especially by comparison with most Western industrialized democracies .
Most Americans profess a belief in God ( 83 % ) , and 82 % are affiliated with a religious tradition .
Scientists are different .
Just a third ( 33 % ) say they believe in God , while 18 % say they believe in a universal spirit or higher power and 41 % say they do n’t believe in either .
Just less than half of the scientists interviewed ( 48 % ) say they have a religious affiliation , while as many ( 48 % ) say they are not affiliated with a religious tradition .
A narrow majority of the U.S. public ( 51 % ) identifies as Protestant , including those who just call themselves “ Christian . ”
About a quarter ( 24 % ) is Roman Catholic .
The ratio of Protestant to Catholic identification is similar among scientists , though far fewer scientists are affiliated with either ( 20 % Protestant , 10 % Catholic ) .
Nearly one - in - ten scientists ( 8 % ) are Jewish .
By comparison , only about 2 % of the U.S. population is Jewish .
Among the large group of religiously unaffiliated scientists , about equal numbers describe themselves as “ nothing in particular ” ( 20 % of all scientists ) and as atheists ( 17 % ) ; 11 % say they are agnostic .
Religious belief among scientists varies somewhat by sex , age and scientific specialty .
Younger scientists are substantially more likely than their older counterparts to say they believe in God .
In addition , more chemists than those in other specialties say they believe in God .
More men ( 44 % ) than women ( 36 % ) say they believe neither in God nor a higher power ; belief in God is comparable for men and women scientists , but more women than men profess belief in a different supreme being or higher power .
Canada has come last on a WWiF scorecard of G8 countries ' efforts against climate change .
That news would once have elicited at least a slightly surprised response .
For several decades , Canada managed to present itself as the friendly giant of environmental issues .
The 1989 Protocol on CFCs , an early turning point in combating the depletion of the ozone layer , was born in Montreal , and American environmental campaigners like Al Gore are always quick to heap praise on their northern neighbour .
But these days , Canada is looking increasingly like the dirty one of G8 .
The WWF report noted that Canada is one of the few countries on the scorecard whose emissions are still rising , and that Canada 's Conservative government is n't doing enough to combat climate change .
Maybe some of Canada 's new bad - guy image on environmental issues is just a by - product of America 's new green image .
Obama 's presidency was always going to bump the US up a few places on environmental scorecards , almost just out of gratitude that America has at least promised not to so flagrantly and unapologetically deplete the world 's natural resources .
But Obama is n't why Canada is losing its green reputation .
The real reason lies in the vast Alberta oil sands .
In 2008 , Alberta 's economically recoverable reserves were placed at 173 billion barrels , meaning that only Saudi Arabia outstrips Canada on oil reserves .
But unlike Saudi Arabia , in Alberta the oil is literally in the sand .
To dig it up and refine it is a process far higher in emissions than the processing of Saudi Arabian oil , and is destroying much of Alberta 's northern Boreal forest along the way .
The response to the report in Canada has been less hand - wringing than one might expect .
Some dismiss the finding by pointing out that even other environmental organisations have problems with WWF .
Others argue that surveys like the WWF's are just penalising countries like Canada and Russia for their geographic realities – smaller countries keep their emissions down by importing oil from Canada , then criticise Canada for producing it , and so on .
On top of the recession 's effect on plans for the oil sands , defenders argue that Obama 's cap - and - trade proposals would severely impact Canadian oil production because the proposal will heavily penalise those who ship Canadian oil sand bitumen to the United States , given that refining the raw bitumen is so energy - intensive .
But Canada is n't being punished for its geographic reality .
It is finally being called out for presenting itself as environmentally friendly , while under the Conservative government green issues have been completely sidelined , if not derided .
Before becoming prime minister , Stephen Harper implied that the science of climate change was " tentative and contradictory " , called the Kyoto accord a " socialist scheme " and ranted that an " army of Canadians " was needed to defeat it .
While he has proposed " made in Canada " solutions to cutting carbon emissions , Harper 's main actions have been to cut programmes that promoted renewable energy like wind power .
Even plans for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver risk causing environmental damage to rare forests in the nearby Eagle Ridge Bluffs .
Vancouver is consistently voted one of the world 's most liveable cities , and the Canadian government intends to use the Olympics to showcase Canada 's pleasant , fresh - aired way of life .
But the price Canada is paying to maintain its " friendly giant " facade is increasingly being paid for by the environment .
The fact that Obama 's Clean Energy and Security Act will , if passed by Congress , disproportionately hurt oil companies working with Albertan oil sands may feel like American hypocrisy to Canadians who have long watched the US 's profligate environmental destruction go unchecked .
But while Harper continues to disappoint on his commitments to the environment , someone has to play the bad cop to Canada .
New devices from new Android manufacturers will , in some places , push the Android envelope .
Sometimes , they introduce incompatibilities , or change features in ways that not every developer will expect .
The Motorola Cliq is no different .
Specifically , rather than having a trackball on the face of the device , as the on - the - market HTC devices have , the Cliq has a D - pad on the slide - out keyboard .
This means developers expecting to have a pointing device in portrait mode on all Android devices will be in for a bit of a shock .
And , as with the Samsung Galaxy , the D - pad may result in a different experience from a trackball , certainly from the user ’s standpoint , and possibly from the developer ’s standpoint ( if the D - pad buttons behave differently in terms of an event stream from the trackball ) .
[ quote ]
Motorola has an Android add - on that offers support for AVDs with Cliq - style interaction .
Those who sign up for the MOTODEV site can download the add-on , and installation instructions are available separately .
Note that MOTODEV staffers have indicated that a newer version of this add - on should be published shortly , as the current edition is based on an older OS build .
There is also an article in the MOTODEV technical library that talks in general terms about dealing with screen rotation and pointing device issues .
I would encourage Android developers to not assume the existence of a pointing device if possible .
Use one if it is available , but do not assume every device has one .
It is very possible that we will see devices that only offer touchscreens , and at least for the Cliq , it offers only a touchscreen when in portrait mode .
If you do need a pointing device , say so in your manifest via the < uses - configuration > element .
Similarly , if you specifically need a trackball — either because you really need it or just are not in position to test with a D - pad — specify that in < uses - configuration > , so your application will not download to incompatible devices .
If you have questions about the Cliq , or run into Cliq - specific issues , Motorola has a set of Android - related boards on MOTODEV .
You may get faster , more targeted responses to your questions if you post those there rather than in general Android support areas .
If you would like to keep an eye on those boards , one way is to subscribe to them in your feed reader :
As we get closer to when the Cliq will be available from T - Mobile or other carriers , we will hopefully get a better idea of how developers can best get a Cliq for hands - on testing .
In the meantime , developers working on Android apps that wish to target the Cliq can apply for membership in the App Accelerator Program .
Among other things , that will get you access to a Cliq via the DeviceAnywhere remote testing service .
And , of course , I would be remiss if I failed to mention MOTODEV Studio for Android , which takes the Eclipse / ADT combination and augments it further for Android development .
It is free , so Eclipse users may wish to give it a whirl .

The “ Cash for Clunkers ” program — which offers a rebate of up to $ 4,500 for people to trade in their gas guzzlers ( the vehicle has to get below 18 MPG to qualify for the full rebate ) for new , fuel efficient vehicles — has , for the most part , been hailed as a huge success .
The U.S. auto industry has seen sales soar , and environmentalists have been happy to see people trading in their Ford Explorer for a Ford Focus .
That being said , I ’m here to tell you why the Cash for Clunkers program is a waste and is just perpetuating our current financial problems .
Before I get into why the Cash for Clunkers program is bad for the average consumer , let ’s talk about the good intentions in which the program is rooted .
Â
The heart of the Cash for Clunkers program aims to serve two causes :
Help the United States automotive industry sell more cars by incentivizing people to purchase new cars
Help the environment by having people trade in less fuel efficient vehicles for vehicles that get better fuel economy
Again , the basic idea of this is program is great .
Â
It has helped to stimulate car sales —
Ford posted its first monthly sales gain in nearly two years this past month — and it has helped to get more fuel efficient vehicles on the road .
Â
Based on the latest statistics , the average gas mileage of trade - ins has been 17 mpg , while the average newly purchased vehicle gets 25 mpg , nearly a 50 % increase .
So , as a site dedicated the fuel economy , on some levels I have to applaud the program .
That being said , overall , I have to rate this program a complete failure due to the fact it is putting more strain on the debt - burdened consumer and the deficit happy Federal government .
Â
Here ’s what I mean :
The Consumer : Basically , the Federal government is offering people a $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 rebate to buy a vehicle that likely costs anywhere from $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 .
Â
One of the reasons why so many of us are in trouble financially is because over the years we ’ve taken on too much debt .
Â
This program encourages more of the same , leaving consumers even more strapped for cash and fostering an unstable and unsustainable economy .
Â
If someone offered you 15 cents if you gave them $ 1 , would you do it ? Â I would n’t either .

Â

The Federal Government :
In case you had n’t noticed , the Federal government has a national debt pushing $ 12 trillion .
Â
Just this year alone , the government is going to run over a trillion dollar deficit .
Â
In order to finance the soon to be multi-billion dollar “ Cash for Clunkers ” program — along with every other bailout and stimulus — the Federal government has had to borrow money , pushing the country deeper into debt .
Â
While in the short term this may not pose much too of a problem , in the long term this debt points to two certain things , neither of which are good : high inflation and higher taxes .
In the short term , the Cash for Clunkers program may provide a boost to the auto industry and the economy as a whole , but in the long term I see this program failing to live up to the hype , and dragging both the average consumer and the Federal government down with it .

These candles are tested for pollutants .

Burning candles made from paraffin wax -- the most common kind used to infuse rooms with romantic ambiance , warmth , light , and fragrance -- is an unrecognized source of exposure to indoor air pollution , including the known human carcinogens , scientists reported here today .
Levels can build up in closed rooms , and be reduced by ventilation , they indicated in a study presented at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) .
In the study , R. Massoudi Ph.D. , and Amid Hamidi , his undergraduate student , said that that candles made from bee 's wax or soy , although more expensive , apparently are healthier .
They do not release potentially harmful amounts of indoor air pollutants while retaining all of the warmth , ambience and fragrance of paraffin candles ( which are made from petroleum ) .
" An occasional paraffin candle and its emissions will not likely affect you , " Hamidi said .
" But lighting many paraffin candles every day for years or lighting them frequently in an un-ventilated bathroom around a tub , for example , may cause problems . "
Besides the more serious risks , he also suggested that some people who believe they have an indoor allergy or respiratory irritation may in fact actually be reacting to air pollutants from burning candles .

I accidentally came across this piece by Thomas Hylland Eriksen , a Norwegian anthropologist , titled “ The Paranoid Phase of Globalisation . ”
It was published in openDemocracy just a little over a month after the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington D.C. , and it was interesting to note Eriksen ’s predictions at the time :
Imagine this scenario for 2002 – science fiction a short while ago , exceedingly likely now .
The world had entered the paranoid phase of globalisation .
Countries were neither at war nor not at war .
Detailed surveillance of citizens and quixotic imprisonment of individuals became commonplace .
Politicians eagerly elaborated on the imminent threat of terrorist attacks , thereby justifying ever more draconian measures .
Radical humanist networks and human rights groups were ostracised for their lack of loyalty and structural similarities to terrorist groups .
Yet everybody , including the politicians , knew in their heart of hearts that turning the citizenry into potential enemies would only aggravate the problem .
And so it did .
Terrorist attacks did not stop , nor did they escalate to all - out war .
They were just frequent enough to keep everybody constantly worried .
A plane - crash here , an epidemic there .
The fun immediately went out of travelling .
Even commuting ceased to be a drowsy and boring affair as people became increasingly wary of their fellow passengers on the tube .
Those who entered poor countries from rich countries were screened thoroughly for signs of contagious disease .
Many began to let their favourite teams down for fear of stadium attacks .
Others felt a lump in their stomach whenever they entered a crowded basement , for they knew that the armed paramilitaries in fatigues guarding them were only impotent symbols of the state .
How close did he come in his prediction ?
Was the situation better than he predicted , or worse ?
Much of the article is developed along the familiar axis of trust–risk , intersected by another axis of globalization–identity politics .
In terms of an analysis of world capitalism , geopolitics , and warfare between the national security state and non-state actors , the approach offers some pluses , and some minuses .
On the one hand , it is one that affords us a more “ intimate , ” inter- personal kind of analysis , bringing the analysis down to ground level cultural expressions .
On the other hand , it substitutes generalization from various micro-places for a more comprehensive understanding of both imperialism and the capitalist world - system .
With respect to “ identity politics ” ( and I am not sure this framework is adequate for understanding Al Qaida ) , Eriksen observes :
Many writers see identity politics in general as an anti-modern counter - reaction to the individualism and freedom embodied by globalisation , while others see it as the defence of the weak against foreign dominance , or even as a concealed strategy of modernisation .
Some emphasise the psychological dimension of identity politics , seeing it as nostalgic attempts to retain dignity and a sense of rootedness in an era of rapid change ; others focus on competition for scarce resources between groups ; some see identity politics as a strategy of exclusion and an ideology of hatred ; while yet others see it as the trueborn child of socialism , an expression of the collective strivings of the underdog .
That is a pretty good depiction of the state of debate , and he notes that none of these interpretations and judgments tells the whole story .
Nonetheless , he feels comfortable enough to provide the following scheme for understanding identity politics — a scheme that I generally agree with , especially for its relational and processual elements , and its astute recording / synthesizing of expressions of identity politics which most of us will have observed or experienced personally :
“ identity politics always entails competition over scarce resources ” ( with a somewhat amorphous , all - in - one definition of “ resources ” ) “ modernisation and globalisation actualise differences and trigger conflict ” “ similarity overrules equality ideologically ” “ images of past suffering and injustice are invoked ” “ the political symbolism and rhetoric evokes personal experiences ” “ first - comers are contrasted with invaders ” “ the actual social complexity in society is reduced to a set of simple contrasts ”
Some will note of course the degree of instrumentalism built into this scheme , not that it should be rejected as a whole or out of hand .
But primordialists do make a good point : most people take their culture for granted , and are not conscious manipulators acting on the front stage and in the public limelight .
Many attachments are felt personally and emotionally , rather than as calculated politics , built on abstract terms .
Indeed , to suggest otherwise would mean that ethnic leaders , most of all , are simply faking it , conscious of their calculated manipulations while pretending they are deep - seated , ancient , traditional … and faking can be exhausting — not too good as a long - term strategy .
It was what I think is the genius of Pierre Bourdieu ( a.k.a. the French social theorist and ethnographer who resembles Tommy Lee Jones — come on , compare this with that ) , to have worked out a synthesis and ultimate transcendence of both instrumentalism and primordialism :
The habitus comprises a set of generative schemes that produce practices and representations that are regular without reference to overt rules and that are goal directed without requiring conscious selection of goals or mastery of methods of achieving them .
What is commonly interpreted as rational interest - seeking behaviour is in fact largely habitual , an acting out of habitual constraints encoded in unexamined assumptions about what is reasonable and unreasonable ( Bourdieu 1977 : 72 — [ Outline of a Theory of Practice .
Cambridge UK : Cambridge University Press . ] )
Eriksen ends his article on a universalist , humanist , some might even say Christian theme :
The new era must move beyond the paranoid to the more fully human : discovering a “ universal ” language of recognition and respect while realising that the more fundamental emotions are compassion and love .
It is hard to disagree with love and other good things .
In fact , I would have considered ending all my articles on the same note , if my desire was to secure automatic agreement .
So I will be a “ contrarian ” instead : I think the new era / world we should move to is one where you get to leave me alone .
I am all for love , just not on command .
I am all for relationships , just not the forced encounters that one endures living in the city .
And I am all for internationalism , just not the right of anyone to shove his / her muzzle into everyone else ’s affairs .
( I may even tolerate you disagreeing with me on these ponts . )
I was having dinner with friends the other day and we started talking about word processing programs we 'd all used in office jobs .
" You know , I 've been using Word for over 20 years , " I said , and immediately felt older than dirt .
But it was true .
The first word processor I ever used was a combination of the PIE text editor and the TEXT formatter , both for CP / M , almost thirty years ago , back when computers were powered by tiny pterodactyls in cages .
From there I jumped to DOS machines and the famous WordStar , once the most popular word processor of all time .
Around 1987 I switched to Microsoft Word for DOS , version 3.0 .
I used to laugh at the WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS people , with their silly keyboard templates and inscrutable function - key combinations — I had proper menus and italic text that really looked italic !
Of course I also had slow scrolling speeds in graphics mode to view those italics , and bizarre text transitions that would happen when I deleted invisible formatting commands .
Word for Windows 1.1 was a delight , with the transition to a GUI interface , then Word for Windows 2.0 both pleased me with a bevy of new features and frustrated me because it took twice the RAM just to get up in the morning .
( Macintosh Word 6 users , I 'm sure , have no sympathies ) .
Word 95 was really just Word 6 with red squiggle spell checking and long filenames , and after that things pretty much stayed the same until Word 2007 , when Microsoft changed the entire user interface because it was getting too hard to find all the new features they kept cramming in .
Jensen Harris has a great series of posts examining the history of Word 's user interface and the reasoning for the UI rewrite .
It 's actually somewhat astonishing to learn how many features Microsoft added in each version .
All in all , I 've had a relationship with Microsoft Word for over two decades , with only a couple of brief dalliances with Ami Pro and DeScribe for OS / 2 in between ( they meant nothing to me — honest ! )
Thinking about how long I 've used Word simply makes it all the more strange to realize that I do n't need Word any more .
At all .
Ever .
It 's complicated
One of the great things about writing for the Web is that you get to contradict yourself , and both your initial statement and contradiction remain available forever for people to see and laugh at .
My standard defense is that things change , and in our current world , change is happening faster than ever .
Failing that , I fall back on the Whitman defense : " I contradict myself ?
Very well then I contradict myself .
I am large , I contain multitudes . "
For the longest time I was firmly in the camp that believed people would always want to use tools like Word because they offered so many features .
In general , people prefer software with more features .
This is an almost universal law of software : if it were n't true , software companies could never sell new versions of their products , because most people would already be satisfied with what they had .
True , people claim to pine for the " good old days " when software was less complicated , and they insist that Word 5 was the greatest version of Word ever written , but their actions at the cash register negate their words .
Word not only has tons of features , but it lets you make documents that look pretty and important .
We all want to feel pretty and important , so we 'll all just keep using Word forever , and people will just have to deal with the ugly complexities of translating Word 's complicated document format into manageable XML or other interchange formats .
I 've written about this before , but the short version is that Word 's document format will always be complicated , even if it is natively XML and completely open , simply because it has to support all the thousands of features that Word itself provides .
So why do n't I need Word any more ?
Print , out !
To figure this out , I tried to go back to basics and think about what Word was originally designed to do .
In the early days , Word 's primary purpose was to ready a document so that you could print it out .
As a student I needed to print out essays so I could hand them to my instructor .
In the office I needed to print out reports so that I could hand them to my supervisor .
The end goal was always the same : I printed out something to give to someone more important than me , who would evaluate it and , if I was lucky , give it back to me at some indeterminate time in the future .
One did n't question this ; it was just the way the world worked .
Somewhere along the way , we stopped printing things out quite so much .
Maybe it was the rise of office networking .
Maybe it was when the printer companies kept raising the price of ink to ridiculous levels .
Maybe it was when we realized we could n't print out the whole Internet .
Despite the fact that fewer things were being printed , we kept on using Word to create our documents .
The thinking went something like this : I need to write my documents in Word because I want to share them with other people , and since everyone else has Word ( sorry , WordPerfect fans ) I 'll need to use Word to make sure they can read my documents .
Of course , thinking along these lines tended to end up with more people buying Word , something that Microsoft was n't too upset about .
This led to a few people becoming very concerned about Microsoft 's stranglehold on the word processing market , and in particular on the file format that Word used .
Suddenly , it was a big deal that the Word format was a big binary blob , a sort of memory dump of whatever Word happened to be thinking about at the time .
Despite the fact that all the makers of competing word processors had managed to do a passable job of converting .doc files for years , this was suddenly seen as a horribly unfair move by Microsoft that had to change .
Even Microsoft thought the .doc format was a bad idea in an increasingly interconnected world , and started moving over to an XML - based format for Word 2003 .
The battle to establish Office XML as an ECMA and later an ISO standard , and the cries of proponents of the competing Open Office ODF XML format , became increasingly heated .
This was suddenly an Epic War of File Formats , a fight to the death between the forces of good and evil , with good and evil being defined depending on whose side you were on .
What everyone had lost track of in the heat of battle was why we were still using Word ( or OpenOffice Writer , which is — let 's face it — just a clone of Word ) to create documents that were likely never going to be printed .
Word , to this day , is still largely a digital representation of a bunch of 8 ? by 11 pieces of paper .
Pages have numbers which you must use to reference them , and every page has a header and a footer .
Word does have a display mode called " Draft " that makes it look more like an endless stream of toilet paper than separate pages , but I always switched to " Print Layout " — partly because Draft was so ugly , but mostly as a kind of unconscious reflex , a need to " know " what the printed form would look like even though I was rarely printing things out any more .
Even in Draft mode , the pages are still there , and are always the same size .
Like many conventions of society ( such as mutual gift - giving ) we keep doing things in a certain way simply out of habit , long after the original need ( a barter - based economy ) has vanished .
Think of how many people attach Word documents whenever they email a resume .
Now , consider that Outlook uses Word as the default editor for email and think about just how silly this all is .
Here 's the link to Scahill 's story .
Apparently two men have testified in federal court in VA to various wrongdoings & just generally evil behavior that really runs the gamut of violent - right - wing - nuttery .
According to the report
The two men claim that the company 's owner , Erik Prince , may have murdered or facilitated the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company .
The former employee also alleges that Prince " views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe , " and that Prince 's companies " encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life . "
Blackwater has long symbolized the wrongheadedness of the mentality that led us into Iraq .
And it really has felt as though the investigation into their dealings has dragged on forever to no end .
But if the testimony given yesterday by these two witnesses is true , then something big has to be done about Blackwater .
They are armed mercenaries who have , at times , been deployed in American streets to ' keep order ' .
And they have , apparently , murdered innocent American citizens who appeared to be getting in the way of the messianic wishes of their ego-maniacal CEO .
These allegations , and a series of other charges , are contained in sworn affidavits , given under penalty of perjury , filed late at night on August 3 in the Eastern District of Virginia as part of a seventy - page motion by lawyers for Iraqi civilians suing Blackwater for alleged war crimes and other misconduct .
Susan Burke , a private attorney working in conjunction with the Center for Constitutional Rights , is suing Blackwater in five separate civil cases filed in the Washington , DC , area .
They were recently consolidated before Judge T.S. Ellis III of the Eastern District of Virginia for pretrial motions ...
A hearing before Judge Ellis ... is scheduled for August 7 .
Various charges of weapons smuggling , use of excessive force , tampering with , destroying and covering up evidence , deployment of people ' unfit ' to serve in a war environment and the like are detailed in the article , which I recommend that everyone read , just to get a better idea of what our government has been spending our money on instead of , say , health reform , infrastructure , or combating global warming .
This ( bloodthirsty ) clown , Mr. Prince , thinks he is more than a mere human .
I hope he meets a most human end as a result of all of this .
People like this need to be stopped .
And Blackwater or Xe or whatever the fuck they 'll be calling themselves tomorrow , should be permanently banned and dissolved , never to re-appear again .
Briefed on the substance of these allegations by The Nation , Congressman Dennis Kucinich replied , " If these allegations are true , Blackwater has been a criminal enterprise defrauding taxpayers and murdering innocent civilians . "
Update : thanks for reading & reccing !
the link to the Nation was screwy for a few mins , but seems to be OK again .
Update again : the Nation link has had some issues , here is an alternate link .

Spliced video from 5 CNBC appearances from 2005 - 07 where Bernanke demonstrates that he knows absolutely nothing .
This one is so good we need it to go viral .
Please send it to your reps in Congress and to the White House .
Washington contact info for everyone and everything is here .
If we can get a million voters to see the clip , and from that group , 100,000 or so to actually email the video to someone in Washington , we might just be able to make enough noise to send B - 52 back to Princeton .
At a minimum we will make his life miserable and cause him extreme distress as this video passes through a million households and his utter lack of competence is seen by so many .
If nothing else , think of it as a few minutes of your time for karmic revenge .
Thank you !
There is no excuse or precedent for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to misunderstand , miscalculate and misrepresent the greatest debt bubble of the last 200 years so tragically .
Thousands saw it coming , but Greenspan & Bernanke were completely and utterly disconnected from reality .
Bernanke actually said that lending standards were circumspect and safe , or something to that effect , and that regulators were closely monitoring the quality of loans made by banks .
I will pause while you get off the floor from laughing .
Every time he opens his mouth in this clip , he 's not just wrong , but insufferably so .
His credibility is non-existent .
Chairman Bernanke , there is no excuse .
Admit your failure .
We the people ask for demand your resignation .
After years of losing , gun control advocates say this week ’s vote on confirming Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court will be their long - awaited win that shatters conventional wisdom and proves that the Second Amendment is no longer the unstoppable force of Washington politics .
Proponents of gun control say the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) and similar groups have overreached .
They point to a Senate vote last month blocking an effort to expand concealed - carry laws .
“ The lesson that ’s going to come out of this is you can vote against the NRA and still win , and win in gun-friendly areas , ” said Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , the nation ’s leading gun control group , which is billing this week ’s vote as a chance to defeat the NRA .
Gun rights supporters dismissed suggestions that they ’ve lost their long hold on the Capitol .
The NRA ’s spokesman dared lawmakers to test Second Amendment voters at their “ own peril . ”
Since the 2000 elections , few lawmakers have bucked gun advocacy groups , and the NRA in particular .
The powerful lobby had proved too often that it could swing elections in battleground states simply by sending its traditional election - time blaze - orange postcards telling voters how their elected officials scored on gun rights .
When an effort by Sen. John Thune , South Dakota Republican , to expand reciprocity for concealed - carry laws throughout the nation failed July 22 to overcome a filibuster in a 58 - 39 vote , gun control groups said they ’d made a dent .
This week , they expect Judge Sotomayor to be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the vocal opposition of the NRA and Gun Owners of America ( GOA ) .
The NRA said the Thune amendment vote should be cold comfort to gun control groups .
“ Only the Brady Campaign will try to spin getting 39 votes in the U.S. Senate as a resounding victory , ” said Andrew Arulanandam , the NRA ’s spokesman .
He said gun rights remain as potent an issue as ever .
Some Second Amendment supporters say that defeating Judge Sotomayor ’s nomination is not central to their mission , and that it was the wrong time to stage a fight .
The Brady Campaign counts seven NRA - backed senators who have said they would vote to confirm the judge .
“ I think the NRA at some point has gone beyond its mission , and are perhaps allowing themselves to get hijacked by those who are in the extreme , ” Sen . Mark Warner , Virginia Democrat , told the Hill newspaper .
Blogs on gun ownership also have debated the NRA ’s decision to take a stand on Judge Sotomayor , saying her confirmation is not directly related to their issue .
Gun rights groups said they realize some senators wo n’t see Judge Sotomayor ’s nomination as a firearms issue .
“ Any Supreme Court justice is an uphill battle because a lot of people put the issues on hold in their mind and they say , well , the president deserves their pick , ” said Erich Pratt , a GOA spokesman .
Still , the groups questioned Judge Sotomayor ’s judicial philosophy on guns , based on her answers during the Senate confirmation hearings , saying that alone was reason to get involved .
Mr. Pratt said some lawmakers who have had perfect ratings with the GOA will end up losing that distinction because of their Supreme Court vote .
He said GOA is considering double - weighting the vote on Judge Sotomayor .
The NRA gives out a letter grade , and it ’s unclear how the Sotomayor vote will affect the group ’s ratings - particularly if other votes occur , such as efforts to renew the 1994 weapons ban law .
The NRA and GOA point to two events this year in Congress that they say show that the gun issue still resonates with lawmakers .
Gun rights supporters won a key fight over an amendment proposed by Sen .
Tom Coburn , Oklahoma Republican , to allow guns to be carried in national parks as long as state and local laws do n’t prohibit it .
Democratic leaders scuttled their own bill to grant a voting member of the U.S. House to D.C. residents after a gun rights amendment was attached in the Senate and had enough support to pass the House .
House Democratic leaders could n’t figure out a way to strip off the amendment because the committee with jurisdiction had too many Democrats who support gun rights .
The specter of increased gun control also can scuttle legislation .
A Western Hemisphere treaty that President Obama wants the Senate to ratify is unlikely to come up for a vote because pro-gun Democrats are wary of crossing the NRA .
Clear pro-gun majorities emerged in Congress after Republicans won both chambers in 1994 , but have extended even under Democratic control .
Since the 2000 presidential election , which analysts said Democratic nominee Al Gore lost at least partly because of his support for gun control , the issue has been considered untouchable .
The Democratic Party ’s 2004 nominee , Sen. John Kerry , went so far as to stage a late - campaign duck hunting trip in Ohio to try to boost his prospects , and Democratic leaders in Congress have tamped down on talk of passing gun control measures such as a renewal of the 1994 law that banned certain semiautomatic weapons .
But Mr. Helmke of the Brady Campaign said the last two elections have been eye - openers for lawmakers wary of crossing the NRA .
He said in races in which the NRA and the Brady Campaign endorsed candidates , Brady - backed candidates won the vast majority - proving that gun rights groups can be bucked .
“ The fact that they have n’t had a major electoral victory in the last two cycles is starting to translate into less clout on the Hill , ” he said .
He said the Supreme Court ’s 2008 ruling overturning Washington ’s gun control law moved the debate into a new area , where the issue is less about fundamental constitutional principles and more about practical controls .
“ The gun issue is becoming less and less of a wedge issue , ” he said .
“ We ’re seeing more and more of a consensus in the middle ground . ”
But Mr. Arulanandam of the NRA said lawmakers should be wary of thinking their constituents no longer care about the gun issue : “ Any politician who follows Mr. Helmke ’s so - called words of wisdom does so at his own peril . ”

The CIA ’s decision to hire contractors from Blackwater USA for a covert assassination program was part of an expanding relationship in which the agency has relied on the widely criticized firm for tasks including guarding CIA lockups and loading missiles on Predator aircraft , according to current and former U.S. government officials .
The 2004 contract cemented what was then a burgeoning relationship with Blackwater , setting the stage for a series of departures by senior CIA officials who took high - level positions with the North Carolina security company .
The revolving door helped fuel a backlash against what many inside the agency and on Capitol Hill came to regard as an overuse of outside firms , many of which made millions of dollars after filling their staffs with former CIA employees .
“ I have believed for a long time that the intelligence community is over - reliant on contractors to carry out its work , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
“ This is especially a problem when contractors are used to carry out activities that are inherently governmental . ”
Advertisement
Her comment underscored how the Blackwater contract ’s disclosure has renewed questions about the sort of work the CIA has outsourced since the Sept. 11 attacks .
In recent years , the agency has also faced criticism for using contractors to interrogate prisoners .
Experts said that there may not be any legal barrier against using contractors to kill terrorism suspects or subject them to brutal interrogations .
Still , they said , there tends to be deep public discomfort with the idea of delegating certain activities -- whether issuing pardons , making arrests or pulling triggers -- to people who are not direct government employees .
“ The use of force has been traditionally thought of as inherently governmental , ” said Jeffrey Smith , former CIA general counsel .
“ The use of a contractor actually employing lethal force is clearly troublesome , but I ’m not sure it ’s necessarily illegal . ”
U.S. officials familiar with the targeted - killing program said that Blackwater ’s involvement was limited in scope and duration , and that the arrangement ended several years before CIA Director Leon E. Panetta killed the program two months ago .
Advertisement
The program was kept secret from Congress for nearly eight years before Panetta told lawmakers about it in June .
CIA officials have emphasized that the program was never operational and that it did not lead to the capture or killing of a single terrorism suspect .
“ It was never successful , so he ended it , ” CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said .
Panetta “ never suggested to Congress that anyone at the CIA misled the intelligence committees or otherwise broke the law . ”
The CIA delivered a report to Congress earlier this month after conducting an internal investigation of the program , which was launched after the Sept. 11 attacks but was canceled and restarted several times under different regimes at the agency .
Officials familiar with the report said that the agency did not have a formal contract with Blackwater in connection with the targeted - killing program .
Instead , the agency hired the company ’s founder , Erik Prince , a former Navy SEAL , and other Blackwater executives to help turn an idea for forming Al Qaeda hit squads into an operational program .
Advertisement
The effort ranged from consulting with top executives to carrying out training exercises at Blackwater ’s headquarters in North Carolina .
Company officials did not respond to requests for comment .
Blackwater was also closely associated with the CIA ’s Predator aircraft operations , one of the most successful weapons in the agency ’s arsenal against the Al Qaeda terrorist network .
Former CIA officials said that from the beginning , Blackwater provided security at the air base in Shamsi , Pakistan , where the Predator aircraft were based .
At the time , the company that manufactures the drone , General Atomics , was responsible for loading the Hellfire missiles used to target dozens of Al Qaeda leaders .
But that task was subsequently switched to Blackwater , sources said .
The agency “ has always used contractors , ” said a former CIA official familiar with the Predator operations .
“ You have to be an explosives expert , ” and the CIA has never sought to use its own personnel for the highly specialized task .
“ We did n’t care who put on the munitions as long as it was n’t CIA case officers , ” the former official said .
Advertisement
Gimigliano declined to comment on Blackwater ’s involvement with Predator , saying the CIA “ as a rule does not deny or confirm reports on contractual relationships . ”
Blackwater changed its name to Xe Services LLC to escape the notoriety that followed a series of bloody incidents in Iraq , where the firm was accused of employing excessive force while providing protection for State Department employees .
In one case , Blackwater guards were accused of opening fire in a crowded Baghdad square and killing 17 civilians .
The CIA had hired Blackwater in a similar capacity in 2002 to provide security at agency facilities in Afghanistan .
Two years later , the CIA turned to Blackwater executives for help with the assassination program largely because the company , which has hired dozens of former U.S. special - operations soldiers , was seen as having deeper expertise than the agency itself on clandestine lethal operations .
The use of contractors for the task was not considered an issue under the secret authorities that then - President George W. Bush had granted the agency .
Advertisement
“ If there ’s a covert- action finding that says , ‘ Go hunt down Osama Bin Laden ’ -- which there was -- the agency can use whatever means necessary , ” said a former senior CIA official .
Over the next several years , the ties between the CIA and Blackwater deepened as a series of CIA executives took senior roles at the company .
Among them were J. Cofer Black , former head of the CIA ’s counter - terrorism center ; Robert Richer , former No. 2 for operations ; Alvin B. “ Buzzy ” Krongard , former executive director ; and Enrique “ Ric ” Prado , military chief of the counter - terrorism center .
Former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden sought to reverse that trend by refusing to grant security clearances to contractors until at least 12 months after they had resigned from the agency .
But Hayden defended the use of contractors during a panel discussion on the issue Thursday .

“ We go to contractors because they possess certain experience or certain knowledge that we do n’t have inherently inside our workforce , ” Hayden said .
“ We generally use the best athlete available in the draft . ”

Romney Slams Bailouts That He Used to Support
Created : September 19 , 2009 12:07 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Mitt Romney at the Values Voter Summit this morning :
When government is trying to take over health care , buying car companies , bailing out banks , and giving half the White House staff the title of czar – we have every good reason to be alarmed and to speak our mind !
Romney at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February :
I know we did n’t all agree on TARP .
I believe that it was necessary to prevent a cascade of bank collapses .
For free markets to work , there has to be a currency and a functioning financial system .
To be fair , in that speech Romney said that TARP should not have been used to rescue car companies .
But the opposition to bank bailouts is new .
Opposition to TARP has been a motivating force in the Tea Party movement , a possible reason for the softening here .

Bill Moyers has been a frequent critic of the Republican Party over the years , making his critique of the Democratic Party on ' Real Time ' more exceptional .
Moyers disses Dems as ' spineless '
PBS 's Bill Moyers issued a tough critique of the Democratic Party on Friday night on HBO 's " Real Time With Bill Maher . "
Moyers , whose comments focused on the recent health care debate , said that " too many Democrats have had their spines surgically removed . "

Moyers , a White House press secretary during the Johnson administration who went on to win over 30 Emmys and countless other awards during his subsequent journalism career , has been a frequent critic of the Republican Party over the years , making his critique of the Democratic Party on " Real Time " more exceptional .
" The problem is the Democratic Party , " said Moyers .
" This is a party that has told its progressives — who are the most outspoken champions of health care reform — to sit down and shut up .
That 's what Rahm Emanuel , in effect , the chief of staff of the White House , told progressives when they stood up as a unit in Congress and said , no public insurance option , no health care reforms . "
Moyers said that , over the years , the Democratic Party " has become like the Republican party — deeply influenced by corporate money . "
" I think Rahm Emanuel , who is a clever politician , understands that the money for Obama 's reelection would come primarily from the health industry , the drug industry and Wall Street , and so he is a corporate Democrat who is destined , determined that there would be something in this legislation — if we get it — that will turn off those powerful interests . "
Moyers had some advice for President Barack Obama , as well .
" There 's a fear that Barack Obama will become the Grover Cleveland of this era , " said Moyers .
Grover Cleveland was a good man , but he became a conservative Democratic president because he did n't fight the interests .
... I would much rather see Barack Obama be Theodore Roosevelt .
Theodore Roosevelt loved to fight .
He came into office and railed against the malefactors of great wealth , and he was glad to take them on .
...
" I think if Obama fought , instead of finessed so much , he stood up and declared for what is really the right thing to do and what is really needed instead of negotiating the corners away , instead of talking about bending the curve , and talking about actuarial rates , if he were to stand up and say , ' We need this because we 're a decent country ' , I think it would change the atmosphere . "
Moyers said that conservatives have dominated the debate over health care lately .
" In the last few weeks , the right wing has been winning the debate .
How [ Obama ] lost control of the narrative , I do n't understand .
Well , yes , I do .
He did n't find the right metaphors , as you were just saying , and he did n't speak in simple powerful moral language .
He was speaking like a policy wonk to the world of Washington , not a country of people who are hurting .
...
" Here 's the party that lost and the conservative movement that was discredited over the last eight years ....
They 're setting the agenda for a Democratic Party that controls the White House , the Senate and the House .
Something 's wrong in that . "

Education " Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime . "
Increasingly , computers are expected to be useful tools in our children 's education .
But today , most children whose education involves computers are being taught to use one company 's product : Microsoft's —
Microsoft spends large sums of money on lobbyists and marketing to procure the support of educational departments .
How proprietary software attacks education
Link to the ' Education ' sin
The education of children represents a major revenue stream for Microsoft , and a strategic opportunity to embed their products into the lives of future adults .
By enticing schools to teach their students using Windows and associated software , Microsoft can also make parents feel obliged to provide the same software at home .
Where else do we see one corporation able to put their marketing and corporate branded materials in front of children as requirements in this way ?
Many US states even boast about how they are cooperating with Microsoft , either ignoring or not understanding the corrupting influence that accepting freebies from this huge corporation has on their government .
Because Microsoft 's software is proprietary , it is incompatible with education — users are simply passive consumers in their interactions with Windows , they are legally forbidden from adapting the software to solve a particular problem , or from satisfying an intellectual curiosity by examining its source code .
An education using the power of computers should be a means to freedom and empowerment , not an avenue for one corporation to instill its monopoly through indoctrination .
Free software , on the other hand , gives children a route to empowerment , by encouraging them to explore and learn .
Nowhere was the promise of an educational platform using free software more significant than the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
Launched by MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte in 2003 , OLPC was designed to lead children around the world to an advanced education using the combination of information technology and freedom .
The project aimed to produce low - cost devices ( starting with one called the XO ) so that millions of children could have access to them , and free software , so they would have the critical freedoms to explore and share their software .
Then under pressure from Microsoft , Negroponte backed the project away from its commitment to freedom and announced that the machine would also be a platform for running the nonfree Windows XP operating system .
Microsoft is not the only threat to education — Adobe and Apple are both firmly placed in education , even on Windows .
Adobe 's proprietary Flash and Shockwave players and Apple 's QuickTime and iTunes are widely used by educational software .
Microsoft is now targeting governments who are purchasing XOs , in an attempt to get them to replace the free software with Windows .
It remains to be seen to what degree Microsoft will succeed .
But with all of this pressure , Microsoft has harmed a project that has distributed more than 1 million laptops running free software , and has taken aim at the low - cost platform as a way to make poor children around the world dependent on its products .
The OLPC threatens to become another example of the way Microsoft convinces governments around the world that an education involving computers must be synonymous with an education using Windows .
In order to prevent this , it is vital that we work to raise global awareness of the harm Microsoft 's involvement does to our children 's education .
A great way to do this is by downloading Sugar and helping a child in your local area experience free software .
How does free software stand up to this ?
Freedom 1 : The freedom to study how the program works , and change it to make it do what you wish .

Why schools should exclusively use free software
Link to the ' DRM ' sin
The monomaniacal fear of big media companies is that people will share digital media with their friends , building a free public library of cultural works .
Public libraries are wonderful institutions , and in a digital age they become almost miraculous : we can now provide universal access to human knowledge and culture — or at least anything that 's been published — at little or no cost .
The amazing thing is that it 's almost automatic : once people can share freely with their friends over a global network , you get a digital public library .
P2P networks are one example of a digital library , and the web is another .
The value of these libraries to the public is historic and immeasurable .
But media companies serve shareholders , not the public , and are therefore very ready to destroy in its infancy any public resource that might interfere with their profits .
The personal computer is built from the ground up to make sharing information fast and easy , so for media companies to restrict sharing they need the full cooperation of software makers at the deepest level .
Enter Microsoft .
In order to completely prevent sharing , media companies needed Microsoft to do two things :
First , they had to make sure that any outgoing digital signal is just as locked down as the DRM 'ed music or movie file .
Otherwise you could simply play a video on your computer out to another device ( like your digital camera ) and press record .
So Windows , when playing a file with DRM , needs to constantly check to make sure any connected device is cooperating with the DRM scheme .
This anti-feature is called Protected Media Path .
Microsoft introduced it with Vista , and it continues in Windows 7 .
Second , media companies needed Microsoft to keep other programs from observing the playback process and intercepting the audio and video in unencrypted form .
After all , it is still your computer , and ( as much as media companies hate this ) you can install and run whatever applications you want .
Vista and Windows 7 close this " loophole " by monitoring all the applications currently running whenever a media file with DRM is playing .
If Vista or Windows 7 detects an unapproved application running in the background , your song or video will simply stop playing .
In practice , the encryption on most popular DRM schemes ( including DVD and Blu ray ) has been cracked , and DRM - free copies of almost any piece of film or music are available on the internet .
But users of Windows 7 and Vista still have code running on their computer — at all times — that is trying to limit their basic right to share media with each other and their power to build libraries .
These restrictions have gone beyond what many would expect .
For example , at the request of NBC , Microsoft prevented Windows Media Center users from recording television shows that NBC would rather you did n't , even though this kind of recording is an included feature of Windows Media Center .
They claimed that they were just following FCC regulations , though the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC has no authority to make such regulations .
Microsoft even adds DRM in contexts where media companies have largely given up on it .
This year , after every major online music store went DRM - free , Microsoft launched a DRM - encumbered music store for mobile phones — this music service has one particularly charming limitation : many people switch cellphones every 6 months to a year , but there is no way to transfer songs from one phone to the next .
If you switch phones every 6 months , then you lose your music every six months .
But more importantly , this is a level of DRM that music companies are no longer demanding , indicating that Microsoft has its own aim in promoting DRM : lock - in .
Because DRM creates artificial incompatibility , it is the perfect tool for tying users of a service to a particular product .
When people buy music from a Microsoft service , they cannot use any other music players ( like the iPod , for example ) .
Even when Microsoft launched its own " Zune " music player , the Zune did not play tracks with Microsoft " Plays for Sure " DRM sold by other music services ( including the MTV URGE Music Service built in to Windows Media Player 11 ) .
Pressure from big media companies is not the only reason Microsoft pushes DRM ; lock - in is central to Microsoft 's business strategy and DRM is a great way to pursue it .
Microsoft is not the only company guilty of this .
Apple , via its iTunes software , and its Macintosh , iPod , iPhone and Apple TV devices also imposes DRM on users .
Adobe and Sony also impose DRM on users .
But Microsoft is a particularly aggressive user of DRM , and the integration of DRM at the deepest levels of Windows 7 is a key reason not to buy it .
Free software , by its very nature , does not support DRM — if DRM were added to free software , the users and developers would work around it and remove it .

Security " The security of your computer and network depends on two things : what you do to secure your computer and network , and what everyone else does to secure their computers and networks .
It 's not enough for you to maintain a secure network .
If other people do n't maintain their security , we 're all more vulnerable to attack .
When many unsecure computers are connected to the Internet , worms spread faster and more extensively , distributed denial - of - service attacks are easier to launch , and spammers have more platforms from which to send e-mail .
The more unsecure the average computer on the Internet is , the more unsecure your computer is . " --
Bruce Schneier Proprietary software is inherently less - secure than free software
Link to the ' Security ' sin But how do you know your computer is secure ?
If you 're using proprietary software , you do n't !
With free software , even if you do n't have the skills to evaluate the software , you can be certain that someone else can .
Windows has a long history of security vulnerabilities , enabling the spread of viruses and allowing remote users to take over people 's computers for use in spam - sending botnets .
Because the software is secret , all users are dependent on Microsoft to fix these problems -- but Microsoft has its own security interests at heart , not those of its users .
In 2005 , a vulnerability was discovered that affects all versions of Windows from Windows 3.0 , released in 1990 until Windows Server 2003 R2 from December 2005 , with XP and later versions most severely affected .
The problem , which affects the Windows Metafile image format , a format commonly used for clip - art and other vector images .
Files containing specially crafted ' Escape codes ' allow for arbitrary user - defined function code to be run when displaying the image files .
Security researcher , Steve Gibson , believes the flaw may be intentional , too .
The situations where such files are viewed is wide : Viewing a website in Internet Explorer .
Previewing an image on your desktop or using Windows Explorer .
Previewing an infected email in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express .
Microsoft even introduced a new class of malware , the macro virus -- allowing seemingly innocuous spreadsheets and word processing documents to contain malicious programming code in Microsoft Office .
Part of the issue of Windows security comes from the fact that that by default , administrator accounts are used and expected by many applications -- these adminstrator accounts also allow malware to attack the operating system .
In free software this would be treated as both a technical issue and a social problem -- if software needs to do things as an administrator , it needs a good reason to do so , and if it prevents users from doing the job without risking their privacy and security , it is anti-social .
Microsoft 's monopoly Microsoft has been found guilty of monopolistic behavior all over the world .
With Windows Vista , Microsoft worked with PC manufacturers to significantly increase the hardware specifications for the standard user - experience , causing people to require new computers to run the updated OS .
Microsoft 's monopoly affects your freedom
Link to the ' Monopoly ' sin Early versions of Windows 3.1 , relying on an underlying version of the DOS operating system would throw an error if non-Microsoft DOS , such as Digital Research 's DR - DOS , were detected .
At one point , Microsoft CEO Bill Gates , in an internal memo said " You never sent me a response on the question of what things an app would do that would make it run with MS - DOS and not run with DR - DOS .
Is there [ sic ] feature they have that might get in our way ? " with Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg later sent another memo , stating : " What the [ user ] is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable , and when he has bugs , suspect that the problem is DR - DOS and then go out to buy MS - DOS . "
Microsoft recently tried to sell a bunch of patents which would threaten GNU / Linux to patent - trolls , but the patents were eventually purchased by the Open Innovation Network , a group with patents to protect free software .
In recent months , we 've seen Amazon.co.uk is starting to make Windows refunds quick and easy for GNU / Linux users buying netbook computers .
Whether this will become a growing trend , who knows ?
Worse , most PC manufacturers still do not offer you the opportunity to buy a machine without Windows .
“ I 'm sorry , Mr. Christ .
You 're only licensed for five loaves of bread and two fish . ”
Traditionally , building your own machine was a way to get around the Windows tax .
Microsoft has managed to hurt this , too .
Sites such as NewEgg have many of their best deals tied to a purchase of an OEM copy of Windows , penalizing those who actively seek to avoid Microsoft and other proprietary software companies in the name of freedom .
The monopoly of Windows is n't just limited to the direct influence of Microsoft 's products : many computer manufacturers only ship machines with Windows , because of bundling deals with other software companies , loading up the machine with a variety of proprietary software , including trial offers for Internet providers and other junkware .
Free software does n't have this problem :
There can not be a monopoly on free software , because everybody has the source code and everybody can change the software and distribute modified versions .
While some major PC manufacturers are flirting with the idea of selling machines running GNU / Linux , all major PC manufacturers are still heavily advocating the use of proprietary software , by virtue of their relationship with Microsoft .

Microsoft opposes standards ...
Standards are important .
With standards , users of various computing platforms can share information .
It also removes users from the barrier of vendor lock - in .
This is most prevalent in the area of Office documents , where entire governments , at both a state and national level , have made decisions based on the future proofing of their information .
Microsoft 's attacks against OpenDocument
Link to the ' Standards ' sin Microsoft is attempting to block an established , free and open format by heavily pushing one they have much more control over , and they 're using all their lobbying power to try and fast track it through the standards process , destroying the reputations of the very standards bodies they seek approval from .
Microsoft challenges the existing OpenDocument standards for Office documents with its own Office OpenXML format , which specifically implements Microsoft Office , rather than a more general standard .
Unlike OpenDocument , which is well - supported and cross-platform , Microsoft 's format is only supported by proprietary software from one vendor , and because it has been designed to implement every bug , glitch and historical feature from Microsoft 's Office software , the specification to implement OOXML is over 6000 pages long , making it much harder for other software to implement the format .
Office documents are not the only area where Microsoft has railed against standards .
Microsoft has abused its monopoly position on the internet , by making its Internet Explorer browser support only a subset of the published web standards , whilst submitting users to an inferior experience when an alternative browser was used .
In Europe , Microsoft has been forced to offer a ' ballot screen ' of alternative web browsers to the user upon installation of Windows 7 to force Microsoft 's browser monopoly to end .
With free formats , it 's important to ensure you are using free software as well .
Free formats cannot excuse the damage done by proprietary software .
Microsoft 's lock - in strategy " Embrace , extend and extinguish " -- that 's how Microsoft described its strategy for locking its users into proprietary extensions to standards .
Microsoft breeds a dependency on their secret software
Link to the ' Lock - in ' sin Microsoft regularly attempts to force upgrades on its customers , by removing support for older versions of Windows and Office , whilst changing the file formats used by its desktop applications , leaving many businesses in a position where they are forced to upgrade to continue to use the software and document formats they 've invested time in .
By removing support from operating systems and other software , such as Microsoft Office , Microsoft leaves companies with no choice but to upgrade to later versions of its software .
The later versions of the software have file formats which differ from the previous versions , forcing companies who exchange these documents to also upgrade .
Additionally , some applications refuse to run on older versions of Microsoft Windows , forcing complete system upgrades for what is essentially a document exchange format .
This behavior is not limited to Microsoft , but also to proprietary software companies producing products for Windows .
Adobe regularly updates its software to patch flaws used to bypass restrictive measures in its PDF readers , and Apple used its Software Update application on Windows to coerce users of iTunes to install the Safari web - browser .
How free software defeats this problem : Everybody who uses the software has access to the source code , this creates three distinct options for providing support for the software beyond any support that may be offered by the developers of the software :
Firstly , a subset of users of the software may decide to continue supporting the product with updates and bug fixes themselves -- a group called Fedora Legacy did this for Red Hat 7.3 and Red Hat 9 , for several years after official updates ceased .
Secondly , a new project may decide to continue the development of the software by itself , offering users an alternative upgrade option in the form of a new release or distribution of the software .
Finally , the user can hire an independent software developer , or team of developers to continue to improve and maintain the software .
Privacy and Microsoft
Who should your computer take its orders from ?
Most people think their computers should obey them , not obey someone else .
Yet , with a plan they call " trusted computing " and software they call Windows Genuine Advantage , Microsoft and others are planning to make your next computer obey them instead of you , and this has serious consequences for your privacy .
Microsoft's Genuine Disadvantage
Net Applications , a great resource for watching market share trends , recently changed the way it weighs the data it gathers for browsers .
We waited a little bit until things settled down before posting our next browser share roundup .
Despite the slight changes , the main browser usage trend is unchanged : though its lead remains large , Internet Explorer is still losing ground to all other browsers .
Firefox is steadily gaining , Safari remains in a nonthreatening third place , Chrome is happily carving out a small niche for itself , and poor Opera can't seem to budge from fifth place .
In August , all browsers except for IE and Safari showed positive growth .
Between August and July , Internet Explorer dropped a significant 0.71 percentage points ( from 67.68 percent to 66.97 percent ) and Firefox moved up a sizeable 0.51 percentage points ( from 22.47 percent to 22.98 percent ) .
Safari remained steady at 4.07 percent while Chrome once again moved further away from Opera : it gained a worthy 0.25 percentage points ( from 2.59 percent to 2.84 percent ) .
Opera budged 0.07 percentage points from 1.97 percent to 2.04 percent .
Although IE 's decline seems to be unceasing , the real shame is that the old versions still dominate ( we can only hope that when Windows 7 becomes generally available next month this will start to change since the OS sports IE8 out - of - the - box ) :
Internet Explorer 6.0 : 25.25 percent
: 25.25 percent Internet Explorer 7.0 : 21.10 percent
: 21.10 percent Internet Explorer 8.0 : 15.10 percent
: 15.10 percent Firefox 3.0 : 12.48 percent
: 12.48 percent Firefox 3.5 : 8.88 percent
: 8.88 percent Safari 4.0 : 2.55 percent
: 2.55 percent Chrome 2.0 : 2.50 percent
: 2.50 percent Internet Explorer 8.0 - Compatibility Mode : 2.46 percent
: 2.46 percent Opera 9.x : 1.76 percent
: 1.76 percent Firefox 2.0 : 1.37 percent
Data source : Net Applications
You can see the market share pie for August 2009 , according to Net Applications , at the top of this post .
The graph just above shows how things at Ars are very different : Firefox continues to dominate , but the default browsers for Windows and Mac OS X still show their strength .
Chrome 's lead over Opera is much more significant at Ars. With Safari 4's release , the browser has managed to finally surpass Internet Explorer on our site , despite having one sixteenth of IE 's share worldwide .
Oh Installer , Installer , we had so much fun together , you and I .

The short story is that Cydia — the other non-official iPhone app installer — won the battle against Installer .
Installer was the first pretty application installer to appear for the iPhone , but Cydia became more popular over the last few months .
Ripdev — which was involved in the project since version 3 — says that the Installer repositories will be available until July 1st , 2009 .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
But fear not , my young apprentices , because we still have Cydia and Icy , which is an iPhone app installer that plugs into Cydia directories — made by Ripdev .

The commercial real estate debacle is heating up .
Although the market is cheering the better than expected drop in second quarter GDP , much of the reason for a less than spectacular fall came from the “ G ” in the equation , government spending .
By the way , we revised Q1 GDP lower to - 6.4 percent but not much interest was given to that minor detail .
Who is to say we do not revise the advanced estimate for Q2 lower ?
Either way , the GDP release tells us that commercial real estate is on precipice of implosion .
Is it any wonder that the U.S. Treasury is secretly working on a preemptive bailout program called Plan C gearing up taxpayers dollars for another toxic mortgage industry that has $ 3 trillion in loans ?
The failure of 2008 ’s residential mortgage bailout should tell you that bailing out CRE loans is a losing cause especially for taxpayers .
The problem for commercial real estate is the shrinking demand from consumers who have now found a new form of forced austerity .
With 26,000,000 Americans unemployed or underemployed the demand for armies of strip malls is no longer a pressing issue .
Sure , we can offer gimmicks like cash for clunkers but where is this money coming from ?
Most people realize that conspicuous consumption by consumers , Wall Street , and the government led us here and our solution is more conspicuous consumption ?
Like a conductor prepping his orchestra , the defaults are now starting in full force :
The hits are now starting to come from a variety of angles .
This is a problem that will hit everyone but will bring down hundreds ( maybe up to a thousand ) of the regional banks who made extremely risky bets in the commercial real estate markets .
Unable to compete with the residential real estate mortgage boom , many regional banks decided to keep things local and saddle their portfolios up with commercial real estate .
These loans are more likely to default and default huge .
With one residential property in foreclosure , the bank might lose $ 100,000 given the fall in housing prices but on one really bad CRE deal , a bank can stand to lose millions .
Commercial real estate goes beyond your local strip mall or dental office .
The U.S. Postal Service is announcing it will be contracting its need for CRE space :
“ ( Costar ) The Postal Service sent a notice to American Postal Workers Union executives this summer that it was considering consolidation options in every major metro market in the country and would consider closing 3,243 of its 4,851 largest branches and centers in the review process . …
The review process was to last most of the summer … but they want the consolidation to occur by October 2010 .
…
According to USPS records , it owns 8,546 facilities totaling 219.6 million square feet and leases another 25,272 locations totaling 912.2 million square feet . …
“( Calculated Risk )
The postal service has already reduced their footprint a little since 2003 as shown in the chart from the GAO .
But the GAO report suggests the next reductions may be much more significant .
How about another 14 million square feet of vacant retail space on the market ? ”
More space is coming online .
A recent deal also had Target , the giant retailer backing out of a major project due to “ lack of consumer demand ” which of course is what is happening on main street USA with rising unemployment and stagnant wages .
The average American household with $ 46,000 a year does n’t have the disposable income to support all the failed CRE projects languishing in the market :
This is also being reflected in less people going to restaurants .
The National Restaurant Association ( the other NRA ) announced another month of contraction for the industry .
What does this mean ?
Less demand for CRE space .
And in the report they also stated that current restaurant owners are noticing “ negative customer traffic ” in June .
I thought GDP was now booming and the recession was over as Newsweek had proclaimed ?
Commerical real estate projects are failing across the country .
Take this case from Silicon Valley :
“ ( SJ Business Journal ) Unable to work out a deal , California Bavarian Corp .‘s Bordeaux Centre has been sold at auction to its lender Wrightwood Capital for less than $ 15 million .
Developer Mark Mordell , president of Cal Bavarian , was n’t at the auction but said Wrightwood was the only bidder on the property located in Sunnyvale .
Mordell said he was told the campus sold for less than half the $ 34 million debt owed on the never - occupied , 124,000 - square - foot project begun by Cal Bavarian in 2007 and finished in 2008
“ It was unfortunate that we could n’t get a deal done with the lender , ” Mordell said Tuesday morning .
The property is regarded in the brokerage community as a classy project that has been a victim of the economic downturn and companies fearful about making any moves . ”
So let us get some facts straight .
The project was encumbered with $ 34 million in debt but sold at auction for less than $ 15 million .
What does this mean ?
More bank failures and a painful hit for those that made the loans on this specific project .
We ’re already up to 69 bank failures for 2009 but that does n’t seem to phase the market since all the money to fix these problems are going to come from the taxpayer .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are happy to proclaim that the recession is over ; that is , over for the real estate industry , Wall Street , and banks since they have an unlimited safety net backed up by the American public .
But these commercial real estate deals are going to be lingering for years sometimes sitting empty with tumbleweeds spinning in their empty parking lots .
This gives us two roads ahead .
The first one is the market will start facing major losses in late 2009 and 2010 and will correct once again .
The second road , includes stretching out these projects and bailing them out via Plan C and thus forcing the losses out over a decade thus giving us a Japan like trajectory .
All the bailouts are looking backwards , not forwards .
We need job creation not commercial real estate taxpayer insurance which will drown our economy in debt from toxic bets made in the past from irresponsible banks .
Why do we really need to bailout a bank that made a bad loan in a commercial project in Arizona that does n’t even have any demand ?
Or a strip mall in Florida where unemployment is in the double - digits ?
How does this create a sustainable economy ?
It does n’t .
Here is the running tab for FDIC insured institutions as of the end of Q1 of 2009 :
$ 1.4 trillion in commercial and industrial loans .
$ 1 trillion in commercial real estate .
$ 566 billion in construction in land development .
You add it up and we get over $ 3 trillion .
Nearly half of the $ 7.7 trillion in loans with FDIC insured institutions is in some form of commercial real estate .
Unless people wake up Plan C is going to be implemented and we are going to own a bunch of empty strip malls , restaurants , and other projects with no customers .
I did n’t realize we ’d be doing a cash for clunkers with commercial real estate .

Der Niedersächsische Fußball - Verband ( NFV ) sieht es als verboten an , Fotos von Amateurfußballspielen auf dem Mitmach - Portal MyHeimat oder vergleichbaren kommerziellen Plattformen zu veröffentlichen .
Dies teilte Steffen Heyerhorst , Rechtsexperte der Landesvereinigung des Deutschen Fußball - Bundes ( DFB ) dem auf der Mitmach - Seite aktiven Bürger - Reporter Lars Klingenberg in einer ( nur teilweise veröffentlichten ) E - Mail mit .
Heyerhorst beruft sich in seinem Hinweis auf das juristischen Einschreiten des Württembergischen Fußballverbands gegen das Videoportal Hartplatzhelden .
Das Oberlandesgericht
Stuttgart entschied in der Auseinandersetzung , dass die Rechte an Foto - und Videoaufnahmen lokaler Sportereignisse aufgrund der erbrachten Organisationsleistungen bei der DFB - Landesgruppe liegen .
Das Urteil ist noch nicht rechtskräftig , da die Hartplatzhelden in Revision vor dem Bundesgerichtshof gegangen sind .
[ Update : Der NFV will aber zunächst noch bis zu der angestrebten Grundsatzentscheidung dulden , dass Bildmaterial von Fans auf werbefinanzierten Web - 2.0 - Portalen erscheint .
Prinzipiell sollen die Aufnahmen jedoch allein auf die mit vielen Werbebannern bestückte Plattform fussball.de wandern , welche die Deutsche Telekom für den DFB betreibt . ]
Die Nutzung dieses Portals und die damit verbundene Steigerung der Popularität und die damit einhergehenden Vermarktungsmöglichkeiten trügen dazu bei , dass die für die Organisation und Durchführung des Spielbetriebs entstehenden Kosten für die erforderlichen technischen Komponenten nicht zu Lasten der Mitgliedsvereine weitergereicht werden müssen , begründet Heyerhorst diesen rigorosen Ansatz :
Es handele sich insofern um eine teilweise Refinanzierung durch eine " am Anfang stehende Vermarktung des Amateurfußballs " .
Oliver Fritsch von den Hartplatzhelden sieht von den Ansprüchen des DFB nicht nur alle Mitmach - Aktionen auf mehr oder weniger redaktionellen Seiten wie auch den " Leser - Reporter " von Bild.de betroffen , sondern letztlich auch Lokalzeitungen .
" Der NFV will sein Monopol auf Bilder vom Amateurfußball ausweiten " , schreibt der Sportler in einem Kommentar .
Der Landesverband werde sich nach einem möglicherweise für den DFB positiv ausfallenden BGH - Urteil nach eigenen Angaben überlegen , welche Webseiten er abmahnen werde .
Dabei solle im Einzelfall die Spreu vom Weizen getrennt werden .
Es sei laut Maßgabe des NFV - Juristen zu prüfen , wo sich der Amateursport dann noch im Internet " gegebenenfalls unter Inkaufnahme eines Eingriffs in die Medien - und Vermarktungsrechte " entfalten dürfe , wenn " kein vorwiegender kommerzieller Hintergrund besteht " .
Untersagt werden soll , befürchtet Fritsch , anscheinend jegliche " Privatinitiative für den Fußball " .

Massive campaign for Obama hits air
A new coalition on Thursday launched $ 12 million in television ads to support President Barack Obama ’s health reform plan , in the opening wave of a planned tens of millions of dollars this fall .
The new group , funded largely by the pharmaceutical industry , is called Americans for Stable Quality Care .
It includes some odd bedfellows : the American Medical Association , FamiliesUSA , the Federation of American Hospitals , PhRMA and SEIU , the service employees ’ union .

The decision of labor and progressive groups to join with industry groups could draw new heat about the president 's package from the left .
The ads began airing at about 11 a.m. ET Thursday .
The group is likely to be the biggest spender in support of health reform .
The campaign will serve as a counterweight to the critics at town meetings , which are getting saturation news coverage while Congress is out of town .
In a reversal from former President Bill Clinton ’s 1993 - 94 health care debacle , the group ’s campaign is likely to mean that White House supporters keep the upper hand on the airwaves .
PhRMA ’s participation is key , because the group has promised to kick in as much as $ 150 million for advertising and grass - roots activity to help pass the president ’s plan .
The debut ad is meant to shore up support among the conservative House Blue Dog Democrats and to target swing senators .
So it ’s airing in Alaska , Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Louisiana , Maine , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , North Dakota , South Dakota and Virginia .
The first buy is expected to run for two weeks , with a weekly spend of around $ 3 million .
“ This group has joined forces to communicate the specific benefits of reform at a time when there is a lot of misinformation about what health care reform actually means , ” an official of the group said .
The first ad is called , “ Mean for You , ” as in , “ What Reforms Means for You . ”
The 30 - second script , with a soothing male narrator : “ What does health insurance reform mean for you ?
It means you ca n’t be denied coverage for a pre-existing condition or dropped if you get sick .
It means putting health care decisions in the hands of you and your doctor .
It means lower costs , a cap on out - of - pocket expenses , tough new rules to cut waste and red tape and a focus on preventing illness before it strikes .
So what does health insurance reform really mean ?
Quality , affordable care you can count on . ”
The official provides a little more back story : “ These groups were part of a looser coalition that started back in January that focused on the links between health reform and the economy .
Now that the debate is turning on what health reform means for the individual , they felt the need to launch a new front that addresses some of those particulars while debunking some of the myths that are floating around .
Plus , these groups recognize that their collective voice packs more punch than if they were to just speak out individually . ”
The ad was made by GMMB , which was a lead agency for Obama for America .
Partners include Frank Greer and Jim Margolis .

Nissan unveiled its electric car for the masses , the LEAF , a bubbly hatchback , in Yokohama , Japan at its newly constructed headquarters , today .
Says one of Nissan 's many reps , the company is " betting the farm , " on electrics .
" Betting the farm " takes more than just constructing a car , it takes the creation of a vast new infrastructure to support the electric car .
That means charging stations in homes , quick charging stations at convenience stores and malls .
Charging stations at the office .
It means getting the public to abandon what it 's accepted for many decades , getting utilities and municipalities on board as well .
In short , it takes a vast connection of unrelated moving parts to synchronize and accomodate Nissan 's electric car .
But , by sheer force of will , it almost seems , Nissan believes that it will succeed .
It 's already had nine " markets " commit in the United States , as well as other towns in Japan and Europe .
According to Andy Palmer its SVP of product planning , " others are knocking on their door . "
The car -- should you be not want to click through our slideshow - - is a rounded hatchback .
From afar it looks ugly , born to the egg species of auto , but up close is palatable , and intriguing .
It is seductive if you believe in the electric vehicle , as contraption that frees you from oil , or contraption that ' uniques ' you .
" Some people said , this car looks normal , " says Shiro Nakamura , Chief Creative Officer at Nissan , " but that 's intentional .
The customer wants to be recognized , ' I am driving an electric vehicle . ' "
Yet , says Nakamura , no one wants to be in a " strange " car .
Indeed , the car looks normal , but has enough of a distinction to let people know that it is an electric .
Nissan is still not revealing a price for the car .
Speaking at the unveiling , Carlos Goshn , Nissan 's CEO , said the " The car will cost as much as a comparable internal combustion engine car , minus the batteries . "
When the customer leases the battery and pays for electricity , the monthly cost will be less than gasoline .
We imagine the entire ordeal will be about a break even proposition for the driver , when you factor in the hassle , and other unseen costs that might arise .
Our best guess for the price : $ 30 - $ 40,000 for the car , plus a cheapish lease on a battery that costs $ 10,000 or so to make .
Those numbers are unparalelled in electrics , but Nissan says it will be a profitable operation , thanks in no small part to generous government support for the program .
The LEAF will get around 100 miles per charge depending on how it 's driven .
It 's top speed will be below 90 mph , but the car handles well and accelerates with a powerful zip .
From this hatchback , and platform , Nissan plans to launch more cars including a sedan , in the next five years .
Nissan is staking its company on the success of the electric car .
To be sure , it 's not abandoning the internal combustion engine , but it is taking the opportunity to own the electric car market , the way the Prius now owns the hybrid market .
Will it work ?
Will the company sell hundreds of thousands of electric cars as it hopes by 2012 when the car is sold around the world ?
It seems like a long shot , but we 'll see if pent up demand for an alternative to gas cars is unleashed .
Nissan clearly believes in that pent up demand , and is pushing its chips to the center of the table .
Of all the major automakers , it 's the only one that can truly make that claim .
Disclosure : Nissan was kind enough to fly Jay Yarow to Japan for the LEAF unveiling .
While there , Jay 's also riding bullet trains , gobbling sushi , and checking out castles .
So he 's feeling pretty warm and fuzzy about Nissan right now .
Have you ever had that feeling where you ’re certain something is real , then you take a closer look ?
The incredible skill from the artists in these 15 awesome paintings left us with that exact feeling of uncertainty .

Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , GOP candidate for U.S. Senate ( via Fired Up! Missouri ) :
Transcript :
BLUNT , July 9 : You could certainly argue that government should have never have gotten in the health care business , and that might have been the best argument of all , to figure out how people could have had more access to a competitive marketplace .
Government did get into the health care business in a big way in 1965 with Medicare .
BLUNT , Last weekend :
We 've had Medicare since 1965 , and Medicare has never done anything to make people more healthy .
If there 's any opportunity for more healthy activity , it 's going to be , again , a private , competitive ...
Medicare has never done anything to make people more healthy ?
Uh , if that 's true , why is Medicare the most popular health insurance program in America ?
And how does Blunt explain the wide range of preventative health services offered by Medicare , ranging from flu shots to helping people quit smoking and everything in between ?
And if Roy Blunt wants to keep Medicare costs down , is n't one of the very best ways of doing that making sure that people are healthier when they are 65 than they are today ?
And would n't health reform make that possible ?
Guys like Roy Blunt think health care is just another widget .
But it 's not .
You have your health -- good or bad -- for your entire life , but your health insurance company only cares about the next premium .
With rare exceptions , private health insurance companies have incentive whatsoever to keep you healthy ten years from now , because ( a ) you probably wo n't be a customer of their 's ten years from now and ( b ) even if you are , they can just raise premiums .
For the most part , they just do n't have an incentive to help keep you healthy now to save costs later .
Their goal is short - term profit : not helping you live a long and healthy life .
Everybody who has looked at this situation knows that health reform is the only way to lower costs and increase health , and the fact that Roy Blunt wants to go backwards on health reform by eliminating Medicare and replace it with a private for - profit health insurance scheme is stunning .
Talk about bone - headed politics .
Maybe Blunt should use some of that health care he gets for free from Congress ... to fix his thick skull .
“ They have always called me crazy , ” he said .
“ The thing is , crazy are the people who do n’t understand that the future belongs to those who are not standard , who are open and vulnerable . ”
Still , even in a relatively tame , 45 - minute discussion in his office in Kiev , Mr. Chernovetsky seemed a little off .
For much of the interview , he would not look at his questioner , speaking in almost a monotone while staring at the floor .
In public appearances , this bearing  combined with occasional bursts of exuberance  has prompted speculation that he abuses alcohol or drugs , or is on heavy medication .
At one event promoting religious diversity , he slurred his language , pausing at length as he fumbled for the words for Judaism and Hinduism .
HE has denied the rumors about drugs and alcohol use , though it has not helped that he has taken short , unexplained leaves of absence .
Mr. Chernovetsky , who is married with two children , was elected in 2006 after supporting the Orange Revolution , and became known for courting retired people by strolling neighborhoods and handing out flour and other food .
There are three major political factions in Ukraine , led by President Viktor A. Yushchenko , Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko and Viktor F. Yanukovich , a former prime minister .
Mr. Chernovetsky , an independent , has at times built alliances with each .
All three factions covet the mayor ’s office but fear that removing Mr. Chernovetsky through something akin to impeachment would allow a rival ’s candidate to take over .
In 2008 , the Parliament , led by Ms. Tymoshenko , tried to unseat Mr. Chernovetsky by calling a special election .
He won , after his opponents could not unify around a candidate and split the vote .
He has since suggested that he might run for president .
George Lakoff has an excellent piece on truthout today on the disaster that is and has been President Obama ’s health care reform campaign .
It ’s long and it ’s excellent – Lakoff ’s piece , not the catastrophic reform effort – and I hope to God someone at the White House reads it .
Whenever I get Organizing for America emails , I wonder just what the hell I ’m supposed to do for them .
I really do .
Am I supposed to go sit at a boring - ass party with some warm wine ( I like wine with my whine ) and a bunch of other people who already agree with me and complain about health insurers ?
Do we have to talk about big pharma too , or is that a separate party ?
Seriously , what are we supposed to tell people ?
Everyone knows the wheels are off the health care - mobile , we ’ve all fought with insurers , or worried about family members who need expensive drugs , or thought twice about using insurance while getting our kids / selves / cats some therapy .
Everybody knows .
But the reform effort was easily hijacked by the anti-government right who demonized a public option with their shopworn stock phrases .
The administration was n’t ready , though it should have been , and let the whole debate run away without us .
It ’s time to take back the night , people , and Lakoff ’s the one to show us how .
The biggest thing he points out is that the president came out with a list , rather than a unifying idea .
Never underestimate the power of the unifying idea .
The list of what needs reform makes sense under one conceptual umbrella .
It is a public alternative that unifies the long list of needed reforms : coverage for the uninsured , cost control , no preconditions , no denial of care , keeping care when you change jobs or get sick , equal treatment for women , exorbitant deductibles , no lifetime caps , and on and on .
It ’s a long list .
But one idea , properly articulated , takes care of the list : An American Plan guarantees affordable care for all Americans .
Simple . …
As for language , the term “ public option ” is boring .
Yes , it is public , and yes , it is an option , but it does not get to the moral and inspiring idea .
Call it the American Plan , because that ’s what it really is . ”
Lakoff goes into a lot of fascinating detail , and you can read that at truthout , not here .
Believe me , the amount of awesomeness it contains makes it well worth your time .
I mean , how refreshing is the above ?
There ’s lots more like it in the piece , but here ’s another favorite of mine ( in addition to “ Doctors care ; insurance companies do n’t ” ) :
The American Plan .
Health care is a patriotic issue .
It is what your countrymen are engaged in because Americans care about each other .
The right wing understands this well .
It ’s got conservative veterans at town hall meeting shouting things like , ‘ I fought for this country in Vietnam and I ’ll fight for it here . ’
Progressives should be stressing the patriotic nature of having our nation guaranteeing care for our people .
A Health Care Emergency .
Americans are suffering and dying because of the failure of insurance company health care .
Fifty million have no insurance at all , and millions of those who do are denied necessary care or lose their insurance .
We ca n’t wait any longer .
It ’s an emergency .
We have to act now to end the suffering and death .
Doctor - Patient Care .
This is what the public plan is really about .
Call it that .
You have said it , buried in Policy Speak .
Use the slogan .
Repeat it .
Have every spokesperson repeat it .
Coverage Is Not Care .
You think you ’re insured .
You very well may not be , because insurance companies make money by denying you care .
Deny You Care …
Use the words .
That ’s what all the paperwork and administrative costs of insurance companies are about – denying you care if they can . ”
People can understand that .
Do n’t you feel like you could fight for the American Plan ?
I ’d sip a lot of warm wine in favor of it .
Of course , if this campaign had been run half as well as the presidential campaign , I would n’t have to .

A secular group is demanding that tourism groups stop promoting a " Creationist " zoo which questions the traditional view of evolution .
The Noah 's Ark Zoo , in Wraxall , near Bristol , is accused by the British Humanist Association ( BHA ) of misleading tens of thousands of annual visitors and " threatening public understanding " .
The BHA has written to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( BIAZA ) , North Somerset Council , Visit Britain and South West England , asking them to remove Noah 's Ark from their material .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The BHA says the zoo farm , run by husband and wife Anthony and Christina Bush , promotes Creationism - the belief that all life was created by God .
The charity says the zoo seeks to discredit scientific facts such as radio carbon dating , the fossil record and the speed of light .
The owners make no secret of their religious beliefs but say they are " slightly different " from pure creationists because the zoo explains life as being created by " both God and evolution " .
In a long section entitled " creation research " , the zoo 's website says Darwinism is " flawed " and wants to encourage a " creation / evolution debate " .
Signs at the zoo also describe how the " three great people groups " could be descended from the three sons of Bible ark builder Noah .
BHA director of education and public affairs Andrew Copson said : " We believe Noah 's Ark Farm Zoo misleads the public by not being open about its Creationist agenda in its promotional activities and by advancing misunderstandings of the natural world .

" We have therefore asked the South West England and Visit Britain tourist boards to stop promoting the zoo .
" As they are public bodies , we believe it is inappropriate that they should support establishments that seek to urge religious or ideological beliefs upon people in these ways .
" As Noah 's Ark Farm Zoo threatens the public understanding of the natural world we have asked the local authority , who issues the zoo with its licence , to ensure that the zoo 's education practices are in line with relevant Government and other guidelines . "
Noah 's
Ark research assistant Jon Woodward said : " To say that we are not upfront with our beliefs is unfounded .
The name Noah 's Ark is the first indicator .
" We also have much material on our website , which is not disguised or hidden , as well as being on our leaflet .
Our Education policy is purely based around the National Curriculum .
At no point is religion taught in the classroom , unless requested , as that would go against the National Curriculum .
" We are offering our visitors the chance to look at the Evolution / Creation debate .
As it is a free country , that is within our right .
Contrary to a small minority of people 's claims , we do not teach false science .
This is clearly shown within the zoo with one exhibition talking about Darwin and another offering another point of view .
" We are slightly different from popular creationism .
We hold a view that the natural world around us is the product of both God and Evolution .
Although technically creationists , we do not hold the stereotypical creationist views that the world was created in 6,000 years and there is no evolution .
" Out of 120,000 , of which a vast amount are made up of parents and school trips , we get approximately 10 complaints a year regarding this topic which is very low .
Clearly the public do not share the British Humanist view point . "
North Somerset Council spokesman Steve Makin said : " The licensing of zoos does consider education in so far as a zoo must promote an understanding of , and concern and respect for , biodiversity , animals and the natural world .
The zoo licensing system therefore does not comment on or is involved in personal beliefs . "
A VisitEngland spokesman said it did not comment on the content of attractions .
British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums director Miranda Stevenson said they did not promote Noah 's Ark Zoo Farm although it is a member of BIAZA .
Next year ’s census will determine the apportionment of House members and Electoral College votes for each state .
To accomplish these vital constitutional purposes , the enumeration should count only citizens and persons who are legal , permanent residents .
But it wo n’t .
Instead , the U.S. Census Bureau is set to count all persons physically present in the country — including large numbers who are here illegally .
The result will unconstitutionally increase the number of representatives in some states and deprive some other states ...

Just when you think the auto world is ending in an onslaught of grim grey Korean econoboxes ... life gets better .
And sometimes you just can't make this [ stuff ] up .
Take last Friday 's little news item from WardsAuto , for example .
A Russian company that was supposed to assemble copies of a Japanese Toyota from Chinese kits has instead been building and selling the little Tiggos itself .
Oh , the horror .
We can do no better than to excerpt the salient points of a few sentences that lay out the dastardly deed :
" It has come to our attention that ... entities in Russia have been assembling and / or distributing Tiggo vehicles without our authorization , " Chery says a joint statement with Chinese partner Bondy Trade ( Wuhu ) Co. Ltd. and Russian importer ZAO Chery Avtomobili Rus .
What 's a Tiggo ?
It 's a " cross/utility vehicle " that looks vaguely like a Toyota RAV4 .
In fact , more than vaguely ; it looks a very great deal like a Toyota RAV4 .
And who is the evil Russlegavto accused of this terrible Tiggo - poaching from the criminally copycat Chinese carmaker Chery ?
Why , all becomes magically clear : Russlegavto , as well as Russian auto maker OOO Taganrogsky Avtomobilny Zavod ( TagAZ ) , are controlled by FPG Doninvest .
And so on .
We urge you to click through to the story and read it aloud , preferably after a couple of stiff belts of vodka .
It 's better that way .
To us , the tawdry tale reads like mistranslated aphorisms from our aged Polish aunt who makes such wonderful pastries even though she has n't been entirely compos mentis since before the 1969 moon landing .
Chery is , by the way , the 33rd highest selling brand in Russia .
Which is perhaps the most stunning statistic of all .
There are n't even 33 separate brands selling in the US .
Although the barriers to entry are ... errrrr ... different here .
Chery is also the Chinese carmaker who was , once upon a time , going to manufacture a small car for Chrysler .
Pre-bankruptcy Chrysler , in any case .
But that , my children , was long ago and far , far away now .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
They say those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it .
But in Internet time ?
The testimony of a major hedge fund trader Wednesday in hearings on abusive commodities speculation sent a chilling message about our attempts to clean up Wall Street in the wake of the financial scandal .
Not because the trader , John Arnold , is among the most successful energy traders in the country , and has important things to say .
Not because he came out in favor of limits on commodities trading , which goes against what most of the industry wants .
Not because everything he said made sense .
It was because in his bio is a stark reminder of what happens when we collectively ignore a major scandal and move on to the next bull market .
Arnold , now managing partner of the $ 5 billion Centaurus Advisors hedge fund had worked for Enron Corp. back in the day .
First things first ;
Arnold was never tainted with any of the scandal that brought down the energy trading powerhouse at the turn of the decade .
His Houston - based energy trading firm is among the biggest players in the industry , which is probably why he was called to testify .
And he came out in support of limits on some commodities trading , arguing that it made the business more transparent and efficient .
See full story .
But his history with Enron makes his comments even more significant , because he 's lived on the wild side of energy commodities trading .
And just the mention of Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling 's former company should be enough to make anybody who lived through the scandal in 2001 cringe with embarrassment when looking at what we failed to do in this country to prevent another one .
The disastrous and ultimately useless Sarbanes - Oxley law on accounting disclosure was rushed through .
A handful of CEOs were tossed in country club jails .
And the usual bunk about greater corporate governance was debated at conferences .
Yet only seven years after Enron went down in a flaming pile of management hubris and false accounting -- taking corporate America 's reputation with it -- small investors and savers found themselves again at the mercy of a Wall Street - induced scandal , this time one that would take down the world economy .
No wonder Timothy " Come on , guys " Geithner , our usually placid Treasury Secretary , exploded in a profanity - laced tirade recently at a meeting with financial regulators .
Now that the major bleeding has stopped in New York , banks and bankers want to get back to business .
And regulators of those banks and bankers want to keep their turf .
So the old battles have started up again in Washington and the prospect of major financial overhaul grows dimmer by the day .
Perhaps sometime after the health - care issue gets addressed , right ?
There have been a lot of batty ideas coming out of Washington in the first few months of the Obama Administration with regards to Wall Street .
The idea of taxing bonuses at 90 % comes to mind .
But the core idea that something must be done to rein in abusive trading and risk - taking , and the compensation impetus behind them , is still something that must get done .
The time to push through some sort of overhaul is still now , while the administration is young and can wield influence .
FDR pulled it off during the Great Depression , and it changed Wall Street for 70 years .
Nothing of that magnitude appears headed anywhere now .
Sure , commodities regulators are considering imposing trading limits .
Bans on certain types of electronic trading , called flash trading , as well as so - called " naked " shorting of stocks , are still in play .
But the horse is already out of the barn on most of this stuff , and Wall Street will just find another angle .
The consensus for change has evaporated in New York , where bankers await a return of mergers and acquisitions and the rising stock market masks the pain of a global collapse in confidence in financial services that has yet to have its first anniversary .
In Washington , it is also slipping .
That 's why John Arnold 's testimony is important .
It 's now a world where massive , society - breaking financial scandals happen not once a generation , but once every presidential election cycle or two .
Yet they are tossed aside the next time stocks rise and the job market picks up .
In such a world , the term Enron serves as a cold , dark monument to our inability to pay attention to history long enough to protect ourselves from the next scandal -- probably brewing right now .
Update : Needle exchange legislation was passed by the full House of Representatives on Friday afternoon .
What a difference a change of administration makes .
After eight years of almost no progress during the Bush administration , drug reform is on the agenda at the Capitol , and various reform bills are moving forward .
With Democrats firmly in control of both the Senate and the House , as well as the White House , 2009 could be the year the federal drug policy logjam begins to break apart .

A bill that would eliminate the notorious sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine by removing all references to crack from the federal law and sentencing all offenders under the current powder cocaine sentencing scheme passed its first subcommittee test on Wednesday .
This one was bipartisan -- the vote was unanimous .

The ban on federal funding for needle exchanges has been repealed by the House Appropriations Committee , although current legislation includes language barring exchanges within 1,000 feet of schools .
Advocates hope that will be removed in conference committee .

The Barr amendment , which blocked the District of Columbia from implementing a voter - approved medical marijuana law , has been repealed by the House .
Massachusetts Rep. Barney
Frank 's marijuana decriminalization bill has already picked up more cosponsors in a few weeks this year than it did in all of last year .
Virginia Sen. Jim Webb 's bill to create a national commission on criminal justice policy is winning broad support .
The Higher Education Act ( HEA ) drug provision ( more recently known as the " Aid Elimination Penalty " ) , which creates obstacles in obtaining student loans for students with drug convictions , is being watered down .
The House Education and Labor Committee Wednesday approved legislation that would limit the provision to students convicted of drug sales and eliminate it for students whose only offense was drug possession .
( See related story here . )
The " Safe and Drug Free Schools Act " funding has been dramatically slashed in the Obama administration 2010 budget .
Funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy 's youth media anti-drug campaign has been dramatically slashed by the House , which also instructed ONDCP to use the remaining funds only for ads aimed at getting parents to talk to kids .
While most of the country 's and the Congress 's attention is focused on health care reform and the economic crisis , congressional committees are slowly working their way through a number of drug reform issues .
Here 's some of what 's going on :
" All the stars are now aligned on all these issues , " said Bill Piper , national affairs director for the Drug Policy Alliance .
" I 've never felt so optimistic about drug policy reform in DC . "
Looking into his crystal ball , Piper is making predictions of significant progress this year .
" I have a strong sense that the Barr amendment and the syringe funding ban will be eliminated this year .
The Webb bill will probably be law by December .
There 's a good chance that HEA reform and the crack sentencing reform will be , too .
If not , we 'll get them done next year , " he said .
" Things are heating up like I 've never seen before , " Piper exclaimed .
" It 's like a snowball rolling downhill .
The more reforms get enacted , the more comfortable lawmakers will be about even more .
Cumulatively , these bills represent a significant rollback in the drug war as we know it . "
Former House Judiciary committee counsel Eric Sterling , now head of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation , was a bit more restrained .
Congress is just beginning to come around , and there are dangers ahead , he said .
" We 're seeing windows being opened where we can feel the first breezes of spring , but it's not summer yet , " Sterling said .
" There are people asking questions about drug policy more broadly , there is more openness on Capitol Hill to thinking differently .
Liberals are not as afraid they will be attacked by the administration .
The climate is changing , but my sense is we 're still at the stage where members of Congress are only beginning to take their shoes off to put their toes in the water . "
What progress is being made could be derailed by declining popularity of Democrats , the drug reform movement 's failure to create sufficient cultural change and a stronger social base to support political change , and the return of old - style " tough on drugs " politics , Sterling warned .
" People need to be aware that as unemployment continues to rise , Democrats will be feeling afraid of repercussions at the polls , " he said .
" If the economic stimulus does not seem to be generating jobs , if there is a widespread sense of trouble in the country , the drug issue can easily be recast as a bogeyman to distract people .
Members of Congress could start talking again about ' fighting to help protect your families . '
Those old ways of thinking and talking about these issues are by no means gone , " Sterling argued .
That is why he is concerned about building a social base to support and maintain drug reform .
" The drug reform movement needs to create cultural change to support political change , and I fear we have n't done enough of that , " he worried .
Sterling also warned of a possible reprise of the late 1970s and early 1980s , when the emergence of a parents ' anti-drug movement helped knock drug reform off the agenda for nearly a quarter - century .
The administration 's effort to defund the Safe and Drug Free Schools
Act in particular could spark renewed concern and even a reinvigorated anti-drug mobilization , he said .
" The administration says the Safe and Drug Free Schools program has n't demonstrated its effectiveness and grant funds are spread too thin to support quality interventions , which may well be true , " he said .
" But little dribs and drabs of that get spread around the states , and that means a lot of people could be mobilized to fight back .
The parents ' community and prevention professionals will mobilize around these issues with renewed vigor , " he predicted .
The Wild West show that is California 's marijuana reality could also energize the anti-reform faction , Sterling said .
" For those of us outside California , it 's hard to fathom what 's going on there .
I do n't think anyone back East can imagine a dispensary operating every quarter - mile along Connecticut Avenue , " he explained .
" I ask myself if this is growing in a way that could create a potential powerful reaction like we saw in the 1970s .
There has already been a smattering of stories about marijuana use in school by patients .
Will there be exposés next fall about medical marijuana getting into the schools , kids getting stoned ?
People in the movement have to be aware that very real and powerful emotions can be unleashed by these changes , " he warned .
Still , " momentum is on our side , " Piper said .
" Webb 's bill has bipartisan support , the sentencing stuff is taking off in a bipartisan way , and the crack bill has the support of the president , the vice - president , the Justice Department , and some important Senate Republicans .
That 's probably the steepest hill to climb , but I think we 're going to do it . "
These are all domestic drug policy issues , but drug policy affects foreign policy as well , and there , too , there has been some significant change -- as well as significant continuity in prohibitionist policies .
And that situation is exposing some significant contradictions .
Here , it is the Obama administration taking the lead , not Congress .
The Obama administration has rejected crop eradication as a failure in Afghanistan , yet remains wedded to it in Colombia , and it has embraced the Bush administration 's anti-drug Plan Merida assistance package to Mexico .
" The really exciting thing is Afghanistan and special envoy Richard Holbrooke 's ending of eradication there , " said Sanho Tree , drug policy analyst for the Institute for Policy Studies .
" That 's huge , and it has repercussions for the Western Hemisphere as well .
The US can't have two completely divergent policies on source country eradication .
On Latin America , I suspect there is a power struggle going on between the drug warriors and the Holbrooke faction .
We need a Holbrooke for Latin America , " he said .
The media spotlight on Mexico 's plague of prohibition - related violence may be playing a role , too , said Sterling .
" The mayhem in Mexico certainly created a lot of thinking about how to do things differently earlier this year , " he noted .
" The media climate has changed , and perhaps that 's more important at this stage than the climate inside the Beltway . "
But the Mexico issue could cut against reform , too , he suggested .
" Where is all that marijuana in California coming from ? " he asked .
" If someone can make the case that Mexican drug cartels are supplying the medical marijuana market there , that could get very ugly . "
As the August recess draws nigh , no piece of drug reform legislation has made it to the president 's desk .
But this year , for the first time in a long time , it looks like some may .
There are potential minefields ahead , and it 's too early to declare victory just yet .
But keep that champagne nicely chilled ; we may be popping some corks before the year is over .
Please note that not all transmissions are " smooth " enough to be shifted without use of the clutch , repeated attempts to do so may damage the transmission if gear grinding is excessive .
Some heavier duty transmissions tend to grind gears much more easily and are more difficult to shift without use of the clutch .
This is most easily attempted on light duty transmissions such as those in compact / mid - sized cars / SUVs / trucks .
Karroubi's Rape Witness Disappears
09/03/09
Source : Roozonline
Mehdi Karroubi announced that one of the victims of rape in Iranian prisons has disappeared , and that " former Tehran general prosecutor and his representatives are responsible for any unfortunate event that may happen to him or his family . " �
This individual , who was raped while in detention , went missing after a meeting he had with representatives from the judiciary , according to Karroubi .
Mehdi Karroubi , who continues to protest the June 12 election official results , said in a letter that was published on Monday on Saham News website , the official mouthpiece for the Etemad Melli ( National Trust ) party , that the judiciary representative 's treatment of the victim at that meeting was so " ugly and repulsive " that it led to the victim 's disappearance . �
According to the letter , the victim 's father is hurt and saddened by the treatment of his son and his family . �
The authorities , according to Karroubi , have engaged in " questioning the local neighbors in order to cast doubt on the victim 's character rather than carrying out justice , " which enticed Karroubi to publicize the crime to raise public awareness .
Witness Who Was Interrogated Instead of the Offender
The details of the meeting held between representatives from the judiciary and the victim at Mehdi Karroubi 's office were published some time ago on the website Saham News .
In his letter , citing his disappointment with some judiciary official 's behavior , Karroubi announced that the meeting revealed that some judiciary officials are in fact seeking to silence the issue and deny it , rather than assisting the abused victims and carrying out justice . �
According to the letter , " Following the treatment by some judiciary officials , Mr. Karroubi did not hold any further meetings with those gentlemen , and instead wrote a letter to the newly appointed head of the judiciary , Mr. Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani , asking him to appoint a fair committee to investigate the post-election events . �
According to Karroubi , Saeed Mortazavi has asked Karroubi in a telephone call to cooperate with Judge Moghaddami , head of the thirteenth branch court in presenting evidence for the case .�
Following the request , it was coordinated with Molaghati to attend a meeting at Karroubi 's office - the location was suggested by the judiciary - with another official from the judiciary to speak with the abused victim . �
In the middle of the meeting , however , the victim left the meeting in protest , went to Karroubi and expressed his anger and sadness with the tone of the questions .
A study of Oxford rowers has shown that members of a team who exercised together were able to tolerate twice as much pain as when they trained on their own .
In the study , published September 16 in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters , researchers from the University of Oxford ’s Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology found the pain threshold of 12 rowers from the Oxford Boat Race squad was greater after group training than after individual training .
They conclude that acting as a group and in close synchrony seems to ‘ ramp up ’ pain thresholds .
The underlying endorphin release may be the mechanism that underpins communal - bonding effects that emerge from activities like religious rituals and dancing .
Each of the 12 rowers participated in four separate tests .
They were asked to row continuously for 45 minutes in a virtual boat in the gym ( as in normal training ) , in an exercise carried out in two teams of six and then in a separate session as individuals , unobserved by other team members .
After each of the sessions , the researchers measured their pain threshold by how long they could stand an inflated blood pressure cuff on the arm .
The study found there was a significant increase in the rowers ’ pain threshold following exercise in both individual and group sessions ( a well established response to exercise of any kind ) .
However , after the group training there was a significantly larger increase as compared with training carried out individually .
Since close synchrony is the key to successful competition - class racing , these results suggest that doing a synchronised activity as a group increases the endorphin rush that we get from physical exertion .
The study says that since endorphins help to create a sense of bonhomie and positive effect , this effect may underlie the experience of warmth and belonging that we have when we do activities like dancing , sports , religious rituals and other forms of communal exercise together .
Professor Robin Dunbar , Head of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University , said : ‘ Previous research suggests that synchronised physical activity such as laughter , music and many religious activities makes people happier and is part of the bonding process .
We also know that physical exercise creates a natural high through the release of endorphins .
What this study shows us is that synchrony alone seems to ramp up the production of endorphins so as to heighten the effect when we do these activities in groups . ’
Lead author Dr Emma Cohen , from the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology , said : ‘ The results suggest that endorphin release is significantly greater in group training than in individual training even when power output , or physical exertion , remains constant .
The exact features of group activity that generate this effect are unknown , but this study contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that synchronised , coordinated physical activity may be responsible . ’
One of the researchers involved in this study was Robin Ejsmond - Frey , a double Blue in rowing and former President of the Oxford University Boat Club .
The Dow Jones industrial average might be up for sale by its owner , News Corp. , a move that conceivably could result in a name change for the 125 - year - old stock market barometer .
The Wall Street Journal , citing unnamed sources , reported Friday that News Corp. was considering selling its stock index business and had reached out to potential buyers .
News Corp. , which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch , declined to comment .
Dow Jones & Co. , which News Corp. acquired in 2007 , offers thousands of stock indexes that are used as benchmarks by investors and licensed for use by mutual funds and other investment products .
It also owns the Wall Street Journal .

TVNewser is reporting that Fox News has sent Glenn Beck on a forced vacation this week in an attempt to take some of the heat off of the host he has seen almost two dozen advertisers leave his show .
Rumor has it that Beck himself was telling people that FNC forced him to take the week off .
The network and Beck ’s publicist have denied the report .
TVNewser posted , “ Tipsters inside Fox News tell us Glenn Beck ’s vacation this week from his Fox News show was not planned .
We hear Beck was told to take this week off to let some of the heat surrounding him die down . ”
The heat was caused by Beck ’s charge that President Obama is a racist .
This claim resulted in the group Color of Change applying pressure on Beck ’s advertisers to drop him .
Although it would not be unusual for a talk show host to go on vacation during the slow days of August , it is ironic and a bit suspicious that Beck goes on vacation after Wal - Mart dropped their advertising from his show .
This kind of successful advertiser boycott is highly unusual for Fox News .
The network is used to activists protesting them , but there has never been a pressure campaign against advertisers that has had this type of impact .

Glenn
Beck pulls some of the biggest ratings in cable news , so he is not going anywhere , but if the brass at FNC needed time to let things cool down and devise a counter strategy , so sending Beck in vacation makes a lot of sense .
Of course , Fox News is going to deny sending Beck on vacation , because they do n’t want to admit that the Color of Change campaign is having an impact .
Beck ’s publicist , Matthew Hiltzik , called the story bogus , “ It ’s sad and disappointing that despite denials from all parties involved — Fox and Glenn — and with objective proof that plans were made months ago , that someone continues to peddle this completely bogus story . ”
Beck ’s people can deny it , but their story does n’t quite pass the smell test .
If this was a planned vacation , it could not have come at a better time for Beck and FNC .
Welcome to the August 2009 Carnival of Trust .
The Carnival of Trust is a monthly , traveling review of the last month ’s best posts related to various aspects of trust in the business world .
It is much like the weekly Blawg Reviews that I post links to and have hosted ( click here and here ) , but those generally contain far more than ten links .
My job this month was to pick those ten posts for you and provide an introduction to each post that makes you want to click through and read more .
For my regular Chicago IP Litigation blog readers , this will be a slight departure from the case analysis format you have come to expect , but very similar to my earlier stints hosting the Carnival of Trust and Blawg Review .
It is the trust that matters , not the title .
At IP Think Tank , Duncan Bucknell added to the recent debate in the patent community about whether the IP function should move into the corporate C - level suite , adding a Chief Intellectual Property Office to the ranks of CEO , COO , CTO , CIO , CLO and CMO – click here and here to read Bucknell ’s posts .
Following up on comments by Microsoft ’s Marshall Phelps and Rockwell Collins ’ Bill Elkington , Bucknell explained that the issue is not the name , but in a company having an IP champion that earns the organization ’s trust and respect , whatever title that person is given :
You have to build your own credibility within your organisation as someone who reliably gets the job done .
As you build trust with those senior to you , then your ( ongoing ? ) commitment to communicating the value that can be added using intellectual property will become more prominent .
Make some ( achievable ) promises and then deliver .
The more that you do this , the more credibility will be given to the IP function , and the greater awareness those senior to you will have .
Some would call such a person an ‘ IP Evangelist ’ – I would say that they are just doing their job .
People executing on difficult tasks bit by bit has always been what success is about .
As usual , Bucknell ’s analysis is excellent .
A person ’s respect within an organization is at least as important as their title .
Running an organization is all about building trust .
The patent community focused much of its attention this week on the confirmation hearings for David J. Kappos , nominee for Director of the US Patent & Trademark Office .
Click here for Patentability ’s summary of the hearing highlights and here for a copy of Kappos ’s statement at Patently - O .
The hearings were relatively short , likely because there appears to be widespread trust in Kappos ’s background and abilities .
And although much of the hearing focused on procedural patent office issues , Kappos showed he deserved that trust by focusing his statement on his plans to earn trust with all of the stakeholders in the patent world .
He specifically addressed concerns that his corporate background could disadvantage individual inventors or academics :
I am mindful that the USPTO serves the interests of ALL innovators in this country , small and large , corporate and independent , academic and applied , and – most importantly — the public interest .
While I have spent my career to date at a large corporate enterprise , I am familiar with the concerns and issues of all USPTO constituents – including small and independent inventors , the venture and start - up community , public interest groups , the patent bar and many others – and will reach out to all of them .
Kappos addressed his plans to build trust with his employees at the USPTO :
I am mindful of the incredible dedication of the thousands of USPTO employees , and the essential role they play to the success of the US innovation system .
I will work every day with the USPTO employees and the unions that represent them to establish strong , positive relationships grounded in professional treatment for these workers producing work product based on professional judgment .
He addressed the need to build global trust and relationships :
I am acutely mindful that innovation today is global and that IP policy is of paramount importance , not only in our country , but also in the EU and Japan , in China , India , Brazil and many other developing countries .
I will use my international experience and my understanding of global IP trends to help this Administration represent , advance , and protect the interests of American innovators in the global arena and to lead the world in developing strong , balanced , inclusive intellectual property systems that advance the well - being of all participants .
And he addressed the need to build trust with the Administration he seeks to join and the American people the Administration serves :
Finally , I am mindful that the office for which I am being considered , working as part of Secretary Locke ’s team and within the Administration ’s agenda , must be intensely focused on how to serve the American people at this time of economic uncertainty .
Gene Quinn provides proof that Kappos ’s trust - building efforts worked in his IPWatchdog post about the hearings ( click here to read the post ) :
In all , what Kappos said was certainly reassuring , and he should have absolutely no problem getting confirmed .
If he does stay mindful of the needs of all those who use the USPTO , small , large and in between , and the interests of the diverse industries who sometimes need contradictory things in order to thrive , he will not only be a good leader , but he will be an exceptional leader and might really reform the Patent Office into the entity it can and should be in order to foster economic development and job creation in the US .
Walter Cronkite personified trust .
The passing of Walter Cronkite last month does not have much to do with intellectual property , but I could not do this month ’s Carnival of Trust without mentioning Cronkite .
To me and so many others , Walter Cronkite embodied trust .
Cronkite was the person so many turned to in times of national tragedy , like war , and in times of national triumph , like the Apollo XI moon landing .
Naturally , Cronkite ’s passing caused numerous reviews of present - day news personalities and almost as many questions about whether times have changed so much that we cannot have another Cronkite .
In the Chicago Reader blog , Whet Moser decries a poll that found the Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart to be the most trusted newsperson on the air today – click here to read the post .
Frankly , the poll does not appear to be scientific and , therefore , not very trustworthy .
But I have trouble arguing with the results .
I love news .
Three newspapers are delivered to my door every morning , and I read each one .
Okay , I at least skim each one .
I grew up watching the nightly news , but I now finding myself turning to Stewart for news programming more frequently than I turn to Couric , Gibson or Williams .
I like and even trust all three .
But Stewart has built a more powerful trust with me by calling out the problems with the 24 - hour news cycle and by making me laugh .
Stewart has some obvious biases , but he makes sure they are obvious and he creates even more trust by poking fun at both sides of most issues .
Truth and laughter are powerful trust builders .
Cronkite deserves more than one entry in this Carnival , and the second comes from the Carnival of Trust ’s own Charles Green at his Trust Matters blog – click here to read the post .
Green breaks down the components of The Most Trusted Man in America : 1 ) honesty ; 2 ) selflessness ; and 3 ) integrity .
Green also explains that Cronkite ’s calm , baritone voice reinforced each of the three characteristics .
I could not agree more .
Hearing Cronkite ’s voice is an instant dose of trust .
For those not fortunate enough to develop their own " personal , " trust relationship with Cronkite through his news programming , check out this NPR obituary to get some measure of the man and his history .

How can companies build trust ?
Building trust can be a slow and sometimes uncertain process .
At his Touch Points blog , Steve Finikiotis cites a study suggesting that trust in corporation in the United States and other developed countries is at its lowest point ever – click here to read the post .
In order to remedy the decreased trust , Finikiotis provides four trust building steps : 1 ) Focus on understanding and meeting customers ’ preferences ; 2 ) Under - promise and over - deliver ; 3 ) Transparency ; and 4 ) Encourage and foster feedback .
And although Finikiotis did not focus on this example , last month Amazon showed just how those steps do build trust .
Amazon was accused of copyright infringement when a digital book seller used a self - service program to sell unauthorized copies of several books , including George Orwell ’s 1984 , to Amazon Kindle users .
When Amazon learned of the alleged infringement , it erased the books from its customers Kindle accounts .
As you might expect , there was a public outcry .
Kindle users were upset to learn that books they purchased and felt they owned could be removed from their devices and accounts .
And Amazon sprang into action following Finikiotis ’s four steps :
Amazon listened to its customers ’ frustration at having the books removed and the possibility of future removals ; Amazon replaced the books ; Amazon ’s founder and CEO , Jeff Bezos , issued the following very direct and honest apology :
This is an apology for the way we previously handled illegally sold copies of 1984 and other novels on Kindle .
Our “ solution ” to the problem was stupid , thoughtless , and painfully out of line with our principles .
It is wholly self - inflicted , and we deserve the criticism we ’ve received .
We will use the scar tissue from this painful mistake to help make better decisions going forward , ones that match our mission .
With deep apology to our customers ,
Jeff Bezos
Founder & CEO
Amazon.com
4 . Through its response and apology , Amazon fostered feedback .
Amazon turned a negative situation into a very positive one .
As a Kindle owner ( and lover ) , I was very happy with the response and it has made me an even more loyal Kindle customer .
And others agree .
For example , Amazon ’s response helped convince PublicOrgTheory blog to go ahead with a Kindle purchase – click here to read the post .
And In Propria Persona has qualms with copyright law , but saw the apology as good customer service and said it improves the likelihood of him purchasing a Kindle – click here to read the post .
Finally , the Below the Line marketing blog says that " Amazon shows how to apologize , " and notes that customer comments on the Amazon site have been largely positive since the apology ; proof that Finikiotis ’s steps work .
Nice job to both Finikiotis and Amazon .
And with that story of trust done well , thank you for reading , whether you are a regular reader of this blog or a Carnival of Trust groupie .
Members of the public look at a tree stump in Rathkeale , Co Limerick , after workmen claimed the image of the Virgin Mary appeared in the remains of the felled tree .
HOW little times change : 1985 -- recession , unemployment and a moving statue of the Virgin Mary in Ballinspittle , Co Cork .
Fast forward 24 years : recession , unemployment and the Virgin Mary in a tree stump in Rathkeale , Co Limerick .
In their hundreds and from across the country , pilgrims are flocking to St Mary 's Church grounds in the west Limerick town to pray and touch the willow tree stump , which many claim depicts an image of the Blessed Virgin .
Candlelit rosaries continued last night in Rathkeale and locals have pledged to keep a 24 - hour vigil to ensure that nobody removes the tree stump .
Workmen employed on a FAS scheme were contracted to remove the 80 - year - old willow tree on Monday evening as its branches were overhanging a primary school .
Chairman of Rathkeale Community Council Noel
White recalled the moment the image was seen .
" The wood was rotten and they were cutting away when one of the lads working on it , Anthony Reddin , said , ' Look , there 's the Virgin Mary . '
Immediately , another one of the lads knelt down , blessed himself and began praying , " Mr White said .
" About 30 minutes later , a crowd had gathered , " he said .
But scepticism remains even among the most devout of Catholics .
Local priest Fr Willie Russell has said , " There 's nothing there . . . it 's just a tree .
You can't worship a tree . "
Rathkeale parish priest , Fr Joe Dempsey is away on a fortnight 's holidays but over 2,000 people have signed a petition to prevent the tree 's removal .
Those praying at the stump yesterday were in no doubt of what was before them .
Hope
Seamus Hogan who runs a gift and toy shop in the town said people from all walks of life arrived into Rathkeale .
" We had American and Swedish tourists here last night and people from all over the country .
If all they are looking for in these times is hope and this is where they finding it , in a piece of wood , then God knows that is a good thing , " Mr Hogan said .
" The Catholic Church needs something like this at the moment and if this gives hope and inspiration , then that is great .
We have people suffering from cancer here , people on wheelchairs and those with walking aids , it is amazing , " he added .
Carmel Conway and her mother , Bridget travelled from Lixnaw , Co Kerry .
" I think it is real , " Carmel said .
" Even if it is n't , if it makes people pray , that is a good thing , " she said .
Pensioner James Richardson stopped off en route from St Ita 's nursing home in Newcastle West , Co Limerick to a medical appointment to pray at the scene .
He said he felt better having seen the stump .
Local man , Frank Markham said : " It is getting young people into the church that never went .
I have n't missed Mass here in over 70 years and this has strengthened my belief . "
Another man who asked not to be identified said he travelled from West Cork to pray to be reunited with his ex-girlfriend .
" If it helps , it will have been worth it , " he said .
Plans are now being made to have a glass case placed around the wooded stump to protect it from the elements .

Rob Miller is seeing a major fundraising boost following his opponent Joe Wilson 's outburt at the president .
( robmillerforcongress.com )
UPDATE : About nine hours later , at 8:00 am PT , Miller has now raised $ 148,000 and counting .
UPDATE 2 : At 12:15 PT , Miller is now at $ 371,000 .
Could Wilson 's outburst raise one million dollars for his opponent ?
It 's entirely possible .
Also on Zimbio :
Names in Politics Every week Zimbio looks at 10 names in politics who are setting the news cycle .
We 're still not sure what exactly the fallout will be from Joe Wilson ( R - SC ) yelling " You lie ! " at Barack Obama during his speech outlining his plans for health care reform .
It 's possible Wilson will become something of a hero within right - wing circles , or it 's possible his outburst will see him drummed out of the GOP .
One thing is sure though : it really , really helped his opponent Rob Miller .
The South Carolina Democrat had already attempted to unseat Wilson in 2008 , but came a few votes short .
Now , following Wilson 's moment , Miller has already raised $ 75,000 and counting from progressives who want to unseat Wilson .
Miller is more than willing to take advantage of Wilson 's heckling .
In a statement released to CNN , Miller said , " Representative Wilson 's behavior tonight exemplifies everything that is wrong in Washington .
Instead of engaging in childish name - calling and disrespecting our Commander - in - Chief , Joe Wilson should be working towards a bipartisan solution that makes quality , affordable health care available to each and every South Carolinian . "
Miller , a veteran of the Marine Corps , lost to Wilson by eight points during his 2008 run at the congressman 's seat .
He 's already preparing to run again .
Meanwhile , some conservative groups have rallied around Joe Wilson .
Red State , a popular right - wing website , is encouraging readers to donate to Wilson following tonight 's speech .
But the true sign of the trouble ahead for Wilson may be this : in the time it 's taken us to type out this article , Miller has already raised another thousand dollars .
His current campaign contributions now stand at $ 76,302 total .
Meanwhile , the search term " Rob Miller for Congress " is the 21st fastest rising search term in Google Trends as of right now .
Expect that number to grow by quite a bit in the coming days .

“ We firmly believe if you provide a really safe , healthy environment , people will bike , ” Ms. Freedman said .
The city is also establishing educational programs on bike riding and bike safety .
Image Nicole Freedman , the citys " bike czar , " said , " The grand plan is to change the culture , which is an incredible task . "

City and state officials are also backing up their efforts to turn Boston into a bike - friendly city with a crackdown on bad behavior against cyclists .
The legislature recently passed a law holding drivers liable if they open a car door in the path of an approaching cyclist and injure a cyclist , or if they open a door unsafely .
And the City Council is considering a fine for motorists who park in bike lanes .
There are few legal penalties  at least so far  for cyclists who ride recklessly and do not obey traffic signals .
But Ms. Freedman said city officials hoped more bike lanes would lead to more riders ’ and drivers ’ following the rules .
“ Bike lanes will give cyclists a legitimate place to be , and behavior will improve , ” she said .
On a recent Tuesday morning , Ms. Freedman rode in a newly installed bike lane from Kenmore Square part of the way up Commonwealth Avenue , through the Boston University campus .
The ride was smooth and problem - free until the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Carlton Street , a notorious choke point for drivers looking to get onto Storrow Drive or the Boston University Bridge , which leads to Cambridge .
The traffic was thick .
The bike riders were stopping and starting .
Many just got out of the bike lane and rode on the sidewalk .
A sign is needed , Ms. Freedman said , to get cyclists to loop around a side street to avoid the traffic .
“ Do we have problems ?
Yes , ” Mr. Menino said .
“ We ’re an older city .
Most of our roads were cow paths . ”
David Watson , executive director of MassBike , an advocacy organization , said change in Boston , particularly in the number of miles of bike lanes put in each year , is slow compared with improvements in other cities .
“ I think on balance we ’re moving in a positive direction , ” Mr. Watson said .
“ During my commute in peak travel times , I ’m running into bike traffic jams that are stacking up six to eight deep at lights , and that ’s something three years ago I was never seeing . ”
There is something affected , something not believable , something agitpropish , about all the cheers for the glorious economic recovery we are experiencing .
Some of its biggest boosters do n’t even quite believe it .
I ’m thinking of the reporter on National Public Radio a few days ago who , at the end of a segment , offered a passing warning that the bust did not come to an “ organic ” end , but rather was artificially stopped by government intervention .
That ’s an intriguing admission , suggesting that not even this reporter really believed it .
I certainly do n’t believe it .
In fact , I seriously doubt that even the champions of this great fakeroo believe it .
What he hinted at is the crucial difference between a recovery that comes from within the structure of the market economy and one that is imposed from without .
The former is sustainable , a basis for growth in the future .
The latter is not sustainable .
It lasts only so long as the stimulus lasts .
The most conspicuous problem remains unemployment , which is nearing double digits even in the official data while unofficial data even from Fed economists hint that the reality is closer to 16 % .
Among the youth , the rate is 25 % and growing .
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Month after month , the press announces the “ good news ” that unemployment is not as high as expected , and yet if you look at the trend line , we have not seen an uninterrupted climb in job losses of this scale in our lifetimes .
To be sure , this is only a symptom .
When an economy goes from boom to bust , a bout of job losses is inevitable .
It can even suggest a good trend , as people leave jobs in failing sectors to enter jobs in the healthy sectors .
Policy should not attempt to stop this trend .
What is of concern here is the timing .
The problem keeps getting worse , which suggests that in fact the bust has not played itself out entirely .
And this is backed by other trends .
Let ’s first talk about housing statistics that are off the cliff .
Consider housing starts .
Over a year , the crash from the height of 1.8 million per month to 390 thousand per month .
The latest rebound looks like a blip on the radar screen .
July numbers on foreclosures are the worst we ’ve seen , and the third time in five months that we ’ve seen a new record .
Already 2.9 million homes have been foreclosed on , and there are probably at least that many still on the chopping block .
Banks are reluctant to do the deed because foreclosures devastate their books , so they delay as long as possible .
Speaking of Liberty Jr. , Llewellyn H. Rock ...
Best Price : $ 1.80 Buy New $ 8.65 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
There is the sleeping giant of commercial real estate , which rose as much as residential housing , tripling loaned dollars in the course of a mere 10 years .
And yet there has not been a crash here .
Looking at the numbers , one gets the sense of a high - flying jet about to run out of gas .
And when you broaden the perspective past housing , to the whole of domestic investment , it looks like an Olympic high dive with no end in sight .
In fact , ten years of investment has been effectively reverted .
We stand today where we stood in 1999 .
Investment is a very important piece of data for assessing our future , because it is always forward looking .
In this case , there does n’t look to be progress in the future at all .
Even from the point at which this figure turns , we have another few years before real economic growth returns .
Why do matters in the financial sector look better ?
It is wholly a consequence of trillions in artificial stimulus , a market re-jiggered and falsified through money creation and partial nationalization and bailouts .
These do not last .
A few months ago , many people were worrying about the inflationary future that is suggested by the astonishing increase in phony bank reserves over the last year .
Today , however , the tune has changed .
Bernanke is now being heralded as the great genius of our times .
What this suggests is that no efforts are going to be undertaken to suck the phoniness out of the system .
The new reserves are going to stay in the system , and every effort will be taken to convert the reserves into real money supply increases .
And if this actually happens , you had better hold on for a wild inflationary ride .
Do we even need to mention the federal budget problems ?
Revenues continue to collapse as government spending soars , creating a gigantic hole in the budget at a time when pressure for more spending is accelerated by the recession .
There is no talk of budget cuts .
We are entering into uncharted territory .
A year ago this month , the whole country was in agreement that we had been living an illusion for the previous ten years and that the prosperity we thought we were enjoying was not sustainable .
There was no dissent on this point .
Even Obama admitted it .
Today , the illusion is even more egregious than it was , and yet people are once again embracing it as if it will not end .
The policy response to the downturn has been one of the most short - sighted and economically irrational in the entire history of mankind .
Why did they do it ?
It ’s all about the politics of the short term .
The entire economic structure has been phonied up in order to make a success of the Obama cult .
This is the driving motivation , alongside the obvious desire on the part of financial and banking bigshots for a bailout .
Please clip and save this column and reread it 18 months from now .
In the meantime , do n’t be among those who believe that the government has discovered the secret to prosperity in the offices of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing .

netboot.me : Turning ' netboot ' into ' internetboot '

After a couple of weeks of concerted effort , I 'm pleased to announce the initial release of a new service , netboot.me .
Netboot .me takes regular netbooting and makes it a whole lot more versatile - now , you can netboot directly into the installers for many popular linux distros , as well as system tools and even live linux distributions , all directly over the Internet , and without any local configuration required !
All that 's required to set up netboot .
me is a spare writable CD , USB key , or floppy disk to write a small ( less than 1MB ) disk image to .
Alternately , determined geeks can change their DHCP server to allow computers to netboot directly .
Once you 've done that , booting off the device on any computer with wired ethernet ( wifi is a work in progress ) will automatically cause the bootloader to download the current version of the menu from netboot .me , which you can then find the boot image you want to boot from .
Selecting it causes the boot image to be downloaded and booted immediately .
Currently on the boot menu :
Best of all , netboot .
me lets you add your own boot configurations ; once you 've tested them , and if they 're of general interest , you can file a bug to have them included in the menu system .
netboot .me is capable of booting any linux kernel and any other standard boot image , as well as disk images and CD images , thanks to syslinux 's memdisk .
The getting started and help pages have many more details on how to use netboot.me , and how to contribute to it .
The more boot images in the system the better , so contributions are much appreciated .
Netboot .me is built on top of App Engine , which simplified things enormously .
Also , the idea of booting a computer off App Engine is just awesome .
For all of this , I owe a huge debt to the gPXE project and its support for netbooting over HTTP .
Its many other excellent features have also proven invaluable , such as direct support for USB , CD ISOs and regular netbooting , and support for syslinux comboot files for the menu system .
Edit : Now on reddit digg , and slashdot - your upvotes would be appreciated .

You ’d think that with a whopping 20 minutes carved out of an hour for commercials , the actual television program itself would be devoid of commercials , right ?
Not so .
Jay Leno has a considerable preoccupation with naming products on his show ( and , in the video above , interviewing the Wendy ’s girl ) .
The above video , featuring moments only from the September 25 , 2009 episode of The Jay Leno Show , features blatant references to Cialis , Walmart , Photoshop , Waffle House , numerous tire companies , Wendy’s , and Microsoft ’s Bing , calling into question the notion that The Jay Leno Show is an entertainment program .
With all of these mentions , you ’d think that Jay Leno was running a glorified infomercial .

Australia 's kangaroo meat industry has been dealt a huge blow , with an import ban coming into effect in Russia today .
Australian rural lobbyists say the impact on both regional communities and the environment could be devastating .
Russia has been Australia 's biggest kangaroo meat export market , taking about 70 per cent of what is produced .
But the Russian government authority that supervises imports has banned all roo meat , citing the detection of bacteria in a number of shipments .
Brent Finlay from rural lobby organisation AgForce says the ban will see kangaroo numbers explode , damaging the environment .
He also says it will hit communities that rely on the $ 270 million generated annually by the roo meat exports .
" We need this exports income to keep young Australians in jobs , " he said .
Mr Finlay says there are concerns politics is mixed up in the ban , but a spokesman for the Russian authority has dismissed that .

Estoy de acuerdo con flowerpot , creo que el jugador no lo hace con mala intención , quería llegar al balón pero le pisa la pierna al llegar tarde y esta se tuerce por el lado contrario por el que debería torcerse ...
Lo raro es que no se vean cosas de estas a menudo .
Además el hecho de que tuviera la pierna tan horizontal influye en ello .
Mala suerte para el jugador , que se recupere .

How To Fix The PCI Express x1 Bug
The reason why I wrote this article is simply because I have seen many whom had their motherboard 's PCI Express bus width stuck at x1 while overclocking .
This is especially seen on the ASUS P5B series .
So today , we are going to find out what will work and what wo n't , as well as their impact on gaming and HD video playback .
GPU - Z example showing a GeForce 9600 GT stuck at PCIe x1
Motherboards that might be affected include :
ASUS P5B
ASUS P5B - E Plus
ASUS P5B Deluxe / WiFi
ASUS Commando
ASUS P5KR
ASUS P5KPL-CM
ASUS M4A88T -M/USB3
New !
Gigabyte EP45 - UD3P Rev. 1
Gigabyte EP43-UD3L
Gigabyte P35C-DS3R
Gigabyte P35-DS3L
Gigabyte G31M -S2L
MSI P6N SLI V2
Graphics cards that might be affected include :
AMD Radeon HD 6850 New !
AMD Radeon HD 4850
AMD Radeon HD 4350
AMD Radeon HD 2600 XT
ATI Radeon X1950 Pro
ATI Radeon X1950 XT
ATI Radeon X1900 XTX
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260
NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX
NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512 MB
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT
Solutions that currently do NOT work :
Setting the PCI Synchronization Mode to 33.33 MHz
Updating the BIOS
Updating the graphics driver
Reinstalling Windows
Switching PSU
Solutions that MAY work :
Disable " PEG Force X1 " in the BIOS .
Adjust the NB Vcore in the BIOS .
Updated !
- According to rade486 , the ASUS P5B has a bug in which AUTO regulation of the north bridge does not work properly .
Instead of raising the NB voltage when the the North Bridge requires it , the AUTO feature keeps it at 1.2V .
The correct voltage varies from system to system .
So the best solution is to set the NB voltage manually and start from the lowest voltage setting , and increase the voltage step by step until you get the card to run at x16 .
He finally managed to get his card running at x16 with a voltage seting of 1.25 V .
If possible , install a fan to blow on the north bridge heatsink to keep it cool with the voltage hike .
So the best solution is to set the NB voltage manually and start from the lowest voltage setting , and increase the voltage step by step until you get the card to run at x16 .
He finally managed to get his card running at x16 with a voltage seting of 1.25 V .
Overclock or underclock the PCI Express reference clock ( up to 15 MHz either way ) .
More details here - PCI -E Reference Clock .
Set PCI Synchronization Mode to Auto .
This is an important step .
Set PEG Link Mode to Normal ( instead of Auto ) .
Installing the graphics card into a different PCI Express x16 slot .
You can also use a PCI Express x8 slot as the performance difference between PCI Express x8 and PCI Express x16 is minimal .
Reseating the graphics card in the same PCI Express slot , taking care to blow away any dust in the slot .
If you have a metal brush , you can try lightly brushing the contacts .
There has been at least three reports of a PCI Express x16 card suddenly switching to x1 mode due to loose or oxidised contacts in the PCI Express x16 slot .
Switching the PCI Express Selector from x16 x1 to x8 x8 .
This partially fixes the problem by enabling PCI Express x8 but the performance difference between PCI Express x8 and PCI Express x16 is minimal .
Overclocking the CPU base frequency by 1 MHz ( In ASUS motherboards , that means switching AI Overclocking to Manual and then changing the base frequency from 200 MHz to 201 MHz ) .
Many thanks to all of you for your feedback , and congratulations on beating the PCI Express x1 bug !
If you have any other tips on beating this bug , do tell us !
How To Check If You Are Affected
Checking if you are affected is simple .
Just use any system information utility , like CPU -Z or GPU -Z to check the PCI Express operating mode .
Here are examples of CPU- Z and GPU - Z results for motherboards affected by the bug , and those not affected by the bug .
PCI Express x1 ( Affected by the bug ) PCI Express x16 ( Not affected by the bug )
In this motherboard , GPU-Z reported that the Bus Interface was PCI - E 2.0 x16 @ x1 .
Similarly , CPU-Z reported that while the Max .
Supported was x16 , the actual Link Width was only x1 .
In this motherboard , the Bus Interface was PCI - E 2.0 x16 @ x16 .
Similarly , CPU-Z reported that the actual Link Width was the full x16 .

MIPS Technologies says that it will soon publish the source code of its port of Android for the MIPS architecture .
This could boost adoption of Google 's open source mobile platform on MIPS - based devices .
Android , which is built on top of the Linux kernel , is attracting interest in many segments of the mobile and embedded space .
Although it was originally designed for cell phones and is only supported officially by Google on the ARM architecture , it is being ported by third parties to work on other kinds of chips and form factors .
MIPS touts its Android port as a step forward for its " digital home " strategy , part of the company 's emphasis on the suitability of MIPS - based chips for the wide range of consumer electronics products that are outside of the increasingly ARM - dominated smartphone space .
In practice , what this means is that we can probably expect to see Android running on a lot more high - end MIPS - based digital photo frames .
Some other potential areas where Android on MIPS could be useful include multimedia set - top boxes , VoIP hardware products , and GPS devices .
" We are seeing an enormous amount of customer interest in Android on the MIPS architecture , " said MIPS Technologies marketing VP Art Swift in a statement .
" Android presents a compelling value proposition in bringing internet connectivity and a broad range of applications to MIPS - based digital home devices .
We are working closely with customers and partners to ensure that critical technologies are available for developers to take advantage of Android for consumer electronics . "
As you may recall , we wrote about Android on MIPS back in April when Embedded Alley announced its own unofficial port and development tools , which were primarily targeting RMI 's Alchemy Au1250 SoC .
Last week , Embedded Alley was acquired by Mentor Graphics , one of MIPS Technologies partners for Android .
Mentor hopes to encourage adoption of its own Nucleus real - time operating system alongside Linux and Android in mobile and embedded devices .
Although the MIPS Technologies website declares that the code is being made available to the public , that is actually not entirely yet true .
It 's initially being made available to select users .
In order to get access to the MIPSAndroid.org website and the private git repository , you have to first fill out a registration form and be approved by the site 's administrators .
I filled out the form myself and got approval several hours later .
The limited access is a temporary measure while they are in the process of rolling out the infrastructure and the code will be more broadly available to the public soon .

Software developers are increasingly using Web technologies to build desktop applications .
This is because modern HTML rendering engines and emerging standards provide a profoundly powerful foundation for rapid development , rich presentation , and deep Web integration .
Apple 's open source WebKit renderer has become the basis for several cross-platform application runtime environments that are designed to empower this trend , including Adobe AIR and Appcelerator 's Titanium framework .
WebKit can also be used alongside native platform user interface toolkits to build software that delivers all of the advantages of Web technology but also allows tight integration with the underlying platform .
In this article , we will look at how the WebKit HTML renderer can be used with GTK + to make a lightweight WYSIWYG editor with Python .
The magic of contentEditable
When scientist Tim Berners - Lee created the first Web browser in 1991 , it was both a hypertext viewer and an interactive editing tool .
The ability to seamlessly modify and produce content was a fundamental part of Sir Tim 's original vision for the Internet , but the notion of integrating this functionality directly into the browser never really gained broad traction .
The " contentEditable " property , which was originally devised by Microsoft and is now included in the HTML5 specification , makes it possible for Web developers to specify that certain blocks of HTML content should be treated as editable by the browser .
This feature is now widely supported in mainstream browsers and is a big step towards enabling the kind of Web that Tim Berners - Lee imagined .
We recently looked at how this feature is used in Snowy , a note - taking Web application that is affiliated with the Tomboy project .
The contentEditable attribute also has potential value on the desktop , as it significantly simplifies the task of building a WYSIWYG editor .
We can use this feature that 's already baked into WebKit and wrap it with a simple native user interface .
For this example we will use the Python programming language and the GTK + toolkit .
I chose those simply because they are familiar to me , but it 's important to note that this same technique could easily adapted to work with other toolkits , programming languages , and environments .
You could use Cocoa on Mac OS X , or you could use Qt if you wanted a cross- platform solution .
The WebKit APIs are relatively consistent between various ports , so the WebKit - specific functions used here should work in most places .
We will start by creating a GTK + window and populating it with a WebKit rendering element that displays a simple HTML string .
This demonstrates how trivially easy it is to use WebKit in a GTK + application .
It uses the WebKit GTK + port and the associated bindings .
import gtk , webkit # Create a GTK + window w = gtk.
Window ( ) w.set_title ( " Example Editor " ) # Terminate the program when the window is closed w.connect ( " destroy " , gtk.main_quit ) # Instantiate the WebKit renderer editor = webkit .
WebView ( ) # Load an HTML string into the renderer editor.load_html_string ( " < p > This is a < b>test </b > " , " file :/// " ) #
Add the renderer to the window w.add( editor ) w.show_all ( )
#
Turn over control to the GTK + main loop gtk.main ( )
This gives us a fully functional rendering element that can be used to display HTML content content or build a simple browser .
To make it into an editor , we need to turn on the editing mode .
You could do this by adding the contenteditable =" true " property to a top - level HTML element , but WebKit also provides a more convenient API method for turning the feature on in an embedded renderer .
editor = webkit. WebView ( ) editor.set_editable ( True )
Yes , it really is that easy .
With only one line of code , the HTML renderer becomes an HTML editor .
The user will be able to modify the content as if it was displayed in a word processor program .
The next step is to provide user interface controls that allow the user to apply formatting to the content .
WebKit does n't have its own APIs for setting formatting , but it 's relatively trivial to do so with JavaScript .
On the Web , the JavaScript document .
execCommand method is used with contentEditable to implement interactive editors .
It can be used to apply formatting to selected text and to insert content .
The method takes three parameters .
The first is a string that indicates which formatting command to use .
The second parameter is boolean that indicates whether the rendering engine should provide its own user interface for handling the operation , such as providing an input dialog to prompt the user for a URL when a link is being created .
The third parameter can be used to programmatically provide a value for the operation , like when you want to specify what font to apply to content .
For most simple formatting operations , the last two values can be set as " false " .
Some WebKit bindings give developers convenient access to DOM methods from native code .
This might make it possible to call execCommand on an embedded WebKit renderer in some environments using the programming language with which you are building your program .
The Python bindings for the GTK +
WebKit port do n't offer full DOM access yet , however , so we have to cheat and use JavaScript .
First , we make a string that specifies the JavaScript code for the document .
execCommand call .
Then we pass this string into WebKit 's execute_script method , which runs JavaScript strings in the context of the renderer .
The following example shows how to toggle bold formatting on the selected text in the WebKit renderer when the user clicks a GTK + button .
editor = webkit. WebView ( ) editor.load_html_string ( " < p > This is a < b>test </b > " , " file :/// " ) editor.set_editable ( True ) def on_click_bold ( b ) : editor.execute_script(" document.execCommand(' bold ' , false , false ) " ) b = gtk.
Button ( " _Bold " ) b.connect ( " clicked " , on_click_bold )
There are execCommand commands for standard formatting operations , including bold , italic , and underline .
More complex formatting operations , such as setting font and color are supported , too .
There are also several for inserting content , such as text , HTML , images , bulleted lists , paragraphs , and links .
In addition to formatting and content commands , there are some for actions , including cut / copy / paste and undo /redo .
For a full list of standard commands , you can refer to the relevant section of the HTML 5 specification .
The QuirksMode website has a really useful compatibility table that you can use to see which of these are supported in various browsers .
You can refer to the Safari column to see which ones are supported in WebKit .
For a more complex example , let 's have a look at how to handle image insertion .
We will use a GTK + file dialog to prompt the user for an image and then we will insert it into the content field .
editor = webkit. WebView ( ) editor.load_html_string ( " < p > This is a < b>test </b > " , " file :/// " ) editor.set_editable ( True ) def on_click_insert_image( b ) : dialog = gtk.FileChooserDialog( " Select an image file " , w , gtk.
FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN , ( gtk.STOCK_CANCEL , gtk.RESPONSE_CANCEL , gtk.STOCK_OPEN , gtk.RESPONSE_OK ) ) if dialog.run ( ) == gtk.RESPONSE_OK : fn = dialog.get_filename( ) if os.path.exists ( fn ) : editor.execute_script( " document.execCommand(' insertImage ' , null , ' %s ' ) ; " % fn ) dialog.destroy ( ) b = gtk.
Button ( " Insert _ Image " ) b.connect ( " clicked " , on_click_insert_image )
Some of WebKit 's default behaviors are undesirable for an editor .
For example , it will automatically load the target URL when a link is clicked .
That makes plenty of sense for a Web browser , but it 's not really what we want our HTML editor to do .
You can use the navigation - requested signal to trap page load requests and either ignore them or perform a specialized action as needed .
The next step to make a full - fledged editor is to build the user interface .
In my prototype , I use a GTK +
ActionGroup to construct the menus and toolbars .
This offers a few nifty advantages in this specific context .
import gtk , webkit , os w = gtk.
Window ( ) w.set_title ( " Example Editor " ) w.connect ( " destroy " , gtk.main_quit ) editor = webkit .
WebView ( ) editor.load_html_string ( " < p > This is a < b>test </b > " , " file :/// " ) editor.set_editable ( True ) def on_action ( action ) : editor.execute_script( " document.execCommand ('%s ' , false , false ) ; " % action.get_name( ) ) actions = gtk.ActionGroup( " Actions " ) actions.add_actions ( [ ( " bold " , gtk.
STOCK_BOLD , " _Bold " , " < ctrl > B " , None , on_action ) , ( " italic " , gtk. STOCK_ITALIC , " _Italic " , " < ctrl > I " , None , on_action ) , ( " underline " , gtk.
STOCK_UNDERLINE , " _Underline " , " < ctrl>U " , None , on_action ) , ] ) ui_def = " " " < toolbar name=" toolbar_format " > < toolitem action = " bold " /> < toolitem action = " italic " /> < toolitem action = " underline " /> </ toolbar > " " " ui = gtk.UIManager ( ) ui.insert_action_group(actions ) ui.add_ui_from_string(ui_def ) vb = gtk.VBox ( ) vb.pack_start(ui.get_widget(" /toolbar_format " ) , False ) vb.pack_start( editor , True ) w.add( vb ) w.show_all( ) gtk.main ( )
Barcelona have confirmed that they are interested in signing the Arsenal captain Cesc Fábregas , but have ruled out breaking the bank to bring the Spain midfielder back to Camp Nou .
Fábregas , who left Barcelona for England as a 16 - year - old , has been repeatedly linked with a return to the current European champions , and the sporting director Txiki Begiristain has identified him as one of the few players capable of improving a team that won the treble last season .
" It depends on how much we want to spend , " Begiristain said in the Spanish tabloid Marca .
" If we spend a lot of money , it is possible [ to bid for Fábregas ] .
We do not know how much it will be yet .
We have not asked Arsenal .
If the amount is too high , we will not try . "
Barcelona fans have had to look on as rivals Real Madrid splashed more than £ 220 m on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo , Kaká and Xabi Alonso this summer .
The signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Internazionale – with Samuel Eto'o moving in the other direction – has been Barça 's one notable outlay .
" We find it difficult to improve what we have and that is the reality , " added Begiristain .
" Improving a team that has won a treble is difficult , and trying to improve dramatically can get you into trouble .
Any new player must be compatible with the plans of the coach .
Here the views of Pep Guardiola are critical . "
One possible target is Shakhtar Donetsk 's Dmytro Chygrynskiy , and Begiristain would not rule out a move for the Ukranian .
" I do n't want to dismiss any of the players we like and will help us improve , " he said .
" There are several options . "
The American Republicans opposed to Barack Obama 's introduction of healthcare reforms have been bad - mouthing our NHS .
How dare they ?
The NHS is one of my main reasons for thanking heaven I was born here , where I know that whatever my income , our free health system will look after me .
It 's not perfect , no organisation of that size could be , it 's bound to make some mistakes , but I do n't know where I 'd be without it .
Probably dead .
I have a thyroid condition , and every day for the last 30 years I 've had free medication , like thousands of others with ongoing conditions : diabetes , epilepsy , cancer and many others .
What happens to the 43 million people in the US who can't afford to pay for such things ?
Must they live a miserable , painful , debilitated life and die early ?
My mother was cared for until 98 , free , through pneumonia , stroke , angina , arthritis and a broken back .
All but one of the dozens of doctors , nurses and medical staff who treated her were kind , patient and verging on saintly .
She was even fitted with new false teeth at 97 by a lovely young dentist who came to our house to treat her , even though we all knew that the Grim Reaper was nearly at the door .
By that age , my mother often longed to be allowed to fade away , but our hospital seemed to pull out all the stops to keep her going .
So those Republican claims that our elderly cannot receive certain treatments are fibs , or at least grossly exaggerated .
The over - 59s are not refused heart surgery .
One of my friends , aged 70 , has recently had a stent fitted ; another , also 70 , is about to have a valve replacement .
And last year , aged 66 , I had two cataracts removed .
For decades my family and friends have been in and out of our local hospital A&E like yo - yos , with our strokes , broken ankles , broken back , fishbones stuck in throats , X - rays , blood tests , scans , check - ups , and we 're all still alive and healthy .
We 're almost fond of the place .
Half our street works there – doctors , nurses , even a moral philosopher .
Admittedly we 've had the odd wretched experience – the long wait in casualty or for a bedpan , the horrid puréed dinners , the lost notes – but ultimately we 've all been looked after , cured and called back for check - ups and therapies .
All together , we have been a tremendous drain on the NHS 's resources : GPs have been buzzing round to our house for red alerts – the vomiting virus , the after - stroke frights .
The chemist has been churning out pills , and all of it free , except for the odd prescription .
What would have happened to us in the US had we not been able to afford insurance ?
I dread to think .
I do n't understand the Republicans .
Do they want the poor to be dropping like flies ?
Or are they all insurers ?
Republicans brag that their cancer treatment is better than ours .
So it is , but presumably only for the wealthy .

“ The serpentinization reaction produces hydrogen gas and groundwater with high pH values similar to that of household bleach .
Hydrogen gas is very energy rich for microorganisms , but not every microorganism can live in these high pH conditions . ”
A research team composed of scientists from Memorial University ( located in St. Johns , NF ) , Carnegie Institution for Science East Carolina University and NASA Team leader , Dr. Penny Morill , an Earth Sciences Researcher from Memorial told press that the life forms found on the rock known as the Tablelands will lead researchers to their ultimate goal : finding life on Mars .
The microbial life forms found will give the researchers an insight into what life on Mars could be like - or was like .
Dr. Merrill told press that
The type of rocks found at the Tablelands are rare , and there are only four other places on earth where these rocks can be found .
What makes the rocks special are their high levels of iron and magnesium , which give the rocks their reddish colour .
The rocks come from the Earth 's mantle and their chemical make - up is similar to that of Martian meteorites that have landed on Earth .
The chemicals in the rocks react with water , in a process that is called Serpentinization .
Morrill told Memorial 's on - line news , today.mun
What makes all this important is that the microbacteria found at the Tablelands are living in conditions similar to those believed to be found on Mars .
Methane , found on Mars in 2004 , is thought to indicate the presence of life on Mars because Methane is created by biological ( think cows ) and geological processes ( think coal , volcanoes ) .
Canada has a collaborative initiative with NASA and the Canadian Space Agency to study certain earth systems , such as permafrost , because of their similarity with the environments presumed to be found on planets such as Mars or Saturn .

It 's harvest time again for the marijuana plant , and US drug eradication officers are busier than usual .
An ever - tightening southern border , high unemployment , and a steady , even growing , appetite for the illicit plant have all led to a surge in marijuana acreage in the country 's chief pot -growing regions , law enforcement sources say .
In the first eight months of the year , local , state , and federal police chopped down 8 million plants worth about $ 22 billion on the street – a 14 percent increase from last year .
Seizures of the farms have nearly doubled in Washington state alone .
There has been no increase in overall enforcement efforts or funding .
In recent years , domestic pot production in some parts of the US had fallen due to more anti-drug agents in helicopters scouring the prime cultivation areas , including the hillsides of southern Appalachia and the Pacific Northwest , police say .
Only between 20 to 40 percent of planted pot fields are ever harvested and sold due to US enforcement actions , says the Office of Drug Control Policy .
But rising unemployment seems to have given new impetus to the industry , officials say .
Driven by tough times
Especially in east Tennessee , Kentucky , and West Virginia , tough economic times may be motivating descendants of moonshiners to take the high risk and put spades in the earth .
Pocketing a street value of up to $ 2,000 per plant , a successful grower can quickly rise in local prominence – new trucks and boats popping up in poor areas are often a sign of successful cultivators , police say .
The illegal American pot harvest is worth about $ 35 billion a year , according to government estimates .
In comparison , the 2007 bumper corn crop in the US was worth approximately $ 45 billion .
Illegal California growers , too , seem to have picked up production – a sign to some that while the US economy is struggling , the black market is growing .
Growing appetite
So is demand .
The US Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday in the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health that the number of Americans who report " current use " of pot rose from 14.4 million in 2007 to 15.2 million in 2008 .
Hard times and unemployment seem to have had no negative impact on consumption , said Ed Shemelya , chief of marijuana eradication for the Office of Drug Control Policy 's Appalachian High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area , in an interview to the Associated Press .
In fact , it 's the other way around , he said .
Despite intense eradication efforts and anti-drug campaigns , Justice Department figures show marijuana consumption has stayed level over the last decade , agrees Bruce Mirken , a San Francisco - based spokesman for the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project in Washington .
" It may not be that people are spending their last money on marijuana , but certainly the fact is that the need to … distract yourself is pretty much a constant in human behavior through good times and bad , " he says .
OBAMA AND SMERCONISH ….
President Obama sat down this morning with conservative radio talk - show host Michael Smerconish , who broadcast his show live from the White House today , for a substantive and interesting discussion .
One exchange , in particular , stood out for me .
A caller from Philadelphia , who said he “ worked hard ” in support of the Obama campaign last year said he ’s “ getting a little ticked off , ” because he ’s afraid the president ’s “ knees are buckling a little bit ” on health care .
“ It ’s very frustrating to watch you try and compromise with a lot of these people who are n’t willing to compromise with you , ” the caller said .
Obama responded :
“ Well , look , I guarantee you , Joe , we are going to get health care reform done .
And I know that there are a lot of people out there who have been hand - wringing , and folks in the press are following every little twist and turn of the legislative process .
You know , passing a big bill like this is always messy .
FDR was called a socialist when he passed Social Security .
JFK and Lyndon Johnson , they were both accused of a government takeover of health care when they passed Medicare .
This is the process that we go through — because , understandably , the American people have a long tradition of being suspicious of government , until the government actually does something that helps them , and then they do n’t want anybody messing with whatever gets set up .
“ And I ’m confident we ’re going to get it done , and as far as negotiations with Republicans , my attitude has always been , let ’s see if we can get this done with some consensus .
I would love to have more Republicans engaged and involved in this process .
I think early on a decision was made by the Republican leadership that said , ‘ Look , let ’s not give them a victory and maybe we can have a replay of 1993 - 94 when Clinton came in ; he failed on health care and then we won in the midterm elections and we got the majority . ’
And I think there ’s some folks who are taking a page out of that playbook .
“ But this should n’t be a political issue .
This is a issue for the American people .
There are a bunch of Republicans out there who have been working very constructively .
One of them , Olympia Snowe in Maine , she ’s been dedicated on this .
Chuck Grassley , Mike Enzi , others — they ’ve been meeting in the Senate Finance Committee .
I want to give them a chance to work through these processes .
“ And we ’re happy to make sensible compromises .
What we ’re not willing to do is give up on the core principle that Americans who do n’t have health insurance should get it ; that Americans who do have health insurance should get a better deal from insurance companies and have consumer protections .
We ’ve got to reduce health care inflation so that everybody can keep the health care that they have .
That ’s going to be my priorities , and I think we can get it done . ”
This was an interesting response — to a great question — for a few reasons .
First , I do n’t think I ’ve heard the president say he “ guarantees ” that health care reform will get done before this .
Second , the more he reminds folks about how the right has consistently been hysterical about Democratic reform ideas , the better .
But the part about Republicans also seemed new — he said some GOP officials are opposing reform simply to help the Republicans ’ chances in the 2010 midterms .
That ’s obviously true , but as Greg Sargent noted , “ I ’m pretty sure Obama has not gone this far before . ”
WASHINGTON 
The first major operation launched with the additional troops ordered to Afghanistan by President Obama is devised to clear Taliban havens across a strategic southern province  and then , in a marked departure from past practice , to leave clusters of Marines in small bases close to the villagers they were sent to guard and aid , according to senior military officers .
Despite the troops ’ substantial numbers and firepower , the strategy is not without risks .
Indeed , on Thursday , the first Marine was killed in the operation .

Although American and allied forces have previously swept through the province , Helmand , killing or capturing as many guerrillas as they could , often with airstrikes , the military has never before had enough ground troops to hold onto large areas that were cleared of insurgent fighters in combat operations .
Raising
Silkworms
Silkworms go through four stages of development , as do most insects : egg , larva , pupa and adult .
The adult ( imago ) stage is the silkworm moth .
The larva is the silkworm caterpillar .
Since the silkworm grows so much , it must shed its skin four times while it is growing .
These stages - within - a - stage are called instars .
To get more information on each stage , select from the list below :
Mulberry leaves which are the only food that silkworms will eat .
Container
You can raise silkworms anywhere , but they will grow faster in a proper container .
Newborn caterpillars
They are very tiny and look great under a lower - power microscope !
Older caterpillars
Are large enough to hold in your hand and pet !
Spinning a cocoon is easy to watch when the caterpillars are in a cocoon condo of toilet paper tubes .
Metamorphosis is complete when the moth emerges .
It can't fly and only lives for a few days .
Eggs again !
Once your moths lay eggs , you can start all over again !
What went wrong ?
If your silkworms are dying , find out why .
and how to fix it .
The FIA has issued documents and recordings of the World Motor Sport Council hearing into the Renault - Singapore Affair .
This is fascinating as it reveals that there was a second witness to confirm Nelson Piquet ’c claims , known only as WItness X , described as another member of the Renault F1 team who , although not a conspirator himself , knew of the conspiracy at the time of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix .
This witness was found by Renault F1 .
The team stated in its submissions of 17 September 2009 that Witness X had confirmed that Mr Briatore had known of the deliberate crash plan before it had been put into effect .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Newly re-elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday his next government “ would bring down the global arrogance , ” signaling a tougher approach by Tehran toward the West after last month ’s disputed election .

Ahmadinejad , in his first provincial trip after the June 12 presidential vote , said Iran ’s enemies had tried to interfere and foment aggression in the country , referring to mass opposition protests against the official election result .
The hardline president , who often rails against the West , said the Islamic Republic wanted “ logic and negotiations ” but that Western powers had insulted the Iranian nation and should apologize .
Iranian leaders often refer to the United States and its allies as the “ global arrogance . ”
“ As soon as the new government is established , with power and authority , ten times more than before , it will enter the global scene and will bring down the global arrogance , ” he told a big crowd in the northeastern city of Mashhad .
“ They should wait as a new wave of revolutionary thinking ... from the Iranian nation is on the way and we will not allow the arrogant ( powers ) to even have one night of good sleep , ” Ahmadinejad said , according to state broadcaster IRIB .
Opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi , Ahmadinejad ’s main challenger in the election , says it was rigged in the incumbent ’s favor .
The authorities reject charges of vote fraud .
Iran has accused Britain and the United States , which have criticised a crackdown on opposition protests , of interfering in its internal affairs .
London and Washington reject the charge .
“ In this recent election the enemy tried to bring the battlefront to the interior of this country , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ But I have told the enemies ... that this nation ... will strike you in the face so hard you will lose your way home , ” he said in comments translated by English - language Press TV .
He also voiced continued defiance in a row over Iran ’s disputed nuclear ambitions , saying major powers “ will not be able to take away the smallest amount of Iran ’s rights . ”
Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful power purposes .
Western countries suspect it is aimed at making bombs .
- The 1st thing im confused with is why does my server hostname change when i change to an Arena map ?
- Next , people respawn on Arena , i think it maybe because of the TF2 Respawn plugin i have in .
- Lastly for Arena do you need to dedicate the server to Arena only in order to really play Arena GameMode correctly .
Because it seems like Arena maps couldnt be in a map rotation .
Speaking in the journal Neuron , Earl Miller , the Picower Professor of Neuroscience at MIT , said : " If the monkey just got a correct answer , a signal lingered in its brain that said , ' You did the right thing . '
Right after a correct answer , neurons processed information more sharply and effectively , and the monkey was more likely to get the next answer correct as well .
hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in
hoverIntent is a plug - in that attempts to determine the user 's intent ... like a crystal ball , only with mouse movement !
It is similar to jQuery 's hover method .
However , instead of calling the handler
In function immediately , hoverIntent waits until the user 's mouse slows down enough before making the call .
Why ?
To delay or prevent the accidental firing of animations or ajax calls .
Simple timeouts work for small areas , but if your target area is large it may execute regardless of intent .
That 's where hoverIntent comes in ...

Gordon Brown and his senior ministers all committed to cutting their personal carbon emissions today as the entire cabinet signed up to the 10:10 climate change campaign .
The cabinet pledge came as the number of individuals who have signed up to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 10 % in 2010 passed the 10,000 mark .
Climate change secretary Ed Miliband , who had already promised to cut his emissions and those of his department , urged his colleagues to join the Guardian - backed campaign at today 's cabinet meeting held on the London Olympics site .
He said : " There was a real sense that this is the right thing to do , and that this has very powerful symbolism , but you 've got to put your policy money where your mouth is .
David Cameron has a wind turbine on his roof but all round the country Tory councils are turning down wind farms . "
The Tory frontbench as well as the Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , have signed up to the campaign which is aimed at increasing pressure on governments to take strong action ahead of December 's crucial summit in Copenhagen .
Last night Franny Armstrong , director of the climate change film Age of Stupid and the 10:10 founder said : " It 's amazing that within 48 hours of the campaign 's launch , the leaderships of the three main political parties have committed to cut their 10 % .
Who said people power was dead ?
These politicians clearly recognise that each person in Britain must start cutting their emissions as part of a national war - effort - scale response to the climate crisis .
But ministers have a responsibility far beyond their individual emissions – they must now introduce the policies to ensure Britain cuts its overall emissions by a similar amount . "
In a case of art imitating life , Peter Capaldi , the actor who plays the Alastair Campbell figure Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It was among several thousand people today who pledged to cut their emissions , joining high profile backers including Delia Smith , Colin Firth , Radio One DJ Sara Cox and Nicholas Stern .
In addition to the 10,000 individuals , more than 400 businesses and organisations including charities , schools and hospitals have so far signed up to cut their carbon footprint in 2010 .
Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said she signed up because 10:10 was a way for Britons to feel more involved in the run-up to the international climate talks in Copenhagen .
" I used to be addicted to my car but even though I have cut back on using it recently , I plan to cut back even more now .
At home I want to replace my light bulbs with energy efficient ones and will be turning down my thermostat by a degree as soon as I get back .
I will also be thinking very hard before booking more than one private international flight a year . "
Health secretary Andy Burnham said : " I 'm signing up to the 10:10 campaign because it gives me a chance to really show I can make a difference on a personal level to tackling climate change .
Everyone who signs up can be part of a big national effort – all of us pulling together to prevent global warming . "
The organisations that have signed up so far range from small charities with a dozen employees to major multinationals with many thousands of people .
The Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Buckinghamshire signed up so it could influence its visitors over the coming year .
In 2010 , the lighting in the museum will be attached to motion and daylight sensors and the heating will be turned down .
" People come here because they 're inspired by Roald Dahl and we'd like to inspire our 50,000 visitors a year to make some changes in their life too , " said director Amelia Foster .
Users of Mozilla 's Firefox web browser may have received an unpleasant surprise when they performed a routine security update for a Microsoft Windows component .
Tens of millions of computers have quietly installed an extra Firefox add - on whether users wanted it or not .
Firefox .NET ClickOnce Addon
The Firefox add - on shipped with a bundle of updates via Microsoft's .
NET Framework Service Pack that was made available to users through the Windows Update Web site .
If a user installs the .NET update , it automatically installs its own ClickOnce Firefox add - on that is both difficult and dangerous to remove once installed .
( Source : washingtonpost.com )
ClickOnce Addon Allows for Dangerous Vulnerability
Annoyances.org noted that the update added to Firefox one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities present in all versions of Internet Explorer : it gives websites the ability to easily and quietly install software on your PC and offers instructions on how to remove it .
Normally , it 's not a problem and you can just uninstall the add - on through Firefox 's add - ons interface .
The problem is , Microsoft has disabled the " uninstall " button on that extension .
The only way to remove the add - on is to modify the Windows Registry , which , if not done correctly , can render your Windows PC inoperable .
Removal instructions are available from Brad Abram 's Microsoft Blog .
Not the First Time
This is n't the first time Microsoft has been found installing unwanted software , making one wonder once again what else Microsoft is installing without a users ' knowledge while providing another excellent example of how not to convince people to trust their security updates .

For the not - yet - homeless , there are two main paths to criminalization  one involving debt , and the other skin color .
Anyone of any color or pre-recession financial status can fall into debt , and although we pride ourselves on the abolition of debtors ’ prison , in at least one state , Texas , people who ca n’t afford to pay their traffic fines may be made to “ sit out their tickets ” in jail .
Often the path to legal trouble begins when one of your creditors has a court issue a summons for you , which you fail to honor for one reason or another .
( Maybe your address has changed or you never received it . )
Now you ’re in contempt of court .
Or suppose you miss a payment and , before you realize it , your car insurance lapses ; then you ’re stopped for something like a broken headlight .
Depending on the state , you may have your car impounded or face a steep fine  again , exposing you to a possible summons .
“ There ’s just no end to it once the cycle starts , ” said Robert Solomon of Yale Law School .
“ It just keeps accelerating . ”
By far the most reliable way to be criminalized by poverty is to have the wrong - color skin .
Indignation runs high when a celebrity professor encounters racial profiling , but for decades whole communities have been effectively “ profiled ” for the suspicious combination of being both dark - skinned and poor , thanks to the “ broken windows ” or “ zero tolerance ” theory of policing popularized by Rudy Giuliani , when he was mayor of New York City , and his police chief William Bratton .
Flick a cigarette in a heavily patrolled community of color and you ’re littering ; wear the wrong color T - shirt and you ’re displaying gang allegiance .
Just strolling around in a dodgy neighborhood can mark you as a potential suspect , according to “ Let ’s Get Free : A Hip - Hop Theory of Justice , ” an eye - opening new book by Paul Butler , a former federal prosecutor in Washington .
If you seem at all evasive , which I suppose is like looking “ overly anxious ” in an airport , Mr. Butler writes , the police “ can force you to stop just to investigate why you do n’t want to talk to them . ”
And do n’t get grumpy about it or you could be “ resisting arrest . ”
There ’s no minimum age for being sucked into what the Children ’s Defense Fund calls “ the cradle - to - prison pipeline . ”
In New York City , a teenager caught in public housing without an ID  say , while visiting a friend or relative  can be charged with criminal trespassing and wind up in juvenile detention , Mishi Faruqee , the director of youth justice programs for the Children ’s Defense Fund of New York , told me .
In just the past few months , a growing number of cities have taken to ticketing and sometimes handcuffing teenagers found on the streets during school hours .
In Los Angeles , the fine for truancy is $ 250 ; in Dallas , it can be as much as $ 500  crushing amounts for people living near the poverty level .
According to the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union , an advocacy group , 12,000 students were ticketed for truancy in 2008 .

Heads of State
Why does the Bus Riders Union care ?
Because it estimates that 80 percent of the “ truants , ” especially those who are black or Latino , are merely late for school , thanks to the way that over - filled buses whiz by them without stopping .
I met people in Los Angeles who told me they keep their children home if there ’s the slightest chance of their being late .
It ’s an ingenious anti-truancy policy that discourages parents from sending their youngsters to school .
Your first plan of action for getting out of credit card debt should be put together a budget , clearly documenting all forms of income and expenditure .
This allows you to visibly see where your money is going so that you can identify areas where you can start to realize savings .
You may also wish to consider ways to make some extra income if there is no overtime available where you work .
The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club lost a battle in court to force police to hand back vests , and other items bearing the bikers ' trademarked logo of a winged skull .
In a ruling released today , Justice Gladys Pardu of the Superior Court of Justice agreed with the Crown that the club's " death head " logo is " offence related property , " which makes it easier for club members to commit crimes .
Lawyers for the international biker club argued that the club owns the items , and has a right to have them returned .
Pardu disagreed , likening the club 's efforts to gain back their vests and jewellery bearing club logo's to efforts by gunmakers to have their weapons returned after the commission of a crime .
" Nor should a landlord be .. able to challenge a finding that a tenant was using .. [ a ] home as a grow - op , " the judge found .
Hells Angels ' lawyer Ryan Naimark had argued in University Avenue court that the items are the property of the California - based motorcycle club , and not the club members from whom they were seized in drug and gangsterism raids .
" My client was not a party to this , " Naimark earlier argued .
Court heard last week from Ricky Ciarniello , a senior club member and president of the Vancouver Hells Angels , who testified that the club does not condone lawbreaking .
The judge noted that three - quarters of club members have criminal records and that Ciarniello could n't cite one instance of a club member being expelled for lawbreaking .
She also noted that the club does n't accept police officers or any former law enforcement officials as members .
It was believed to be the first time in any country that a Hells Angels member has gone to court to argue for return of what the club argues is its property , which was seized during a police operation .
The judge agreed with Federal prosecutor Tom Andreopoulos , who reminded court that Justice John McMahon of Ontario Superior Court ruled last fall and winter in a series of biker trials in Toronto that the outlaw biker organization is a criminal enterprise across Canada .

Andreopoulos noted that the judge commented on " the power of the patch , " and the intimidating effect Hells Angels patches with a grinning winged skull can have on people during the commission of crimes .

There 's a semi-obscure Russian religious text called The Way of The Pilgrim that suggests one can achieve a state of grace by incessantly reciting the Jesus Prayer mentally until it becomes so intrinsic that it automatically repeats itself with every heartbeat .
I thought this was a beautiful , simple and brilliant idea :
It 's like brainwashing your own soul into goodness .
I decided to give the concept a shot myself , but the thing is - I do n't really want to be filled with grace .
Considering my moral character , grace just seems inappropriate .
So instead of the Jesus Prayer , I am incessantly repeating a line fromConan the Barbarian in the hopes that it will ultimately infuse my soul with his warrior spirit .
With every heartbeat , I am going to mentally repeat the barbarian 's answer to the greatest question in existence : " What is best in life ? "
To which Conan answers , " To crush your enemies , see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women . "
***
Even the greatest tales start small ...
I woke up like I usually do : sticky , frustrated and unconsciously suckling at a bottle of Beefeaters like it was the sour teat of some great alcoholic mother - goddess .
I rolled out of bed and , again as usual , cried for 15 minutes out of regret for the previous night 's mistakes .
But eventually I sobered up ( that 's just a turn of phrase , mind you ) and remembered my new goal in life .
I straightened myself with a Sisyphean effort and gazed into the mirror .
" CONAN ! " I bellowed , " WHAT IS BEST IN LIFE ? " " SHUT THE FUCK UP ! " came an unexpected answer from the living room .
I did not recall anybody else in the house offhand ; a typical night often ends with any friends I may have made either fleeing in terror and disgust or , if all goes well , simply under arrest .
This warranted investigation .
" To crush your enemies , see them driven before you , " I continued more softly , padding across the blood - stained carpet of the hallway ( that 's no big deal , by the way , I just like to do my bleeding in the hallway ) , " and to hear the lamentation of their women . "
When I stepped into the living room , I could n't help but notice that Bill Pullman was suspended from my ceiling .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , warned world governments against “ premature exits from monetary and fiscal policies ” despite signs that “ the global economy appears to be emerging at last from the worst economic downturn in our lifetimes . ”
Predicting that the recovery will be “ relatively sluggish ” and unemployment is likely to continue to rise through next year , Mr. Strauss - Kahn said , “ [ P ] olicy makers should err on the side of caution when they decide when to exit from their crisis response policies . ”
After all , he said , global growth has “ turned the corner ” mainly because of what he called “ massive policy support . ”
Mr. Strauss - Kahn made the comments in remarks prepared for delivery in Berlin Friday in the Sixth Annual Bundesbank Lecture .
A prepared text was released in Washington .
The former French finance minister , also said that “ the time is right ” for policymaker to devise exit strategies .
“ Failure to clarify and formulate these plans will risk undermining confidence and the recovery process itself , ” he said .
The IMF is more optimistic about the global economy than it was just a few months ago .
It now expect global growth of slightly less than 3 % in 2010 , Jörg Decressin , an IMF forecaster , said in Washington earlier this week .
That ’s up from the IMF ’s July estimate of 2.5 % .
The IMF chief also said that , despite a consensus that financial regulation and supervision must do better at mitigating systemic risks , “ the reform effort is not proceeding as quickly as is necessary to address the problems raised by the crisis . ”
Among other things , he endorsed proposals for tougher capital requirements for the world ’s banks and said they should be crafted to prevent excessive risk taking .
In addition , Mr. Strauss - Kahn predicted that the world will eventually see alternatives to the dollar rise “ in stature and international usage , ” but predicted change would come “ over the coming decade , rather than the coming months . ”
An idealistic young lawyer working for a Congressional subcommittee in the late 1950s discovers that TV quiz shows are being fixed .

YOU know what we think of WorldNetDaily ( WND ) — see : WorldNetDaily — Worthless Creationist Rag !
The last time we discussed one of their trashy articles was here : WorldNetDaily : A Plea For Theocracy .
Like some mythological monster equipped with a galaxy - sized colon , WND ’s material keeps on flowing — in enormous quantity .
We present to you , dear reader , some excerpts from ‘ Origin of Species ’ edition debunks evolution .
This brilliant article is subtitled : “ Failure of natural selection logic documented in ‘ Nothing Created Everything ’ .
The article is written by Bob Unruh , described as a news editor for WorldNetDaily.com .
The bold font was added by us :
Best - selling Christian author Ray Comfort says there are such huge holes in evolutionary arguments that he ’s giving away 50,000 copies of a special edition of Charles Darwin ’s “ Origin of Species ” that includes an introduction not only revealing the theory ’s many hoaxes but also Darwin ’s own thoughts on the existence of God .
Ah , so today ’s WND article reviews a special edition of “ Origin of Species ” with an introduction by Ray Comfort .
Verily , this is an intellectual milestone .
We have n’t written about Comfort before , but let us say this :
If ignorance had mass , Comfort would be a black hole .
Let ’s read on :
Comfort , whose new book “ Nothing Created Everything ” elaborates on the evidence against the theory of evolution , said he ’s had many conversations with avowed atheists as follows : Comfort : “ So you are an atheist .
Do you then believe that nothing created everything , which is a scientific impossibility ? ”
Atheist : “ No . ” Comfort : “ So you believe that something created everything ? ”
Atheist : “ Yes . ” Comfort : “ Then you ’re not an atheist . ”
Ex-atheist : “ OK . ”
Yes , like Perry Mason , Comfort easily shreds his opponents .
We ca n’t find his latest book at Amazon , but here ’s their listing for another of Comfort ’s many works .
The reviews are most entertaining .
Now , let ’s read some more from WND :
Comfort has dedicated the book to popular contemporary atheist evolutionist Richard Dawkins , who introduced the concept “ Nothing Created Everything ” : “ To Richard Dawkins , in the sincere hope that he looks beyond the hypocrisy of organized religion , before he goes to meet his maker . ”
Dawkins , no doubt , is cowering in fear .
We continue :
“ Darwin was n’t anti-God at all .
In his famous book ‘ Origin of Species ’ Darwin refers to creation as the ‘ works of God ’ and calls Him the ‘ Creator ’ an amazing seven times , ” Comfort said . [… ]
It ’s precisely because of this prevalent ignorance ( or dishonesty ) that we are giving away 50,000 copies of ‘ Origin of Species ’ throughout universities in the United States this November . ”
He ’s doing what ?
Comfort said he discovered the book was in the public domain , so the special edition [ with Comfort ’s introduction ] is being prepared in conjunction with his book “ Nothing Created Everything . ”
Darwin wo n’t be able to survive the comparison !
Moving along :
Comfort said his plan to give away copies of “ Origin of Species ” includes information on scientists such as Albert Einstein , Isaac Newton , Nicholas Copernicus , Francis Bacon and Louis Pasteur who believed God created the universe . [ … ]
Comfort cited the “ rave reviews ” his special edition already is attracting .
The WND article then quotes one of those reviews , and — surprisingly — it ’s not what we ’d classify as favorable :
“ It ’s like a book with multiple personality disorder – two parts that absolutely hate each other ; an intro [ by Comfort ] that is the inane product of one of the most stupid minds of our century , and a science text [ by Darwin ] that is the product of one of the greatest minds of the author ’s century , ” wrote PZ Myers , who teaches at the University of Minnesota at Morris .
About Comfort ’s introduction , WND says :
The introduction points out the fact that humans share 96 percent of their genetic makeup with chimps does n’t make them chimpanzees .
“ According to evolutionist Steven Jones , a renowned British geneticist , ‘ We also share about 50 percent of our DNA with bananas , and that does n’t make us half bananas , ” says Comfort .
Truly a profound insight .
The WND article ends with this :
On his book “ Nothing created Everything , ” Comfort says , “ Anyone who tries to actually justify that nothing created everything has to be insane .
This is a scientific impossibility . ”
No doubt , you want to run right out and buy a copy .

Chart of user complaints about web privacy , showing user control and public display to be the top concerns .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley 's School of Information released a report late Monday ( June 1 ) showing that the most popular Web sites in the United States all share data with their corporate affiliates and allow third parties to collect information directly by using tracking beacons known as " Web bugs " - despite the sites ' claims that they do n't share user data with third parties .
Researchers Joshua Gomez , Travis Pinnick and Ashkan Soltani spent a year analyzing the data collection and data sharing practices of the 50 most visited Web sites .
They were advised by Brian W. Carver , an assistant professor at the Information School .
In their report just posted on a new Web site called " Know Privacy , " the researchers call for significant changes in Internet privacy policies .
First , they recommend that Web site operators and third - party trackers tell users all of the information that has been collected about them and with whom they have shared it .
Second , they recommend that users be allowed to choose whether or not Web sites can share information about them with corporate affiliates .
Additionally , the researchers want Web site privacy policies to be more readable , contradictory Web site statements about third - party sharing eliminated and links set up from Web site privacy policies to the online complaint form for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) .
A key focus of the School of Information report is the use of Web bugs .
Web analytics companies and advertising servers use Web bugs to track users for improved marketing or behavioral profiling .
A Web bugs is typically a small graphic embedded in a Web page , usually in the form of a 1 - by - 1 pixel image that is invisible to the naked eye .
It turns out that a handful of tracking companies operating Web bugs have an incredible breadth of coverage , the researchers said .
For example , five tracking companies were represented on more than half of the top 100 Web sites examined in the study , while Web bugs from Google and its subsidiaries were found on 92 of the top 100 Web sites and 88 percent of the approximately 400,000 unique domains examined in the study .
" Web bugs are ubiquitous , " said Soltani .
During the month of March 2009 , the researchers found at least one Web bug on each of the top 50 Web sites , while most sites had several Web bugs and some had as many as 100 .
Graph of privacy policy contents for 50 most visited sites
Although Internet data - sharing practices are widespread , the problem has yet to generate investigations by government organizations such as the FTC , which continues to rely on industry self - regulation to protect consumer privacy .
Gomez said that is also because the commission has framed online privacy issues in terms of harm , rather than because of consumers ' lack of control over personal information .
An assessment by the researchers of users ' expectations of privacy online showed that they want control over the collection and use of their personal information , and that Web bugs are virtually invisible to consumers and difficult to block .
Analysis and comparison of user complaint data from the FTC and privacy watchdog organizations such as the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , the California Office of Privacy Protection and TRUSTe indicated that 40 percent of users are mostly concerned with a lack of control over data collection and the public display of personal information .
" Third - party tracking and affiliate - sharing are clearly at odds with user expectations , " Pinnick said .
The researchers found that all of the top 50 Web sites do state on those sites that they may share collected data with affiliates .
But , they said most statements are unclear about - or lack any information about - data retention , the purchase of data about users from other sources , or the fate of user data in the event of company acquisition or bankruptcy .
They said Web sites do n't identify the affiliates that they might share information with and added that they got no useful responses when they asked representatives of the Web sites for a list of those companies .
The researchers ' own examination of the publicly - traded companies operating popular Web sites revealed that the Web sites had an average of 297 subsidiaries and a median of 93 .
The researchers ' full report and additional information is online at : www.knowprivacy.org .

When California math and science teachers return to their classrooms this month , they 'll have 10 free online textbooks at their fingertips to help them teach everything from calculus to chemistry .
Each of the books meets the state 's math and science standards , giving California teachers a high - tech , no -cost tool during tough economic times , the governor announced today .
Free was the key word .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger launched the digital textbook initiative in June , arguing the online books could help shave hundreds of millions of dollars from the state 's education budget , an assertion disputed by education officials , who decried a lack of technology in many schools .
The program " gives school districts high - quality , cost - effective options to consider when choosing textbooks for the classroom - not only during these difficult economic times but in the years to come , " the governor said in a statement today .
While many such textbooks have been available online for years , they were never evaluated by the state for content , leaving teachers to question the legitimacy .
The governor asked publishers to submit free digital textbooks for consideration and 16 of 20 books were ultimately reviewed .
Of those , four met all state standards and six came close , according to the California Learning Resource Network , which evaluates all state textbooks .
Because the online books are made available by the publishers for free , they were not required to go through the state 's entire textbook adoption process , which includes a review for discriminatory content or compliance with equal representation standards - making sure not all doctors pictured are men , for example .
" Thus , a textbook 's inclusion in this report does not in any way constitute an endorsement by the state of California , " according to the network 's report released Tuesday .
School districts were advised to conduct their own reviews .
Of the 10 books touted by the governor today , Palo Alto nonprofit the CK - 12 Foundation publishes six .
The organization started two years ago to help reduce expenses associated with textbooks , which can cost up to $ 100 apiece , said president and co-founder Murugan Pal .
Teachers can use the books in a variety of ways , copying only some chapters , projecting pages on a screen during class or having the entire book professionally printed and bound - at a cost of about $ 18 apiece , depending on the quantity .
" It can minimize the cost , " Pal said , adding that the necessary costs related to printing the materials is n't going to go away altogether .
Reading the textbooks online is possible , but it's not the most convenient way to take in the material , and few schools currently have the technology to offer that , with Internet access sketchy and student access to computers limited .
" You have to provide computers to every student , which I 'm for , " said state Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell , after the governor touted the cost - saving possibilities in June .
" If I had that magic wish list , it would be one of my three wishes . "
Untitled / Dust is IMHO one of the most underappreciated demos ever .
Sure , it won
The Party 1993 , but I do n’t think it later got the recognition it deserved .
One reason may be that it was quite difficult to launch it on many machines ( IIRC ) + it required lots of conventional mem ( I was lucky enough to have PC that was compatible with this demo , but it required some config.sys+autoexec.bat wizardry ) .
Not as difficult as with Optic Nerve ( great demo , as well ) , but still ’
It may be not be the best example of flawless design ( to put it mildly ) , but codewise - it ’s amazing .
The opening sequence contains texture mapped , flat shaded 3D world ( 1993 , year after Wolfenstein has been released ) !
The rest may not be as impressive ( still worth watching of course ) , but beginning was truly jaw - dropping at that time .
Some folks did appreciate the effects in this demo , though , as Dust coder - Stone has been later recruited by fellow demosceners from Remedy and became a lead programmer on their little game about cop who had lost a wife .
As they say - the rest is history .

Yep , jawdropping effects in that age .
Do you maybe happen to remember a demo where the end credits were created on a water surface ?
The demo group greets would emerge from under the water and then suddeny disappear creating incredibly realistic ( at the time ) waves .
The water was not done in the 2d convolution matrix way - they behaved much much better .
Maybe with some sort of connected springs , I do n’t really know .
There was a mode where you could play with the water yourself using the mouse .
It was equally impressive , for me at least .

YES !
This and Heartquake were my absolute favorite demos back when i got a rare , used GUS , imported from Germany into the rural Ukraine .
The installation disc contained all important demos up to end of 1994 or so , from which i learned about the scene .
And i am absolutely heartcrushed that my parents threw away my Ultrasound a few months ago .
:/
Since i discovered that , i do n’t talk to them any longer .

WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -- American International Group is preparing to pay millions of dollars more in bonuses to dozens of corporate executives , a source familiar with the development said .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) has been talking with Washington 's newly - appointed compensation czar Kenneth Feinberg about the bonuses , which are due to be paid on July 15 , said the source .
The payments AIG is set to make next week were previously disclosed .
About 40 senior managers were awarded some $ 9 million in performance bonuses for 2008 but payments were to be partly staggered throughout 2009 , and contingent on certain targets related to AIG 's restructuring .
The company is reviewing its compensation plans with Washington as it tries to avoid the national furor set off by $ 165 million in retention bonuses paid to employees of a financial products unit in March .
Much of AIG's $ 99 billion in losses last year stemmed from derivatives written by that unit .
Feinberg was appointed last month to oversee the compensation of top executives at seven firms that have received large federal bailouts .
The firms must convince Feinberg " they have struck the right balance to discourage excessive risk taking and reward performance for their top executives , " Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said in a statement , responding to AIG 's pending bonus payments .
" That process is just beginning now , and Feinberg has begun consulting with those firms about their compensation plans , " the statement said , adding the Treasury will not " provide a running commentary on that process . "
AIG , which declined to comment , has received more than $ 80 billion in federal loans in successive bailouts since its near - collapse last September .
In total , U.S. taxpayer aid of up to $ 180 billion has been extended to the insurer that once claimed global dominance .
AIG is in the midst of reducing liabilities at its financial products unit , and selling or spinning off some of its prized insurance operations in a bid to repay taxpayers .
In total , AIG last year agreed to pay in excess of $ 1 billion in retention payments and performance bonuses to employees across the organization , including to the financial products employees .
Some financial products executives agreed to return their bonuses in full or in part after the payments spurned anger across the nation .
The Chinese have suffered a problem during the launch of the Indonesian Palapa - D communications satellite via a CZ - 3B Chang Zheng - 3B ( CZ3B - 12 ) launch vehicle .
The launch took place at the Xi Chang Satellite Launch Center , in Sichuan Province on Monday at 09:28 UTC , but failed to place the spacecraft in the required orbit – due to an issue with the CZ - 3B ’s third stage .
The Palapa - D satellite was scheduled to replace the Palapa - C2 ( 23864 1996-030A ) satellite – which is due to come to the end of its life in 2011 – at 113.0 degrees East .
It is unknown at this time if the spacecraft can be saved , though this is unlikely .
Latest reports from the Chinese State media – which appeared to undergo a news blackout for several hours after launch – claim the problem is related to a failure of third stage ignition .
The new satellite was ordered to Thales Alenia Space in July 2007 and is based on the Spacebus 4000B3 platform – which has a larger capacity than the Palapa - C2 .
It is equipped with 24 standard C - band , 11 extended C- band and 5 Ku-band transponders , and will cover Indonesia , ASEAN countries , Asia , Middle East and Australia .

Click here to Join L2 Palapa - D has a launch mass of 4,100 kg , a payload power of 6 kW and a service life time of 15 years .
The launch of Palapa - D is – or was as the case may be – part of a commitment drive by the Indonesian communications industry to provide services that include TV broadcasters , VSAT providers and other corporate customers .
The satellite was set to be used to support other services such as cellular communications , fixed voice telecommunications and fixed data services .
The cost for the development and launch of the Palapa - D is between US $ 200 million and US$ 300 million .
China ’s return to their launch manifest – after a four month lull – came via their most powerful vehicle in the fleet , the CZ - 3B Chang Zheng - 3B .
The CZ - 3B features enlarged launch propellant tanks , better computer systems , a larger 4.2 meter diameter payload fairing and the addition of four strap - on boosters in the core stage for additional boost during the first phase of the launch .
The rocket is capable of launching a 11200 kg satellite to a low Earth orbit , or a 5100 kg cargo to a geosynchronous transfer orbit .
The vehicle has a total length of 54.84 meters and a core diameter of 3.35 meters .
The first launch of the CZ - 3B took place on February 14 , 1996 but ended in what is now known has the “ St. Valentine ’s Day Massacre ” .
That failure occurred when the first CZ - 3B stage suffered a problem just two seconds after lift - off , resulting in the vehicle listing heavily off the pad .
With no range safety on board , the vehicle flew almost sideways for around a minute , before nose - diving into a nearby town , killing an untold amount of people .
Recently unearthed raw video ( 30 mb ) of the launch , impact , and the aftermath are available on L2 .
The first successful launch took place on August 19th , 1997 when the second CZ - 3B orbited the Agila - 2 ‘ Mabuhay ’ ( 24901 1997-042A ) communications satellite .
Palapa - Ds launch was the 13th use of the CZ - 3B .
This was the 119th launch for the Chinese , the 118th launch of a Chang Zheng launch vehicle and the 51st orbital launch from the Xi Chang Satellite Launch Centre .
The Xi Chang Satellite Launch Centre is situated in the Sichuan Province , south - western China and is the country ’s prime launch site for geosynchronous orbital launches .
Equipped with two launch pads ( LC2 and LC3 ) , the centre has a dedicated railway and highway lead directly to the launch site .
The Command and Control Centre is located seven kilometers south - west of the launch pad , providing flight and safety control during launch rehearsal and launch .
Other facilities on the Xi Chang Satellite Launch Centre are the Launch Control Centre , propellant fuelling systems , communications systems for launch command , telephone and data communications for users , and support equipment for meteorological monitoring and forecasting .
The first launch from Xi Chang took place at 12:25 UTC on January 29 , 1984 , when the CZ - 3 Chang Zheng - 3 ( CZ3 - 1 ) was launched the Shiyan Weixing ( 14670 1984-008A ) communications satellite into orbit .
Al Giordano passes along a doctored photo in a Honduran paper :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Crystal Lee Sutton with actor Sally Field , who portrayed a fictionalized version of Sutton .
Ironically , she has also become a symbol for the corruption and dysfunction of the American health care system .
In a year - old newspaper interview , Sutton compared insurance company behavior to murder .
She went two months without possible life - saving medications because her insurance would n't cover it , another example of abusing the working poor , she said .
' How in the world can it take so long to find out ( whether they would cover the medicine or not ) when it could be a matter of life or death , ' she said .
' It is almost like , in a way , committing murder . '
At the time , her husband was working two jobs to help take care of her while she battled the cancer .
She did receive the medication eventually , as indicated in the article , but this was apparently a clear case of the insurance company getting between the patient and the doctors .
Working with union organizer Eli Zivkovich , Sutton eventually raised the ire of the factory management after speaking with other workers about unionizing and copying a race - baiting anti-union flyer for Eli .
In a climactic incident she was fired and jailed .
The events resulted in a 1975 book by New York Times Hank Leiferman and the 1979 film .
J.P. Stevens management ultimately signed a contract with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1980 , after the release of the movie .
Sally Field won an Academy Award for her portrayal .
' I said I 've always been different and I would n't have this cancer thing be any other way .
I accept it , ' she said .
' It has to follow my personality . '
Sally Field portrays Crystal Lee Sutton in this still from the motion picture ' Norma Rae . '
Sutton meets former President Bill Clinton in 2008 , with historian Leslie Thompson .
Single payer universal health care or just health insurance reform ?
Not having health insurance will bankrupt you and kill you , but having insurance can bankrupt you and kill you , too .
Rest in peace , Ms. Sutton , and condolences to her survivors .
Arrangements are incomplete with McClure Funeral Home in Graham .
Statement from Family :
Thank you so much for getting the word out about Crystal .
I was able to share the messages with her , and it meant a lot to her and to her family .
She even managed a smile at the H.L. Mencken quote !
She died yesterday about 3:30 , peacefully , with her family there .
The local paper had a front page article this morning , here .
The funeral is tomorrow , the last I heard , at Maclure funeral home in Graham , N.C. , at 2:00 , with visitation prior to the service .
I miss her already .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 11/8/2009 ( 4067 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Flying saucers are so passé .
Fireballs , now they 're hot .
The truth is out there , people .
Whether or not it includes spaceships and aliens is still up for debate , but according to a 20 - year longitudinal study of Canadian UFO reports released Tuesday , nearly 15,000 of us have had reason to suspect we are not alone .
The reasons ranged from thousands of sightings of star - like lights manoeuvring oddly in the night sky , to hundreds of sightings of " fireballs " in the sky , to one where dozens of people saw a huge , lantern - shaped object flying slowly over a lake in the Yukon .
Most of the 8,601 UFO sightings reviewed by Winnipeg - based Ufology Research had two witnesses , involved a white object -- even triangles were much more common than your stereotypical saucer or cigar shape -- and lasted an average of 17 minutes .
And we 're not just talking about folks who just stumbled out of a bar or those who like to wear tin foil hats here : Reports were filed by witnesses with government and military agencies , police , civilian UFO groups and online UFO websites , says the study 's co-author .
And report they did .
The number of UFO sightings has increased from 141 ( in 1989 ) to more than 1,000 per year .
" It 's a persistent phenomena , " says Winnipeg ufologist Chris Rutkowski , who co-authored the study with Geoff Dittman .
" People are witnessing something in the sky .
Whether it 's aliens or not is a matter for further study , but there 's a small but significant percentage ( of sightings ) every year that we simply can't explain . "
Out of those 8,500 - plus UFO cases , only about 14 per cent were labelled as unexplained after review by investigators .
And less than four per cent were classified as " close encounters " -- meaning someone claimed to have seen something ( or some being ) up close .
But Rutkowski , who has degrees in astronomy and education and describes himself as an " open - minded skeptic , " says even if one report proves to be valid , it 'll be a very important scientific discovery .
After the United States Air Force ended its Project Blue Book study of 12,000 UFO cases in 1969 and concluded that UFOs were not a threat to national security , many people assumed the " fad " had passed , he said .
" Here we are 40 years later and not only is the phenomenon not going away , the numbers are increasing .
This is hard scientific data and there is n't a comparable study anywhere , " said Rutkowski , who presented the 20 - year study to UFO researchers , many of whom are scientists , across North America during the recent Mutual UFO Network in Dallas , Texas .
" But we 're no closer to the truth , in some ways . "
Rutkowski currently receives around six UFO reports each week .
The most recent and noteworthy , he says , came last Friday from six people who reported seeing a large orange light moving along the shoreline of Dauphin Lake , 15 kilometres east of Dauphin .
" It stopped and then moved away from them .
They said it ' moved at a speed we 've never seen a plane move at , ' and there was no sound at all , " Rutkowski recalled .

The conservative obsession with ACORN has occasionally seemed excessive , but this video and this video are genuinely shocking .
Just because Bill O'Reilly targets someone - it does n't mean they do n't deserve it .
Conor Friedersdorf gives Andrew Breitbart his due for the scoop at Breitbart 's new blog , Big Government :
I ’ll phrase this in what I take to be the way that would maximize Mr. Breitbart ’s satisfaction .
Imagine if he ’d appeared on the Sean Hannity show and said the following :
ACORN is n’t just unfit for taxpayer funds it is an organization so lax in its oversight that what goes on at some of its field offices would shock the conscience of any moral American .
If a pimp and a prostitute walked into the Baltimore ACORN office , the employees would n’t just overlook their illegal profession .
They ’d openly help them to commit tax fraud , to conceal the smuggling of underage illegal immigrants from El Salvador to work as teen prostitutes , and to launder the money from that kiddie brothel into a political campaign .
I ’d have mocked Mr. Breitbart if he ’d made those claims .
Others would ’ve too .
In this case , however , we 'd have been wrong !

India is conscious of the Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region and is taking " adequate measures " to make sure that its neighbourhood is not threatened , Minister of State for Defence MM Pallam Raju on Thursday said .
" China being a regional power will make its moves and if we sense a threat to our internal security we will do some counter measures , " he told reporters here on the sidelines of homeland security seminar .
However , " we need to give China the benefit of doubt that they are also in their quest to safeguard their sea lanes of communication because they have their energy resources passing through this ( Indian Ocean ) .
" They are taking some steps .
We have to make sure that that it is not intrusive and they will not come into our space .
Towards that end we are conscious of what China is doing and we are making adequate measures to make sure that our neighbourhood is not threatened , " Raju said .
On Beijing acquiring anti-satellite capabilities for space - age warfare , he said India was against militarisation of space .
But space assets would have to be utilised in warfare in the years to come and India was also preparing itself for taking adequate counter measures to this Chinese capability , he said .
" The frontier of space , which includes utilisation of satellites , will continue to be a growing area of warfare .
India has stated in the past that it is against militarisation of space .
But space assets have to be utilised in warfare in the years to come and we are also preparing for it to take adequate counter measures , " Raju said .
He also pointed out to the growing trade between the two Asian giants and said China would not be a problem because of economic factors .
" The emphasis and focus is on ( bilateral ) trade , which is increasing at a rapid rate .
Although we share a large border , we have not had any skirmishes .
So I do not see any reason why they should be a problem on that front .
As a regional power , they will take steps to increase their military prowess and we will do in our case , " he said .
On the nearly USD 140 - million US military aid to Pakistan , with which Islamabad may acquire Predator drones used by NATO forces in Afghanistan against Taliban , Raju said when technology was being used for countering Taliban forces , there was a chance it may fall into wrong hands .
" I am sure they will take adequate steps to prevent
this , " he added .
The minister also warned about the danger of nuclear , biological and chemical ( NBC ) weapons falling into the hands of terrorists who have become more sophisticated and complex .
" In the future , there is the potential of terrorists acquiring advanced technology including NBC weapons and communication equipment .
We may even see insurgents armed with nuclear devices or biological and chemical weapons , capable of massive destruction in localised areas .
After the horrific attacks on Mumbai last November , we have taken up the challenge to modernise and upgrade our security forces in a comprehensive manner .
India should take precaution against the NBC threats , " Raju said .
" We have to be prepared for any eventuality and NBC warfare is something for which we are also preparing for , " he said .
He said the terrorists ' objectives were becoming more ambitious with the intention of inflicting maximum damage .
" Therefore , the task ahead is formidable . "
The Minister said the nation faced threats to its internal security from abroad , while confronting militants in 160 districts across eastern and southern parts of the country .
He said paramilitary forces were being further strengthened and modernised .
Internet social platforms and chat programs appeared to have unified Uighurs in anger over the way Chinese officials had handled the earlier brawl , which took place in late June thousands of miles away in Shaoguan , Guangdong Province .
There ,
Han workers rampaged through a Uighur dormitory , killing at least two Uighurs and injuring many others , according to the state news agency , Xinhua .
Police officers later arrested a resentful former factory worker who had ignited the fight by spreading a rumor that six Uighur men had raped two Han women at the site , Xinhua reported .

But photographs that appeared online after the battle showed people standing around a pile of corpses , leading many Uighurs to believe that the government was playing down the number of dead Uighurs .
One Uighur student said the photographs began showing up on many Web sites about one week ago .
Government censors repeatedly tried to delete them , but to no avail , he said .
“ Uighurs posted it again and again in order to let more people know the truth , because how painful is it that the government does bald - faced injustice to Uighur people ? ” said the student , who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the government .
A call for protests spread on Web sites and QQ , the most popular instant - messaging program in China , despite government efforts to block online discussion of the feud .
By Tuesday morning , more than 36 hours after the start of the protest , the police had detained more than 1,400 suspects , according to Xinhua .
More than 200 shops and 14 homes had been destroyed in Urumqi , and 261 motor vehicles , mostly buses , had been burned , Xinhua reported , citing Liu Yaohua , the regional police chief .
Police officers operated checkpoints on roads throughout Xinjiang on Monday .
People at major hotels said they had no Internet access .
Most people in the city could not use cellphones .

To the Editor :
Those who are opposed to having a government - as - single - payer , health - care - for - all system ought to have a conversation with themselves , focusing on some self - impact issues .
They should ask themselves :
Why do I believe the headlines that banks are stabilizing , but refuse to believe the headlines that this country will continue to shed jobs , and that new waves of foreclosures are in progress ?
Can I guarantee that I will have my job , with health benefits , one year from now , or even one or two weeks from now ?
Can I guarantee the same for my spouse or partner , or my children and grandchildren ?
If I am a business owner , can I guarantee that I will have ongoing or additional customers ?
Do I delude myself into believing that if I become unemployed , I will always be able to " find something , " i.e. , pumping gas , to provide for myself and my family ?
Do I really believe that if one catastrophic or horrific event has already happened to me or my family , I am immune from another one forevermore ?
Do I refuse to believe that there is an ongoing waste of money by insurance companies and lobbyists , or that my co-pays will not go up ?
Am I aware that many health policies carry specific benefit payout limits ?
Do I know those limits for each ailment , accident or incident , or each person covered ?
Is my nest egg safe and sizable enough to handle over - the - limit costs ?
If I do n't mind that uninsured neighbors or strangers might die needlessly , do I mind if they are contagious and could possibly infect me because of their inability to secure timely , necessary medical attention ?
Am I fluent in " legalese " — the deceptive , fine - tuned jargon that fills the massive brochures for my health insurance , which I do n't have the time to read and understand ?
Am I confident that policy loopholes wo n't come back and bite me when I most need and expect coverage ?
With a return of talk about tort and medical malpractice reform , might I be able to lobby instead for justice system reforms that target for jail and disbarment the lawyers who unscrupulously write loophole - filled , Swiss cheese policies for their own undeserved financial gain , and the gain of insurance company executives and board members ?
Finally , how big and secure is my own support system ?
And why am I allowing my country to be called " uncivilized " because it is one of the only developed nations to not care about health care justice for all ?

What 's really behind NOM 's anti-civil habit
by Jeremy Hooper
The National Organization For Marriage is all about their supposed " broad - based coalition . "
But when you listen to its Catholic leaders Maggie Gallagher and Brian Brown speak within their own Holy See- focused forums , you really start to hear what is truly motivating their beliefs .
And after some time , you will totally understand why NOM - affiliated attorney Charles LiMandri would describe the organization as being " predominantly Catholic . "
Like , for instance , take this 2008 appearance from " Catholic Answers Live " ( please : ba dum dum : ) .
In it , Madame Gallagher " explains " how it 's not just gay sex and same - sex marriages that will get a good Catholic in " sinful " trouble , but how simply " trying to change the public understanding " on same - sex marriage is enough to anger God. Listen in to Mags ' confessional :
( click to play audio clip )
* Source : Catholic Answers Live -- 6/30/08
Now , Maggie and Brian have every rite right to hold on to their strong faith .
We could not have more support for their religious freedom .
Truly .
But the simple fact is that when someone has beliefs life this , there is no way they can speak objectively on the subject of civil marriage equality .
Maggie can go on national media all she wants , pretending that her concerns are sweeping and go well beyond faith .
But the views express in this audio are the true motivation .
She and Brian are fulfilling what they see as their duties as good Catholics , not what they should see as their duties as citizens within a church - state separated that is based in constitutional rather than canonical law !
It is pretty clear that their rosaries are what brought Maggie and Brian to this fight .
As they work day and night to alter the civil landscape for people of all faith views ( including none at all ) , it 's time the stop hiding their true motivation behind a veil .
They need to own their motivation , the same way we unabashedly own our commitment to what we perceive as constitutional fairness .
Framing their opposition as civil might bring them more mass appeal .
But it 's obvious that the appeal of Mass is the real reason why they give a damn about our ring fingers .
* UPDATE : We 've just learned that Maggie is speaking tonight in Scarborough , Maine , to a " private meeting for Catholic clergy . " this engagement came at the request of Maine 's Bishop Malone : Maggie & ME [ G - A - Y ]
Your thoughts
Being a catholic ( now non-practicing due to the likes of Maggie and Brian and the current Teutonic head of the catholic church ) it was always my experience that those who " preached " the loudest ( hell fire and damnation ) were the same people who were " bushel " from those to whom they preached .
Again " Judge not lest ye be judged . "
Think of the judgment they 'll get for the way they judge the people in the world who do n't agree with everything they say - - oh my , oh my !!!!

I thought this would have been more obvious given how repetitive they are with their talking points , especially during interviews .
When you lie , you fall back on rote sayings and it becomes harder to embellish on the go .
This has been Gallagher and Brown 's standard procedure for months ( i.e. , uniting the great halves of humanity , their three examples of discrimination , and so on ) .
If they actually went into their real reasons , the morality issue , you 'd see a bit more substance to their answers , a better elaboration .
Sadly , they 'd lose all middle - ground supporters the moment they became honest .

Kinda makes me wonder how much money the Catholic Church is channeling into their coffers ?
Posted by : Julie M. | Sep 4 , 2009 10:49:32 AM
Devon gets it !
NOM uses the same talking points over and over .
It 's standard Catholic doctrine .
If you tell a lie enough times it becomes the truth .

Good points .
Since in Maine we know ~ 1/2 money from Mormons and ~ 1/2 from Catholic church ... ( and they are getting blasted for that because they are closing churches and decreasing help for the poor . )
WELL ...
Here is a new NOM STORM AD .... well , I doublt it will be produced , but it would be a goodie h/t DKos .

President Obama is slowly putting Iran in a box .
His cancellation of the useless and expensive so - called “ missile shield ” program in eastern Europe , which had needlessly antagonized Russia , has been rewarded with greater Russian cooperativeness on Iran .
The US right wing accused Obama of a failure of nerve .
But in fact his move was shrewd and gutsy , since he predisposed Russia to increased cooperation with the US in regard to Iran ’s nuclear research program .
Obama ’s full court press for a United Nations Security Council resolution on nuclear disarmament also pulled the rug out from under Iran ’s previous grandstanding tactics , whereby it accused the US and its allies of only wanting nuclear dominance , not the abolition of nukes .
Obama chaired the UN Security Council at the summit level on Thursday , and managed to get through an important resolution on nuclear disarmament .
United Nations Television has video :
The BBC notes that there are increasing fears that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is breaking down .
It was originally pitched as a bargain between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world , such that the countries with nukes would gradually get rid of them , while sharing expertise in nuclear energy - generation , while the other countries would agree not to acquire them .
Israel was the first non-European country to refuse to sign and then to go on to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970s , with French and British help .
Last week , the International Atomic Energy Agency censured Israel for its estimated 200 warheads , acquiescing in a resolution introduced by Arab states .
The vote was another sign , in the wake of the damning Goldstone report on Israeli atrocities in Gaza , that the international community is fast losing patience with unilateral Israeli policies .
In the 1990s , India and Pakistan got the bomb ( India had done some low - yield test as early as the 1970s ) .
More recently , North Korea has .
Many countries have or seek what is called the “ Japan option . ”
It is generally thought that Japan could construct a nuclear weapon very rapidly if it felt threatened enough .
This emergency capacity is also thought to be sought by Iran , which denies that it currently has a weapons research program .
Russian President Dmitri Medvedov signalled on Thursday that his country could eventually support further UNSC sanctions on Iran if Tehran declines to be more transparent about its nuclear research program with the IAEA .
His position appeared more open to increased sanctions than that expressed recently by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who is widely regarded as the de facto ruler of the Russian Federation .
Russia Today has video :
Medvedev ’s flexibility comes in the wake of the Obama administration ’s cancellation of plans for missile shield installations in eastern Europe .
Although both countries deny that there is any quid pro quo , it seems obvious that Obama ’s good will gesture has yielded positive results in Moscow with regard to Iran policy .
Washington ’s earlier push at the United Nations against the Iranian nuclear research program foundered when Iran charged hypocrisy on the part of the nuclear powers and insisted that its program is solely peaceful ( an allegation that as far as US intelligence can tell is probably true ) .
Obama ’s stress on new nuclear disarmament agreements is in part intended to blunt any further Iranian diplomatic campaign and to put Iran in the position of looking obstreperous if it is not forthcoming in the upcoming negotiations with the 5 permanent UNSC members plus Germany .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown took a hard line position , urging further US sanction , according to ITN :
Brown erred in charging Iran with having a nuclear weapons program , which US intelligence can find no evidence for .
But because it is using centrifuge technology that is open - ended and could be suitable for dual use , Western leaders such as Brown are suspicious that the program has weapons implications down the road .
China disagreed with Brown ’s stance , and is opposed to further sanctions on Iran .
But China has a doctrine of “ Harmonious Development , ” which prescribes that it stays out of the way of the other great powers and avoid political adventurism while it grows its economy .
The Chinese might well be susceptible to US and UK pressure to move against Iran if the outcome of the forthcoming 5 + 1 talks is disappointing .
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu ’s appearance at the UN was decried by Israeli liberals as clownish .
He seemed to take Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s bait by trying to offer documentary proof of the Holocaust ( the event is not in doubt and does n’t need to be proven ) and then by referring to little Hamas in Gaza ( pop. 1.5 mn . ) as Nazis .
Is n’t there a rule that if you make an analogy to the Nazis in your argument , you automatically lose ?
And since Israel declined to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , has a couple hundred warheads , and has occasionally brandished them against other countries , Netanyahu altogether lacks credibility as a critic of Iran ’s peaceful civilian nuclear research program .
Andrew Butters at at Time magazine explores the issue of whether making the Middle East a nuclear - free zone , as some have suggested , is a realistic goal .
He concludes that it is more realistic than might be at first assumed .

AT THE press of a button , the double doors sweep open .
Welcome to the office in downtown Manhattan of Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive of Goldman Sachs .
A couple of years ago , such smooth gadgetry would have seemed a fitting symbol of the power of Wall Street .
These days it stirs more sinister thoughts : of a screen villain rather than a hero of high finance .
As it happens , it is rumoured that an institution not unlike Goldman will appear unflatteringly in Oliver Stone 's sequel to “ Wall Street ” , due in cinemas next spring .
Economists continue to debate the ultimate causes of the collapse of Lehman Brothers , Wall Street 's fourth - biggest firm , a year ago on September 15th , and of the havoc that followed .
The public and most politicians , however , are clear : the blame lies with bankers , venal and incompetent in equal measure .
“ It 's like pre-Thatcher Britain out there , ” sighs the head of a New York bank .
At a hearing in February a congressman addressed JPMorgan Chase 's boss , Jamie Dimon , as “ Mr Demon ” .
Deliberate or not , it captured the mood .
The name - calling may have died down a bit lately , but the Street will struggle to regain its swagger .
Reforms proposed by Barack Obama 's administration would , if passed , introduce an array of penalties for bigness and boldness .
Regulators , too , are determined to clip finance 's wings , even musing about reducing the “ swollen ” financial industry to a more acceptable size ( see Buttonwood ) , a sentiment echoed by self - flagellating bankers .
This week the arch - capitalist Mr Blankfein chastised Wall Street for letting “ the growth and complexity in new instruments outstrip their economic and social utility ” .
Reducing banks ' leverage and their leeway to splash out on star traders will be a priority at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh this month .
The politicians are driven in part by populist urges and in part by a genuine wish to avoid a repeat of the week in which global finance suffered a near - fatal heart attack .
In the space of two days Merrill Lynch fell into the arms of Bank of America ( BofA ) , Lehman went bust and American International Group ( AIG ) , a mighty insurer , buckled under suicidal derivatives bets and had to be bailed out .
Lehman 's demise marked the onset of the worst financial crisis and global recession since the 1930s .
To be sure , the seeds of trouble had been sown years earlier , with the relaxation of lending standards in mortgages , corporate buy - outs and much more , and with the enthusiasm for using borrowed money to enhance returns .
The debts of American financial firms rose steadily from 39 % to 111 % of GDP in the 20 years to 2008 .
But many of the subsequent policy choices — not least the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Programme — stemmed from Lehman 's demise .
Some believe there would have been less pain had Lehman been bailed out .
Others think it was coming anyway ( see Economics focus ) .
Either way , the episode shattered market expectations that large firms would not be allowed to fail — a few months before , the stricken Bear Stearns , New York 's fifth - biggest investment bank , had been forcibly married to JPMorgan .
With no one sure who could be trusted , lending froze , most abruptly in short - term markets , such as that for commercial paper , that many had come to rely on to support long - term assets .
Such was the panic that the government was forced to backstop supposedly rock - solid money - market funds .
By October the large , free - standing investment bank , the pride of Wall Street little more than a year earlier , was extinct .
Among the most important decisions was that no other big financial firm would be allowed to suffer Lehman 's fate .
The consequences were too frightening .
This approach extended to the stress tests for 19 “ systemically important ” institutions , completed in May .
Those found wanting were promised capital from taxpayers if they could not tap private sources .
The aftershocks of September 2008 are still being felt , not least by the firms at the centre of it .
Although chunks of Lehman were sold quickly to Barclays of Britain and Nomura of Japan , tens of billions of dollars of clients ' cash , much of it belonging to hedge funds , is still trapped in the world 's biggest bankruptcy .
AIG is part way through a tortuous dismemberment .
America 's financial - services industry has shed record numbers of jobs as firms have failed , been sold or retrenched ( see chart 1 ) .
Life has become less gilded for those still at their desks : Wall Street bonuses fell by 44 % last year ( chart 2 ) .
For the first time in living memory , investment bankers are having to pinch pennies : taxi firms in Bedford , a wealthy New York suburb , say business at local railway stations has evaporated because Wall Street commuters are walking , cycling or being picked up by their spouses instead .
Hence the relief at recent signs of stabilisation .
Stockmarkets have rebounded .
Investors have regained their appetite for junk - rated debt : the amount issued hit a two - year high in the week to August 14th .
The interest rate at which banks lend to each other has fallen back to near pre-crisis levels .
Large - scale bank nationalisation is off the table .
Though hundreds of smaller banks face extinction , big banks have thickened their buffers against loss by raising common equity .
The healthiest have repaid public capital ( at a profit to taxpayers ) .
Confidence is growing among discerning investors : hedge funds , the bane of wobbling banks last year , have lately been buying their shares , not shorting them .
Fuelling this optimism is a partial revival of capital markets .
Overall activity remains muted , private securitisation markets all but shut .
But trading and underwriting have picked up as capital - and credit - hungry firms tap into the thawed market — though volume has fallen since July ( see chart 3 ) .
Survivors prepared to take risks have done very well from trading in currencies , commodities and so forth as clients adjust their portfolios to new market realities , such as higher volatility .
Bill Winters , co-head of JPMorgan 's investment bank , calls it “ the most profitable period ever for continuing operations ” .
Banks have begun adding staff in hot areas , notably commodities .
Some are even offering guaranteed bonuses , believed only months ago to have vanished with the go - go years .
These trading profits look unsustainable .
Indeed , dealers ' spreads are already coming down as shell - shocked rivals recover their poise .
Moreover , the financial system continues to be underpinned by federal programmes .
Issuance of securities backed by consumer assets , such as car loans , has come back from the dead , to roughly $ 100 billion since March , but only thanks to a financing facility run by the Federal Reserve .
“ I still think in terms of parachutes rather than green shoots , ” says Rodgin Cohen , chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell , a law firm .
This support means that the minting of money this year in banking 's top tier — the latest quarter was Goldman 's most profitable ever — leaves a bad taste .
“ Wartime profiteering , ” harrumphs an industry consultant .
Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard economist and an authority on financial crises , argues that Wall Street 's resurgence merely reflects a temporary arbitrage : systemically important banks can make big profits taking big risks with cheaply borrowed funds , thanks to the taxpayer 's “ invisible wallet ” in the form of guarantees , while the authorities turn a blind eye .
Some may even be gambling for salvation .
The banks that lost most , such as Merrill and Royal Bank of Scotland , have been offering the keenest terms in several areas , such as leveraged lending and rights issues , say rivals .
This jostling for custom is benefiting some clients .
BofA Merrill Lynch , Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse recently agreed to delay part of their fees for initial public offerings by two property trusts .
The balance will be payable only if the trusts make a minimum return on equity for a set period .
Swallow and hope
One threat the big names face is from boutiques and others looking to capitalise on the turmoil .
Merger and restructuring shops have been hiring , touting their independence and freedom from regulatory interference .
KKR , a private - equity firm , is expanding its capital - markets unit and has begun underwriting share offerings , starting with firms in its own portfolio .
Private - equity groups should also benefit from the planned easing of restrictions on their ownership of banks .
Several former rainmakers and star analysts have set up broker - dealers .
There is a big vacuum to fill , argues John Costas , a former UBS bigwig who has just co-founded PrinceRidge , a boutique focused on debt markets .
Some $ 15 trillion of financing capacity has been taken out as banks have shrunk balance - sheets and the “ shadow ” network of non -bank credit has crumbled , he estimates .
Demand has fallen too , but not by that much .
The newcomers could yet struggle .
Far from ceding ground , the big banks have grown even bigger , aided by government - brokered mergers .
Rules have been bent or broken : JPMorgan breached the 10 % market - share ceiling for deposits when it took over Washington Mutual , for instance .
According to Inside Mortgage Finance , a newsletter , nearly half of American mortgages made in the first half of the year came from Wells Fargo , which took over Wachovia , or BofA , which swallowed Countrywide .
Increased concentration is vexing for regulators .
Because systemically important firms can borrow more cheaply thanks to implicit state backing , small and medium - sized banks struggle to compete .
A recent Fed study put big banks ' funding advantage at more than 30 basis points .
That leads to another possible problem : indiscipline .
Private firms with a low cost of funds and the taxpayer behind them are prone to recklessness : just look at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
America 's leading banks were too big to fail before the crisis .
Now they are bigger still .
On closer inspection , however , the giants are taking divergent paths .
In one camp are those at the top of Wall Street 's new pecking order , Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan .
With them are other “ flow monsters ” — firms with a big share of high - volume markets , such as currencies , fixed income and equities — including Barclays and Credit Suisse .
Like others , these giants have been forced to reduce their leverage , but they see a future that is not so different from the past .
Goldman has been boldest , taking record amounts of risk last quarter — though mostly for client trades , not its own book , it insists .
Mr Blankfein believes his firm will be able to continue making markets , financing deals and co-investing with clients .
“ Being both a principal and an agent is mutually reinforcing , ” he says .
Perhaps , but these days making a fortune can be as invidious as losing one .
Goldman 's bumper profits and earmarking of $ 11.4 billion for staff in the first half of 2009 — not a record , but close — have turned the media as well as the mob against it .
Illustration by Ian Whadcock
The firm 's chutzpah has not helped .
It declared that it could have survived without federal assistance , and that it did not need the taxpayers ' cash it received as a derivatives counterparty of AIG because its positions were hedged .
Goldman has been put on the back foot by a spate of negative stories , including one that compared it to a vampire squid .
( These creatures , which grow to only six inches , are “ small and harmless rather than carnivorous , ” says an exasperated Mr Blankfein . )
Keen to deflect criticism , Mr Blankfein this week attacked some of the industry 's pay practices and accounting shenanigans , even calling for a ban on multi- year guarantees , which Goldman insists it does not offer .
Goldman 's arch-rival , Morgan Stanley , takes a markedly different view of Wall Street 's future .
Having ramped up its risk - taking in the boom — John Mack made higher leverage an explicit goal after becoming its boss in 2005 — Morgan Stanley has spent the past year scuttling in the opposite direction .
The firm has hired traders in some areas to take advantage of the rally after the dramatic cutbacks of last year , but it now sees its future primarily in conventional “ agency ” businesses that require relatively little capital , picking up fees for arranging mergers , underwriting securities offerings and broking — to which end it bought a controlling stake in Smith Barney from Citigroup .
Citigroup , too , is returning to its roots .
Forced by regulators to shrink after losing tens of billions on collateralised - debt obligations , it is well on the way to shedding 40 % of its assets .
The new , more modest model , centred on things like retail banking and managing companies ' cash , is essentially the Citicorp that existed before its mammoth merger with Travelers in 1998 , with a few exceptions , says Vikram Pandit , Citigroup 's boss .
This renewed focus on old - fashioned finance is spreading .
Consulting firms say they have seen a surge of interest from banks keen to sharpen their service in everything from retail banking to prime brokerage ( the financing of trading by hedge funds ) .
Bob Gach , head of the capital - markets practice at Accenture , a consultancy , knows of several that have set aside $ 400 m or more to improve their technology links with customers .
“ Relationships are back , ” he says .
Investment banks are also throwing more resources into merger and restructuring advice , neglected by some during the boom as “ a mere pimple on the donkey 's arse ” , as one veteran puts it , but now seen as a core source of revenue — with limited downside .
Much of this comes in anticipation of new rules designed to curb bankers ' wilder instincts .
With Congress fixated on health care , the fate of the Obama administration 's sweeping financial reforms remains unclear .
Banks are in anxious limbo , awaiting the fine print on the treatment of securitised mortgages , credit - default swaps and more .
But no one doubts that changes are coming .
The most dramatic is likely to be a toughening of capital - adequacy standards , endorsed recently by G20 finance ministers and a group of central bankers and supervisors that oversees the Basel capital rules ( see article ) .
The new rules could be ready for adoption by the end of next year .
The Basel Committee has already proposed higher capital charges for complex trading and exotic securitisations .
Capital will also be the method of choice to rein in firms big enough to rock the system .
American officials are reluctant to go nuclear and break them up , not least because the task of splitting them into pieces small enough to pose no danger would be horribly messy .
Instead banks will probably face a sliding scale , with minimum capital ratios rising as they get bigger or embrace more risk .
They will also be expected to prepare “ living wills ” , setting out how they could be liquidated in the event of failure .
“ There 's a real risk we end up so laden with capital that we can't waddle and fart at the same time , ” says a Wall Street grandee .
Scrutiny from supervisors , increased after Lehman , will remain heavy .
Goldman Sachs has no fewer than 40 Fed staffers breathing down the necks of its traders and risk - modellers .
Supervisors may have a valuable role in dealing with excessive pay , too .
Britain 's Financial Services
Authority may have watered down its pay code after bankers whinged about losing talent , but it has been using moral suasion to good effect , calling bosses to express its displeasure at the re-emergence of guaranteed bonuses .
“ Only the very bravest ignore a call like that , ” says JPMorgan 's Mr Winters .
Supervisors , boards and shareholders ( who are finally getting a say on pay in America ) are likely to have a more beneficial impact on pay practices than rules crafted by politicians , who tend not to think the consequences through .
When Congress increased the tax on bonuses earlier this year , banks predictably began raising fixed salaries to compensate .
The compromise on pay reached by the G20 is more measured , but mostly proposes things big banks are already doing , such as paying more restricted stock and clawing back bonuses if performance slumps .
Elsewhere too , re-regulation may have regrettable unintended results .
The push to standardise over - the - counter derivatives contracts , for instance , could , if taken too far , leave investors trying to hedge specific risks with blunt instruments , making the system less safe , rather than more .
The eventual size and shape of a re-regulated , rethought Wall Street is hard to predict .
The industry has always been a bit like a balloon : squeeze it in one place and it expands in another .
Sure enough , banks are making the most of today 's conditions : Credit Suisse , for instance , is structuring mortgage securities that are unrated by credit - rating agencies ; it and others have begun securitising life - insurance policies that the old and infirm sell for cash .
Not - so - great expectations
However , the days when finance accounted for 40 % of corporate America 's profits are over .
Mr Winters thinks investment banks ' average return on equity will settle at a hardly dazzling 10 - 12 % ( though the best firms will do much better than that ) .
At leverage of 15 times equity — the reduced level at which investment banks now typically operate — large parts of the fixed - income business fail to cover their cost of capital , reckons Brad Hintz , an analyst with Alliance Bernstein .
Rising interest rates will provide further drag — and probably ensure that credit grows more slowly than the economy for some years .
“ Everyone was running downhill for 15 years , ” says Michael Poulos of Oliver Wyman , a consultancy .
“ Now we 'll see who the real athletes are . ”

My generation and the rest of the American population has been rather cowardly when it comes to defending our liberties .
Not that we have not had plenty volunteer for military service , because we have .
Our cowardice has been in not standing up to our own government 's weakness , deceit , and manipulation .
You see , we have now endured several " wars " which have been pathetic , at best .
Not the actions of our soldiers , but the actions of our government and the inaction of our citizens .
Most recently , by my count , we have been " at war " for nearly a decade .
But honestly , we are not a nation " at war " .
We are not doing without .
We are not stopping our lives to band together , uniting against a common enemy foreign or domestic , fighting to win at all costs , while demanding that our soldiers and citizens be kept out of harm 's way unless absolutely necessary .
What have we sacrificed to get the ugly job done , whatever the goal is ?
Where is the sugar rationing ?
Where is the rubber shortage ?
Where is the shortage of workers when all available men have gone off to do difficult but necessary tasks ?
There is no Rosie the Riveter here .
Instead , we are told to keep showing up at our cubicles each weekday , and at the malls on weekends .
Keep shopping .
Keep refinancing our mortgages .
And keep watching the war on TV .
We are a rich nation of 300 million people , and we cannot win and end a war ?
We cannot catch , imprison , or kill our enemy once and for all ?
We can not be done with ugly , tragic , and expensive actions and get on with being a kinder , gentler nation ?
If we were truly " at war " , we could achieve this end in 1 day .
What a ridiculous scam .
And we fell for it , voted for it , sat by and watched it happen .
We lined up like patriotic lemmings with flags on our lapels and allowed groups of privileged men to orchestrate a never - ending series of wars , while most of them NEVER went to war , let alone served their country in uniform .
We allowed them to repeatedly install , train , and fund villains that we trembled in fear of , like the boogie man under our bed .
Red enemies , yellow enemies , and now anyone tan or with a turban on .
I am not a veteran , so I cannot speak as if I am any better than other non-veterans .
But how ironic , that when these ChickenHawks had the opportunity to actually BE in one of those wars they so eagerly send our sons and daughters off to die in , they " had other priorities . "
Someone aspiring to be Commander - In - Chief chose to serve 4 years of a 6 year enlistment in a stateside National Guard unit , and somehow took a few years leave after that .
Second in command claimed marriage as his out .
One received seven deferments by teaching business school .
Another used his religion 's " study abroad " requirement to escape service .
Yet another dodged the draft by enrolling in college acting classes .
One had a terrible knee , but somehow was able to keep playing in the NFL for 8 more seasons .
The cream of this crop had a cyst on his bottom that prevented him from heroic duty .
And there are hundreds more .
As detestable as this is to me , I must say I am even more ashamed of our apathy in not defending our own soldiers and citizens from harm .
We sit idly by and allow paper warriors to wrap themselves in our sacred flag , shouting out like bullhorns and rattling the sabers of vengeance .
We send soldiers into " wars " without enough armor , no clear and definable goal , and no national courage to actually use our might to bring the war to a quick and absolute end .
We give up some liberties for our common security , only to allow it to be used to snoop on political enemies .
Elderly widows are frisked at the airport to show how serious we are about " homeland security " , while the majority of cargo luggage , out of public view , skates through unexamined .
We buy the sham , and keep buying those luxury goods and services .
Oh , how the mighty have fallen .
Those who stand up and call the charlatans to the carpet are questioned as unpatriotic .
Why is that ?
Why is it that the folks fighting AGAINST wars and the folks FIGHTING wars are divided ?
Why are those who protest wars , and those with loved ones carelessly tossed to the dogs of war , are shouting at each other from opposite sides of the street ?
Why are they not on the same side , there is plenty of room on that curb .
We could use a few more radicals at Support The Troops rallies , and a few more moms of soldiers at war protests .
Why do we so easily succumb to the " divide and conquer " wedges of class , race , and religion ?
Our voluntary duping , apathy , and lemming - like acquiescence to this manipulation is something I have not done my part to rail against , either .
I have been too busy consuming , getting , living it up .
Certainly not sacrificing .
It is embarrassing .
Shameful .
For that , Greatest Generation and all American veterans , you have my sincere apology .
I should have been protecting and looking out for you the way you have protected me .
I am relieved that my father and his father are not alive to see this dereliction of civic duty and sorry state of affairs .
I am just sorry we did not wait until the rest of The Greatest Generation had passed on , before falling so short of their example .
First they came for the communists , and I did not speak out -- because I was not a communist ; Then they came for the socialists , and I did not speak out -- because I was not a socialist ; Then they came for the trade unionists , and I did not speak out -- because I was not a trade unionist ; Then they came for the Jews , and I did not speak out -- because I was not a Jew ; Then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak out for me . - Martin Niemoeller , 1946
Rough seas caused by Hurricane Bill prevented this tiny week - old trio baby Loggerhead Sea Turtles from safely trekking to the ocean from their nest .

The four - stroke engine has dominated internal combustion for more than a century , but a British engineering firm is ready to topple that technology with what it calls a 150 - horsepower " five - stroke " engine said to offer the fuel economy of a diesel without the particulate emissions .
Ilmor Engineering , a firm that is co-owned by Roger Penske and supplies Honda engines to the Indy Racing League , spent almost 20 years developing the three - cylinder engine .
Two cylinders operate on the conventional four - stroke cycle and empty their exhaust into a third low - pressure expansion cylinder , which allows the expansion and compression processes to operate independently .
The prototype engine was first displayed at the 2009 Stuttgart Engine Expo , and its being readied for real - world , under - the - hood testing .
The Otto cycle four - stroke engine has pretty much been the standard for 132 years , but the five - stroke engine might be a great stopgap between current technology and the Next Big Thing .
According to Ilmor , the 0.7 - liter engine is capable of 150 brake horsepower and weighs 20 percent less than engines with a similar output .
Brake specific fuel consumption of the prototype is 226 g/ kWh , which is a 10 percent improvement over current four - stroke technology .
Even better , Ilmor says the technology is " 100 % conventional " and does n't require any new manufacturing techniques .
Ilmor says that the prototype five - stroke engine , based on a design by Gerhard Schmitz , has an overall expansion ratio " approaching that of a diesel engine – in the region of 14.5:1 . "
Along with its light weight and relatively high output , the extra work done in the low pressure ( LP ) cylinder provides for better fuel economy .
" Running of the concept engine has produced impressive fuel consumption readings over a very wide operating range , " the company said in a statement .
" This is because at the onset of knock a greater percentage of work can be extracted in the LP cylinder , giving a degree of self compensation . "
Ilmor says the prototype is ready for road testing and could be used as a conventional engine or as part of a hybrid drivetrain .
The company says it is " keen " to find a partner to help develop the engine and it is talking to automakers and top suppliers about the technology .

Hamid Dabashi at CNN points out that the US executive ’s ( the Obama administration ’s ) plans to engage Iran may come up against Congress ’s desire to act aggressively toward the country , either through crippling sanctions or covert operations .
A recent congressional hearing on Iran chaired by Howard Berman stacked the decks in favor of the Neoconservatives , 4 to 2 ( with discredited outfits such as the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the American Enterprise Institute , which were big players in bringing us the Iraq War and are key components of the Israel lobbies ) .
Why were the real Iran experts , such as Gary Sick and others prevented from testifying ?
Why is it that the ideological points of view were so narrow ?
It should be admitted that the Obama administration itself may be considering attempting to choke off Iranian gasoline imports .
Iran presumably would respond by building a couple refineries , which it probably needs to do anyway .
But it takes 5 years and billions of dollars to build a refinery .
As Press TV notes , however , the scheme would need Russian and Chinese cooperation , which is a little unlikely to be forthcoming .
Robert Naiman at the Huffington Post reviews all the reasons for which the idea of blockading Iranian gasoline imports is a stupid one .
Dabashi makes the excellent point that the sort of severe sanctions being dreamed up for Iran by the hawks in Congress resemble what was done to Iraq .
Sanctions on Iraq just weakened civil society and cast down the country to fourth world status , killing some 500,000 innocent infants and toddlers , while signally failing to remove the regime .
In fact , destroying civil society has the effect of bolstering the state , especially when it is an oil state .
Saddam Hussein ’s regime under sanctions stashed away tens of billions of dollars from smuggling , and established and implemented massive domestic surveillance , to the point that weeks after the fall of Baghdad , I remember seeing Iraqis being interviewed by American television correspondents asking them if they were happy Saddam was gone , and the Iraqis were too afraid to say anything ( they kept looking over their shoulders . )
What they knew and the clueless Americans did not was that the Fidai Saddam ( those who sacrifice themselves for Saddam ) paramilitary was still around , watching , and ready to assassinate open collaborators .
That public fear , which persisted like a phantom limb even after the fall of the Baath , was instilled during the UN / US sanctions regime .
So no , Congress , you and the Neocon think tanks cannot overthrow the government in Iran with economic sanctions .
Let me just add to Naiman ’s list of Reasons for Which this is Another Brain - Dead Neocon Idea .
You may have noticed that just last week , and despite Iran ’s political crisis , Russia and Iran conducted joint naval exercises in the Caspian Sea .
You really think Russia is going to vote at the UN for crippling sanctions on Iran ?
What would happen to the value of Russian ( and Chinese ) investments in Iran ?
Even a US ally such as the UK , which is seeing depletion of the North Sea fields , is increasingly interested in Iran as a source of natural gas .
In part , this interest derives from a desire to avoid being hostage to Russia .
Draconian sanctions on Iran would have the effect of actually strengthening Russia ’s near - monopoly position with regard to supplying natural gas to Western Europe .
Moreover , the Iranians can play spoiler for the US withdrawal from Iraq , both in the Shiite south and in Kurdistan .
They helped rein in Muqtada al - Sadr , they can unleash the special groups of the Mahdi Army .
As the US military draws down over the next year , it becomes more and more vulnerable in Iraq .
Moreover , Iran has plenty of clients in Afghanistan and can make lots of trouble for US and NATO troops there .
Obama could go into the 2012 election season with two quagmires on his hands if he provokes Iran too much .
And , Shiite - dominated Iraq would not go along with a gasoline embargo on Iran .
In fact , Iraqis would line up to smuggle gasoline into their neighbor , both on economic and ideological grounds .
And Venezuela among other potential exporters would not cooperate .
Since gasoline is easily transported and transformed into cash ( what the economists call ‘ fungible ’ ) , a gasoline embargo would be among the more difficult policies to implement that you could imagine , especially if much of the world is against it .
As Naiman notes , if the US Navy stopped third parties from delivering gasoline to Iran , that would be an act of war in international law .
We ’ve got two or three too many wars going on as it is .
The Neoconservatives , as with any cult , work by gradually drawing their victims into an unrealistic world view with assertions that in their own right seem reasonable .
The regime in Tehran is horrible .
It would do the Iranians themselves a favor to get rid of it .
It is vulnerable on gasoline imports .
The regime is a threat to world peace ( even though it has not launched any wars of aggression ) , just Because It Is .
It is trying to get nukes ( even though all the evidence points to the opposite conclusion ) .
There is therefore a window within which the West must move .
Now , now , strike now !
And then the victims drink the cool - aid .
But in fact , the Iranian opposition inside the country universally opposes forceful Western intervention in Iran .
The regime is not militarily aggressive .
It does n’t have any near - term capacity to produce nukes .
There is no crisis , and what problems exist cannot be resolved militarily .
The Neoconservatives promised Bush that the route to peace in Israel / Palestine lay through Baghdad .
They promised him inexpensive gasoline .
They promised him spreading democracy .
In fact , they were in part responsible for the killing over 4,000 American soldiers and the maiming of over 30,000 , the killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , the displacing of 4 million of them , and they helped provoke two civil wars .
Make no mistake .
They would gladly do exactly the same thing to Iran .
Because Neoconservatives , whether Christian or Jewish , whether Bolton or Rubin or Clawson , are sociopaths who lack the basic ability to empathize with people not exactly like themselves , and who exalt instrumental goals over basic human welfare .
Of course Bush did not need any pretty promises to impel him to launch desperate adventures .
As the Arab Times reported , a bewildered French President Jacques Chirac told a journalist in a book published this spring that Bush had tried to enlist him in the Iraq invasion one last time in February , 2003 , by emphasizing that the threat of Gog and Magog had gathered in the Middle East against the West and only overthrowing Saddam would forestall a catastrophe of biblical proportions .
( See also Clive Hamilton , and James Haught , and Jacques Sterchi .
Chirac called a Swiss theologian to have him explain what this Gog and Magog was whereof Bush spoke .
Chirac complained that the problem with people in the Bush administration was that none of them knew anything about the really existing Arabs .
Chirac reads Arabic , and he used to ask the Bush people he dealt with to name one Arab poet .
None could .
France has been directly involved in the Arab world since Bonaparte invaded Egypt in 1798 , so French political leaders could only lament the earnest evangelical nonsense spewed by crazies who had taken over Washington .
A lot of the crazies who insist on stealing Palestinian land and resources in the West Bank also depend on weird interpretations of Bible verses .
Our world is being poisoned by irrationality in the service of narrow self - interest .
With regard to the 2003 Iraq invasion , Chirac expected a quick US victory , then a vacuum of which al - Qaeda would take advantage in Iraq .
That is , he expected Bush ’s Iraq War , fought ostensibly as a part of the ‘ war on terror , ’ to produce exactly the opposite result of the one sought .
So too would aggressive US action against Iran , including any attempt at a gasoline boycott .

‘ We have to take a stand against skunk ’
Psychotherapist and author Julie Lynn Evans is on the
front line of a war against skunk – the powerful strain of cannabis which , she says , risks turning today ’s teenage users into psychotic wrecks
Psychotherapist Julie Lynn Evans has seen at first hand what skunk can do to vulnerable teenagers
The voice on the end of the phone did n’t sound panic - stricken , but the more Julie Lynn Evans listened , the more it was obvious that the caller ’s needs were exceptional and urgent .
As one of the UK ’s foremost psychotherapists , Lynn Evans had no immediate gaps in her diary , but could , she explained , visit one evening .
Novelist Julie Myerson fuelled the debate when she wrote about her son Jake 's addiction to skunk
And so it was that she found herself sitting in
the South London home of the now notorious Myerson family .
For three hours that night , she assimilated the details of a private family crisis with which we have
all become familiar : Jake Myerson had been a straight - A student destined for Oxbridge ; skunk addiction had made him menacing , unmanageable and morally erratic .
His parents , novelist Julie Myerson and her playwright and journalist husband Jonathan , had endured his stealing , violence and chaos for three years before issuing their ‘ tough love ’ ultimatum : give up skunk or be barred from the family home .
It came as no surprise to Lynn Evans , who has spent 20 years working with troubled adolescents , that Jake had opted for the latter .
When she thinks back to that night , Lynn Evans ’s enduring memories are of the Myersons ’ fear , guilt and desperation .
Julie ’s articulate voice on the phone had masked her true state of mind .
‘ She was a mother on the edge – exhausted and broken .
She wanted me to see if I could bring Jake back and get him into rehab . ’
Lynn Evans could n’t promise either of those things .
‘ But I was able to confirm their reality – that Jake was n’t inherently bad , but that he ’d been caught in the grip of a vicious drug .
' Skunk had turned him into someone for whom nothing and no one were sacrosanct .
That is what it does – it is one of the most distorting drugs I have ever come across . ’
Psychotherapists do not normally talk openly about the conversations they have with their clients , but Julie Myerson ’s decision to write about Jake ’s drug abuse in her book The Lost Child has meant their case is far from normal .
And Lynn Evans , too , is a controversial figure .
Four years ago , she sparked an outcry when she said she would rather her children smoked heroin than skunk .
Back then , it seemed a reckless remark ; today you could argue it was remarkably prescient .
‘ Skunk is one of the most distorting drugs I have come across ’
‘ Obviously , I do n’t want my children smoking heroin either , ’ she explains , ‘ but my point was that while you can be cured of heroin addiction , the psychosis and schizophrenia caused by skunk may be permanent .
You can undo the damage , as long as you have n’t hit psychosis .
' That is why we have to take a stand against this drug – before it is too late .
I have several clients who will be on antipsychotic medication for the rest of their lives .
For them , there is no way back . ’
Lynn Evans , 52 , is a divorced mother - of - three – Lucy , 22 , Sam , 20 , and Harry , 18 – who began her working life as an A - level history teacher .
She discovered early on that she was good at handling ‘ naughty children ’ , probably , she admits , because she is something of a maverick and mischief - maker herself .
At 30 , shortly after having Lucy , she decided to retrain as a therapist and found herself drawn again to wayward teenagers .
Her work with families – she practises in a large shed in the garden of her West London home – has embraced a range of issues , from separation and divorce ( she has just written a book on the subject , called What About the Children ? ) , to anorexia , self - harming , binge - drinking and , inevitably , drugs .
It was through her children , rather than clients , that she first became aware , around eight years ago , that something new and sinister was happening .
‘ Lucy had some friends to stay , ’ she recalls , ‘ and the following morning I found one of them huddled in my shed , looking completely deranged .
Her skin was a greeny - grey colour , she had huge , dark rings under her eyes and she was n’t making any sense .
' I woke up everyone in the house and demanded to know what had been going on .
They told me she had been smoking weed – but I could tell that whatever she had had was much more dangerous than hash as I understand it . ’
Lynn Evans handed the girl , who was 15 , over to
her parents and advised them to seek expert help .
( The girl subsequently had therapy and made a complete recovery . )
In the ensuing months , several teenagers exhibiting similar symptoms appeared in her consulting room , having been frogmarched there by their parents .
‘ One had dropped out of university after developing full schizophrenia , another had a psychotic episode at 15 , another was hearing voices .
' I had five cases in quick succession – children
who had become paranoid , violent and uncontrollable after smoking what they thought was cannabis but was quite clearly something far more powerful . ’
Lynn Evans had no evidence to back up her intuition .
‘ I was seeing at first hand the result of what was happening out there , but it is only later that science
catches up .’
Within the past couple of years , data has come in thick and fast .
According to a recent report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists , more than 80 per cent of those being treated for their first episode of psychosis had used skunk .
In 2007 , The Lancet reported that cannabis users are 40 per cent more likely to develop psychotic illnesses than non-users .
In the past five years , the number of people needing emergency treatment for cannabis misuse has doubled .
Although these reports use the umbrella term ‘ cannabis ’ , the reality is that 80 per cent of cannabis seized in Britain today is skunk – which experts regard as a more dangerous substance .
The reason for this is a seismic shift in cannabis production .
Until the late 1990s , the cannabis market was dominated by resin smuggled in mainly from Morocco .
But tighter border controls led to dealers cultivating cannabis in the UK instead .
They picked up on a trend first developed in California , of crossing two varieties of cannabis .
The new hybrid was nicknamed skunk because of its distinctive , pungent smell .
The dealers farmed indoors using intensive horticultural techniques .
One consequence of this was an increase in potency .
The degree of ‘ high ’ a user gets from cannabis depends upon a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
Five years ago , the THC levels in skunk were thought to be 20 times stronger than the old imported cannabis .
Scientists have now discovered that British - grown skunk has only slightly raised levels of THC but much lower levels of another chemical called cannabidiol ( CBD ) .
‘ The crucial thing about CBD is that it has anti-psychotic properties – it counteracts some of the effects of THC , ’ says Lynn Evans .
‘ The fact that it has been drastically reduced explains why we are seeing such a devastating fallout from skunk use . ’
In the past five years , Lynn Evans has treated , on average , five teen clients a year – boys and girls in equal numbers – who have been caught up in the skunk phenomenon .
They range in age from 12 to 20 .
‘ Very few young people beyond 20 would touch skunk , ’ she says .
‘ By that age , they know where to get other stuff if they want it and skunk is deeply uncool .
But 12- , 13 - and 14 - year - olds do n’t know any better .
Kids want to smoke dope ; they take what is on the streets , and at the moment that is skunk . ’
No parent should underestimate the power of peer pressure .
Lynn Evans tells me about the craze for ‘ hotboxing ’ .
‘ They crowd into a room , tape up every crevice so there is no ventilation , then lie down together , smoke skunk and inhale the vapours .
It ’s naughty , they are home alone , and they do it for the thrill of getting away with it . ’
Ask Lynn Evans to define the traits of a skunk user and she talks of ‘ children who are vulnerable ’ .
Many have experienced some form of trauma or live with uncertainty .
‘ Children who have been abandoned or gone through the stress of their parents ’ divorce , or who have witnessed tension and fighting at home and for whom the world is an edgy place , might like skunk because it numbs those edgy feelings . ’
There is another significant factor among her skunk - using clientele .
‘ Four children I have worked with who have full - blown psychosis had learning difficulties – dyslexia , dyspraxia or mild Asperger ’s syndrome – which probably made them feel uncomfortable and emotionally vulnerable at school .
It will also have left them exhausted because children with learning difficulties have to work three times as hard as other children .
They see skunk as an escape valve – a way of getting some rest . ’
None of this explains why Jake Myerson started using skunk , and Lynn Evans cannot provide the answer because , although she has remained in contact with his parents , she has never met him .
‘ And if I had , it would have been confidential , ’ she says .
What she can say is that Jake ’s behaviour was typical of an out - of - control skunk user .
The reason she went to the Myersons ’ that night , rather than have them come to her , was because his parents had hoped to persuade Jake to meet Lynn Evans and accept some help .
In denial , he refused .
That denial is , Lynn Evans confirms , part of the skunk syndrome .
‘ They feel untouchable .
They have no sense of consequences .
Their behaviour is entirely destructive .
That is the stamp of this drug and it is why I hate it so much . ’
One criticism of the Myersons has been that they took too relaxed an attitude to their son ’s dope habit .
But , Lynn Evans points out , ‘ They did n’t know what they were dealing with .
Even three years ago , no one was saying skunk was a complete no - no . ’
Lynn Evans shares the laid - back attitude of many of today ’s parents who themselves dabbled with cannabis in the 1970s .
‘ I would legalise normal dope tomorrow .
I do n’t think it is any worse than white wine .
It does n’t frighten me , but skunk does .
To me , they are two completely different substances . ’
It is , she says , a catastrophe that cannabis was downgraded from class B to class C in 2004 , just as skunk was becoming widespread .
The government recently upgraded it to class B again .
‘ I do n’t blame the government – they did n’t know what was happening on the streets .
' But now they should be thinking about how skunk can be distinguished from cannabis , and until some answers can be found for cannabis regulation I ’d like skunk categorised as a class A substance . ’
‘ Skunk users feel untouchable .
They have no sense of consequences ’
Our interview is interrupted several times as Lynn Evans fields calls about a 17 - year - old client who has spent a week in a detox treatment centre and is threatening to leave .
‘ His father died when he was ten , his mother has lost control , and I am telling her she must practise tough love otherwise he will be straight back on the streets and smoking skunk , ’ she says .
‘ It is an incredibly difficult thing for any parent to do .
' But if I had a child who was keeping the family awake at night , lashing out , disturbing the neighbours , refusing to go to school and taking my other children down with him , I would do exactly the same . ’
Maybe the toughest element of tough love is accepting that there is no guarantee that it will bring the skunk user to his senses .
‘ For teenagers who think they are invincible , it can be part of the adventure , especially if parents are paying their rent and sending them food parcels .
They live in squats or bedsits and escape the pressure of school and exams . ’
Lynn Evans has several clients for whom tough love was a bit of a lark .
Today they have full - blown psychosis .
‘ They are on antipsychotic medication , which numbs their senses .
They do n’t have sexual relationships because they are not capable of them .
They have no job and I ’m really there now to hand - hold because there is nothing more I can do . ’
Jake Myerson is clearly a long way from that point .
‘ He ’s bright , good - looking , charming and his brain is still intact , ’ says Lynn Evans .
‘ And now he ’s a cult hero to dope users .
I hope he gives up skunk before he does real damage to his head . ’

In what was possibly the most surreal , horrific , and unimaginable thing I have ever witnessed in my life , 1200 Riot Police and Military Personal rabidly attacked a group of well under 300 American citizens , many of them just students that were unaware there was even a protest going on .
They then expanded their perimeter and shut large areas of Oakland down .
This is how my last experience at the G20 in Pittsburgh went down , out of control authorities mercilessly attacking an unarmed crowd with batons , tear gas , pepper spray , sound weapons , and rubber bullets .
Around 10 pm on Friday night , long after the vast majority of dignitaries and protesters had left , it became evident that the outrageous show of force by the Military and Police was not enough to stave off their thirst for blood .
When I first arrived on the scene Luke Rudowski of We Are Change and a small group of protesters were peaceably assembling among a much larger number of college students just out for another weekend of fun in Schenley Plaza .
Around ten minutes later Rob Dew arrived and we began filming the entire scene , it was evident that the number of police already in the area and the amount who were massing and surrounding the perimeter was extremely alarming .
[ efoods ]
As Luke bull horned that the people in this park meant the police no physical harm , and that they were simply exercising their right to free speech , a couple of masked individuals began to scream “ He does n’t speak for us ” .
These few provocateurs and well meaning idiots could have been easily dealt with by a handful of regular police officers dressed in their standard uniform , however that solution does not offer the pretext for over a thousand heavily armed psychotics to encircle and engage the American people .
I began to become extremely frightened as to what the outcome of the situation was going to be as I began to witness LRAD weapons showing up , dogs beginning to circle the perimeter , and then everyone putting on their gas masks .
During all of this I was threatened with arrest three times and physically charged and chased by one of the officers .
At that point I realized they were about to attack , and they did .
Hundreds of armed to the teeth trained professionals began their march towards innocent young men and women , and then took it much further by launching tear gas canisters , battening people trying to leave , and firing rubber bullets randomly into the crowd .
Luckily I was able to slip through the cracks of a blockade of only 6 or so riot thugs as they tried to amass more in that area and form another brutal line .
I personally witnessed a young man on a bike being beaten for no reason whatsoever and as he fled the officers then beat his bike .
When the young man tried to retrieve his bike his knuckle was broken .
Another man was gassed so badly he had to be taken to the hospital .
This is how “ Peace Officers ” treat us ?
During the very quick first burst of the madness I lost touch with Infowars Producer and Cameraman Rob Dew , I immediately thought he had been arrested , and I was correct .
He was illegally detained and digitally fingerprinted in a separate process for “ protesters ” .
Rob was cuffed all evening in a room full of other detainees , and was not released until 10:20 am the next morning with no charges being brought against him .
Military and Police mocked them as Americans were being detained and processed often laughing at college students that had been beaten for no other reason for being in the wrong place around their campus that evening .
Luke Rudowski received multiple battens to his back and legs as the jackals descended on him with force , even though he had made it clear to all of them he wished them no violence .
For his peaceful efforts Luke and Lee from We Are Change were separated from the rest of the more than one hundred detainees and sent to State Prison .
Luke was strip searched , mocked , and charged with Disorderly Conduct and Unlawful Assembly , and will have to go back to Pittsburgh Wednesday to face charges .
The Military and Police laughed as they took note of the “ Superstar ” that had been all over the news on channel 11 and even National NBC , taking a sick pleasure in the torture of another human being .

When most of us talk digital cameras , we talk megapixels , ISO , image noise , shot - per - second speed and image processing .
We 're tech geeks .
But really , none of that stuff matters as much as your camera 's lens .
Advertisement
The lens is , after all , your camera 's eyeball — the image sensor or film can only record what comes in through the lens .
It 's what defines the picture 's perspective , clarity and way more .
Advertisement
Lenses are actually a really complicated thing to talk about — if your job was to steer photons through tunnels of stretched glass , people would call you complicated too — so we 're gonna try to keep it to field basics , you should know to get around , rather than dive into the crazy physics and mathematical ratios and stuff .
Lens Terminology
Before we get into the basic lens types , you should know the two major numbers you 're looking at you when you talk about lenses : Focal length and aperture .
Advertisement
Focal length is the distance between the optical center of the lens and the point where it focuses the light coming into the lens ( when a shot is in focus , that 's the image sensor or film ) .
The diagram above , from Cambridge In Colour shows , very simply , what focal length refers to , and how it affects your pitchas .
Here 's another pretty excellent , easy to understand explanation , with pictures showing the results of using different focal lengths on the same shot .
Practically , what you need to know is that focal length measured in millimeters , and that 's where you get , say , an 18 - 55 mm lens , a 400 mm telephoto or a 28 - 560 mm lens found in a super - zoom camera .
( You probably know this , but when you see " 20 x zoom lens , " the spec refers to the ratio of the longest focal length to the shortest — so 560 divided by 28 . )
Basically , the longer the focal length , the more magnified or " zoomed in " your photo can be .
Advertisement
Aperture is the other major spec on a lens , and something you deal with most on DSLRS .
The aperture is the hole that actually lets the light into the camera , and you make can make it bigger or smaller .
The size of the hole is expressed in terms of F - stops , or as you might see a lot F / 2.8 or F2.8 or F8 or F11 or whatever .
Advertisement
The bigger the F number , the smaller the aperture , or hole .
The smaller the number , the bigger the hole , which means the more light it lets in .
The reason that 's good is that means you can shoot with a faster shutter speed , so you do n't get blurry photos , or when you 're shooting in low light , since more light can get through , which means you 're not forced to choose between shooting dark , blurry things or excessively grainy photos as you crank up the ISO ( light sensitivity ) to compensate for the lack of light .
So , when someone 's talking about a " fast " lens , they 're talking about one with a big aperture , like F / 1.8 — easy to remember , you can shoot with faster shutter speeds with less light .
Advertisement
With a big aperture , you also have a shallower depth of field — subjects in focus are sharp , but everything around it is soft and blurry .
A tighter aperture ( higher F - stop number ) lets you focus more at once , as you can see in the diagram above combined from Wikipedia .
There 's more on depth of field here .
Overall , we 're staying on the easy - to - swallow side , but if you 've really got a hankering for F - stop knowledge , here 's a crazy detailed explanation .
Lens Types
Having fun yet ?
There are a few basic types of lenses , and of course , a whole bunch of specialized ones beyond that , like macro or tilt lenses .
But here are the basics .
Advertisement
A normal lens is one with a perspective that looks a lot the perspective of the human eye .
With a 35 mm or full - frame camera , that 's about a 50 mm lens , though it varies depending on the size of the film or image sensor .
For instance , this 35 mm Nikon lens is for their DX cameras , DX meaning it has a sensor that 's not " full " ( equal to 35 mm film ) .
When that lens is attached to a DX camera , it 's the equivalent to a 50 mm lens on a full - frame camera — making it normal .

A wide - angle lens is , most basically , one with a focal length that 's way shorter than a normal lens ( which , again , varies depending on the size of the film or sensor ) .
Wide angles are useful for take wide shots — - panoramas , or just trying to squeeze a huge group of people in a single picture without being 10 light years away .
You can also do neato distortion tricks — a fisheye is just a crazy kind of wide - angle lens .
Example Image : Ekilby / Flickr

A telephoto lens is one with a really long focal length ( like 400 mm ) .
Since they 're designed like telescopes , they are physically more compact than their focal lengths , but they can still get pretty damn massive .
They 're good for shooting stuff far , far away .
Example Image Shiny

A prime lens is just one with a fixed focal length — you can't zoom in or out — and typically they produce sharper pictures than all - but - the - priciest zoom lenses .
Any of the above lens types can be prime lenses , or zoom , below .
This fisheye is a prime lens .
A zoom lens is one you can adjust the focal length on — zoom in and out — so you can shoot a variety of stuff with a single lens .
The aperture tends to vary based on the focal length , unless you get a really pricey zoom lens that 's also " fast . "

Lens Brands and Compatibility
But , even looking at one company at a time , lenses are complicated and sticky .
Take Canon , for instance .
They 've got a million different kinds of lens mounts ( where the camera and lens fit together ) for their single - lens reflex cameras , depending on how far back in time you go .
Currently they 've got two major kinds of lens mounts : EF ( electro - focus because the focusing motor action is built into the lens ) and and EF - S .
The latter is for their entry - level to mid-range DSLRs only , because it 's made for their smaller ( not full - frame , i.e. , not 35 mm equivalent ) image sensors .
Standard EF lenses will work on cameras with an EF - S mount , but EF - S lenses wo n't work on cameras with a regular EF mount .
And before that , there was the FD mount , which totally does n't work on DSLRs without an adapter .
Nikon is n't quite as bad as here — they 've had the same F - mount for over 40 years , so all their lenses with physically fit on the camera , but with their DSLRs , you 've gotta watch out for their FX lenses ( full - frame lenses like for the D700 ) vs. their DX lenses ( like Canon , meant for their cameras with smaller APS - C sensors ) .
When used on full - frame cameras , DX lenses will block out the corners of the picture since they 're supposed to cover a smaller image area .
But overall , with Nikon you have the advantage of being able to use older lenses in a way you can't with Canon gear .
Ken Rockwell has a comprehensive tome about Nikon lenses and types for more .

The High Cost of Optics

Okay , great .
Here 's a real question :
Why are lenses so goddamned expensive ?
Well , as Steve Heiner , Nikon SLR - division technical marketing manager , told us , " You 're paying for materials and the process of creating the lens , " which , as you might guess , improves image quality .
Faster apertures — which require larger glass elements in pro zoom lenses — heavier materials like metal , for durability , and touches like a nano - crystal coating that minimizes reflections for low - light shooting are things that make lenses cost hundreds or thousands or dollars .
As a rep from Canon told us , there 's no real getting cheaper over time , like most other mechanical components .
Precision optical glass just does n't work that way .
Materials are also what separate crummy lenses from good ones , which is why cheap lenses in cellphones suck — they 've gotta be cheap , really tiny and really light and well , you can't change physics — and why even cheap DSLR lenses are n't as good as expensive - as - hell ones .
Update : Daniel pointed out this pretty excellent video showing how lenses are made , which shines more light on why they 're so damn pricey :
At the same time , there is a lot of progress in lens tech happening — look at all the ultra wide - angle lenses popping up in point - and - shoots now .
Canon says that 's cause you 've got smaller image sensors ( which as we noted above , changes the relation of the focal length ) , more aspherical lens elements ( which are cheaper to make ) , a new kind of ultra high refractive index aspherical optical glass ( uhhhh , do n't ask me ) and the miniaturization of mechanical parts like AF motors .

There 's a lot we had to leave out , like chromatic aberration and lens flare , but we hope we gave you a pretty good starting point to learn about lenses .

Let ’s begin with a brief Q&A with America .
Q : Let ’s say you ’re sick with a potentially deadly disease .
Who do you want for a doctor ?
A : The smartest , most experienced and highly qualified expert in the field .
Q : You ’re looking to invest your life savings .
Who do you trust to handle your money ?
A : The brightest , most agile financial mind I can find .
Q : You ’ve been selected to participate in a “ private citizens in space ” program .
Who do you want in charge of building the rocket ?
A : The most brilliant and reliable engineers in the nation .
So far , so good .
One more .
Q : You live in a time of unimaginable complexity and danger .
Who do want to be the leader of the free world ?
A : Somebody I can have a beer with .
You know , a regular guy , a Joe Sixpack .
It ’s said that people tend to get the leaders they deserve , and I ca n’t imagine better proof than the United States .
At present we ’re watching as a new president attempts to arm - tackle an array of national political and economic crises of evil supervillain jailbreak proportions , and at this early stage it ’s far from clear that he ’s Rushmore - bound .
He may or may not get health care reform passed , and if he does it may or may not be as comprehensive as the programs pursued by previous arch - progressives Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower .
He may or may not bog us down in a vastly expanded quagmire in Afghanistan , although at present only an idiot would bet on him meeting his campaign promises regarding getting the heck out of Iraq .
He may or may not decide to honor the pledges he made to the gay community .
He may or may not spearhead a green revolution that saves the species from itself .
And his economic policies may boost us to new , unprecedented levels of universal prosperity .
Or they may plummet us nards - first into a meat grinder of a global recession so epic it will make the Great Depression look like a weekend in the Hamptons .
So the jury is still out on Mr. Obama .
But …
While past performance is no guarantee of future results , there ’s also that thing about those who do n’t understand history being doomed to repeat it .
And America ’s history of electing dolts , buffoons , scoundrels , knaves , low - jackers , pig- fuckers , gomers , dog- whistlers , Kloset Klansmen , recidivists and sheep pimps to the Highest Elected Office in the Land does not make one optimistic about the prospects for Barackapalooza .
I ’d love to be wrong , but let ’s be honest .
An indicator that can pick a loser 100 % of the time is every bit as valuable to the shrewd investor as one that always picks the winner , and the Electoral College is as reliable a Finger of Doom as the world has ever seen .
Let ’s review , shall we ?
George W. Bush : Worst president ever ?
Dumbest president ever ?
Hard to say for certain , although put me down for “ hell , yes . ”
The nation apparently elected a string of semi-housebroken wombats in the 1800s , and contemporary polling feels obliged , in the name of “ balance , ” to humor the estimations of conservative “ scholars ” who rate him the sixth - best ever .
For my money , that opinion alone is sufficient for the credentialing institution to revoke the PhD , but such is the price we pay for the privilege of living in an society that not only tolerates fools gladly , it gives them television shows .
Bill Clinton :
In so many ways , Clinton was the archetypal president of our age .
He was the distilled , undiluted essence of the modern political animal .
He was like everything in Washington , only moreso .
And I do n’t mean that in the good way .
Bubba may not be the man who invented the Republican wing of the Democratic Party , but he was damned sure the one who established it as the only wing that mattered .
The irony , of course , was that he was reviled by the GOP .
I ’ve always wondered if the source of that rage was that Clinton was a better Republican than they were .
In addition , he cheapened the office at every turn : whether renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to the highest bidder , pardoning Marc Rich or “ hiking the Appalachian Trail ” like mink freebasing Viagra , it seemed as though his every action left us feeling the need for a shower .
From the poor house to the penthouse to the whore house , we ’ve never seen anything like him .
God willing , we never will again .
George HW Bush :
It ’s still hard to fathom how this mealy - mouthed little wimp stumbled into the White House .
All the Democrats had to do in 1988 was find a candidate with a pulse .
Instead , they trotted out Mike Dukakis , a man with all the charisma and passion of an accountant on a phenobarbital drip .
Bush the Elder was the latest incarnation of an established and thoroughly corrupt dynasty , and between him and his fuckwit kids there is no better argument , could be no better argument , in favor of a 100 % inheritance tax .
If they ’d had to earn anything on their own merit their only entree into a country club would be as assistant assistant assistant greenskeepers reporting to Carl Spackler at Bushwood .
Ronald Reagan : Wow .
Where to start .
Back in the 1960s Marshall McLuhan , in writing about where television was taking the culture , predicted Reagan in terms so accurate that you ’d think you were reading a history instead of a precognition .
The only thing missing was the name and home address .
The failing in McLuhan ’s analysis , if there was one , was this : as cynical as he was , the reality turned out to be even worse than he feared .
Ronnie was as anti-intellectual a leader as we could have imagined prior to Dubya .
A man who somehow managed to remain immensely popular despite the fact that most Americans disagreed with his policies .
One of the most corrupt collections of advisors , staffers and appointees in history .
And the man who represented the grand triumph of years and years of scheming by wealthy conservatives bent on by god rolling the rich - poor gap back to feudal levels .
An intellectually void , amoral cesspool of a human being who will nonetheless go down as one of our “ great ” presidents .
Jimmy Carter : Carter has the distinction of being one of the very few politicians that Hunter Thompson ever said anything nice about , and his record since leaving the White House has made clear what an outstanding statesman and humanitarian Carter really is .
History will not mark him down as the most adept practitioner of the presidential arts , however , and for those who bemoan the erosion of the line between church and state , let ’s remember just how very publicly Baptist Jimmy was .
Now , thanks in part to him , we ’ll never get the smell of the fundamentalists out of the furniture .
( Which reminds me – Phish is playing four dates at Red Rocks , so those of us who live in downtown Denver are hoping the wind is n’t blowing straight west - to - east for the next few days . )
Gerald Ford : Nice enough guy , seemed like .
For a politician and all .
But he was n’t ever elected .
Richard Nixon :
Please tell me we do n’t really need to talk about this one .
Lyndon Johnson : Ever heard of Vietnam ?
It ’s hard to recall the last time somebody took an idea so bad and managed to make it even worse .
He does get credit for important civil rights legislation , at least .
Still , in the final analysis he was a president from Texas with a lust for illicit , unwinnable wars .
If that reminds you of somebody else , do n’t blame me .
I ’m just reporting the facts .
John F. Kennedy :
He invaded Cuba , and once the troops started landing he changed his mind .
He nearly got us into a hot nukular shooting war .
Then there was that Vietnam thing – he and LBJ can share this honor .
Marilyn Monroe was either a plus or a minus , depending on where you stand with respect to the marital infidelity issue .
Ultimately , though , the only thing that saved his legacy was death .
Had he lived to serve out his term (s ) he ’d be judged today based on his record , which falls somewhat short of the legend .
So , when was the last time America elected a president it could be proud of ?
By today ’s standards
Ike is n’t looking bad at all , and his two predecessors , FDR and Truman , also score high marks .
If you look at that chart in the link above , it seems like maybe the country ’s ability to elect somebody half decent runs in cycles .
Let ’s hope that ’s the case , and that the wheel is turning back in our direction .
Because damn , America is due .
Live television coverage of an Iranian football match was blacked - out because sections of the crowd were chanting anti-government slogans and waving green emblems in support of the country 's political opposition , it was claimed yesterday .
The premier league match between Esteghlal and Steel Azin took place at Tehran 's Azadi stadium just hours after tens of thousands of green - clad protesters used the state - organised Quds Day anti-Israel demonstrations to voice their opposition to the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is accused of stealing Iran 's recent election .
The game 's scheduled live TV coverage was disrupted apparently after bosses of the state broadcaster , Irib , learned of the presence of protesters inside the stadium .
According to Iranian websites , the match was initially broadcast for a few minutes in black - and - white without crowd noise to show that technical problems were being experienced .
The transmission then cut back to a studio presenter who said that the problems had arisen because Irib had " sent only one camera to the stadium " .
Eventually the match was shown nearly an hour late , again without sound and with close - up shots focusing solely on the pitch and editing out the 70,000 spectators .
The news website Mehr described the live broadcast failure as " unprecedented " .
Aziz Mohammadi , the head of Iran 's premier league , blamed it on Esteghlal 's refusal to agree to a 15 - minute kick - off delay to give extra preparation time to cameramen who , he said , had been under added pressure because of the earlier coverage of Quds Day .
However , that explanation was dismissed by club bosses who said Irib had cited " technical problems " throughout the match .
The Mizan Press website – linked to the opposition National Religious party – said the real reason was the presence of supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , the reformist who says Ahmadinejad cheated him of victory in June .
" Following the self - motivated presence of the green wave in Azadi stadium , Irib did not cover live the Esteghlal - Steel Azin match , " it wrote .
" Irib 's lie about camera malfunction and receiving only black - and - white images from inside the stadium was uncovered an hour later by the colour transmission using close - up and specially edited frames .
In these images the spectators were not shown at all . "
Suspicions that the broadcast was delayed deliberately were bolstered by reports from listeners who said they heard chants in support of Mousavi during a live radio broadcast of the game .
It was the second time on Friday that TV bosses had been blindsided by opposition protests .
Hours earlier , Ahmadinejad was publicly embarrassed during a live interview when opposition chants of " Ahmadi , Ahmadi , resign , resign " could clearly be heard while he was speaking .
The incident also exposed the authorities ' sensitivity to expressions of dissent in sporting arenas , especially football , which has an avid following in Iran .
Days after the disputed election , four members of Iran 's national team were banned from the game after displaying their support for Mousavi by wearing green wristbands during a World Cup qualifying match against South Korea .
Last month eyebrows were raised when two premier league teams abandoned their green strips and took the field against each other in predominantly white outfits .
The green shirts of the women 's national team were withdrawn and replaced with red tops on the eve of the recent Asian Games championship in Thailand .
The authorities are understood to be gearing up for a further security crackdown this week as university students return for the start of the new academic term .
A team led by Bulgarian archaeologist Prof. Nikolay Ovcharov has uncovered an enormous cult complex at the ancient Thracian city of Perperikon in the Rhodoppe Mountains .
The complex consists of at least 9 altars each 2 meters in diameter located on an area of 12 square km .
They are dated back to about 1 500 BC thanks to objects discovered around them , which is about the time of Ancient Egypt and the civilization of Mycenae and Minoan Crete .
This is the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age .
On those altars , the ancient Thracians practiced fire rituals ; similar rituals were practiced at about the same time in Ancient Egypt , on the island of Crete , and in the Hittites state in Asia Minor .
Professor Ovcharov , who gave a special press conference in the southern city of Kardzhali Wednesday , said the discovery of the cult complex may lead to the discovery of a connection between Ancient Thrace and the Minoan Crete civilization .
One of the altars Ovcharov 's team found is built of stone plates with thickness of 1,5 - 2 meters ; this is believed to be the largest altar in Southeast Europe .
During their excavations at Perperikon over the summer , the archaeologists found items from the late period of the Roman Empire , and a medieval citadel dated to 13 - 14th century , which is a testimony that Perperikon was an important city during all time periods .
FROM the Belgian port city of Antwerp comes a sad tale : of a school headmistress whose efforts to construct a haven of multicultural dialogue have been wrecked by the intolerance of others .
In recent years , a growing number of schools in Antwerp ( a tough but buzzing city , where the anti-immigrant far - right picks up about a third of the vote in local elections ) have banned outright the wearing of Muslim veils and headscarves by female pupils .
Karin Heremans , headmistress of the Antwerp Atheneum ( a prestigious sort of secondary / high school ) tried another approach .
Ms Heremans is described in the local press as a champion of cultural diversity in the school system , who fought for nine years for the right of her pupils to wear headscarves if they wished .
She wanted her state school to be a place of “ inclusive neutrality ” , in which religions are not excluded from the curriculum but “ cohabit ” with it .
She took seriously the idea of Antwerp as a diverse city , which it certainly is : a large and growing Muslim community co-exists with a smaller but highly visible Hassidic community , a fairly radicalised nationalist Flemish white population and a rather tolerant , intellectual bourgeoisie .
She organised concerts of Jewish and Muslim musicians in a local church , for example , and sat on endless committees trying to puzzle out how to make integration and multiculturalism work .
Alas , as her school became a rare place where veils were permitted , in addition to girls taking refuge in her liberal policies came girls from families dominated by radical Islamism .
Instead of being a beacon of tolerance , her school became a “ ghetto ” in the words of one supporter .
The proportion of headscarf - wearing girls went from 50 % to 80 % in three years , and girls who did not wear scarves found themselves under stronger and stronger pressure to cover up .
The school found itself “ targeted ” by Islamist hardliners who began questioning certain lessons , school excursions , and trying to block the organisation of mixed gender parents ' meetings , Ms Heremans told Le Soir , a Francophone daily , this morning ( no link ) .
Finally , when term began this month , she banned the headscarf .
She described this as a “ difficult and frustrating ” decision .
There was a protest by about 60 radical Islamists on the first day of term , some of whom insulted and publicly threatened her , according to Le Soir .
It is a bad idea to draw broad conclusions from a single case .
By instinct , I am strongly secularist , as it happens .
I quail a bit at the French solution , ie , banning all headscarves in all schools , by law .
Or rather , I do n't see how it could be pulled off in a country that does not have a long tradition of aggressively secular state schools , like France .
In countries like Belgium or Britain , religion is part of the school system , and a legal move against Muslim dress codes is easy to present as discrimination .
I used to think I was in favour of muddling through in most cases , and I am still tempted by the idea that good manners and calmness can help more than many people think .
But the latest trouble in Antwerp seems to have been caused by a piecemeal approach .
Ms Heremans is now calling on politicians to launch a proper debate on headscarves , and stop hiding behind the idea that individual schools are “ autonomous ” in this matter .
A wider law or ruling is being called for .
" The headscarf question is much more serious than we thought , " concludes Ms Heremans .
I do not share the doomy predictions of the Eurabia crowd .
Europeans are not sleep walking into the abandonment of western civilisation .
They are trying to work out how to adapt to fast changing societies , and they have their eyes wide open .
And societies have always evolved .
Immigrants in previous centuries and decades have prompted remarkably similar fusses , and are now well integrated .
Young Spanish women did not have much freedom in the villages of their native Andalucia , 50 years ago .
Yet the arrival of traditional , pious immigrants in Europe does clearly test the liberal values that I hold dear .
In short , how should a liberal , tolerant society protect the rights of a less liberal minority in its midst ?
Anyone with a quick answer to that one , I would suggest , is a fraud or a demagogue .

Pictured : Astonishing photos of rare white Bengal tiger in feeding frenzy
When it ’s feeding time at the zoo , it ’s still a jungle out there .
Although food is plentiful , there ’s always a fierce battle to grab your share .
Its teeth bared , a white Bengal tiger lunges into the water ready to snap up whatever is thrown its way .
Photographer Birte Person captured these spectacular shots as the tiger and five others did the closest thing they could to hunting at Singapore Zoo .
White tigers are almost extinct and most of those that survive are in captivity .
In the past century only 12 have been spotted in the wild .
They are neither an albino nor a separate subspecies .
Instead , they are a genetic hiccup , which happens naturally once in every 10,000 Bengal tiger births .
The result is a tiger with white fur , black stripes , blue eyes and a pink nose .
Birte , 62 , from New South Wales , Australia , was at the zoo for the tigers ’ tea -time .
‘ They sit in anticipation on the rocks waiting for the first morsel to be thrown , ’ she said .
‘ Then it is a huge lunge into the water by all of them .
‘ It carries on at a frantic pace until they all get some food . ’
She continued : ' Singapore has one of the largest collections of white tigers in the world and runs a very efficient breeding and conservation program .
Force of nature :
White tigers are almost extinct and most of those that survive are in captivity
White tigers are born to a Bengal Tiger that has the recessive gene needed for white colouring and happens naturally once in every 10,000 births
' When these photos were taken I was on my way to another conservation shoot in Asia but decided I had to stop and look at these magnificent creatures .
' They sit in anticipation on the rocks waiting for the first morsel to be thrown , then it is a huge lunge into the water by all of them .
Birte says that Singapore has one of the largest collections of white tigers in the world and runs a very efficient breeding and conservation program
' Because it happens so quickly it is very difficult to get photos like this - I 'm very pleased with them . '
Bengal tigers are fully grown at two to three years of age and live for up to 15 years in the wild .
Males weigh 200 - 230 kilograms and are up to three metres in length .
The females are 130 - 70 kilograms and up to 2.5 metres long .

This is a translation of Iranian blogger that is so many things : sad , triumphant , thoughful , hopeful , fearful and incredibly brave .
The original link in Farsi is here .
This blog snippet makes me so hopeful and so scared at the same time .
This is such a critical moment :
Is this Romania or is this Tianamenn Square ?
But it is more than that , there is a cultural divide that is being shattered with the pictures and the tweets and the blogs and the videos .
The Muslim cartoon villiany is falling apart before the neocons eyes .
I really do n't have too much to add to this .
It 's just that I remember watching the Berlin wall come down and the Romanian flags with the centers cut out of them and how the Cold War truly disappeared before our eyes .
Those were scary times , these are scary times , let us remember that this is n't just a chance for Iran , this is a chance for the world .
Tomorrow I will make an essentially meaningless and small gesture ( some may say egotistical ) to show my solidarity with this blogger .
I will wear green and hope he or she survives to see the better future they helped to create .

US politicians and families of US victims of the Lockerbie bombing were uniformly outraged and dismayed by the Scottish government 's decision to release Abdelbaset al - Megrahi to Libya on compassionate grounds .
The White House and the US state department emphasised that they had vigorously opposed Megrahi 's release in discussions with their British counterparts .
" The United States deeply regrets the decision , " said the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
" As we have expressed repeatedly to officials of the government of the United Kingdom and to Scottish authorities , we continue to believe that Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland .
On this day , we extend our deepest sympathies to the families who live every day with the loss of their loved ones .
We recognise the effects of such a loss weigh upon a family forever . "
The secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said : " The United States is deeply disappointed … Today , we remember those whose lives were lost on 21 December 1988 and we extend our deepest sympathies to the families who live each day with the loss of their loved ones due to this heinous crime . "
Senator Frank Lautenberg , Democrat of New Jersey , said " It 's an outrage , and heaven forbid that we are caving in for commercial needs to releasing prisoners who have committed terrible crimes .
That sends a message out to terrorists . "
Congressman Dan Maffei , who represents Syracuse , New York , where 35 of the dead attended university , said he was " shocked and disappointed that the Scottish government would release a known terrorist for any reason .
" I can't imagine what the families of the victims are going through .
As allies against terrorism , it is crucial that we form a hard line against these types of actions , and the release of al - Megrahi sets a very dangerous precedent . "
More than 30 of the 189 Americans who perished on the flight were from the state of New Jersey .
Many families of the victims were horrified at the release and expressed their outrage in strong terms .
Susan Cohen , mother of Theo Cohen , a 20 - year - old Syracuse University student killed in the bombing , described the release as " an absolutely disgusting disgrace " .
She speculated that the west 's interest in Libyan oil played a role in the decision .
" Do you know how it 's going to look in the history books for Scotland to have caved like this ? " she asked .
" This is what [ Libyan leader Muammar ] Gaddafi wanted .
Megrahi will be a hero in Libya .
Gaddafi will roll into New York in triumph in late September [ for the UN general assembly ] .
" Megrahi in jail was a tiny , tiny bit of justice .
It 's now all gone and Gaddafi has won . "
Bob Monetti of Cherry Hill , New Jersey , whose 20 year - old son Rick was on the plane , said : " Personally I always thought compassion came just after somebody said ' forgive me , ' and those are words I 've never heard .
Maybe some people are much more forgiving than I am . "
Kathleen Flynn , whose 21 year - old son John Patrick was on the plane , decried the " twisted Scottish law where one minister can make a decision like this " .
" Had we had the trial in the US would it have been different ? " she asked .
Stan Maslow of Haddonfield , New Jersey , whose 30 year - old daughter Diane died on the plane , said the release is " heartbreaking " .
" We 've lived through this for 21 years , " he told Fox News .
" We 've never had justice . "
Frank Duggan , president of victims of Pan Am 103 , a group that represents the families of the US victims , said he had been assured the Libyan government would give no public show of celebration .
" We were all afraid that this guy would go back to a hero 's welcome , " he said in a statement .
" But there 's going to be no dancing in the end - zone , as the expression goes . "
A while back I had a post that criticized the AI of Far Cry , and in the comments Legal Tender asked :
I wonder if you could elaborate further on the super - senses issue with the AI , Shamus ?
I do n't mean a more detailed description of it but rather what it takes to fix it from a programming point of view .
I remember you wrote a little something about AI behavior .
I can't find that post but it left me thinking of …procedural AI ?
You know , give the AI grunts a set of behaviours and then let them loose on the world .
What can be done about super - senses ?
I mean , is there a setting , something like AIdetection =1 or AItrackingtrfoliage=1 ?
and then you adjust them to 0.8 so foes will ignore you or can't aim if you are behind obstacles ?
I started trying to write a response in the comments , which grew into a post , which grew into a series of posts .
I had a post on this back in 2006 , where I talked about the problems of having an NPC accompany you through the game .
In that post , I said :
People ask why AI sucks so bad ?
This is why :
It 's hard , it 's expensive , and when it 's working right people do n't notice because they only notice when the thing screws up .
The developer can spend money making the gameworld bigger , or spend money adding lots of detail to some inconsequential NPC just so it does n't kill immersion .
Developing AI is all about concealing or mitigating AI mishaps and screwups .
If you hire a brilliant programmer and he does astounding work , in the end you ’ll have spectacularly stupid AI that does n’t do anything too obviously stupid when the player is looking .
That ’s the best you can hope for , because that ’s the best that you can hope to do with a “ mere ” 10,000 lines of C++ code and a couple percent of your dual core processor .
( Actually , processor is n’t that much of a bottleneck .
The check to figure out where a given bullet will go and which of the 1,000,000 polygons in the scene it ’s going to hit is going to be an order of magnitude more time consuming than anything your AI coder can throw at it .
We do n’t really need more AI processing power , because we ’ve only just begun to figure out what to do with the power we already have . )
Note that I ’ve never written production - quality AI before .
I ’ve dabbled quite a bit over the last quarter century , like most curious coders , and I ’ve made a few simple systems .
( Some of my first coding projects way back in 1983 at the tender age of 12 involved AI pathfinding . )
But this series is more my overview of the problem and how I ’d approach it than a review of work I ’ve done in the past .
I ’m going to be outlining the problem – which is far bigger than a lot of people realize – but not offering any solutions .
( If you want the solutions , feel free to send me an overview of the salary and benefits package you ’re offering , because we ’re going to be working together for a long time .
( I ’m Kidding . ( Mostly . ) ) )
I ’m going to be talking mostly about dealing with enemy AI in this series and what a programmer needs to accomplish to reach the lofty goal of having enemies that are n’t obviously complete morons .
Let ’s assume we ’re talking about generalized , dynamic AI as opposed to pre-scripted stuff .
Imagine we ’re talking about AI to oppose the player in various situations both indoors and outdoors .
Ideally , we want the level designer to be able to drop a bunch of enemy AI dudes into the level , click and drag over the group , and say “ You lot are all on a team .
Work together . ”
In the end , we want that team to fight in a way that is n’t obviously stupid , unfair , or boring .
I divide combat AI into four distinct parts , in order of descending importance and increasing difficulty to implement : Detection , Targeting , Pathing , Behavior .
I ’ll talk about each of these in its own post .
Later , you see .
If I were developing AI , my first step would be to get as far away from the game engine as possible .
AI development is very expensive in terms of experimentation and testing .
( Or should be , if you hope to do a good job . )
If you ’re testing group tactics , you need to test all sorts of situations and behaviors .
There are hundreds and hundreds of ways a battle can play out , and you need to be testing a wide variety of scenarios to make sure you ’re not just playing whack - a- mole .
You do n’t want to spend two days fixing the code that lets the AI navigate around buildings only to find you ’ve completely broken the code that lets it snipe from a distance , and then spend another day fixing that to find the AI can no longer take turns going through doors .
You need to run a lot of tests , and you do n’t want to launch the alpha version of a AAA game engine and sit through a bunch of loading screens every time you want to see the AI do its thing .
The game will be very unoptimized and unstable early in development , and you do n’t want to deal with long loads and crashes .
You also do n’t want to have to manually play the level , either .
At least , not every single time .
Having a clear view of the battlefield would also help in giving me a nice objective view of things .
It ’s much more difficult to spot irrational or absurd behavior in a sea of foliage , particle effects , lens flares , tracer rounds , blood decals , and flying ragdolls .
This would n’t be a problem if I was watching icons battle it out on a sterile “ Tron ” - style grid .
( Aside : Didja see the new Tron Legacy teaser ?
Whee . )
I have no idea how AI coders work these days , but I would write something exceptionally lightweight .
A simple program that moves 2d sprites around a simple “ maze ” of arbitrary shapes .
Ideally , I ’d want a program that can launch directly into the battle in a second or two .
It would be able to run in accelerated time and fight itself while I watch and analyze the action .
I could then iterate on that thing about twenty times faster than someone loading up ( say ) Crysis every single time they want to see the AI work .
Once I had it polished to a mirror shine , then I ’d integrate it into the game .

PITTSBURGH , Sept. 24 ( UPI ) -- Protests at the G20 economic summit turned violent at times Thursday with demonstrators throwing rocks and police firing rubber bullets , Pittsburgh police said .
Police used pepper spray and smoke canisters to break up a march in downtown Pittsburgh but some of the marchers began throwing rocks and police responded by firing rubber bullets , the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette reported .
In a separate incident , police used gas canisters to disperse a crowd estimated at 500 -- many of them said to be curious onlookers -- near Phipps Conservatory , where heads of state were to have dinner , the newspaper said .

Vic Walczak , legal director for the local ACLU , said the crowd was peaceful and even moved when a police car needed to pass through .
" I do n't think this is an unlawful assembly , " he said .
The two - day summit began Thursday .
Fourteen Greenpeace activists were arrested Wednesday trying to scale city bridges .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the activists were trying to send a " message to the leaders of the G20 , " the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review reported .
The arrests occurred after eight people rappelled from a bridge and unfurled a banner reading : " Danger . Climate Destruction Ahead .
Reduce CO2 Emissions Now . "
Police said they also detained five people trying to hang a banner from the Fort Pitt Bridge .
Groups this week have protested Group of 20 economic policies , President Barack Obama 's administration , a coal conference and other issues , the Tribune - Review reported .
To deal with an expected high number of demonstrators and protect security perimeters in Pittsburgh 's downtown area , the city hired out - of - state officers and brought in several thousand state police troopers and Pennsylvania National Guard troops .
The paddock at the Nurburgring is a low - key place this weekend , but behind the scenes there have been ground - shaking developments that could change the face of Formula 1 .
It appears that Max Mosley 's latest manoeuvrings in the political battle in the sport have backfired .
The motives behind the FIA president 's actions in the last fortnight are not entirely clear but their consequences are coming into focus .
To recap briefly , on 24 June it appeared that Mosley , F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo had come to a deal that ended the threat of Ferrari and seven other leading teams setting up a rival championship .
Their agreement was widely - and accurately - reported as a victory for the eight ' rebel ' teams , who are represented by the umbrella group Fota .
But two days later , Mosley - apparently upset by what he interpreted as the teams ' ill - advised triumphalism , and by the widespread perception that he had been defeated - hinted that he could go back on his guarantee that he would not stand in October 's FIA presidential elections , which had been part of the peace deal .
And this week , through the proxy of FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting , he told the eight Fota teams that they did not have entries for 2010 - despite the fact that the FIA had published an entry list with them on it .
That led to renewed talk of a Fota breakaway , as a last - resort option .
Mosley and Fota are actually very close to an agreement on all matters of issue , but the teams are not prepared to sign any legally binding documents until they are absolutely sure that the FIA president will not renege on his part of the bargain .
The shenanigans have deeply concerned CVC , the venture capital group that owns F1's commercial rights .
Sources tell me that CVC is very nervous about what it perceives as the risk Mosley is putting on its business , and it is exerting pressure to ensure it is removed .
Behind the scenes , I 'm told , CVC and Fota are finalising a new commercial agreement with Ecclestone 's F1 Management company ( FOM ) .
The plan is apparently to tie the three entities together and then present Mosley with a fait accompli .
Effectively they will say : " This is what we have agreed .
These are the new arrangements for the world 's premier single - seater championship .
We would like to run this with the FIA as its F1 world championship , so we would like you to sign these contracts , on our terms .
But if you do n't , fine .
We will go and do it ourselves . "
There is no obvious reason for Mosley not to sign , but it will be made clear to him that , if he does n't , CVC will launch legal action against him for breach of contract .
At the same time , it appears that a new Concorde Agreement - the legal agreement between the teams , the FIA and FOM that enshrines the relationship between them , the teams ' rights and the distribution of funds - is ready for signing .
And , as of Saturday , that is scheduled to happen on Wednesday .
In theory , this should be a way out of the impasse in which F1's senior figures currently find themselves .
Certainly , that is what many insiders hope .
But when I asked a senior figure whether this was now the endgame , he gave me a withering look and said : " No , because as soon as this is sorted out we have to work out what happens with everything after 2012 . "
For Mosley , though , it does appear that his four decades in a central position in F1's power games may be coming to an end - even if it should be remembered that , as an ex-president , he would have a place on the FIA Senate and might well be able to wield influence from there , and he might also succeed in having an ally such as ex-Ferrari boss Jean Todt elected as president .
Intriguingly , people are also beginning to look at what all this means for Ecclestone .
As this row has dragged on , it has become clear that he does not have the near - miraculous fixing powers of old .
The fact that the teams have had direct negotiations with CVC is another new development .
So Ecclestone 's remarks last weekend about Adolf Hitler - which have caused deep disquiet among the major multi-national companies that back F1 , and are said to have infuriated CVC - were badly timed as well as ill - advised .
All of which has led to speculation that his position may not be secure in the medium to long term .
F1 without Bernie Ecclestone as its powerbroker and money - maker ?
Now that really would be the start of a new era .
The Ontario Court of Appeal may have narrowed a common defence in drinking - and - driving cases when it ruled yesterday that a Georgetown woman who was found standing beside her car in a steep ditch off Airport Rd. had " care and control " of her vehicle .
The prosecution of Connie Banks was one of scores of " car in the ditch " cases and her conviction yesterday , said her lawyer , offers little hope for anyone charged with having care and control of a vehicle while their blood alcohol level is over the legal limit .
" I think the court is sending a message that they 're going to interpret the current law as it relates to these cases so narrowly , " said defence counsel John Collins , " that ... really , the only safe option for any citizen now is to not operate a motor vehicle under any circumstances after they 've consumed alcohol . "
Banks veered into the ditch at about 12:45 a.m. on April 14 , 2008 , while driving home from a visit with one of her daughters in Brampton .
During her 4 ½- hour stay , she said she had consumed four bottles of beer .
Banks later testified that she had assumed her car was damaged and was reaching for her cell phone to call a tow truck when an officer arrived at 1 a.m .
The keys were out of the ignition and the lights were off as she stood outside .
Breathalyzer tests at 2:52 a.m. and 3:13 a.m. showed Banks had .120 and .119 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood — over the legal limit .
But because the Criminal Code required the tests be administered within two hours of a person being in " care and control " of a vehicle , the case turned on whether Banks was in control of her car as she stood next to it in the ditch — and whether she could have set it in motion , placing the public at risk .
A trial judge convicted Banks , saying even though she had planned to have her car towed , there was a possibility that after getting it pulled from the ditch , she might have decided to drive it anyway .
Last year , however , Superior Court Justice David Corbett overturned that decision and acquitted Banks .
The Crown was required to prove Banks would have driven home but it did n't establish that beyond a reasonable doubt , he said .
Yesterday , Collins argued it was " fanciful " to think Banks might have continued on her journey after being pulled out by the tow truck .
That could only have happened , he told the court , if she had been able to persuade the tow truck driver to take it off the hoist and conduct a mechanical inspection , in fog and darkness on a busy road , to see if it could be driven .
Still , a three - judge appeal panel ruled yesterday it was open to the trial judge to have concluded Banks might have driven the rest of the way .

" These are very hard cases , " said Justice Michael Moldaver .
" But , as you know in your heart of hearts , the best way to avoid these things is to not be in a position of being `over 80 ' . "
The court reinstated an $ 800 fine that had been imposed on Banks by the trial judge .
The conviction also carries an automatic 9 - month license suspension , the prospect of high insurance premiums and a requirement that a breathalyzer be installed on her car ignition .
Like most hate groups , the National Socialist Movement ( NSM ) conducts virtually all its business in secret .
So leaders of America ’s largest neo -Nazi group could n’t have been happy last week when hundreds of its private E-mails appeared on the Internet .
The messages — more than 600 of them dated between July 2007 and August 2009 — are posted to the website wikileaks.org , which publishes leaked documents .
They were sent to a hotmail account maintained by an NSM member identified as William Herring , a self - described ex-con who handled correspondence for the group .
They provide a glimpse into the inner world of the NSM , whose members seem to spend almost as much time at each other ’s throats as they do standing up for the white race .
Among the highlights was a major dust - up in fall 2007 that featured claims of Jewish collaboration and led to the ouster or resignation of several key members , including the group ’s 2008 presidential candidate .
On Oct. 3 , 2007 , NSM leader Jeff Schoep wrote an “ internal party memo ” urging members to stop squabbling .
“ When Col .
Bishop and I have to play babysitter , and talk to people about drama , it makes us , all of you , and our Party look foolish , ” he wrote .
“ America is being overrun with Mexicans and other invaders , instead of expelling certain people , these members and the Party are better served if the drama is saved for the playground , and we all get back to work . ”
Two weeks later , he adopted a harder line in another E-mail to NSM members .
“ The NSM does not operate as a Democracy , your pledge of Loyalty is to the Party and its Leadership .
Honor your Oath , and your Pledge of Loyalty to the Party , or get out of our Ranks now while you still can ! ”
In mid-October 2007 , Schoep took aim at former NSM regional leader Jim Ramm , an alias for Matthew Ramsey , in a flurry of E - mails .
“ Jim Ramm is collaborating with the ADL [ Anti- Defamation League ] , ” Schoep declared in a message dated Oct. 18 .
He also forwarded an E - mail titled “ giving it to the jews ” in which Ramm , who served as webmaster for NSM ’s nukeisrael website , supposedly threatened to give the site to the ADL .
Ramm later asserted that the E- mail was a fake and denied contact with “ the Jews . ”
He attacked Schoep in a rambling Oct. 21 E - Mail , alleging that Schoep had covered up for an associate who was coming on to Ramm ’s then - girlfriend .
He complained that in 2006 , NSM records grossed over $ 110,000 in sales , yet was n’t required to report profits to members .
“ NSM members are expected to just smile and just hope Commander is spending the money wisely , ” he said .
“ NSM members make no mistake : Jeff Schoep is in this just for the money and he really does n’t give a damn about the White Race . ”
Even the group ’s presidential candidate was n’t spared .
Schoep gave the boot to John Taylor Bowles after Bowles stated on his website that NSM was in disarray .
“ As a Party veteran , You above all people should never waiver [ sic ] in the face of any drama , much less feed into the drama and make a false claim that the Party is in disarray , ” Schoep wrote in an Oct. 18 , 2007 , E - mail .
Bowles responded with an E- mail to his “ fellow National Socialists ” complaining that Schoep was refusing to rein in his web team , despite “ their tyrannical and unjust ways of banning people and cussing at people . ”
Bowles also accused Schoep of doing little to help his presidential campaign and complained that Schoep ’s E-mail about loyalty sounded as if it had been penned by a Marxist .
“ Has the NSM Commander been honest with you and told you his reckless character got him a DUI and dues are paying the increased auto insurance premium along with the high price of his Mustang , ” he wrote .
“ Must be nice to live high on the hog on your dues money and you see little in return . ”
Contributing to the brouhaha was an E - mail supposedly from former NSM chairman Clifford Herrington .
It lambasted Christianity and announced his return as party commander in place of Schoep .
“ All Praise the Hairy Horned God from Hell ! ” proclaimed the E- mail in an apparent reference to Herrington ’s wife , who had earlier triggered a scandal when anti-racists discovered she was priestess of the Joy of Satan Ministries .
Schoep promptly declared the E - mail a fake .
Even Herring , who appears to be utterly devoted to NSM , occasionally needed to be talked off a cliff .
In a June 29 , 2008 , E - mail to Schoep , he was furious about a rumor that he was about to be expelled from NSM for being a drunk .
“ I have been faithfully doing all I could for the NSM on a ‘ budget ’ that is laughable at best , ” he wrote .
“ I have been down to washing my clothing in the bathtub and using coffee filters for toilet paper – just so I could keep my internet and phone on and continue helping you with these emails .
Am I to be discarded because I had a drinking problem ?
Am I nothing more than some ex-con piece of shit to be thrown away when I am no longer useful ? ”
But there ’s more to NSM than feuding .
Amid reports of cross-lightings and a book - burning , Herring suggested that NSM set up a scholarship fund for those who could n’t afford to attend the group ’s national rally .
Schoep recommended keeping it on the down low .
“ We need to be carefull [ sic ] about making this known ” because “ our enemies will say we are paying people to attend events , ” he wrote in a Dec. 1 , 2007 , E - mail .
In a March 29 , 2008 , E- mail , Schoep ’s wife asked Herring , who subscribes to the neo-Pagan religion called Odinism , for help on a class essay comparing mythical heroes .
“ I have to have a 5,000 word paper wrote [ sic ] to answer this question , ” Joanna Schoep E-mailed .
He complied , and she thanked him in a follow - up E-mail .
“ I just need to get an A in the class , so I can get into Law school someday down the road , ” she wrote .
Schoep later reported that his wife got an A- on the paper .

A glance at a map and a little knowledge of the region suggest that the real reasons for Western military involvement may be largely hidden .
Afghanistan is adjacent to Middle Eastern countries that are rich in oil and natural gas .
And though Afghanistan may have little petroleum itself , it borders both Iran and Turkmenistan , countries with the second and third largest natural gas reserves in the world .
( Russia is first . )
Turkmenistan is the country nobody talks about .
Its huge reserves of natural gas can only get to market through pipelines .
Until 1991 , it was part of the Soviet Union and its gas flowed only north through Soviet pipelines .
Now the Russians plan a new pipeline north .
The Chinese are building a new pipeline east .
The U.S. is pushing for " multiple oil and gas export routes . "
High - level Russian , Chinese and American delegations visit Turkmenistan frequently to discuss energy .
The U.S. even has a special envoy for Eurasian energy diplomacy .
Rivalry for pipeline routes and energy resources reflects competition for power and control in the region .
Pipelines are important today in the same way that railway building was important in the 19th century .
They connect trading partners and influence the regional balance of power .
Afghanistan is a strategic piece of real estate in the geopolitical struggle for power and dominance in the region .
Since the 1990s , Washington has promoted a natural gas pipeline south through Afghanistan .
The route would pass through Kandahar province .
In 2007 , Richard Boucher , U.S. assistant secretary of state , said : " One of our goals is to stabilize Afghanistan , " and to link South and Central Asia " so that energy can flow to the south . "
Oil and gas have motivated U.S. involvement in the Middle East for decades .
Unwittingly or willingly , Canadian forces are supporting American goals .
The proposed pipeline is called TAPI , after the initials of the four participating countries ( Turkmenistan , Afghanistan , Pakistan and India ) .
Eleven high - level planning meetings have been held during the past seven years , with Asian Development Bank sponsorship and multilateral support ( including Canada 's ) .
Construction is planned to start next year .
. .
Ukraine is the main gateway for gas from Russia to Europe .
The United States has pushed for alternate pipelines and encouraged European countries to diversify their sources of supply .
Recently built pipelines for oil and gas originate in Azerbaijan and extend through Georgia to Turkey .
They are the jewels in the crown of U.S. strategy to bypass Russia and Iran .
The rivalry continues with plans for new gas pipelines to Europe from Russia and the Caspian region .
. .
Meanwhile , Iran is planning a pipeline to deliver gas east to Pakistan and India .
Pakistan has agreed in principle , but India has yet to do so .
It 's an alternative to the long - planned , U.S. - supported pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India .
A very big game is underway , with geopolitics intruding everywhere .
U.S. journalist Steven LeVine describes American policy in the region as " pipeline - driven . "
Other countries are pushing for pipeline routes , too . . .
John Foster is an energy economist and author of " A Pipeline Through A Troubled Land - Afghanistan , Canada , and the New Great Energy Game , " published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives .

Genetic Nomenclature
The phenotype of an organism consists of the observable traits of that organism .
The genotype is the actual genetic composition of the organism , its genes and alleles .
There are commonly accepted rules followed when naming the phenotypes and genotypes in bacteria , although notations can vary .
The phenotype is designated using a three letter code with the first letter capitalized .
Superscripts are used to distinguish mutant ( -) from wild - type (+ ) phenotypes .
A particular bacteria ’s ability to synthesize tryptophan , for example , would be written Trp+ .
However , when describing an organism ’s phenotype , the mutant traits , such as the inability to synthesize tryptophan ( Trp– ) , and not the wild type traits are listed .
Antibiotic resistance is written using a similar three letter code , but instead of ‘+’ or ‘-‘ superscripts an ‘r’ is used for resistance and an ‘ s ’ for sensitivity .
E. coli‘s resistance to the antibiotic Eryhtromycin would be written Ermr .
Genotypic descriptions are written using a three letter code related to the phenotypic designation .
For the genotypic designation , however , all three letters are lower case and either italicized or underlined .
Also different for genotypic designations is that by simply mentioning a gene it is assumed that it is a mutant .
Take the following genotype and respective phenotype for example :
genotype : trp , met , lys
phenotype : Trp– , Met– , Lys–
The ‘-‘ mutant superscript is assumed in the phenotype by simply designating the gene in the genotype .
It is possible for one protein to be encoded by more than one gene .
In such a case an upper case letter ( which is also italicized ) is added to the end of the three letter gene description .
Tryptophan synthetase , the enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan , is encoded by both the trpA gene and the trpB gene .
It is even possible to have different mutations in the same gene .
In that case a number is added to the end of the gene designation .
Mutations in different alleles of the trpA gene could be written trpA1 or trpA32 .
Finally , a specific nucleotide deletion can be represented using a ‘ Δ ’ before the gene and the designation for the particular nucleotide after .
genotype : recA1 , thi , trpB2 , Δ( lacZ ) m15
phenotype : RecA– , Thi– , TrpB– , LacZ–
And here are some links to pages about genetic nomenclature used for specific organisms :
E. coli genome project :
‘ The E. coli Genome Project at the University of Wisconsin - Madison had its genesis in an editorial by Frederick R. Blattner in the November 18 , 1983 issue of Science , in which he raised the idea of completely sequencing the E. coli ( and human ) genomes : ’
“ At present the worldwide accomplishment in DNA sequence amounts to 2.3 x 10e6 base pairs , representing 2500 individual sequences .
It is now becoming more or less routine to sequence completely the DNA of whole genetic entities ranging from single genes through multigene families to simple life forms such as viruses and phage .
Currently the largest single DNA molecule to have been sequenced is the phage lambda genome ( 48502 base pairs ) .
We are beginning to recognize that determination of the total genetic specification of more advanced life forms may be a possibility in the relatively near future .
Extension of this principle to bacteria ( genome size 5 x 10e6 base pairs ) — the simplest free living forms — would require an increase of the worldwide technical effort by only a factor of 2 .
Some three orders of magnitude more would be needed to progress to the total human genome . ” — F. R. Blattner ( 1983 ) “ Biological Frontiers ” Science 222( 4625 ) , 719-720 . [ not indexed in PubMed ]
‘ In that same year we began isolation of an overlapping lambda clonebank of E. coli K - 12 strain MG1655 .
Those clones served as the starting material in our initial efforts to sequence the whole genome .
Improvements in sequencing technology have since reached the point where whole - genome sequencing of microbial genomes is routine , and the human genome has in fact been completed .
But in those early years of radioactive sequencing reactions and manual reading of autoradiographs , it was a daunting undertaking … ’
Mouse Nomenclature Home Page :
‘ The Mouse Genome Informatics Database is the authoritative source of official names for mouse genes , alleles , and strains .
Nomenclature follows the rules and guidelines established by the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice . ’
Genetic nomenclature for Drosophila melanogaster :
‘ The nomenclature guidelines below explain how FlyBase assigns canonical symbols and names to its genetic objects ( genes , alleles , transposons , insertions , aberrations and balancers ) .
We encourage the community and journals to adhere to FlyBase - approved symbols / names for consistency in published datasets .
While these guidelines cover most circumstances , there may be exceptional cases not clearly covered here .
Please contact FlyBase to discuss such cases or any other aspect of the nomenclature . ’
Guidlines for Human Gene Nomenclature :
‘ Guidelines for human gene nomenclature were first published in 1979 [ 1 ] , when the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee was first given the authority to approve and implement human gene names and symbols .
Updates of these guidelines were published in 1987 [ 2],1995 [ 3 ] , and 1997 [ 4 ] .
With the recent publications of the complete human genome sequence there is an estimated total of 26,000 - 40,000 genes , as suggested by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium [ 5 ] and Venter et al . [ 6 ] .
Thus , the guidelines have been updated to accommodate their application to this wealth of information , although symbols are still only assigned when required for communication .
These updates were derived with input from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ( HGNC ) International Advisory Committee and attendees of the ASHG01NW Gene Nomenclature Workshop .
All approved human gene symbols can be found in the HGNC database [ 7 ] . ’
‘ The philosophy of the HGNC remains “ that gene nomenclature should evolve with new technology rather than be restrictive as sometimes occurs when historical and single gene nomenclature systems are applied ” [ 2 ] . ’
‘ A summary of the guidelines is presented here :
1. Each approved gene symbol must be unique .
2. Symbols are short - form representations ( or abbreviations ) of the descriptive gene name .
3. Symbols should only contain Latin letters and Arabic numerals .
4. Symbols should not contain punctuation .
5. Symbols should not contain “ G ” for gene .
6. Symbols do not contain any reference to species , for example “ H/h ” for human . ’

The Tradition of Libertarian Singers by Rafael Uzcategui
To think of insurgent popular song from Latin America 's perspective is to easily evoke the names of Victor Jara , Ali Primera , Carlos Puebla , Inti-Illimani or Silvio Rodriguez .
But , the importance of this way of struggling using songs is neither accidental nor unique .
There has always been singing linked to all revolutionary movements in our continent , some times hidden by the events themselves or by interested reconstructions of the history of our socio-political struggles .
We would like to celebrate here the existence of a tradition of popular singers , comrades of the idea of social justice with liberty : anarchism .
This exercise in memory , unlike those by the " true dissidents , " does not pretend to be exclusive and , least of all , the whole truth .
As any historic reconstruction - seen from a particular point of view - it contains fragments of truth .
It also pretends to connect old singers with current ones , the struggles they are part of and to recreate possible links of community solidarity .
Libertarian tango and corrido Angel Cappelletti - one of the historians of Latin - America 's libertarian ideals - asserts that anarchism has a wide tradition in our continent , rich in pacifist and violent struggles manifestations of individual and collective heroism , in feats of organization , in oral , written and practical propaganda , literary works , stage , pedagogic , cooperative and community experiments .
Its decadence -- after the main role libertarians played between 1870 and 1930 -- is attributed to three causes :
The series of coup - d'etats occurred around the '30s and the repression following each of them ; the foundation of the Communist parties , that , thanks to the support of the Soviet Union , received material strength and a prestige lacking in the libertarian organizations and in third place , the apparition of national - populist currents , more or less linked to the armed forces .
The anarcho - syndicalist groups developed a vast cultural work directed to the peasant and labor majorities during the first years of the XX century .
Soon after , the proclamations of newspapers and books were taken to the stage , to the plastic arts or turned into poems .
In Argentina , libertarian " payadores " were the chroniclers and heralds of the agrarian struggles in the southern cone .
Likewise , composers of tangos and milongas were activists of the ideal and immortalized the memory of successful labor struggles or of the consequences of bloody government repressions .
In Mexico , corridos Zapatistas and Magonistas gave popular expression to demands for land , liberty and other demands of clear anarchist vein .
But , it is beyond the Rio Grande river where the libertarian song finds its highest and best development and popularity , linked to the agitation instigated by the people 's Big Union , The Industrial Workers of The World , IWW .
Stoking the flames of discontent Joseph Hillström , 23 years old , filled with memories of his Swedish skies , arrives to the United States , in October 1902 .
He makes his home in California and takes part in strikes and political movements struggling for the rights of the disposed : masses of immigrants arrived in New York harbor to break their backs in hard working days .
With a new name , Joe Hill , he joins The Industrial Workers of The World , IWW , in 1910 .
One year later , in the heat of the strike in the piers of San Pedro , he wrote his first song .
While the Southern Pacific hired strike breakers , with his songs Joe breathed courage to the workers on strike .
Something magic happened : the workers began to sing his tunes , together and in solidarity , in their 44 different languages , that way des troying the attempts of their bosses of dividing and making them fight against each other -- the old imperialist , " divide and conquer " technique .
Joe goes from city to city to join the protests .
There have always been songs in the revolutions , but with Joe Hill , the strikes began to be always carried out singing , as never before .
His popularity with the people , wins the Swede the hate of the authorities and a bad beating that left all his body terribly wounded in San Diego .
Hill 's formula was as simple as it was effective : he would take the melodies of popular songs of the day ; and he would ad stanzas that were creative , combative , witty and catchy .
To Joe Hill a book was good , but a song learned and constantly repeated was the best propaganda .
The IWW began to publish working class songs in pamphlets called , " Red Songbook . "
In one of them , 13 were songs the Swede considered his " songs to keep alive the flames of discontent " with names such as , The Preacher and The Slave , " " Casey Jones , The Union Scab " and " When The Shannon River Runs . "
A conspiracy is concocted , in 1914 , to silence his voice .
Accused of having killed a policeman and his son in an assault , he was jailed for 22 months .
From his prison cell , Joe Hill continued writing songs and encouraging his comrades to tirelessly keep on the strikes .
The IWW mobilized all its energies against the evidently fixed trial , but could not stop the death sentence sought by the authorities from the first time they pronounced the name Joe Hill .
The Swede , knowing the turmoil his death sentence was creating in the United States , said farewell to one of the union leaders with these words : " Good bye , Bill .
I die like a true rebel .
Do not waste your time mourning .
ORGANIZE ! " He was tied to a chair and a heart of white paper was placed on his chest that a firing squad of five mercenaries hit the right spot .
It was November 19 , 1915 .
30 , 000 workers in Chicago bid him the last farewell singing with tears in their eyes and with their fists raised high .
The Guitar that Killed Fascists Woodrow Wilson Guthrie was born three years before Joe Hill was murdered .
Considered the most important Northamerican folk singer of the first half of the XX century , Guhtrie continued the Swedish martyr and anarcho - syndicalist IWW singers tradition as part of the , " Almanac Singers " or the " People 's Songs , " unions of progresist singers that supported workers struggles with their songs and concerts .
With influences of Irish music and Black Blues , his repertoire included more than one thousand songs of protest .
His songs related stories of good , generous bandits and of murdered anarchists ; his guitar and his harmonica also sang about children and old people , about the woods and the mountains , and the arid plains of the country , creating a style of total support for the popular struggles of the moment .
Guhtrie , traveling the whole country by freight train , gave concerts with a guitar that had a sticker that read : " This machine kills fascists . "
Woody Guhtrie has left us monothematic records about the conflicts of his time : songs about the building of the great Bonneville and Grand Coule dams , ( Columbia ballads , 1937 ) , his Sacco and Vanzzetti Ballads , ( 1946 ) and , above all , his " Dust Bowl Ballads , " where he talks about the peasant migration soon after the crisis of 1929 , including the extraordinary , " Tom Joad , " a seven minutes ballad that summarizes the 500 pages of John Steinbecks 's novel , " The Grapes of Wrath . "
During then '60s , Woody Guhtrie was the most powerful influence in the so - called " Second Generation of Folk Singers " : Bob Dylan , Joan Baez , John Mayall , Donovan , Grateful Dead , who , with electric instruments , tried to reproduce his spirit , but very few managed to emulate his persona .
Four decades after , the United States is once again plagued by protests and police clashes .
Diverse groups coincide in their critiques of the consequences of economic globalization and take their concerns to the streets of Seattle , Washington , DC , New York , San Francisco and other cities to shout slogans , to dance in the carnivals of resistance ...
And to sing .
The spirit of Joe Hill and Woody Guhtrie comes alive again in those demonstrations , in the singing voices of young performers such as Ethan Miller .
Ethan , who lives in Maine , is involved in movements in his area against capitalism ; movements that are also anti-authoritarian ; in fact , he lives and works in the JED Center , a collective and community place that supports and organizes programs for social change .
Miller has actively participated in events against globalization , sharing the stage with other musicians such as David Rovics , Jim Page , Charlie King and Karen Brandow .
They also sing in Europe
It is also undeniable the anti-authoritarian passion on the other side of the water .
During the Spanish Civil War , the feats of the confrontation would transform popular melodies into anthems of resistance that came to form a legacy still sang in our days .
In France , shelter of exiled libertarian Cenetists , Georges Brassens ( 1893 - 1981 ) sang in cabarets his songs to prostitutes , delinquents and other disinherited since 1952 , with a mordacity and tenderness that won him a name in the French bohemia .
As an anarchist , he ridiculed every form of power and was involved in the movement by publishing poems in the libertarian press .
Brassens ' recordings secretly went through the boundaries of fascist Franco 's Spain and influenced the style of the young son of an anarchist -- Cenetist to be more precise -- named , Joan Manoel Serrat .
The legacy of singer composer Brassen is of more than 2,000 recorded songs and his spirit is still alive in singers such as Serge Utge Royo , who , besides his own prolific career , actively participates in French libertarian circuits .
It is evident that the style popularized by Brassens ' irony and street themes -- is reflected in the songs of consecrated Spanish singers , such as the named Serrat , Joaquin Sabina and others .
But even more interesting is the rebirth these days of libertarian gatherings to play the guitar by those who grew up in the ferocious and indomitable counterculture : punk .
By the mid ' 80s a group of restless youth tried to develop a space as an alternative to the traditional musical market .
Besides the explosion of the phenomenon known as , " Basque radical rock " -- Kortatu , La Polla Records , Eskorbuto , MCD , Hertzainak , etc-- , punk offered a possibility to express ideas about the Iberian peninsula and to relate to movements such as anarcho - syndicalism itself , the struggle against OTAN , insumission and " okupation " ; a true multi shaded movement inspired by an ideology definitely anti-authoritarian .
Bands such as Juanito Piquete y Los Mataesquiroles , Antimanguis , Black Carcomas , Productos Carnicos and Kolumna Durruti come out of the present breeding ground of libertarian songs , that tone down their rage with more relaxed rhythms for audiences of every type .
As Josu Arteaga , who writes about the scene for the magazine , Ekintza Zuzena , says , " desperate to break the noise barrier , Nuts who showed up dressed only with one guitar , needed exhibitionists , balms for the broken hearts , songwriter singers ready to give back power to the word . "
From this libertarian roots are Juanito Piquete , Moi Rojo , Pito Karkoma , el duo Paso a Paso and Sonoris Kausa , linked to others of more traditional trajectories such as Lengua de Trapo , Sena Jaraiz and Pablo Garabato , who , from their first recordings , sing to the struggle and to life , who have also produced a collection titled , " Without Excuses : 19 Songwriter Singers of the XXI Century , " issued cooperatively by 8 independent recording companies .
The lyrics of these new minstrels of utopia move from the unionist topics to bring to us the thematic of the collectives in which they participate : struggle against prisons , critique of neoliberalism , feminism ... and the reinvindication of anarchy .
Argentina , Ecuador Argentina , turned into the land of pickets , popular assemblies and the struggle for the dissapeared is also Gabriel Sequeira 's pampa .
He is in his 30s and close to the libertarian organizations of Buenos Aires , where he began in the world of rock 'n roll .
He proudly introduces himself as the " anarchist trobadour , " be it in the Foro Social Mundial de Porto Alegre or in Congress Square together with Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo .
With one recording to his credit -- independent , of course -- Sequeira performs in any stage of resistance that asks for his help .
In Ecuador we find Jaime Guevara , a " chamo " -- as the people call him with affection in Quito -- with 29 years of song and activism , a central character in the fast growing libertarian militancy of the Ecuatorian capital .
Maddly beloved , he has won the affection of the popular sectors , his eternal audience in his concerts in favor of human rights , antimilitarism , and the struggle for justice .
Jaime had a band until stage precariousness -- the streets , the demonstrations -- forced him to continue alone only with the company of his guitar , that once went to jail with him and stayed over 28 days more than El Chamo .
" They gave my guitar back to me in pieces . "
Rejecting the military like ways of some folkloric groups of protest , Jaime puts laughter , everyday life and humor in all his songs .
With one recording and preparing another , Guevara has no doubts in " acolitar " -- cooperate -- singing some of his 500 themes written for solidarian gatherings , such as , Jornadas Continentales de Resistencia Contra el ALCA , of October 2002 , in Quito , when " El Chamo " was in the front lines of the barricades .
Health , song and anarchy
If power is synonym of silence , liberty is also named , Word .
Tuneful voices will not cease to sing with and for the struggle , for and with the feelings that make us singular as human beings .
The modern minstrels in these times of the internet and nanotechnology , arm themselves with a guitar and a knapsack of antiauthoritarian values .
If we look carefully , perhaps we may see one of them walking in front of our home .
If we listen attentively , we may enjoy ballads that still stir flames of discontent .

I have three goals in this post : 1 .
Refactoring the technique in my previous post so that building the search tree is entirely separate from searching the tree .
2 .
Making it work with real - valued weights , not just integers3 .
Applying it to an ambiguous parsing problem , making use of a type class to define an abstract grammar .
The idea is that I want to search a tree of possibilities where each edge of the tree is marked with a weight .
The goal will be to search for leaves that minimise the sum of the weights of the edges down to the leaf .
Here 's an example tree :
The minimum weight leaf is at C .
If we 're working with probabilities then we 'll use minus the log of the probability of a branch as the weight .
That way multiplication of probabilities becomes additions of weights , and the likeliest leaf has the minimum weight path .
So here 's the definition of a search tree .
I 've given both leaves and edges weights : ( Compare with this .) is short for ' lower bound ' .
It provides a lower bound for the total weight of any option in this subtree ( assuming non-negative weights ) .
The tree in the diagram would look like :
This tree is a container in a straightforward way and so we can make it an instance of But it's also a monad .
maps all of the elements of a tree to trees in their own right , and then grafts those trees into the parent tree :
It 's easy to make trees into aby simply grafting trees into a new root .
is meant to be a monoid , but this operation , as written below , is n't precisely associative .
But it 's ' morally ' associative in that two terms that are meant to be equal describe equivalent search trees .
So I 'm not going to lose any sleep over it : For our searching we 'll need a priority queue .
I 'll use a skew tree with code I lifted from somewhere I 've forgotten :
At each stage in the search we 'll pick the unexplored branch with the lowest total weight so far .
So when we compare trees we 'll compare on their lower bounds .
So we need an ordering on the trees as follows :
The real cost of a choice is n't just the weight immediately visible in the tree but the cost of the journey you took to get there .
We use thefunction to put that extra cost into the part of the tree we 're currently looking at :
The only tricky aspect to this code is that we need to be able to handle infinite trees .
We can't have our code simply go off and return when it 's found the next match because it might not be possible to do so in a finite time .
Instead , the code needs to perform one operation at a time and report what it found at each point , even if that report is just stalling for time .
We do this by returning a ( possibly infinite ) list containing elements that are either ( 1 ) the next item found or ( 2 ) a new update giving more information about the lower bound of the cost of any item that might be yet to come .
This allows the caller to bail out of the search once the cost has passed a certain threshold .
( Returning a useless looking constructor to stall for time is a common design pattern in Haskell .
It 's an example of how programs that work with codata need to keep being productive and you get something similar with the - | Skip| - in Stream Fusion .
First time I write the code I failed to do this and kept wondering why my infinite searches would just hang , despite my great efforts to make it as lazy as possible . )
A quick test of an infinite search : finding Pythagorean triples by brute force .
We give each integer as cost one more than the previous one : I guess this is actually Dijkstra 's algorithm , but on a tree rather than a general graph .
If you run test1 you 'll notice how the output is noisy because of all thoseterms .
If you 'e not worried about non-termination you could just throw out redundant output like so :
Might as well convert weights to probabilities while we 're at it :
This version should be a lot less chatty :
Now that searching works I can turn to an application - a more sophisticated example of what I briefly looked at previously ) , parsing with ambiguous grammars .
So let me first build types to represent parsed sentences in a toy grammar :
The following two are noun phrase and prepositional phrase :
And entire sentences :
We want to be able to print parsed sentences so here 's a quick ' unparse ' type class to recover the underlying string :
Now I 'm going to approach the problem of parsing ambiguous sentences in two ways .
One will be efficient , and one will be inefficient but represent the ' ground truth ' against which we 'll compare .
( This reflects standard practice in graphics publications where authors compare their fancy new algorithm with an ultra- slow but reliable Monte Carlo ray - tracer . )
I 'm going to assume that sentences in my language are described by a " context free " probability distribution so that a noun phrase , say , has a fixed probability of being made up of each possible combination of constituents regardless of the context in which it appears .
I need an English word for something that takes a grammar and does something with it but I 'm at a loss to think of an example .
I 'll use ' transducer ' , even though I do n't think that 's right .
So a transducer is built from either terminal nodes of one character , or it's one of a choice of transducers , each with a given probability :
And here 's our toy grammar .
It 's nothing like an actual natural language because real grammars take a long time to get right .
Note I 'm just giving the first couple of type signatures to show that the grammar uses only theandinterfaces :
So , for example , a noun has a 50 % chance of being the stringand a 50 % chance of being the stringSome of our " parts of speech " allow sequences of terms .
We need some kind of probabilistic model of how many such terms we can expect .
I 'm going to assume the probability falls off exponentially with the number of items : I also have a convenience function for sequences of length at least 1 : And now the rest of the grammar :
We 're going to use this grammar with two instances of type Transducer .
The first will use the rules of the grammar as production rules to generate random sentences .
The second will parse strings using the grammar .
So we get two uses from one ' transducer ' .
This is pretty powerful : we have described the grammar in an abstract way that does n't asuume any particular use for it .
Let 's implement the generation first :
We can test it by generating a bunch of random sentences :
We can now use generate - and - test to estimate what proportion of randomly generated sentences match a given sentence :
On the other hand we can build a parser , based on Hutton 's , just like in my previous post except using this new tree search monad :
And now we can try running both methods on the same string :
You should see the parsings from countResults in roughly the same proportion as the relative probabilities given by findParse .
Remember that the relative probability of a given parsing is the lastterm before that parsing .
Try playing with , the number of Monte Carlo runs and the seed .
Remember that there is going to be some variation in the randomised algorithm , especially with hard to parse strings , but raising the number of runs will eventually give reasonable numbers .
Of course ultimately we do n't care about the Monte Carlo method so it 's allowed to be slow .
Anyway , none of this is a new algorithm .
You can find similar things in papers such as Probabilistic tree transducers and A Generalization of Dijkstra 's Algorithm .
But what is cool is how easily Haskell allows us to decouple the tree building part from the searching part .
( And of course the tree is never fully built , it 's built and destroyed lazily as needed . )
All of the published algorithms have the parsing and searching hopelessly interleaved so it's hard to see what exactly is going on .
Here the search algorithm does n't need to know anything about grammars , or even that it is searching for parsings .
Semiring Parsing is also easy to implement this way .
BTW
If you think my " ab " language is a bit to contrived , check out the last picture here for an example of some natural language that is in a similar spirit :-)

Just as a brief aside , it is sometimes entertaining to be a libertarian without an affiliation to either the Coke or Pepsi party .
It 's amazing , from the perspective of standing off to the side on a point of the political spectrum that most civics books do n't even acknowledge exists ** , how much of political discourse is team - loyalty politics rather than meaningful policy discussion .
The posts that happened to set me off down this path were a pair from Kevin Drum about poor Barney Frank having to meet rowdy protestors and a lament on the frustrations of cloture in the Senate , but I am not particularly singling him or the left out .
In fact , I read Drum because he is less bad on the team politics angle than others .
I force myself to read a couple of political blogs on the left and right to see what they are saying .
A few observations :
Both teams are absolutely convinced that they are occupying the high ground and it is the other side that is resulting to personal attacks , negative campaigning , astroturfing , whatever .
Seriously , its really hilarious -- I see exactly the same posts written about " our side is losing because we do n't resort to the low tactics of the other side " written by bloggers on both sides of the political spectrum on the same day .
Both teams are absolutely convinced that the media does not give their side the coverage or respect they deserve .
Both teams are guilty of trying to block dissent through clever rhetorical games without having to actually answer policy critiques .
Team red did it with the Iraq war , saying it was wrong to criticize a President in wartime , a useful concept when it is combined with the theory that the President can declare any time to be wartime .
Team blue takes a different approach , by claiming any opposing argument on subjects like climate or health care are being raised as part of plots funded by nefarious interest groups , and so therefore do n't deserve a response .
Both teams hold up wacky members of the opposing team 's fringes and attempt to portray them as representative of the mainstream opposition .
( OK , I may have been guilty of this once or twice myself )
Both teams can be loud and strident where they are energized and ticked off ( this is a good thing ) .
Both teams have recently compared the opposition president to Hitler .
Both teams have been " obstructionist " as the minority in Congress .
Both teams have dreamed of changing the filibuster rules in the Senate while in the majority .
Both teams have freaked at suggestions the filibuster rules in the Senate would be changed while in the minority .
Both teams have promised bipartisanship when they were in the majority and not delivered on it .
Both teams have members who are corrupt .
Both teams have members who have had affairs .
Both teams have supposed evil genius schemers in the background ( Rahm Emanuel meet Karl Rove ) .
Both teams have found it convenient to make concerted personal attacks on individual opponents ( Sarah Palin meet Bill Clinton ) .
Both teams have promised respect for the Constitution in the Executive office and not delivered on it .
Both teams have promised a less interventionist foreign policy and never delivered on it ( people forget GWB first campaigned almost as an isolationist against Clinton 's Kosovo interventions ) .
Both teams have Presidents who are addicted to signing statements .
Both teams have really gone after selected Supreme Court nominees .
Both teams have Congressmen who support ethanol subsidies , which thoughtful people agree are stupid .
Both teams have Congressmen who support farm subsidies , which thoughtful people agree are stupid .
Both teams have Congressmen who support trade interventions ( e.g. sugar tariffs ) which thoughtful people agree are stupid .
Both teams have actively supported ratcheting up the war on drugs , which some thoughtful people may agree with but I think is stupid .
Both teams have voted in the last 15 years for major government interventions in medicine , education , and limitations on personal freedoms in the name of security .
When team blue was in power , it supported a law that was basically the Patriot Act , but had it voted down due to team red opposition .
When team red was in power , it forcefully pushed through the Patriot Act which it had previously opposed , this time against the opposition of team blue members who had previously supported it .
All this is not to say that libertarians are necessarily better people .
If we had a real team that was n't a political joke , we 'd probably engage in similar behaviors .
Of course , the difference is that we would be trying to lower the stakes of the political game rather than continue to raise them .
** Footnote : I do n't know about you , but my civics textbooks in elementary school described a 2 - dimensional political spectrum that ran from " fascism " on the political right to " communism " at the extreme of the left .
How does a libertarian even place himself on a spectrum that ranges from totalitarian statism to totalitarian statism ?
I have n't seen such textbooks lately , so I do n't know if this " heads statism wins , tails freedom loses " approach to the political spectrum still exists .
By the way , I have been reading a book called The Vampire Economy by Gunter Reimann , published in 1939 .
It is a description of the economic policy of Nazi Germany , a subject that gets very little coverage because , frankly , later Nazi atrocities are such a magnet for attention .
I challenge anyone to read that book and find any substantial point of differentiatoin between Hitler 's economy and a strongly socialist country .
And the section on strong - arming the banking industry for political goals was especially entertaining the context of the last 2 administrations .
Hitler approached his later war with Russia as an ideological war to the finish between polar opposites , but in fact it was really a feud between blood brothers .

June 5 , 2009 -- Federal authorities in Utah search for a man who allegedly made threats against President Obama .
Daniel James Murray has been charged with making threats against Obama , after telling a bank teller he was part of a " mission " to kill the president .
The Secret Service says Murray has at least eight registered firearms .
His whereabouts are unknown .
Murray entered Zion 's First National Bank in St. George , Utah , May 19 , to open a savings account with an $ 85,000 check , according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Salt Lake City today .
Murray allegedly asked if the bank was solvent and then stated , according to the complaint , " With all this mess going on under President Obama with banks and the economy , I 'm sure if citizens happen to lose their money , they will rise up and we could see killing and deaths . "
On May 27 , the complaint states , Murray came back to withdraw $ 12,698 from his savings account .
He did not have proper identification and was told he needed it to complete the transaction .
He allegedly said , " Not to be disrespectful , but if I do n't get this money , someone is going to die . "
The bank manager allowed the transaction , and Murray allegedly demanded bills smaller than $ 50 in nonsequential order .
Murray then said , " We are on a mission to kill the president of the United States , " according to the complaint .
Murray told the teller during that visit , the complaint added , " We are 94 million miles from the sun , and are in - between the sun and moon , and the eagle that flies between them , and it 's a giant step for mankind .
... I have traveled thousands of miles to be here and know things that are going to happen .
...
The banking system will fail and people will die .
...
There will be chaos in the world . "
The next day , according to the complaint , Murray withdrew the remaining $ 72,000 and closed his account .
Murray 's location is unknown , the complaint said .
He is believed to be driving a blue 2001 Buick LeSabre with New York plates that read " ERL 1445 , " and are registered in his name .
Murray originally is from New York , but he has recently been in California , Utah , Georgia , Oklahoma and possibly Texas .
" There are at least eight firearms registered to Murray , ranging from semi-automatic pistols to revolvers , some capable of carrying 15 rounds of ammunition and easy to conceal , " the complaint said .
A Secret Service spokesman said there will be no further comment on the case because it involves protective intelligence .
" This is one of a gazillion cases , " the spokesman told ABC News .
" It 's not that out of the ordinary .
We see this day in and day out . "
CNN has video of a protester carrying an AR - 15 semi-automatic assault rifle outside an Obama event in Phoenix , Arizona today .
The gunman told the media that the gun was loaded .
CNN's
White House correspondent said he saw several other people carrying guns including another anti-Obama protester with an AR - 15 who was screaming about socialism .
The Associated Press is reporting that a dozen people were openly carrying guns outside the Obama event .
This is the third gun-related incident at a presidential speaking engagement in the space of a week .
It 's legal to openly carry a firearm in Arizona .
So what ?
Taking a loaded assault rifle to a protest is naked intimidation .
Whoever is organizing these militia mental midgets needs to call them off right now .
They may be within their legal rights , but their behavior is profoundly anti-democratic .
Republican senator Thad Coburn went on TV yesterday to say that the state deserves the anger of teabaggers because it has made these people believe that they are about to lose control of their government .
That kind of rhetoric plays into the paranoid fantasies of gun nuts steeped in the idea that they should use their guns in defense of liberty .
Notice how Coburn and GOP leaders in polite company couch these statements in terms of what people think , as if they had no responsibility to tell their followers the truth or deescalate the situation in any way .
If they had any interest in discourse or even safety , they would try to ratchet down the tensions by reminding people that just because they do n't agree with the president does n't mean he's on the verge of becoming a tyrant .
Clearly they do n't believe that Obama is an incipient dictator , they know he 's not even committed to serious heatlhcare reform .
He has already wavered on the public option .
In his more radical moments the president wants to give the insurance industry subsidies and force the public to buy more of its crappy products .
The GOP knows this perfectly well , but it wo n't exercise leadership to reign in its base .
On the contrary , it 's systematically and gleefully ratcheting up the tensions at every turn .
" People are concerned at the American way of life being threatened and business being vilified , " former White House spokesperson Dana Perino said of the furious protesters disrupting town halls around the country .
The fevered theories of the birthers also reinforce the perception among the president 's critics that Obama is not merely wrong but illegitimate .
Signs reading " death to Obama " and " it 's time to water the tree of liberty " have cropped up at town halls .
( Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that the tree of liberty must periodically be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants . )
Glenn Beck has been likening Obama to Hitler on the air and Sarah Palin has been insisting that the president wants to kill her baby with Downs Syndrome .
Between the sick rhetoric , the summer heat , and the guns , it 's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt .
Republicans and their lobbyist allies are riling up the militiamen .
They do n't care who gets hurt as long as the insurance industry 's profits are safe .

Time is money , that ’s one of the oldest English sentences I learned .
I guess I was n’t even in school , and I remember I knew the meaning of this .
And keep in mind that English is not my primary language , I was born and raised Romanian .
Years after , I still surprise myself thinking in these terms .
There is a common understanding that your time is one of your most precious assets , so you should take good care of it .
Interestingly enough , this happens mostly in Western cultures , Â Eastern cultures seems to have a more relaxed attitude towards time .
But even more interesting is the fact that , despite the ubiquity of this saying , almost everybody tries to avoid its message .
Do n’t get me wrong , people are still putting a high value on time , making it a very precious asset , but almost nobody really treats time the same way they treats their money .
People are eager for free time , they are making a lot of effort to gain some extra time , but once they get it , they are wasting it instantly , in a way they will never do to their money .
In this post I ’ll try to share a few simple and easy ideas for really keeping your time safely in your wallet , the same way you do with your finances .
Keep it clean
If you are a person moderately rich , I bet your wallet looks like a pharmacy .
It ’s clean and ordered and you know in less than a second where to find the ten dollar bill , as well as the Mastercard you use for shopping only .
And even if you are not a moderately rich person , but you have a positive attitude towards money , I bet your wallet is clean and ordered .
I know mine is .
And I know I have quite a positive attitude towards money .
So why do n’t we do the same with our time ?
For me , that translates in a very clean and ordered working routine .
If time will be sliced into ten , twenty and fifty dollars bills , I would know instantly how much do I have left , and where I find the needed bill every time I need it .
Slicing my time in ordered pieces , the same way I did with bills and cards in my wallet helped me a lot .
And is such a simple yet powerful analogy : keep your time as your wallet .
Spend only what you have
That , my friend , is very healthy advice .
Even if you will apply this only to money , it will make you happy at some point in your life .
I tried to keep myself away from credit , partly because I know I have a rather risky attitude ( by the way , after 10 years of entrepreneurship and successful business , I still like to embrace risks ) , and partly because I just did n’t feel well about it .
That saved me several times in difficult situations , most of them business related , like a tight cashflow or a bad market .
If I would have credit in those situations , my life would have been much more difficult .
But when you translate this habit into time management , well , you will discover some interesting stuff .
Spending only the time you have means to do what you have to , when you have to .
Working late hours , for instance , will be a violation of this percept .
Because you will be spending the time you simply do n’t have for work .
Even if it seems it ’s for work , it is n’t , it ’s your personal time .
And by using this time for working , you are making a credit .
You take by credit from your free time and pour it into work time .
Yeap , you know that already : sooner or later you ’ll have to pay that credit .
With interest , of course .
Buy only what you can afford
Although this seems a repetition of the previous habit , there is a subtle difference .
In this case , you do spend only what you have .
But if you are spending only what you have to buy a thing that you ca n’t afford , well , that ’s bad .
If you give all your paycheck for a fantastic trip to Hawaii , when you get back you ’ll be in a rather tricky situation : you had the time of your life , but your life needs some fast cash , or you ’ll be in trouble with those bills …
It ’s the fact that you should correctly evaluate your financial capacity and keep your spending under control .
Now translate this for time management : whenever you have a chunk of free time , try to slip in only what you can do in that chunk of time , not more .
This comes to correctly evaluate your working and time consumption capacity and keep your procrastination under control .
You might want to stretch that piece of time , but you really can’t .
You ca n’t stretch a ten dollar bill into a twenty dollar bill , so you wo n’t be able to make an hour from twenty minutes .
Do n’t try to bargain for it , it wo n’t work .
Save some time
Every intelligent people know the importance of the savings .
Making deposits , investing in trust funds , buying stocks from profitable businesses , all of these are savings activities .
By doing this constantly you ensure that your money wo n’t get devalued and that you can also make some profit out of it .
It ’s a clever move .
And I bet you put a lot of effort into finding the best way to save your money .
And also you do enjoy spending your savings , right ?
But I ’m not so sure if you ’re doing the same way with your time .
Have you ever thought to save some time for yourself ?
Have you ever thought to manage your activities in a flexible schedule , so you can quickly step out from the routine and take some time off ?
Saving the time for yourself is highly rewarding .
If you have money deposits or other type of investments that are doing well , why not starting to invest in some time for yourself ?
Time for personal development , or for leisure , or for family , or just for enjoying life .
Once spent , stop thinking about it
Whenever I buy something , I never look back .
That ’s another healthy habit I have about money .
I do n’t have regrets or second thoughts .
If it proves expensive after I bought it , well , so be it , I ’ll bargain better next time .
But once spent , I never think about that money again .
I only focus on what ’s left in my wallet , or on what I can attract by using my skills .
If you think at money as raw energy , you ’ll understand that once declined into matter , that energy is gone for good .
So once transformed in goods , that money cease to exist , is literally dead .
And is so much healthier to focus on life than on death , do n’t you think ?
Well , try to do the same with your time .
Never look back , never have second thoughts , never regret something , Whatever that was in the past , those times are gone .
Of course , you can enjoy memories , you ’ll always have that , but if you constantly live surrounded by memories , you ’ll lost connection with this present time .
You ’ll not actually live this life , you ’ll not allow to the time to manifest into your existence .
So , leave the past in the past , and do n’t fantasize too much about the future , this present time you are living in it right now is actually all you have .
Use the best tools
You ’re searching the best banks for your money .
You ’re buying the best consultancy services and apply for the best credit card deals .
Great !
So you ’re actually using the best tools for your money .
Because it is so important to you , right ?
You just ca n’t afford to have nothing but the best .
But do you do the same with your time ?
Do you even have tools for managing your time ?
In the last 10 years I used a variety of tools for time management , starting form paper based systems , to complex digital setups .
But I gradually invested in better and better time management systems and processes .
I learned the Getting Things Done methodology , which is a great process for time management ( and even more ) , and I invested in state of the art tools for implementing GTD .
I try to use nothing but the best to organize my time .
Yeap , because it is so important to me , and I ca n’t afford nothing but the best for it .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  Pakistan is objecting to expanded American combat operations in neighboring Afghanistan , creating new fissures in the alliance with Washington at a critical juncture when thousands of new American forces are arriving in the region .
Pakistani officials have told the Obama administration that the Marines fighting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan will force militants across the border into Pakistan , with the potential to further inflame the troubled province of Baluchistan , according to Pakistani intelligence officials .
Pakistan does not have enough troops to deploy to Baluchistan to take on the Taliban without denuding its border with its archenemy , India , the officials said .
Dialogue with the Taliban , not more fighting , is in Pakistan ’s national interest , they said .
The Pakistani account made clear that even as the United States recommits troops and other resources to take on a growing Taliban threat , Pakistani officials still consider India their top priority and the Taliban militants a problem that can be negotiated .
In the long term , the Taliban in Afghanistan may even remain potential allies for Pakistan , as they were in the past , once the United States leaves .

The animations were designed by copying the pattern of real chimps ' yawns
Yawning is so contagious that chimpanzees can " catch " it from cartoons , according to research .
Scientists from Emory University in Atlanta , US , have discovered that an animation of a yawning chimp will stimulate real chimps to yawn .
They describe in the Royal Society journal , Proceedings B , how this could assist in the future study of empathy .
The work could also help unravel if and how computer games might cause children to imitate what they see on screen .
Previous studies have already shown contagious yawning in chimpanzees - stimulated by video - recorded footage of yawns .
" We wanted to expand on that , " explained Matthew Campbell , a researcher from Emory University 's Yerkes National Primate Research Center and lead author of the study .
" We 're interested in using animation for presenting stimuli to animals , because we can control all the features of what we show them , " he continued .
One possibility is to look at what factors in animations promote more or less imitation
Matthew Campbell , Emory University Although Dr Campbell does n't think the chimps were " fooled " by the animations into thinking they were looking at real chimps , he explained that there was evidence that chimpanzees " process animated faces the same way they process photographs of faces " .
He said : " It 's not a real chimpanzee , but it kind of looks like a chimpanzee , and they 're responding to that . "
He and his team , including Devyn Carter who designed the animations , showed the animals the yawning sequences .
" We also had the animations doing other movements with their mouths that the chimps often do , " he said .
" The chimps showed a lot more yawning during the yawn video than when the control videos were playing .
He told BBC News that the only way he and his colleagues could explain the " very strong difference " they saw was that seeing the yawns was making the animals yawn .
On screen Chimps are social animals and respond to facial expressions
This is an introductory experiment that the researchers say has demonstrated the utility of animations in behavioural experiments .
In his future work , Dr Campbell would like to pin down exactly how these measurable behaviours are related to the more difficult to measure phenomenon of empathy .
" We 'd like to know more about behaviours related to empathy , like consolation - when an individual does something nice to the victim of aggression , " he told BBC News .
" So we want to see if our good contagious yawners are also good consolers . "
As well as tracing the development of empathy in our primate relatives , the research could have a more direct human perspective .
" There 's a lot of concern about children and what they see on TV and the video games they play , so one possibility is to look at what factors in animations promote more or less imitation in non-humans , " said Dr Campbell .
" So if we make the animations more realistic , are we going to get more contagious yawning out of the chimpanzees ?
" And does that imply that realism promotes mimicry ?
If so , that could be really useful for work with humans as well . "

U.S. Military Working to ' Kill or Capture ' 50 Taliban Drug Lords Senate report says new Obama admin strategy includes ' assassination ' hit list .
August 10 , 2009  --
In a dramatic change of policy ordered by the Obama administration , the U.S. military has been given approval to " kill or capture " 50 Taliban - connected drug lords whose names are on a classified " kill list " being circulated to commanders , according to a report prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and obtained by ABCNews.com .
Military officials expressed anger today that the " classified program " had been revealed in the Senate report .
Click here to read the full report .
A Department of Defense spokesman , Bryan Whitman , declined to comment on the target list , but said " where terrorists do interface with drug networks that produces a security threat , a force protection threat , and is a legitimate target in those regards . "
Senate investigators were told military commanders have been given , for the first time , the green light to " remove from the battlefield " the 50 drug lords on the kill list , which also includes another 317 Taliban and al Qaeda figures .
U.S. military commanders told Senate investigators that their classified rules of engagement and recognized Law of War " have been interpreted to allow them to put drug traffickers with proven links to the insurgency " on the kill list , called the " joint integrated prioritized target list . "
The report said the military placed " no restrictions on the use of force with these selected targets " but said the military does not " authorize targeted assassinations away from the battlefield . "
Commanders said the standard for inclusion on the list included two " verifiable human sources and additional evidence . "
" It gives them legal authority to assassinate , " said one person involved in the military 's briefing for the committee , headed by Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) .
Investigators said a new study found that the Taliban collected about $ 125 million a year in taxes and protection money from the heroin traffickers and growers .
U.S. officials in Afghanistan reported an " absence of any concerted effort " by the CIA " to monitor the money movement between traffickers and insurgents . "
" I have to ring their neck to get anything out of them , " a senior official at the U.S. embassy in Kabul said , according to the report .
Karzai Denies Connection to Afghanistan's Heroin Business
The report also concludes that corruption at " district , provincial and national levels " of the Afghanistan government seriously compromises the Obama 's administration 's strategy to assign a higher priority to counter - narcotics efforts .
There have been recurring allegations and circumstantial evidence that the brother of Afghan President Harmad Karzai is closely linked with major heroin traffickers but the Senate report said the U.S. had yet to produce evidence that could be used in court .
An unnamed U.S. General told investigators , " We all assume that he is totally corrupt and engaged in the drug trade but when you ask for the portfolio , we do n't have it . "
Investigators said U.S. intelligence agencies had gathered evidence against Karzai 's brother through the use of electronic intercepts but that the information could not be shared with the Afghans or used in court because the method of collection was top secret .
President Karzai and his brother have repeatedly denied any connection to the country 's heroin business .
" I never was in drug business , " the President 's brother told ABC News in a 2006 interview .
" I never benefited .
I never facilitated . "
As President Karzai seeks re-election next month , he has reportedly pardoned the nephew of his campaign manager and four other soldiers convicted of transporting $ 3 million worth of heroin to the U.S .
Also cited by U.S. authorities in Afghanistan is the case of a regional governor who was found with nine tons of opium in his office but allowed to resign and take a new position in the Afghan Senate .
He was never charged with a crime .
In another example of the pervasive drug corruption , a U.S. State Department official told the Senate investigators that police chiefs in poppy growing areas " pay as much as $ 100,000 to get appointed to a job that pays $ 150 a month , with the knowledge that they will recoup far more in bribes and kickbacks . "
Heroin Industry in Afghanistan
Afghanistan now accounts for 90 percent of all the heroin sold in the world and the report estimates the profits for the traffickers to be between $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a year .
More than half of the significant attacks on coalition troops and Afghan soldiers occurred in the southern provinces , where the report said poppy cultivation and heroin manufacturing are concentrated .
Yet , according to the report , for most of the eight years since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , American and NATO forces " ignored the drug trade flourishing in front of their eyes . "
Senate investigators found that the months - old Obama administration strategy " is still developing , and years of neglect must be undone . "
But the report said the U.S. military is finally learning to work alongside agents from the DEA , who previously had been given short shrift by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his top generals .
" No longer are U.S. commanders arguing that going after the drug lords is not part of their mandate , " the report said .

The Truth Will Not Out , on Its Own
The right - wing fury at town hall meetings over health care and the Republican obstruction of any serious reform in Washington are not just symptoms of a complex debate on an issue packed with powerful special interests ; it is a test of whether reality matters in the United States .
Email

When a supposedly “ moderate ” Republican like Sen.
Chuck Grassley of Iowa endorses the crazed view of the “ deathers ” who claim that President Barack Obama ’s health - care plan would promote euthanasia , it is clear that the nation ’s problem is bigger than any one legislative battle , even one as big as health reform .
The overriding question has become whether the United States – as a representative democracy – is on the verge of losing its sanity .
And this is not the first time this question has arisen recently .
Only seven years ago , much of the American population was persuaded that Iraq was some lethal threat to the United States .
Then , there was fear - mongering about Iraq somehow sending small remote - controlled airplanes across the Atlantic Ocean and over the United States to spray chemical and biological weapons on the American people .
There were wildly exaggerated ( indeed , false ) alarms about Iraq developing a nuclear bomb that would be given to al - Qaeda .
Some of this Iraq War craziness tracked Vice President Dick Cheney ’s view that if there were a one percent chance of a threat to the United States , that possibility needed to be treated as a certainty – a mad - hatter approach to the world that would guarantee endless warfare seeking to erase hypothetical dangers while creating an endless array of other one percent risks .
There is a direct lineage from the Iraq War hysteria to the current madness surrounding the health - care fight .
In both cases , the hysteria was stoked by leading Republicans and their right - wing media allies .
Both involved disseminating farfetched , nightmare scenarios to a gullible ( if not paranoid ) segment of the population , which was then whipped into a frenzy that spilled over into intimidation and silencing voices of disagreement .
Regarding the Iraq War , any skepticism toward George W. Bush ’s version of the facts was greeted with anger , from crushing Dixie Chicks CDs because of their criticism of the President , to condemning former weapons inspector Scott Ritter as a traitor for doubting Bush ’s WMD claims , to pouring French wine into gutters in protest over France ’s cautionary advice on Iraq .
Today , anti-health - reform protesters disrupt town halls held by Democratic lawmakers , shouting down pro-reform arguments , issuing direct and indirect threats of violence , and escalating attacks on Obama , including preposterous depictions of the President as Adolf Hitler .
Failure to Push Back
One can surely trace this pattern of Republican - Right behavior even further back ( see , for instance , Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Palin ’s ' Death Panels ' and GOP Lying ” ) , but the key point is that the response from sane Americans remains inadequate to this angry irrationality .
Some rational Americans , it seems , have their own erroneous beliefs that justify inaction .
Over the years , I ’ve often heard the hopeful slogans that “ the truth will out ” or that “ the pendulum will swing back , ” when the reality is that there are no automatic mechanisms for stopping lies and distortions .
Truth is a battle , much as democracy is .
Bringing truth to light requires resources and infrastructure , as well as personal honesty and courage .
That is especially true when the other side in the battle has opted for a strategy of falsehoods and exaggerations – and has assembled both powerful artillery and well - trained mercenaries to carry out what it calls “ information warfare . ”
In such a conflict , there is no guarantee or even a likelihood that the “ truth will out , ” at least not on its own .
Nor is there any reason to believe some mythical pendulum will restore a normal order .
What I have seen during more than three decades in Washington is that many truths remain effectively hidden , even if technically they have been revealed .
A rare moment of truth - telling can be easily overwhelmed by a steady barrage of falsehoods and an infusion of well - calibrated doubts .
Before long , it is the oft - repeated faux reality that is remembered .
It becomes Washington ’s conventional wisdom and then the official history .
[ See , for instance , Robert Parry ’s Lost History . ]
In the United States today , there is a massive infrastructure for spreading lies and distortions – a right - wing media machine that reaches from newspapers , magazines and books to cable TV , talk radio and the Internet .
By simple repetition , this machine can transform any crazy theory or bald - faced lie into something that many Americans believe .
We saw this happen when the right - wing media – supported by many neoconservatives in the mainstream press – pushed the lies about Iraq ’s WMD and intimated that Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein was connected to the 9/11 attacks .
As the drumbeat for the Iraq War began in earnest seven years ago , large segments of the American population were persuaded by President Bush ’s lies .
Even years later , huge numbers of Americans continued to believe that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 and that U.S. forces actually had found Iraq ’s fictitious WMD stockpiles .
Today , a similar phenomenon is playing out on health - care reform .
A well - funded and well - organized right - wing infrastructure is pouring out deceptive talking points and hitting emotional hot buttons .
Like during the run-up to the Iraq War , the opposing forces seeking to make rational arguments and counter the hysteria find themselves out - gunned and out - maneuvered .
Death Panels
The imbalance is perhaps most clearly on display in what may be the most extreme case – the Right ’s successful use of the absurd notion that health - care reform equates with government - mandated euthanasia for the elderly and the disabled .
The right - wing attack line derived from a well - meaning proposal initially advocated by Sen.
Johnny Isakson , a Republican from Georgia who wanted to make sure that doctors would be reimbursed if the elderly or members of their families sought counseling about end - of - life issues .
Isakson ’s idea ended up in the House version of health - care reform .
This provision then was twisted by medical - industry defenders into some sinister government plot to impose euthanasia and the lie quickly spread via the right - wing media .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin elevated the lie to national prominence in a Facebook posting that claimed the goal was to have “ my parents or my baby with Down Syndrone … stand in front of Obama ’s ‘ death panel ’ so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ‘ level of productivity in society ’ whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . ”
Rather than repudiate Palin ’s false and outlandish claim , other leading Republicans , such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , defended her .
“ You are asking us to trust turning power over to the government , when there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia , including selective standards , ” Gingrich said on ABC News ’
“ This Week ” on Aug. 9 .
Some hopeful Democrats still believed that thoughtful Republicans – steeped in the details of the health - care debate – would break from the madness .
But Sen .
Grassley , whom President Obama has praised for participating in bipartisan talks on health care , sided with the so - called “ deathers . ”
At an Aug. 12 town hall in Winterset , Iowa , Grassley told some 300 constituents that “ you have every right to fear ” the provision in the House bill regarding end - of - life counseling , adding that the country “ should not have a government - run plan to decide when to pull the plug on grandma , ” While this insane notion of government “ death panels ” continues to spread , there is far less attention to the current reality that countless thousands of Americans are facing premature death because the for - profit health insurance industry wo n’t give sick people coverage , either by citing “ pre-existing conditions ” or pricing the infirmed out of the insurance market .
In other words , the Palin - Gingrich - Grassley crowd raise the specter of imaginary government - run “ death panels , ” while actual “ death panels ” are being run today by the insurance industry .
That reality was underscored by the thousands of Americans lining up at the Forum in Inglewood , California , for free health care provided by Remote Area Medical , a group of volunteer doctors who normally provide treatment in Third World countries .
As embarrassing as these images are to the wealthy United States , they represent painful proof of the health - care crisis .
Yet , what is becoming apparent about the health - care debate – just like the run-up to war with Iraq – is that reality has been devalued if not discarded by one side of the battle in favor of propaganda and fear - mongering .
Republicans appear to have made the calculation that their right - wing media allies and riled - up listeners can dominate the debate with scary rhetoric and unruly tactics .
The secondary assumptions are that the mainstream news media will be intimidated into a mindless even - handedness even toward blatant lies – and that the Democrats will wilt under the pressure .
For many years now , mainstream U.S. jounalists have cowered in career fear over the risk of offending the Right .
Already , some newscasters are playing into Republican hands by refusing to repudiate the health - care lies directly , instead treating the fabrications as points disputed by the White House .
In other words , the media talking heads say , some people think the health - care legislation creates “ death panels ” to kill the old and the sick , but the White House insists that it has no plans for “ death panels . ”
Another part of the GOP thinking is that Americans who favor facts and reason still wo n’t invest in building a media infrastructure to fight for reality , that well - meaning liberals and progressives wo n't arms themselves for " information warfare , " that they will just trust that truth will somehow emerge on its own or that a magical pendulum will swing the country back into balance .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : gitit 0.6.1
I 'm pleased to announce the release of gitit 0.6.1 .
Gitit is a wiki program that runs on happstack , the Haskell web application server stack , and stores pages and other content in a git or darcs filestore .
The wiki can be updated either directly through the VCS or through gitit's web interface .
Pages can be written in ( extended ) markdown , reStructuredText , HTML , or LaTeX , and exported in ten different formats .
TeX math is rendered using MathML by default , and syntax highlighting is provided for over fifty languages .
demo : http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net manual : http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net/README api : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit-0.6.1 code : http://github.com/jgm/gitit bugs : http://code.google.com/p/gitit/issues/list group : http://groups.google.com/group/gitit-discuss
Here is how you can install and run gitit .
You 'll need GHC and cabal - install .
If you do n't have these , install the Haskell Platform < http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>.
Then : cabal update cabal install gitit mkdir mywiki cd mywiki gitit # now browse to http://localhost:5001
Or , if you want to change the defaults ( say , reStructured Text instead of markdown , or darcs instead of git ) : gitit -- print - default - config > gitit.conf # edit gitit.conf , which is self - documenting gitit -f gitit.conf
The whole code base has been overhauled since the last release .
Gitit is now faster , more memory efficient , more modular , and more secure .
It also has many new features , including - page metadata and categories - atom feeds ( sitewide and per-page ) - support for literate Haskell - a better configuration system - an improved caching system - a Haskell library exporting happstack wiki handlers - a plugin system
The last two items are the most exciting and deserve special comment .
First , in addition to providing an executable , gitit now provides a library , Network .
Gitit , which makes it easy to include a gitit wiki ( or many of them ) in any happstack application .
It is even possible to use the containing application 's authentication system for the wiki .
Second , gitit can now be extended through plugins , short Haskell programs that are loaded dynamically when the server starts .
For examples of the things that can be done with plugins , see the plugins directory , which contains ( among other things ) a plugin for adding graphviz diagrams to pages and a plugin for adding interwiki links .
For a full description of the plugin system , see the haddock documentation for Network .
Gitit .
Interface .
Full changes from version 0.5.3 , as well as upgrade instructions , are available in the file CHANGES .
Thanks are due to - the happstack team , for big improvements in happstack - server that make it much easier to work with , - the darcs team , for using gitit / darcsit for < http://wiki.darcs.net>, giving gitit a real - world test , - Gwern Branwen , who helped to optimize gitit , wrote the InterwikiPlugin , and wrote the guts of the Feed module , - Simon Michael , who contributed several patches , - Henry Laxen , who added support for password resets and helped with the apache proxy instructions , - Anton van Straaten , who made the process of page generation more modular by adding Gitit .
ContentTransformer , - Robin Green , who helped improve the plugin API and interface , fixed a security problem with the reset password code , and made saving of the user 's file more robust , - Thomas Hartman , who helped improve the index page , making directory browsing persistent , - Kohei Ozaki , who contributed the ImgTexPlugin , - mightybyte , who suggested making gitit available as a library , and contributed a patch to the authentication system , - and everyone else who contributed suggestions and bug reports .
Es gibt eine ganz einfache Methode , aus Texten über das schlimme Internet die Luft herauszulassen .
Man ersetze in ihnen einfach „ digital “ durch „ analog “ und „ Netz “ durch „ Welt “ und schaue , ob die Aussagen trotzdem stimmen .
An einem zentralen Absatz der aktuellen „ Spiegel “ - Titelgeschichte lässt sich das ganz gut demonstrieren :
Im Netz In der Welt tost nicht nur Karneval , es herrscht auch Krieg .
Der Cyberspace Die Welt des 21 .
Jahrhunderts ist in der Hand von globalen Playern des Kommerzes , Finanzjongleuren , wirtschaftlichen und politischen Tyrannen .
Die Grauzonen dieser neuen Weltordnung werden vom organisierten Verbrechen genutzt .
Während an der Oberfläche des digitalen analogen Reichs tausend bunte Blumen blühen , Shopping , Chats , Schöngeistiges , wuchert im Wurzelwerk darunter ein Pilzgeflecht aus Intrigen , Täuschung und Terror .
Passt .
Was der „ Spiegel “ als bemerkenswerte Eigenart des Internet beschwört , ist also nur eine allgemeine Zustandsbeschreibung unserer Welt .
Man hätte im konkreten Fall natürlich auf den
Test auch verzichten können , weil das Nachrichtenmagazin im nächsten Satz versucht , einen tatsächlichen Gegensatz zwischen „ Netz “ und „ Welt “ aufzubauen , und kläglich scheitert :
Das Netz , so sehen es manche , bedroht den Frieden der Welt .
Der Friede der
Welt ist bedroht ??
Nein , halt : Es herrscht ein Friede der Welt ??
Ich wüsste gerne , ob die Menschen in der Dokumentation des „ Spiegel “ wenigstens kurz in sich hineingekichert haben , als sie das lasen , bevor sie sich wieder an die anderen Artikel im Heft über Piraten , Terroristen , den „ Kriegseinsatz von Ärzten “ , ein „ Kriegsverbrechertribunal für Bangladesh “ , Vergewaltigungen als „ Alltag des Krieges “ im Kongo , die „ tödliche Logik der Gewalt “ in Nahost und „ Hollywoods Kampf gegen den Irak - Krieg “ setzten .
Die
These des Aufmachers lautet etwa : „ Das Internet ist kein rechtsfreier Raum , kann aber leicht mit einem verwechselt werden “ , möglicherweise aber auch : „ Das Internet ist ein rechtsfreier Raum , müsste das aber nicht bleiben “ , ganz genau ist das nicht auszumachen .
Das Stück gehört zum beliebten „ Spiegel “ - Multi - Autoren - Genre , in dem das Hauptziel ist , so viele Namen , Zitate und Faktenfetzen wie möglich in einem
Text unterzubringen , die dann notdürftig miteinander verbunden werden .
Argumentative Stringenz ist dabei natürlich optional .
So packen die Redakteure die Geschichte des Buchhändlers Amazon , der von ihm illegal verkaufte digitale Bücher auf den Lesegeräten seiner Kunden kürzlich löschte , in das Kapitel , in dem sie behaupten , dass der „ digitale Fortschritt die zivilisierte Welt in die Zeit der Selbstjustiz , des Faustrechts zurückführen könnte “ .
Dabei ist der Fall ein interessantes Beispiel für das Gegenteil .
Dass es unendlich dumm war von Amazon , die Bücher einfach zu löschen , ist das eine .
Das andere ist : dass Amazon womöglich im Recht war .
Wer gutgläubig Diebesgut kauft , hat keinen Anspruch darauf , es behalten zu dürfen .
Im „ wahren Leben “ kommt dann zwar auch nicht der Buchhändler und holt ein solches Buch aus dem Regal .
Aber das Recht gilt , es lässt sich bloß nicht oder nur unter größten Mühen durchsetzen .
Mit anderen Worten : Die analoge
Welt ist ein rechtsfreier Raum .
( Warten Sie nicht auf die entsprechende „ Spiegel “ - Titelgeschichte . )
Es gäbe unendlich viele solche Beispiele , auf die man aber natürlich nicht kommt , wenn man gleich am Anfang des Artikels die analoge Welt als Friedensidyll beschrieben hat .
Bei allem gelegentlichen Versuch zum Differenzieren verlässt der „ Spiegel “ - Artikel auf seinen Millionen Zeilen an kaum einer Stelle die Grundannahme , dass es darum gehe , das Internet soweit zu zähmen , dass es so frei und zivilisiert wird wie der Rest der Welt .
Dass viele Mächtige , nicht nur in China , längst erfolgreich daran arbeiten , im Internet Dinge zu kontrollieren , auf die sie außerhalb des Netzes keinen Zugriff haben , passt nicht ins Denkmuster der „ Spiegel “ - Geschichte .
Dabei verbindet sich mit dem Internet genau so der Traum von der totalen Kontrolle wie der von der totalen Freiheit .
Perfide ist der
Text gleich am Anfang , als er erst beschreibt , wie ein Polizist im Internet gegen Kinderpornographie kämpft , und dann fortfährt :
Sie sind ganz schön weit , die Kämpfer um die staatliche Hoheit im Cyberspace .
Die an der anderen Front aber auch .
Die Flagge mit dem schwarzen Segel auf weißem Grund weht schon in unmittelbarer Nähe des Berliner Regierungszentrums : Die Piratenpartei hat Ende Juni ihr Wahlkampfbüro für die Bundestagswahl eröffnet .
„ Die an der anderen Front “ ?
Da muss man schon sehr genau aufpassen beim Lesen , um nicht zu denken , dass die Piratenpartei für den freien Zugang zu Kinderpornographie kämpft .
Was der „ Spiegel “ aber mit den merkwürdigen Sätzen meint , dass es mit Informationen im „ Paralleluniversum “ ( gemeint ist das Internet ) schlimmer sei „ als mit Atommüll “ ( „ Sie haben nicht einmal eine Halbwertszeit .
Im Internet gibt es keine Zeit und keinen Zerfall . “ ) , testet derweil eine „ Spiegel “ - Redakteurin mit einem denkwürdigen Auftritt im „ ZDF - Morgenmagazin “ :
Lesenwerte Auseinandersetzungen mit dem „ Spiegel “ - Titel :
Felix Schwenzel ( 1 ) : „ so ist das beim spiegel .
arschiges verhalten ist beim spiegel OK , bei anderen ist es vergleichbar mit dem wirken eines polizeistaates . “ ( wirres.net )
Felix Schwenzel ( 2 ) : „ schlimm und skandalös findet der spiegel auch , dass der urheber eines hassvideo gegen einen bayerischen lateinlehrer nie gefunden werden konnte .
nur ob das wirklich etwas mit dem internet zu tun haben muss oder vielleicht der mangelhaften welt in der wir leben ( oder gar schlechter polizeiarbeit ) , kommt den besorgten autoren nicht in den sinn .
ich erinner mich zum beispiel daran , dass die schüler die einem lehrer an meiner schule hundescheisse auf die winschutzscheibe und die lüftung schmierten ebenso wie die , die den vorgarten des direktors verwüsteten und sein haus mit klopaier schmückten , nicht identifiziert werden konnten . “ ( wirres.net )
Alexander Svensson : „ Dass das Domainnamensystem den Übergang vom Wissenschaftler - Internet zum globalen Netzwerk mit mehr als einer Milliarde Nutzern einigermaßen unbeschadet überstanden hat , ohne völlig auseinanderzufliegen , ist schon eine Leistung .
Was für ein Wahnsinn ist da ein Plädoyer , ICANN binnen zwei Monaten in „ eine supranationale unabhängige Instanz “ zu verwandeln und mit „ weitreichenden Befugnissen und Mitteln “ auszustatten , ohne auch nur einmal über Legitimation und Kontrolle zu reden , von den genauen Aufgaben ganz zu schweigen . “ ( „ Wortfeld “ )
Christian Stöcker : „ Insgesamt aber muss , wer das Internet für überwiegend schädlich hält , ein Menschenfeind sein .
Das Netz ist vor allem eins :
Der größte Informationsvermittler und - speicher , den die Menschheit jemals zur Verfügung hatte .
Vor nicht allzu langer Zeit herrschte im alten Europa noch Konsens darüber , dass mehr Information in der Regel besser ist als weniger Information .
Dass die Möglichkeit , Bildung und Wissen zu erwerben , begrüßenswert ist , dass die Welt dadurch zu einem besseren , freieren , womöglich glücklicheren
Ort wird .
Manchmal kann man dieser
Tage den Eindruck bekommen , dieser alte Konsens gelte nun nicht mehr :
Weil unter der vielen Information im Netz auch so viel ist , das dem einen oder anderen nicht behagt .
( „ Spiegel Online “ )
( Das letzte ist natürlich nicht wirklich eine Antwort auf den „ Spiegel “ - Artikel .
Liest sich aber so . )
Researchers have found a genetic mutation in two people who need far less sleep than average , a discovery that might open the door to understanding human sleep patterns and lead to treatments for insomnia and other sleep disorders .
The finding , published in the Friday issue of the journal Science , marks the first time scientists have identified a genetic mutation that relates to sleep duration in any animal or human .
Although the mutation has been identified in only two people , the power of the research stems from the fact that the shortened sleep effect was replicated in mouse and fruit - fly studies .
As a result , the research now gives scientists a clearer sense of where to look for genetic traits linked to sleep patterns .
“ I think it ’s really a landmark study , ” said Dr. Charles A. Czeisler , a leading sleep researcher and chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
“ It opens up a window to the understanding of the genetic basis of individual differences in sleep duration .
Now you have a piece of the puzzle and you can begin to try to trace back as opposed to having little information as to where to start . ”
Many local officials on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande are panning Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's latest initiative to stem illegal activity along the U.S. - Mexico border , complaining that the governor is wrongly painting their region as a lawless no man 's land .
Last week , Mr. Perry said he is sending special teams of Texas Rangers to the border because of " the federal government 's ongoing failure to adequately secure our international border . "
The Rangers , a state force that dates back to the 19th century , will focus on remote areas where smugglers are overrunning ranches and farms , the Republican governor said .
But views on the level of crime along the border vary , and in the mostly Democratic communities the Rangers are supposed to be helping , their arrival has n't been cheered .
For example , Brownsville Mayor Pat Ahumada , a Democrat , blasted the deployment as " an extremist and alarmist reaction to incidents that are happening in Mexico " and " the wrong signal to send to the nation and the world . "
Mexico 's northern border has been plagued with violence over past months as President Felipe Calderón tries to uproot powerful drug cartels .
As the murder count mounts , American officials are becoming increasingly worried that the violence will spill into the U.S .
The Texas Border Coalition , a group of border mayors and county executives , told the governor in a letter that " while each of our communities has their own unique issues , being overwhelmed by criminal elements from Mexico is not one of them . "
First they kidnapped their bosses ; then they threatened to blow up their own factories .
Now , in the latest phase of France 's summer of discontent , disgruntled workers are turning to environmental blackmail as a stick to beat the management into submission .
Angry lorry drivers at Serta , a struggling transportation company , are threatening to pour more than 8,000 litres of toxic fuel additive into the Seine if their demands for redundancy pay - offs are not met .
Acknowledging the " dramatic " effect this could have on the river 's fish population , they insist they will not be dissuaded unless their bosses give in .
" It 's less dramatic than ... people being made redundant and sacrificed , " Jean - Pierre Villemin from the CFDT union told French radio .
" It 's the only means we have of getting what we want . "
Around 50 workers at the distribution site at La Vaupalière near Rouen are demanding severance packages of 15,000 euros after Serta , which went into administration a year ago , announced job cuts .
The transportation company , which has suffered badly in the financial crisis , has already cut around 80 jobs since the start of the year .
Their threat to flood with the harmful substance their on - site drainage system - designed to channel rainwater back into the Seine - is the latest tactic used by workers desperate to draw attention to their plight .
Last month , workers at New Fabris , a bankrupt car parts plant , and at Nortel , an insolvent telecommunications company , vowed to explode gas cylinders at their factories if requests for improved severance package were not met .
Both threats have since been lifted .
These actions , decried as media stunts by their critics , followed a springtime spate of so - called " boss - nappings " across France in which business executives were taken hostage by their bellicose employees .
Such episodes are familiar features in the country 's sociopolitical landscape and received more attention abroad than they did at home .
The more recent threats of environmental damage , however , are more unusual .
It may be that the Serta drivers are seeking to recreate the success of an infamous workers ' campaign nine years ago in which workers at the Cellatex textile plant poured thousands of litres of sulphuric acid into the river Meuse .
They were rewarded by management with a year - long redundancy package of 80 % of their salary .
" The workers ... do not want to leave with the frankly pathetic minimum legal compensation , " said Villemin , who has been on strike with the workers since last week .
" If we do not obtain decent pay - offs we will unfortunately be reduced to opening the [ fuel ] drums and pour the contents into the sewers . "
Antoine Faucher , campaign director of Greenpeace France , said the threats , though worrying , were in fact a reflection of growing concern for the environment .
" It 's significant because today , perhaps unlike previous years , the environment is recognised in itself as a resource , " he said .
" To take it hostage may be of greater value now than it was before . "

Delivered in this way , Chrome OS has the potential to transform the way in which many people access the web , just as mobile phones have changed the way in which we talk and text across the airwaves , and has the benefit of being transparent and easy to use .
A cheap device that runs Chrome OS may be given away , leased or subsidised by internet service providers in much the same way as telecoms companies have made smart phones and other mobile devices accessible on the cheap .
Google envisages a world where super cheap mobile devices provide instant access to web - based applications for users on the move , and there is no need to store applications , processes and data on the local device .
Everything is out there , secure and sound , on a central server , accessible across the web .
The central server may reside on the company LAN or belong to a web service provider , or may , at a stretch , be your home computer .
Chrome OS is not so much a desktop operating system as it is a browser , optimised to access applications , processes and data that live on servers on the LAN or the wider network .
The operating system is the browser .
The browser is the operating system , and " the platform is the web " .
Google 's Chrome OS has been pictured variously as a Windows killer and as the " last chance " for Linux on the desktop , but has a more coherent and straightforward purpose .
The idea is seductive , but has its shortcomings .
You may not want your data out there for personal or business reasons .
Your personal desktop gives you control , and no one who has been brought up on Microsoft Windows , virus holes , spam - filled inboxes and " security through obscurity " has much faith in network security .
Googling for Googols
Google has a vested interest in persuading us to put our lives on the web .
In the ten years since its inception , Google has become the main option for searching the web , and whether the company likes it or not , " to google " has entered the vernacular as a verb , and we google as we hoover or reach for the kleenex .
Google is synonymous with life on the web .
But Google 's biggest asset is not its search techology per se , but the database of the web which is a by - product of its primary activity and is stored on the proprietary file system that it runs on countless thousands of cheap and cheerful Linux servers , estimated at 650,000 as far back as 2006 , and growing by the day .
Google is not so much a search company as it is a cache of everything on the web .
Google 's primary technology is its file system , which has the capacity to store and serve terabytes of data , applications and processes at minimal cost .
Relative to the volume of data Google collects and stores , its running costs are minimal and its margins are tiny , but the cumulative revenue that is collected from the tiny pings of advertising distributed across the web is huge .
The takings are imperceptible but incremental , and can be counted in googols of fractions of cents .
Google can afford to serve greater and greater volumes of data at minimal cost because of economies of scale .
At the heart of the technology that makes this possible is the Google file system and the information it collates on every aspect of life on the web .
The true potential of the Google file system is hardly tapped .
At one extreme , Google is the library of the web , an unparalleled repository for information , accurate and inaccurate , about everything and anything , that can be accessed instantly and at will , an encyclopedia at our fingertips .
At the other extreme Google becomes the engine of the web , to provide the tools we use to process our data , and the storage capacity for that data .
This is how Washington really works :
Even a top liberal advocate for taking a strong stand against the insurance industry takes money behind the scenes from the insurance industry .
On Sunday , former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , who was once a nominee to be President Obama ’s Secretary of Health And Human Services , appeared on NBC ’s Meet The Press , playing the role of the liberal standard bearer , opposite Oklahoma conservative Sen .
Tom Coburn .
Daschle spoke out against insurers , praised the so - called “ public option , ” and at one point framed the debate over health reform to host David Gregory this way :
Well , David , I guess the , the basic question is , are we building this new system for the American people or for the insurance companies ?
I mean , that ’s really the key question .
How will they be better served ?
Sounds like tough - talk from a man who was introduced on the show as “ former Senate majority leader Democrat Tom Daschle , an informal adviser to the White House and author of ‘ Critical : What We Can Do About the Health - Care Crisis . ’ ” Left unmentioned was the fact that Daschle , in his capacity as a high - paid consultant at the law firm Alston and Bird , is once again working closely with lobbyists for UnitedHealth , the largest U.S. industry player , aiding the company ’s effort to convince moderate Senate and House Democrats to , among other things , kill the public option and keep company profits high .
A couple weeks back , BusinessWeek reporters Chad Terhune and Keith Epstein confronted Daschle about his role playing both sides of the health care reform debate .
( The entire piece , about how United Health has already won the health care reform war , is a must read . )
Terhune and Epstein write :
[ United Health top lobbyist Judah ]
Sommer has retained such influential outsiders as Tom Daschle , the former Democratic Senate Leader who now works for the large law and lobbying firm Alston & Bird .
Daschle , a liberal from South Dakota , dropped out of the running to be Obama ’s Secretary of Health & Human Services after disclosures that he failed to pay taxes on perks given to him by a private client .
He advised UnitedHealth in 2007 and 2008 and resumed that role this year .
Daschle personally advocates a government - run competitor to private insurers .
But he sells his expertise to UnitedHealth , which opposes any such public insurance plan .
Among the services Daschle offers are tips on the personalities and policy proclivities of members of Congress he has known for decades .
Conceding that he does n’t always agree with his client , Daschle says : “ They just want a description of the lay of the land , an assessment of circumstances as they appear to be as health reform unfolds . ”
He says he leaves direct contacts with members of Congress to others at his firm .
Now it is one thing for Daschle to make this convoluted argument –that he can at once advocate the public option while taking money to help those leading the charge to defeat it .
It is quite another for Daschle to be allowed on a show like Meet The Press to talk about the insurance industry without any disclosure of the fact that he now works as a strategist for the insurance industry .
A few weeks back , there was quite a hubbub over MSNBC ’s decision to allow Richard Wolffe , a former Newsweek reporter turned corporate consultant , to sit in the anchor chair while Keith Olbermann was on vacation .
Olbermann later apologized for his producers not disclosing Wolffe ’s conflict .
Daschle ’s Meet The Press appearence Sunday , however , shows the TV news business has a ways to go before such transparency is standardized .

The question came during a news conference featuring Canada 's prime minister and the sitting American president 20 years ago this year .
The president standing next to our guy was relatively new to office .
And after our PM answered the question at the White House itself , no one even suggested that Canadians were interfering in U.S. politics .
For our prime minister of the day – Brian Mulroney – the question was like manna from heaven .
After all , what Canadian politician – save seemingly Stephen Harper and Michael Ignatieff – would n't relish the opportunity to defend medicare before an American crowd at the White House .
Unlike today 's crew in Canada , Mulroney seized the medicare moment on May 4 , 1989 .
And in doing so , an assist came his way from an unlikely source – an American journalist .
" We 're very proud of the special health - care system that we 've developed over the years , " Mulroney told the White House press corps that day when presented with a question about Canadian medicare .
" It 's an integral part of our citizenship .
We strengthen it every opportunity we can , and we do n't see it under any challenge or attack . "
And then came the kicker :
" Could you explain that to Mr. Bush so we can get that same health system in the United States ? " the reporter wondered .
Mulroney himself continued the story more than a decade later in his Memoirs .
" I chuckled to myself , " he wrote .
" The irony was striking .
Only a few months earlier I had been accused of threatening the very existence of medicare because of the Free Trade Agreement , and now here I was in Washington , at the White House , being lobbied to promote medicare with George Bush himself ! "
What makes the Mulroney - Bush 41 story so interesting in 2009 is the fact that this year Canada – whether we like it or not – has found itself playing a lead role in the health - care debate raging in President Barack Obama 's America .
Depending on who you listen to ( and particularly if it's coming from the American right ) , Canada 's medicare system is something Americans should fear .
We are the land of socialized medicine where bureaucrats ( imported from the Kremlin ? ) make the health - care decisions , or so the story goes .
So with all this going on , you 'd think that either Harper or Ignatieff would consider hopping on a plane , heading to Washington and demonstrating they 've learned from those pages in Mulroney 's book .
In fairness , NDP Leader Jack Layton did indeed visit Washington where he defended Canadian medicare but , unfortunately , as could be expected when heading a fourth party up here , he received little notice .
Still , full marks for his at least trying .
And Kingston Conservative Senator Hugh Segal valiantly rose to the defence of medicare – even appearing on CNN , to name just one media outlet – when Kingston General Hospital in his home community came under attack on the floor of the U.S. Senate by Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in the midst of this debate .
Without getting into the merits of the medical system ( thankfully ) bequeathed Canadians by Tommy Douglas , John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson , you 'd think the brain trusts surrounding the Prime Minister and Leader of the Official Opposition might consider lining up an appearance for their leaders in the States right about now .
For some inexplicable reason , however , that has n't been the case .
Last week , the polling and research firm EKOS published a survey demonstrating what good politics a foray by Ignatieff or Harper into America to defend medicare might be right now .
While Canadians disagree on many things , we 're very much united over medicare .
EKOS reports that 87 per cent of Canadians believe Canada 's health - care system is better than the one in the United States .
Only 7 per cent prefer the American model .
" Whatever the pitfalls of Canada 's system , it is seen as dramatically better in serving the needs of its overall citizenry , " EKOS president Frank Graves says .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm getting a little fed up about turning on my television and seeing some guy ( or gal ) from Kentucky or a right - wing congressman safely protected by his congressional health plan attacking my country on this issue .
Call me old - fashioned , but I think – especially in light of what EKOS has discovered – that many Canadians are like me and would enjoy seeing our Prime Minister or Leader of the Official Opposition defending our country in America during this health - care season .
And for the life of me , I simply can't figure out why Harper or Ignatieff wo n't seize the medicare moment – like Mulroney once did – and defend our nation 's most prized social program in America when it is under attack .
( And for Harper , who many still believe harbours a hidden agenda that does n't include a fulsome belief in medicare , to pass this up really makes no sense ) .
Not only is it the right thing to do – it has the added bonus of being the right political thing to do as well .
Chances like this do n't come often in politics and the fact both Harper and Ignatieff are asleep at the switch on this one might help explain why both leaders have job approval ratings , according to the same EKOS poll , between 37 per cent ( Harper ) and 29 per cent ( Ignatieff ) .
And President Obama – the man trying to reform America 's medical system – his job approval rating among Canadians ?
More than 70 per cent .

Let ’s start with the punch line – roughly 50 % of people arriving at Firefox Support ( support.mozilla.com ) do so accidentally .
And yes , cats are a common culprit !
Below is the story of how we arrived at this insight .
The metrics and SUMO teams have been working hard to better understand the traffic at support.mozilla.com and users ’ experiences there .
One critical item we ’ve had trouble wrapping our heads around has been the unusually high bounce rate on the SUMO home page .
Looking strictly at the web analytic numbers , roughly 86 % of visitors immediately exit the site .
As a multi- pronged approach to figure out what the heck is going on here , we considered a couple options :
Implement a feedback button / form on the home page , allowing users to tell us what is on their mind – more on this below Modify our tracking so that we can see the percentage of visits that are derived from people hitting the F1 key on their keyboard – the SUMO team will soon be discussing the details of this change
For approach # 1 , we initially implemented a button in the bottom corner of the page ( button and feedback form are pictured below ) .
This page sees nearly 10,000,000 visitors monthly , so we were fairly sure that we would be able to understand some key insights rather quickly .
Unfortunately , events did not play out as expected .
Over the course of nearly a month , we had fewer than 1,000 total responses , which translates to a click - through rate of roughly 0.0001 % ( ouch ! ) .
To boot , there did n’t appear to be any revealing patterns or insights within the responses .
At this point , we felt bewildered and did n’t know where else to turn .
So , what did we do ?
We implemented a pop-up .
Let me stress that I hate pop-ups , hate them .
Given our circumstances , we decided to run the feedback pop-up question for just a 24 - hour period and show it to 60 % of visitors to the SUMO home page ( they saw it when trying to leave the page ) .
The findings were amazing .
Firstly , out of 700 total comments , only one or two people said something negative about the pop-up itself .
Many comments were along the lines of , “ Firefox is great ” ( someone even pointed out that we should have included a positive category within the survey form ) .
Here ’s one example :
“ i admire this site and this browser .
it is faster , and safer , …….. so many add ons that can use and its fun … … i think this is the best internet browser that i have ….
i using ubuntu 9.04 and its work fine … tnx more power to you ….
and to your team …. ”
Secondly , we were able to confirm a hypothesis – nearly half of the traffic to the SUMO home page appears to be accidental ( e.g. , a user accidentally hitting F1 on his / her keyboard ) .
The screenshot below comes from Kampyle ’s dashboard ( they ’re the feedback analytics firm who helped us with this project ) and it shows a breakdown of people ’s feedback by category .
That blue slice of the pie is “ Arrived by Mistake ” … that ’s huge !
Even though it shows as 40 % , we ’re guessing that the true percentage is closer to 50 % , as some folks arriving by mistake likely closed their tab / window within a fraction of a second and missed our feedback question .
[ As a side note , this is a perfect example of why pure web analytics – alone – can fail us ( analysts , marketers , business managers , etc. ) .
Without hearing real comments from real people , we could have easily been led down the wrong path by relying solely on the data . ]
Lastly , we wanted to look at the exact feedback left by people visiting support.
mozilla.com by mistake .
The vast majority indicated that they indeed realized that they had accidentally hit the F1 key .
Diving in a little further , we wanted to share a small sample of actual comments .
Enjoy !
Julia Stiles is done with all of the Gwyneth Paltrows , the Bonos , the Katie Holmeses and the Leonardo DiCaprios of the world .
So she ’s mocking them and their eco-efforts in a hilarious new website , video , and faux - fashion line of eco-friendly clothes .
Julia has launched her parody site “ Julia Stiles Styles ” ( video above ) with the tagline : “ Helping the environment .
You ’re welcome . ”
Her fashion line includes the pieces she ’s named “ Save the Last Shants ” ( “ Ever been wearing a shirt and thought ‘ I sure wish I could also wear these as pants . ’
Now you can with this trendy one - piece that can cover either your top or bottoms halves .
Save time and money , for when your shirt is dirty you can wear it as pants !
$ 470 ” ) and “ 10 Shirts I love about you ” ( “ How much do I love this shirt ?
Let me count the ways .
Comprised from the fabrics of 10 other vintage shirts , this piece is sure to make passersby say “ wow . ”
Perfect for pool parties , dance parties , or any kind of party .
Be the envy of all those around you whose shirts come from only one source .
$ 340 ” ) .
Gatecrasher has more :
Julia Stiles has been re -” Bourne ” as a comedian .
In an inspired turn , the sometime - sourpuss has taken to online video to poke fun at greener - than - thou celebs trying to force - feed us vegan - wear .
In the now - viral parody at juliastilesstyles.com , the Columbia graduate faux - hawks a fabulously sarcastic line of ecowear .
She serves up seriously funny whoop - ass to know - it - all stars and the earnest celebrity causes they expect us to wear on their backs .
Yes , Gwyneth Paltrow , Natalie Portman and Alicia Silverstone – that could mean you .
You too , Bono .
Aw , hell , even Katie Holmes is trying to design clothes , for crying out loud .
In the vid , Stiles chats with deadpan earnestness about some ridiculous Earth - friendly fashions .
They include a men’s top called “ Ten Shirts I Love About You ” made from 10 old shirts .
A Swiffer necktie that doubles as an eyeglass cleaner is the haute hybrid accessory .
Stiles also pulls a funky fashion innovation with “ shants . ”
That ’s a shirt that becomes pants when legs are slipped into the armholes .
Stiles , who lives in New York and starts rehearsals for Broadway ’s “ Oleanna ” in two weeks , filmed the video with the comedy group The Vacationeers .
She met the four - man act while co-starring with Bill Pullman in David Mamet ’s sexual - harassment drama on the West Coast .
The show starts next month on the Great White Way .
“ I was impressed , ” says Stiles , “ so we talked about making some comedy shorts . ”
It ’s easy to imagine the gang getting inspiration from Paltrow ’s line of organic tees .
Or perhaps Portman ’s vegan shoes .
Or maybe Silverstone ’s eco-friendly eye makeup and cosmetics bags .
“ We were just having a laugh , honestly , ” says Stiles .
And a bit of revenge , too .
“ Julia ’s got a good sense of humor , ” says Vacationeer Jeff Grace , adding that the video was a way “ to poke fun at celebrities and their causes . ”
Such as ?
“ The Bonos and Tim Robbinses , ” he says .
“ We even like these people .
They ’ve done good things .
But it can be cringeworthy . ”
To give a silver lining to the lampoon , Stiles added a donation link on the site for the Lunchbox Fund , which feeds impoverished kids .
Super Stardust HD , is revered as one of the best titles available for the PlayStation Network .
Fans have been eagerly awaiting Housemarque ’s next title .
Soon Housemarque will have an announcement that ’s out of this world .

“ All I can say right now is that it is a PS3 PSN exclusive title we have been working on quite a while now , and yes … shooting is an integral part of the game … ”

Bush & Cheney Prosecution Could Prevent Crimes
Prosecuting Bush And Cheney Could Prevent Future Crimes
by Sherwood Ross
Allowing today ’s leaders to get away with war crimes will send a dangerous signal to future leaders that they can do the same .
“ The battle to impose criminal responsibility upon them ( Bush , Cheney , etc. ) is not for today alone but to safeguard a vast future , ” points out Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover .
“ Otherwise the future will be threatened by Executive lawlessness undertaken because of knowledge that leaders need fear to no personal consequences , ” he writes in his recently published “ America 2008 ” ( Doukathsan Press ) .
“ Today , there is no accountability for our leaders , nor do their own families face death on the front lines as occurred during the Civil War when several Cabinet officials ’ sons or brothers faced battle and World WII when one of FDR ’s sons participated in extraordinarily dangerous missions in the Pacific . ”
Instead , there are numerous factors today that make it easy for a President to wage war , Velvel continues , such as ” half trillion dollar appropriations , huge standing military forces which the President orders into combat all around the world at the proverbial drop of a hat , a compliant Congress that refuses to do its duty , and an incompetent , if not venal , mainstream media . ”
“ Not unless leaders fear prison or the gallows for actions that violate law will there be anything to check the next headlong rush to war for allegedly good reasons that later prove false , as with Mexico , Spain , Viet Nam or Iraq , ” Velvel warns .
He says the U.S. has repeatedly fought in wrong wars for a number of reasons , foremost of which is the fact that “ the nation larges does not know , and ignores , history . ”
Other factors include a national penchant for violence , hubris , “ lies , distortions and delusions , ” “ a desire to maintain American power at a preeminent level , ” Congressional abdication of responsibility coupled with Executive seizure of power , public gullibility , nearly uncontrolled nationalism , the South ’s military culture , and Hollywood ’s incessant war - glorifying movies , i.e. , “ The John Wayne syndrome . ”
After repeating the Viet Nam war in Iraq --- which historian Arthur Schlesinger termed “ national stupidity ” --- Velvel writes that although no one thought “ it could happen again , ” it did even though “ Congress took steps to assure it could n’t , such as enacting the War Powers Act , reining in the CIA , and banning electronic eavesdropping of Americans by the NSA . ”
Iraq ’s bloodshed is worse , Velvel writes “ because today we not only have a years - long unwinnable war , but also torture , kidnappings and renderings to foreign countries for torture , many years of detention without trial of people who are innocent , the use of massive private armies to help carry out Executive policies … suppression of the media far beyond anything experienced during Viet Nam … the use of Executive Branch lawyers to write professionally incompetent secret memoranda giving clearance to awful policies , and the use of retired generals who are making a fortune from the Pentagon to spread its gospel on the mainstream media . ”
Today ’s wars of aggression are being waged , Velvel notes , because previous Washington officials were not held to account for their crimes : “ Lyndon Johnson retired to his ranch … Nixon received a pardon and went back to San Clemente , McNamara became the long time President of the World Bank , Kissinger became richer and richer ( and secretly advised Bush and Cheney on Iraq ) … Wolfowitz was given a sinecure at the World Bank , lawyers who facilitated the misdeeds --- such as Jay Bybee and John Yoo --- are federal judges or professors at leading law schools . ”
Velvel says that courts in Italy , Germany , and France will prosecute U.S. officials for war crimes if they are apprehended in those countries and that they might even try them in absentia if necessary .
Just as Lincoln said the Civil War was being waged for a vast future , Velvel reasons this is also true of war crime prosecutions .

A team of seven researchers has won a $ 1 m ( £ 606,000 ) prize offered by online movie rental company Netflix .
The challenge was to improve the way in which the company website predicted customers ' movie preferences and recommended other films .
Since its launch three years ago , more than 51,000 contestants worldwide have tried to solve it .
The winning team , BellKor , met each other for the first time at an awards ceremony held in New York on Monday .
BellKor consisted of former rivals who decided to work together to solve the problem .
It included researchers from Austria and Montreal .
The criterion for the prize was that the winning solution had to improve the accuracy of recommendations by at least 10 % .
" We had a bona fide race right to the very end , " said Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings .
" Teams that had previously battled it out independently joined forces to surpass the 10 % barrier .
New submissions arrived fast and furious in the closing hours . "
A matter of timing
The prize has long been a source of great excitement to fans of algorithms , but now it may also catch the eye of online businesses which rely on customer preferences to recommend products .
BellKor narrowly beat another team called Ensemble to the $ 1 m jackpot .
Both ended up with an overall improvement score of 10.06 % .
However BellKor won because it had submitted its entry first - just 10 minutes earlier .
The PC company BGameBox has changed the name of its “ ryoujoku ” ( rape ) category to “ Platinum category ” and its “ choukyou ” ( sexual training ) category is now called the “ Thoroughbred category ” [ source ] .
Is this what we do now , rename something bad and that makes it okay ?
“ No honey , I was n’t cheating on you .
I was sexually outsourcing myself to for the benefit of others . ”
Personally , I could n’t care less if these type of games exist or do n’t exist .
If we ’re allowed to play a game where a person grabs a gun , carjacks a person , runs over pedestrians , solicites a prostitute and then murders her to get their money back .
Then , why ca n’t we have a game were someone gets raped ?
You say because it ’s both morally wrong and illegal ?
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but is n’t murder , robbery , reckless driving and prostitution ( in most places ) illegal as well ?
To me and most everyone else in the world it ’s just a game .
We know that we ’re not really killing anyone .
And in the case of Rapelay , not really raping anyone either .
I ’m also not on the side of the discussion that believes video games make people more aggressive and cause them to act out what they ’ve done in the game .
Of course there are exceptions to the rule .
But hell , there are people who get aroused by seeing a bloody corpse get shat on .
That does n’t mean it ’s the norm .
Plus , we do n’t know how many people play these type of games and use them as an outlet to act out their bizarre fantasies instead of committing the illegal activities in the real world .
I ’d like to see if there is a study and / or statistics about that somewhere .
Hmm …
On another note , the previous comic was Tales from ConnectiCon ’09 : Part I. Today was originally going to be Part II .
But after reading the article that today ’s comic was based on in Kotaku on Tuesday , I decided to postpone Part II until Monday .

The Pirate Bay saga , long a comic tale involving " spectrials , " repainted city buses , police raids , and political parties , seems at last to have descended fully into farce .
The media companies that brought suit against The Pirate Bay have found themselves up against a slippery opponent , one perfectly willing to argue that taking down the site amounts to an abuse of " human rights , " but it 's tough to imagine that they thought the battle would be quite this difficult .
Case in point : the Stockholm District Court , which oversaw The Pirate Bay trial earlier this year , has acted on Big Content 's motion to shut down the site by today ordering Black Internet , one of The Pirate Bay 's ISPs , to stop serving the site .
It did so , but after a matter of hours , the site appears to be back .
Swedish Pirate Party leader Richard Falkvinge called the court 's decision " a fucking outrage . "
Big Content has also gone to the country 's government - operated debt collector , the Kronofogdemyndigheten , seeking its 30 million kronor ( SEK ) damage award .
Unfortunately for the record labels and movie studios , Kronofogdemyndigheten has concluded that the defendants have no " attachable assets " ( in Sweden , at any rate ) that can be recovered to pay the fine .
( Carl Lundstrom , the independently wealthy defendant who is heir to a cracker / biscuit fortune , certainly has money , but it appears to be in Switzerland .
Whether the other defendants have money outside the country is unclear , though they have always claimed to make little or nothing from The Pirate Bay . )
The deal that might provide such assets , a buyout offer of SEK60 million from Global Gaming Foundry , is mired in problems .
The company 's chairman quit this week amid reports that GGF could not come up with the cash , that it was misstating the facts surrounding its negotiations , and that some insider trading of its stock might be taking place .
The company 's stock has been suspended from trading for the second time in the last three months , though GGF still says that it will present the buyout plan to its board this Thursday .
But who might GGF even buy the site from ?
The Pirate Bay defendants say that they transferred control to another company in 2006 , which then transferred or sold ownership to a Seychelles - based company called Reservella .
Ars has been able to confirm that " Reservella " was in fact registered in the Seychelles by the Mayfair Trust Group , a company which often sets up offshore corporations for others , though Mayfair would say nothing about the real owners .
Everything about the deal suggests that The Pirate Bay defendants are still involved — including the fact that they still run the site , they were the ones who set up the negotiations with GGF , and they were the ones who explained the decision to sell .
Kronofogdemyndigheten's report , however , said that it could find no evidence that Reservella was a mere dummy corporation meant only to conceal ownership .

Opinion How to Win an Election Through Boredom
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is being criticized for running a boring election campaign .
It may be part of a cunning plan to win by deterring opposition supporters from voting .
The strategy could work -- but may end up damaging German democracy .
MOUNT OSORE , Japan 
Its name means the Mountain of Horror , which seems an apt description for this sacred Buddhist site inside the crater of a dormant volcano .
The weather - beaten temple here is surrounded by a lifeless lake and a wasteland of naked rock reeking of sulfur that conjures images of Buddhist hell .
But during the mountain ’s twice annual religious festivals , visitors come by the busload to line up before a row of small tents in a corner of the temple .
Within are the “ itako ”  elderly , often blind women who hold séance - like ceremonies that customers hope will allow them to commune with spirits of the dead .
These spiritual mediums seem out of place in a hyper - modern nation better known for bullet trains and hybrid cars .
Found only in peripheral areas like this volcano on the far northern tip of Japan ’s main island , and only dimly known to most Japanese , the itako are among the last remaining adherents to ancient shamanistic beliefs that predate Buddhism and modern forms of Shintoism , Japan ’s two main religions , historians say .
They have survived government efforts to stamp them out , as well as the continuing disdain of many Japanese , who look down on them as charlatans who trade in superstition .
Even the deputy abbot at Bodai - ji , Mount Osore ’s temple , said the itako were not connected to the temple , which he said only tolerates their presence .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration will continue the Bush administration ’s practice of sending terrorism suspects to third countries for detention and interrogation , but pledges to closely monitor their treatment to ensure that they are not tortured , administration officials said Monday .
Human rights advocates condemned the decision , saying that continuing the practice , known as rendition , would still allow the transfer of prisoners to countries with a history of torture .
They said that promises from other countries of humane treatment , called “ diplomatic assurances , ” were no protection against abuse .
“ It is extremely disappointing that the Obama administration is continuing the Bush administration practice of relying on diplomatic assurances , which have been proven completely ineffective in preventing torture , ” said Amrit Singh , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , who tracked rendition cases under President George W. Bush .
Ms. Singh cited the case of Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian sent in 2002 by the United States to Syria , where he was beaten with electrical cable despite assurances against torture .

Now consider Broward County in 2009 .
The county , between Miami and Palm Beach , was one of the first areas to shrink  losing 21,117 people from April 2007 to April 2009 , according to University of Florida data  and its experience offers a glimpse of what could be on the way elsewhere .
Hollywood , in particular , embodies what the Sunshine State was and might become .
It was founded in the 1920s as “ the dream city of Florida ” by a transplant from Washington State named Joseph Young who built ranch - style homes .
After growing predictably  from 22,978 people in 1955 to 139,357 by 2000 
Hollywood has lost 1,562 people over the past year , according to the University of Florida count .
That amounts to only 1 percent , roughly in line with the rest of the county , but residents say their rhythms have already changed .
Here and in other places adapting to the end of double - digit growth , the days include less noise , work and spontaneity , and more goodbyes , doubts and fears of the future .
It is , by all accounts , a life lived under capacity .
Sandra Woodward , 25 , grew up here , happy and proud .
A secretary with dreams of working in education , she said eight houses on her block are in foreclosure .
She knows 20 families who have left Florida in the last two years .
On Monday , she waited for her son to finish his first day of kindergarten at her alma mater , Hollywood Park Elementary .
About 10 years ago , Ms. Woodward said , gesturing toward the parking lot , temporary trailers were needed , as the school was over - enrolled .
This year , the principal counted 469 students registered  124 fewer than the school can handle .
“ I used to go up north to visit my family , and they all wanted to come here , to be part of this , ” Ms. Woodward said .
“ Now I ’m thinking about leaving , too .
It ’s scary . ”
Chinese researchers have unearthed the fossil of a bird - like dinosaur with four wings in northeastern China , which they suggest is a missing link in dinosaurs ’ evolution into birds .
In a paper in the journal Nature , they said they found the well - preserved fossil of the “ Anchiornis huxleyi , ” which roamed the earth some 160 million years ago , in a geological formation in China ’s northeastern Liaoning province .
About the size of a chicken , the fossil has a total body length of less than 50 cm ( 20 inches ) and a skull about 6 cm long , lead researcher Xing Xu at the Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing told Reuters in an email .
“ This finding suggests that birds are likely to be descended from a kind of small - sized four - winged dinosaur about 160 million years ago , ” Xu said .
“ It is a link between more typical theropods ( dinosaurs which moved around with two rear limbs ) and birds .
It lived around a time period … that we expected for birds ’ ancestor . ”
In a statement , the researchers said : “ Long feathers cover the arms and tail , but also the feet , suggesting that a four - winged stage may have existed in the transition to birds . ”
The transition from dinosaurs to birds is still poorly understood because of the lack of well - preserved fossils , and many scientists say bird - like dinosaurs appear too late in the fossil record to be the true ancestors of birds .
The Chinese researchers believe the fossil is the oldest bird - like dinosaur reported so far , and older than Archaeopteryx , the earliest known bird .
“ The presence of such a species at this time in the fossil record effectively disputes the argument that bird - like dinosaurs appeared too late to be the ancestors of birds , ” they wrote .

ISTANBUL | Beyond the power struggle playing out on the streets of Tehran is a complex battle for control of Iran ’s intelligence ministry — a pivotal institution in the regime ’s repression of dissent .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who began a second term this week , fired Intelligence Minister Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejei late last month after Mr. Ejei objected to the president ’s efforts to name an in - law as first vice president .
The departure of Mr. Ejei , a hard - line cleric close to Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , two other Khamenei loyalists and nearly 20 other high - ranking officials appeared to weaken the leader ’s hold over the ministry and strengthen the power of the Revolutionary Guards , Iran ’s elite military force .
The Guards have been heavily involved in the crackdown on dissent since the disputed June 12 presidential election , and there is an unconfirmed report that the force has created a parallel intelligence service called Tehran intelligence .
Mr. Ahmadinejad and many of his closest allies are Guards veterans .
Mr. Ejei was responsible long before the elections for jailing numerous Iranians and Iranian - Americans on charges of promoting a so - called velvet revolution .
However , he apparently was not loyal enough to Mr. Ahmadinejad .
“ Ejei was so hard - line that no one believed he would not be tolerated by the Ahmadinejad camp , ” said Fatemeh Shams , a political activist and doctoral candidate at Oxford University whose husband is a political prisoner in Iran .
She noted that Mr. Ejei was present on Monday when Ayatollah Khamenei presided at a ceremony confirming Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s second term .
“ Ejei came for the supreme leader , not for Ahmadinejad , because he derives his credibility from [ the leader ] , Ms. Shams said .
In the aftermath of the departure of Mr. Ejei and others — including the head of counterintelligence — some Iranian conservatives are blaming him for the government ’s failure to stop dissent as well as other ministry public - relations bungles .
A conservative Web site , Baztab , attributed the removal of Iran ’s counterintelligence head to the government ’s failure to press for convictions on espionage charges of former nuclear negotiator Hossein Mousavian and two Iranian - Americans , scholar Haleh Esfandiari and journalist Roxana Saberi .
Conservatives also have accused Mr Ejei of a disappointing performance in dealing with the post-election riots .
Pro-Ahmadinejad circles quoted by a reformist Web site , Mizan News , stated that the officials were fired for failing to maintain security and repeatedly ignoring information that a large number of Iranians with anti-government backgrounds were traveling to Iran from England in the lead - up to the elections .
“ Two weeks before the riots started , the Foreign Ministry reported that it was very suspicious that a significant number of people were traveling to Iran from Britain , ” Mr Ahmadinejad told a teachers association , according to Mizan News .
“ But the intelligence ministry did not pursue this matter .
The ministry also did not act as it was expected in the recent unrests , and there were blatant cases of negligence . ”
Mr. Ahmadinejad also criticized the ousted minister for bringing a case in 2007 against Ms. Esfandiari , who was 67 at the time of her arrest and had been visiting her elderly mother .
Supporters of the theory that Ahmadinejad supporters in the Revolutionary Guards falsified election results in the incumbent ’s favor pointed to Mr. Ejei ’s dismissal as proof that the Guards have appropriated some of the Intelligence Ministry ’s functions .
Under Iranian law , the president assumes caretaker responsibilities for up to three months in the event a minister is dismissed .
A high - ranking intelligence official named Majid Alavi has been appointed as interim manager and as Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s personal representative to the ministry .
Mr. Alavi is a fluent Arabic speaker who served four - year terms in Saudi Arabia and Sudan before being expelled from the latter , according to the Persian - language news site Roozonline .
He also has strongly supported the harsh crackdown on protesters .
Some of the approximately 20 other high - ranking officials who have been fired or forced to retire wrote a letter to the director of the ministry ’s intelligence protection office , Mizan News reported , expressing fears that Mr Ahmadinejad would erase security files relating to his allies , including the in - law he tried to name as his first vice president .
The latest purge at the ministry is a continuation of Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s efforts to stack supporters there for the past four years .
In the process , he has antagonized intelligence officers who worked in the administration of his more liberal predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , as well as that of conservative pragmatist Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who preceded Mr. Khatami .
Jahan News , a conservative Web site , claimed that a reformist former intelligence officer currently working in the judiciary called a member of the campaign staff of Mehdi Karroubi , a defeated reformist presidential candidate , three days after the election results were announced and advised him to increase the number of protesters on the streets .
“ If you can place a considerable number of protesters by the sides of streets , state officials will stand down , ” the former intelligence official is supposed to have said .
The outcome of the power struggle in the ministry may give a good indication of whether the Ahmadinejad camp will triumph or whether his re-election will turn out to be a pyrrhic victory .
Ervand Abrahamian , an Iran specialist at Baruch College and the author of “ Tortured Confessions , ” a history of Iranian prisons , said that “ the people running the Intelligence Ministry are already Ahmadinejad people . …
There is conflict - some conservatives like Rafsanjani just do n’t like Ahmadinejad ’s dangerous policies and want to curtail his power , but I do n’t know if they ’d go as far as taking over the ministry . ”

There is a small silver lining in the unemployment report released on Friday .
The positive side was the amount of people being fired slowed down in July ( if you can call an annual rate of 3 million layoffs positive ) .
However , there is still a major reluctance for firms to hire .
We still have 26,000,000 unemployed and underemployed Americans in the country .
Many have been relying on the plastic support of credit cards to ease the pain of the deep recession .
Yet many are finding out that they are unable to have access to the once abundant lines of credit .
It may be the case that we have witnessed peak consumer debt .
Even though some 8 million credit cards were yanked earlier in the year , many consumers are simply embracing a more frugal lifestyle .
The contraction is occurring from both sides in that consumers are being more watchful on what they spend while lenders are actually vetting more carefully who they give credit to .
The latest consumer credit report from the Federal Reserve shows that the trend in less consumption is still going strong :
This is now the third consecutive quarter of credit contracting .
Keep in mind this is debt that is already used up .
These were purchases of flat screen televisions , food , vacations , and many items that have already been used up .
The lines of credit are being pulled back at the same time .
Credit card companies are hiking up minimum payments and charging higher rates to make up for the rising amount of defaults occurring in the country and they are also squeezing their prime credit borrowers .
The last option may be counterproductive in the long - term .
Now you might look at this contraction and think that it is no big deal .
It is an enormous deal .
This is the first time on record that consumer debt has contracted on a year over year basis :
Some 40 years of data and not once has consumer debt pulled back on an annual basis .
It is a rather fascinating phenomenon when you pause to contemplate the massive unrelenting growth in debt over the past four decades .
Americans are now having to deal with less access to cheap debt .
And that is probably an important caveat to note .
The days of 0 percent credit cards and no money down loans for homes are probably long gone .
We see that Fannie Mae has posted a loss of over $ 10 billion for the second quarter and these are the more “ safer ” loans in the market .
With unemployment this high , many people were using their credit card as a bridge loan to get through this tough patch of time .
Much of the drain that is occurring is also because we have never seen so many people unemployed for such a longtime :
* Source : Calculated Risk
This is a troubling sign and has also increased the amount of bankruptcies that we are seeing .
Peak debt was bound to happen at some point in time .
The massive 30 year housing bubble was simply unsustainable .
Spending more than you earn will eventually catch up with you .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are focused on saving the banks and Wall Street and the rest of Americans will need to fend for themselves .
You would think with all this new found liquidity that banks would somehow pass it on to the average consumer .
Unfortunately that is the line they sold to the public to get the bailouts passed .
Remember all that talk about credit being the lifeblood of the economy ?
Apparently not since companies are chopping back credit for regular consumers .
What was pushed through was essentially last minute expensive measures to ensure the banking syndicate remained in place .
The bailouts were to fix their balance sheets .
Now with taxpayer money in hand , they are squeezing the vice around the actual taxpayer that has saved them from failing .
It is really a perverse system when you think about .
The average credit card rate has all shot up during this time when liquidity was being made abundant to 14.43 percent .
With rising unemployment , this is still a major problem .
You might be asking why did the unemployment rate drop to 9.4 % when 247,000 people lost their job last month .
Simply put , people left the labor force :
* Source : Econompicdata
And with this combined , it should n’t come as a surprise that even with tougher bankruptcy regulations , more people are filing for bankruptcy :
Although it is better news that the layoff number was n’t so grim , the fact that many left the labor force and companies are not hiring should cause you to pause as to what really constitutes a recovery .
The peak credit era is over and we will need to remake our economy into a completely different machine .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate passed by unanimous consent Wednesday a bill that would prevent the release of controversial photos of alleged U.S. abuse of prisoners and detainees .
Sen .
Lindsey Graham says if necessary , the White House will classify the photos to keep them out of the public eye .
The bill , sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut Independent , and Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican , had originally been part of the war funding supplemental bill passed Tuesday by the House .
But House Democrats stripped that part of the measure from the bill , and the senators proposed it as stand - alone legislation .
Earlier Wednesday , Graham said at a Judiciary Committee hearing that he had received assurance from White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel " that the president will not let these photos see the light of day . "
" The people involved in Abu Ghraib and other detainee abuse allegations have been dealt with , " Graham said , arguing against the release of the photographs .
" Every photo would become a bullet or IED used by terrorists against our troops . "
Hundreds of photos allegedly depict explosive images of prisoner abuse -- images U.S. military leaders believe would fuel anger in the war regions and endanger U.S. troops .
After receiving the White House promise , Graham agreed to release a " hold " on key legislation , including the $ 106 billion war funding measure .
Before the Senate vote , Graham told his colleagues from the Senate floor that President Barack Obama " would sign ... an executive order " classifying the photographs unless Congress acted to prevent their release .
The ACLU has gone to court to argue for release of the photos under the Freedom of Information Act .
The lawyers won a Circuit Court ruling agreeing they should be made public .
The Obama administration , which initially indicated a willingness to release the photos , bowed to fears of military commanders and reversed course , announcing it is appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court .
The Graham - Lieberman bill will now go to the House .
A senior Democratic aide said it 's " unclear at this point " what the House will do on the bill .
The House may not take up the bill at all or take it up as an amendment to the Department of Defense funding authorization bill , the aide said .
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

Galileo ’s telescope anchors the exhibit “ Galileo , the Medici and the Age of Astronomy , ” which is at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia until September 7 , 2009 .
Though Galileo did n’t invent the telescope ( Dutch opticians did ) , he improved upon it .
The first telescope used a combination of two lenses within a tube , and it could magnify items by three times , but showed them upside down .
But when Galileo constructed his own telescope in 1609 , he added a third lens .
His telescope magnified items by eight times and showed them right side up .
Over the following years , Galileo built several telescopes , including one that would magnify items by a factor of 30 .
Although it sounds like a romp , senior lecturer Wayne Moore says Charles Sturt University ’s Batchelor of Computer Science ( Games Technology ) is a rigorous course .
It ’s also a passport to a well - paid career in an increasingly important industry : opportunities in the computer games business are expanding rapidly at a time when the wider information technology industry is only slowly coming out of recession .
Moore says the computer games business is particularly strong in Australia .
“ Australia has a couple of dozen companies .
Recently I was at the Australian Game Developers Conference in Melbourne along with 400 or 500 other people .
One local employer told me he was looking at hiring between 100 and 150 people next year . ”
He warns that some of the jobs in the industry can be short - term , maybe for the life of a single project .
However , he says it certainly looks as if the games business is going to keep on expanding for some time yet .
Computer games are bigger than Hollywood
In terms of worldwide sales , computer games are already bigger than Hollywood .
Moore says , “ Typically 50 to 100 programmers may work on one of the bigger games ; the budget might be as high as $ 40 million ” .
To illustrate the amount of money at stake he points out that Microsoft has thrown billions of dollars into establishing its Xbox games machine .
CSU ’s course is heavily geared towards the technical rather than the art and design side of development .
There ’s a lot of mathematics and coding in programming languages like C++.
Prospective students need to get a relatively high UAI of 85 or over and have something of a background in maths and physics .
Exposure to computer science at school helps , but it is n’t essential .
Moore says the course teaches that subject from basic principles .
It ’s a four - year degree course .
Most of the first three years are taken up with computer science ; though there are units dealing with psychology , maths , graphics and an introduction to computer games amongst others .
There ’s no formal hardware component .
Students get to choose four extra subjects as electives .
The fourth year is either an industry placement or an honours programme that can lead to a Phd or Masters degree .
About 60 percent of students have opted for placements and 40 percent have chosen further study .
Moore is currently in discussions with Sony which may have placements for three or four students in its UK operation .
He says , “ I imagine if they do well there they can look at continuing on with that company . ”
CSU : first game technology programme
A number of other Australian universities are now offering similar games - oriented courses and options .
However , Moore says the CSU degree was the first programme expressly designed around games technology and its entire content has been specifically tailored to this end .
“ When you study graphics , you do it in a games context .
You learn about maths so your games can include realistic looking smoke , you learn about physics to recreate authentic crashes . ”
The CSU course covers a broad range of games , not just those played on a PC or console but also handheld and mobile phone - based ones .
He says , “ Our students get to cover the whole genre ” .
Moore says there ’s plenty of ‘ hard yakka ’ but his students do get an opportunity to play games , something that ’s not generally encouraged with other computer science undergraduates .
He says “ They get to pull them apart ” .
There ’s a games laboratory at CSU ’s Bathurst campus equipped with the latest hardware and course students have exclusive access .
CSU ’s Game Technology programme is about to enter its fourth year , the first intake of students are preparing to start their industry placements .
Moore says that two or three students fell by the wayside because they were more interested in playing games than doing any work , but those people prepared to put in the effort all stand a good chance of graduating .
Demand for the course is strong .
Moore says that like all other information technology courses the demand has tailed off over the last year , but the quality of the candidates has improved .
Although there are some female students , Moore says their numbers are not as high as the one in six women working in the industry and that CSU is keen to entice more onto the programme .

The CEO of Global Gaming Factory , the company aiming to buy the Pirate Bay , has suffered yet another embarrassment .
After losing a luxury car and a motorcycle to the tax authorities over an unpaid debt , the bailiffs - acting on an anonymous tip - have sailed off in Hans Pandeya 's luxury boat .
Having failed to pay a debt of some 780,000 kronor ( $ 110,400 ) owed to the Swedish tax authorities , at the end of August enforcement officers ran out of patience with Hans Pandeya and moved to seize his assets .
A tow truck took away Pandeya ’s car , which we can now reveal was a rather nice BMW 745iA , and his Harley Davidson .
The tax authorities valued the car at 150,000 kronor ( $ 20,800 ) and the motorcycle at 40,000 kronor ( $ 5,550 ) so his tax debt still was n’t cleared , not by a long way .
The bailiffs needed to find more funds but it was reported in the Swedish media that they were unable to find any bank accounts .
But the trail did n’t go cold .
Following an anonymous tip - off , bailiffs homed in on the Royal Motorboat Club in Stockholm and there they found it – not a torrent galleon with cannons either side , a huge sail and overflowing with pirates , but Hans Pandeya ’s luxury boat .
Pandeya ’s Boat
According to the bayliffs who spoke with Realtid.se , unless Pandeya comes up with the money , the authorities will sell the cruiser at auction within the next two months .
At the moment they say it ’s worth around 450,000 kronor ( $ 62,400 ) , although that figure could be revised .
Have a look round , you might like to offer more ;
Avast !
That still leaves a 142,000 kronor tax debt , so who knows what the authorities will seize next .

Along with the brushes already included , you can create custom brushes using three methods .
Simple shapes are created using the button labelled Create a new brush at the bottom of the brush selection dialog or right click and select New Brush .
Complex black and white brushes can be created by saving a grayscale image as using the .gbr file extension .
The content of such a brush is treated line an alpha-channel .
This means that any pixel that is pure white is treated as transparent .
However , in this tutorial we will be creating brushes that use pictures with colour and this brush will also have multiple images .
Step 1 ¶
Create a new image the size of the brush you will be creating .
For our example , we will be creating a 64x64 image .
Create it with a transparent background .
Step 2 ¶
Go to the Layers dialog and create additional layers with the fill type Transparent ( if necessary , delete or clear the background layer if you forgot to make it transparent when creating the image ) .
Give them any name you want .
We will be just naming them Layer1 , Layer2 , and Layer3 .
The layer name really do n’t matter in this case .
Step 3 ¶
Draw the images you want in the layers that were already created .
In our case we will be drawing a picture of a happy face in 3 colours ( red , green and yellow ) .
At the end your layers should look something like this ( see image above ) .
You can save a copy of your image in .xcf format now , in case you want to edit it later .
Step 4 ¶
The last step is to export your brush as a GIMP picture brush .
The extension of this kind of brush is .
GIH .
So right click on the image , then choose
File → Export As …
IF you want the GIMP to be able to use your new brush , you have to save it in the “ brushes ” folder inside your personal GIMP folder ( for Linux and other UNIX systems , this is usually in “ ~/.gimp-2.10 / brushes / ” ) .
So select that folder and type in a name for the brush .
For our example , the brush was named happy .
gih The Export Image as Brush Pipe dialog will ask you how you want to export the image .
Since we have 3 layers make sure to put 3 in the Ranks edit box .
You can also choose how you want the images to appear as you move the mouse aruond .
In most cases Random will do fine .
NOTE : The Spacing ( Percent ) means how much space is left before the next image is drawn .
If the value is lower , then the image will be drawn more frequently .
You can also adjust this value in the Brush dialog .
To see our brush , go to the Brushes dialog and hit the Refresh button .
Our happy image should appear in the dialog .
If it does n’t , make sure you have saved the brush in the GIMP “ brushes ” folder and that it has an extension of .
GIH .
You will note that our little picture on the right has a little red triangle in the bottom right corner .
This tells us that the brush contains multiple pictures .
You can click on the brush image and hold the mouse button to see a preview of the brush .
The brush animation will show you that it contains the three images .
Let ’s test our brush .
Select our brush from the brush dialog , create a simple image and start drawing .
The 33 m - high KSLV - 1 is South Korea 's first space rocket South Korea has called off the launch of its first space rocket just minutes before the scheduled blast - off due to a suspected problem with fuel pressure .
Officials said an automatic abort system was triggered during the countdown when weak pressure was detected in a fuel tank .
It will now be several days before another launch can be attempted .
The rocket , intended to place a satellite into orbit , has been developed with the help of Russia .
The two - stage Korea Space Launch Vehicle - 1 ( KSLV - 1 ) , was set to blast off on Wednesday from the Naro space complex , 475 km south of Seoul .
But the countdown was halted just eight minutes before lift - off .
" The automatic launch sequence automatically turned off due to a problem that was detected in the countdown , " said Lee Sang - mok , the deputy minister of science and technology policy .
He said a valve had not functioned because of weak pressure inside one of the fuel tanks .
The fuel would be extracted , a process that takes several days to complete , Mr Lee said .
New space race ?
The launch , when it is again attempted , will be monitored by rival North Korea , which has been criticised by the international community for pursuing its own rocket programme .
Earlier this year , the North announced it had successfully orbited a satellite , but the claim was dismissed by the US , Japan and South Korea who called the April flight a cover for a test of ballistic missile technology .
The KSLV - 1 is 33 m long and weighs some 140 tonnes .
Its Russian liquid - fuelled first - stage is said to produce 1,700 kilonewtons of thrust at launch .
The second stage , which burns a solid fuel , was produced by South Korean engineers .
It is intended to generate 80 kN of thrust and is designed to place the Earth observation satellite into its final orbit just a few hundred kilometres above the planet .
South Korea wants to develop an advanced space programme to compete with other Asian space - faring nations - China , Japan and India .
It has already launched 10 indigenously produced satellites on other countries ' rockets .
In April last year , Seoul sent its first astronaut into space aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket .
Yi So - Yeon spent 11 days on the International Space Station , carrying out experiments for the government and industry .

Canada 's biggest cable company is suing its largest rival in a bid to block its attempt to move into what it deems its home turf .
At a hearing in Toronto on Wednesday , Toronto - based Rogers Communications Inc. asked a judge to put a stop to Calgary - based Shaw Communications Inc. 's purchase of Hamilton - based Mountain Cablevision Ltd .
Canada 's biggest cable company , Rogers Communications Inc. , has gone to court to stop its largest rival from buying a small cable firm in Hamilton , Ont. ( ( Matt Rourke / Associated Press ) )
In July , Mountain Cable agreed to sell its cable television operations to an affiliate of Shaw , subject to approval by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
Details of the sale were not revealed , but the price tag is believed to be roughly $ 300 million .
Rogers sees that as an encroachment on its business , and is seeking to stop the sale .
For most of the last decade , Rogers and Shaw have effectively agreed to divide the country in half , with Rogers being the dominant cable provider from Ontario east , and Shaw the largest seller west of Ontario .
Published reports suggest the dispute over Mountain Cablevision might just be the first battle in a war between the two as Shaw moves into Eastern Canada .
" Mountain is n't a one - off deal , " Bloomberg News quoted Rogers lawyer Tim Pinos as saying .
" Shaw intends to acquire further assets in eastern Canada . "
The report claims
Shaw has rejected any deal restricting either company to a geographical area as illegal and unenforceable because it unfairly restricts competition .
New fronts
The legal action is the latest in a line of escalating brinksmanship between Canada 's communications firms , who are finding themselves competing in new sectors against new entrants across the country .
Officials at Rogers and Mountain Cablevision both declined comment when approached by CBC News .
" The judge has promised to rule on this expeditiously , so I do n't want to make any comment that might impact that decision either negatively or positively , " Shaw president Peter Bissonnette said .
Mountain Cablevision services more than 40,000 households with television service , and has nearly 30,000 internet and telephone customers .
Alex Arnet , a reader of ours in Salt Spring Island , Canada , wrote me yesterday about his recent diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer .
He wanted Americans to know first - hand how the Canadian health care system actually works ( and it does work ) .
This is Alex ’s story .
( Particularly interesting is his observation that the only time he ’s seen rationing in Canada is when conservative politicians cut the health care budget . )
When I arrived in Victoria , I was given a cat - scan within hours and in surgery immediately after the surgeon had examined the scans .
The surgeon cleaned me out of tumours and I was on the mend , or so we thought .
Since I had lost about 2/3 of my blood before surgery through slow leaks in my stool , I developed blood clots in my left leg and developed a pulmonary embolism .
This required a further week stay in the Hospital .
The Doctors and Nurses involved were all incredibly caring , personable and so professional .
I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer less than two weeks ago .
I had been suffering some strange symptoms for over half a year , mostly constipation , cramps , and weight loss .
It ended up with a day of such extreme abdominal pain that I got my partner to drive me into emerg at the local Hospital .
This was late at night and the MD on call said it was likely serious and I needed to be sent to the Hospital in the nearest large city , Victoria , BC .
Both helicopters were in use so , since I live on an Island , I was sent over by water taxi , accompanied by two paramedics and my GF .
I had further setbacks that were drug - related , but finally my last day came .
One of my Doctors asked me if I would be willing to inject myself with blood thinner for the next 4 - 5 days .
If so I could go home .
He then asked me if I could afford it .
I was using a single - use needle - induced blood thinner that my Hospital used as a matter of a budgetary choice ( they choose to use a more expensive option than the regular needle or pill ) .
When I asked him what the price of my freedom would be , he said “ $ 15 - $ 25 day . ”
In the meantime I am switching to pill form .
So , after 11 days I am home , and I will be receiving two visits a week from Home Care , in addition to any further treatment needed , such as chemo and radiation .
And all of this cost me nothing , beyond the meds that I am now buying .
There was no waiting and no “ lottery . ”
Do n’t believe the lies being spewed by the lobbyists .
The basic system here is Canada is that the Federal government collects our taxes and returns a certain amount back to the Provinces to be used for Health Care .
The amount is not mandated on the Federal level , but decide on the Provincial level .
This is where the potential exists for problems .
In my province , for example , the current governing party is the BC Liberal Party who are liberal in name only .
They are really conservatives , and in their obsession with not running deficits , they have just made massive cuts to Health Care budgets throughout the Province .
The various Health Authorities have had to cut some elective surgeries , such as hip , shoulder and cataract operations until next year .
So you can see from my example that the problem is not with the system , but rests with it ’s implementation .
I am eternally grateful that I live under the umbrella of my health care system .
I am alive , healthy again , and I do n’t have to worry about paying a big bill .
Is n’t this the way it should be ?
Is n’t this what everyone deserves ?
Sincerely ,
Alex Arnet
Salt Spring Island , Canada
WHY is it so many manufacturers cannot leave well alone ?
They go to great pains to produce exquisite pieces of technology .
Then too often , instead of merely honing the rough edges away to perfection , they spoil everything by adding unnecessary bells and whistles and unwarranted girth .
In the pursuit of sales , they seem to feel they must continually add further features to keep jaded customers coming back for more .
It is as if consumers can't be trusted to respect the product for what the designers originally intended .
Occasionally , they get it right .
When the little Flip Mino camcorder came out a couple of years ago , your correspondent ( not an instinctive early adopter ) just knew it was something he had to have .
What impressed him about the design was not simply the gadget 's diminutive proportions and low price , but the way the developers had so ruthlessly resisted all the marketing pressure to add further features — and had single - mindedly maintained the design 's clarity of purpose .
The Flip had one function , and one only — to fit in a shirt - pocket ready to be flipped out in a trice for those fleeting video moments .
This it did brilliantly .
Though the Flip 's performance has kept pace with technical improvements , subsequent versions have steadfastly maintained the designer 's original concept .

Van der Rohe contemplates simplicity
Such rigorous lack of feature - creep is rare .
Look at what has happened to netbooks — those once - minimalist laptop computers for doing basic online chores while on the hoof .
Though palmtop computers and sub-notebooks had been around for decades , a Taiwanese firm called Asus introduced the world to netbooks in 2007 with its ground - breaking Eee PC .
The two - pound device had a seven - inch screen , no optical drive or hard drive , and occupied half the space of a typical notebook computer of the day .
It had all the essentials ( and no unnecessary extras ) for doing the job , and could be slipped into a briefcase , handbag or raincoat pocket and hardly noticed .
Seeing a good thing , rival makers rushed in with me - too versions — each purporting to offer improvements .
The original keyboard was only 85 % as wide as a full - sized one .
Many people thought that just fine , especially as it offered the luxury of a seven - inch screen .
For the past 20 years , your itinerant correspondent has cheerfully used palmtops with 62 % keyboards and six - inch screens to check his e-mail , surf the web and file stories from odd places .
The me - toos , nevertheless , deemed 85 % unusable and increased it to 92 % .
With the increase in keyboard width came an increase in the netbook 's screen size , room for a fairly hefty hard - drive , additional ports , a bigger battery — and yet more weight .
Today 's netbooks are now the size of low - end laptops , with up to 12 - inch screens , 160 gigabyte drives , one or two gigabytes of random - access memory , a video camera , and cellular as well as wireless transceivers .
As a result , they now weigh well over three pounds and need a padded case to lug them around .
The original concept has been lost in a blizzard of feature - creep .
Much the same has happened to digital cameras and other electronic toys .
Witness the way Canon , Nikon and others , not content with including audio recording in their digital cameras , have now added high - definition video and even built - in projectors as well .
Neither are carmakers , despite their long tradition of chiselling away at product costs , immune from feature - creep .
The latest version of Honda 's clever little Fit ( known in some places as Jazz ) is 10 % bulkier and beefier than its predecessor .
Toyota 's new Highlander is nearly 20 % bigger than the right - sized version it replaced .
Because something can be done does not always mean it should be , though .
Back in the 1980s , Richard Gabriel , an expert on Lisp programming , noted that quality in software development does not necessarily increase with functionality .
“ Worse is better ” was the phrase he coined in a seminal essay on Lisp .
There comes a point , he argued , where less functionality ( “ worse ” ) is a more desirable ( “ better ” ) optimisation of usefulness .
In other words , a software program that is limited in scope but easy to use is generally better than one that is more comprehensive but harder to use .
Mr Gabriel 's paradox was really an attack on “ bloatware ” — in particular , the kind of feature - creep that forced Apple to abandon its Copland operating system and buy NeXT for the Unix software that became Macintosh OS X .
In the process , “ worse is better ” has become one of the pillars of efficient software design and much else .
Regrettably , it is not practised as much as it should be .
But when it is , the process embodies simplicity , correctness , consistency and completeness .
To Mr Gabriel , simplicity — in both the internal implementation and the external interface that greets the user — was the most crucial aspect of any design .
Although the design should also be as technically correct as possible , if that made things more complicated then any compromise should favour simplicity .
Likewise , consistency was important but could also be sacrificed for simplicity 's sake .
Finally , the design should cope with as many situations as practical , and certainly all those normally expected .
But completeness should always be sacrificed if it jeopardised any of the design 's other qualities .
This overarching idea of simplicity is what Mies van der Rohe , architect and leader of the Bauhaus movement in Germany during the 1920s , meant by his motto “ less is more ” .
It 's what now , with latter - day eloquence , is called “ KISS ” ( short for “ keep it simple , stupid ” ) .
The idea has actually been around since the 14th century .
It is the basis of Occam 's razor as well as Einstein 's maxim that “ everything should be made as simple as possible , but no simpler ” .
It was the guiding principle of Colin Chapman , the legendary founder of Lotus Cars , who sought to make every component in his featherweight speedsters do the work of two .
His dictum “ add lightness ” has informed every modification your correspondent has made to his superannuated Lotus 74 track car ( see “ Fly or drive ” , March 21st , 2008 ) .
As an aircraft enthusiast since boyhood , your correspondent has long had a special place in his pantheon of heroes for the poet- aviator Antoine de Saint Exupéry , who pondered the meaning of flight as he ferried mail through the North African night in the 1920s .
“ Perfection is achieved , ” he mused , “ not when there is nothing more to add , but when there is nothing left to take away . ”
How much better the world might be if more of today 's product designers could adhere to such a principle .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Governments in the Asia Pacific should come up with more stimulus projects that help drive an economic recovery by tapping into the female labor force , rather than just creating construction jobs that mainly employ men , a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday .
U.N. Under Secretary - General Noeleen
Heyzer said governments should also spend on health , education and agricultural services to create jobs for women .
“ Women represent an untapped resource for most economies in Asia Pacific , ” Heyzer told an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) seminar on women ’s affairs .
“ Our region loses between $ 42 and $ 47 billion a year by restricting women ’s access to employment . ”
The Asia -Pacific has the world ’s second highest ratio of employed women of working age at 49 percent -- mainly low - skilled workers in labor - intensive manufacturing industries , such as textiles and apparels , leather products , and electronics .
Governments around the world have launched huge stimulus packages to fight the worst downturn in decades , with many using infrastructure projects to create jobs and growth .
Battered by the contraction of trade , the region ’s developing countries ’ average growth rate has fallen to 2.8 percent this year from 8.8 percent in 2007 , despite the robust growth rates of China and India , Heyzer said .
“ We must make sure that growth is more inclusive and socially equitable , ” Heyzer told ministers and women leaders from 21 Asia Pacific economies , adding governments needed to do “ gender budgeting , ” ensure funding for micro-credit schemes and include women in steps to improve food production and food security .
Another 24.8 million people could lose their jobs as the crisis unfolds , rolling back development gains made over the last 10 years , said Heyzer , also executive secretary for the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific .

The sun shone then too .
When Labour gathered in Brighton in 1997 , Tony Blair 's talk of a " new dawn " fresh in its collective ears , the sky remained blue and cloudless , as if smiling on the journey about to begin .
Photographers snapped the young prime minister , eyes closed , his face turned to the sun , as if receiving a blessing from above .
Now Labour is back in Brighton , led by a man the Guardian 's Steve Bell once depicted – on his first day in No 10 – as a rain cloud .
If nature had a feel for the political mood , she 'd surely have arranged for slate - grey skies and unceasing rain .
Instead , Labour 's longest - ever spell in government is apparently ending as it started – with a get - together in the warm Brighton sunshine .
It 's likely that next year 's conference in Manchester will have the mood of a memorial service , a depleted reunion for the survivors of the blast .
If so , they will look back on the Brighton - to - Brighton era of 1997 to 2009 as a single epoch : the age of New Labour .
Like heirs to the deceased , they will rummage through their inheritance , wondering what to keep – and what to dump .
Gordon Brown offered his own audit of sorts yesterday , exhuming from the New Labour past an idea he had buried as soon as he entered Downing Street .
The Brownites always loathed Blair 's " respect agenda " , regarding anti-social behaviour orders as dismal and sacking Blair 's respect tsar .
But Brown devoted a full page and a half of today 's text to the topic , more than on foreign policy , defence and climate change combined .
So there were crowd - pleasing promises to crack down on Britain 's " 50,000 most chaotic families " and to set up " supervised homes " for teenage mothers .
Shades of the Magdalene Sisters , but such talk has focus - grouped well , and , I 'm told , Labour 's polling suggests voters are sick and tired of doing their bit only to see others " play by different rules or no rules at all " , as Brown put it .
In so doing , the prime minister duly revived what had been one of New Labour 's defining ideas , captured in that slogan conceived by Brown and delivered by Blair : " Tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
It paid dividends 15 years ago , and Brown is wagering it will work once more .
But Brown broke from New Labour 's past too .
For he accepted that antisocial behaviour exists at both ends of the spectrum , not confined to fly - tippers and hellish neighbours who menace the worst estates .
He struck out at those at the top who also " break the rules " , who also have responsibilities they are failing to meet – to wit , the bankers .
Again the research was clear , says a Downing Street source : voters in the " squeezed middle feel ripped off by scroungers at the top and bottom " .
This was always the missing piece in the Blairite talk of rights and responsibilities .
Too often it was the strong who had rights and the weak who had responsibilities .
Of course , rhetoric is the easy bit , and the government will have to demonstrate what genuine action it plans to take to rein in the bankers and their runaway bonuses .
But for a party that once bragged of its comfort with the " filthy rich " , to speak this way represented a sharp break from the recent past .
It showed that the initial New Labour obsession with a big tent has gone : they now realise that some people belong on the outside , with those on undeserved mega - bonuses firmly in that category .
You could run a similar rule across the rest of Brown 's address .
He was New Labour - ish in his refusal to trumpet the 50 p tax rate , still preferring stealthily - as - she - goes on matters of taxation , a topic that received only the most glancing treatment .
On the other hand , the war on terror – a theme that dominated Blair 's speeches in the early years of this decade – was barely mentioned .
Still , this can't be left to Brown alone .
The wider centre - left needs to decide what should remain of the New Labour legacy .
Sounding out delegates , former ministers , MPs and advisers today brought a range of responses so diverse that it suggests the party has not yet made up its mind about what worked in the New Labour experiment and what was a dreadful failure .
That said , there is close to a consensus on the debacle of foreign policy .
Voices of left and right agree that Blair 's doctrine of " liberal interventionism " is one part of the inheritance that should be dumped in the nearest skip .
Even those who liked the idea in theory concede that its practice proved disastrous .
Equally momentous is the abandonment of a core part of New Labour thinking on the economy .
" We gloried in a neoliberal economic policy when it gave us the boom , " says one Brown aide .
" We celebrated the freedom of people in the City to make grotesque sums of money when we believed it would pay for what we wanted to do .
We now believe you have to intervene . "
This suggests more than a populist attack on bankers , but an ideological shift already under way .
Others yearn to see an end to triangulation , the split - the - difference politics that was such a Blair hallmark .
Brown still lapses into that , offering , for example , not a full - blooded commitment to electoral reform but instead a modest alternative vote proposal on the ballot in the election after next .
The same goes for his refusal to scrap ID cards outright .
There are plenty more items to be shoved on to the New Labour dustpile .
" Fatuous slogans and pointless targets , " offers Chris Mullin .
" Initiative Tourette 's syndrome , " says Demos 's Richard Reeves , noting Gordon Brown 's inability to craft a big - picture , overarching argument without spoiling the effect by chucking in a few small - bore initiatives , just as Blair did before him .
But what should be kept ?
Strangely , Brown has abandoned the trait that once defined his public persona , especially as New Labour took shape .
Brown used to be known for fiscal rectitude , carpeting any shadow cabinet colleagues who dared make an uncosted spending commitment .
Yet yesterday , even as concern at the scale of public debt is rising , he was blithely showering money around , spending cash on a new National Care Service , for example , as if these were boom times .
Aides insisted it would all be " revenue neutral " , paid for by cuts elsewhere , but a more New Labour -ish Brown would have spelled that out at every paragraph .
There 's more from the New Labour legacy that should be recovered or retained .
The steps towards a more redistributive welfare state are taken for granted now , featuring only in the warm - up lists that precede speeches – the minimum wage , tax credits , winter fuel allowance , Sure Start centres , increases in child benefit and the rest – but they are a crucial part of the record , and classically Labour .
The " New " bit was not to shout too loud about them , which looks now , amid sliding popularity , like a mistake .
Add to that devolution and a basic comfort with modernity – the New Labour era expanded gay rights and introduced civil partnerships – and you have a fair amount that is worth holding on to .
Above all , though , is that quality Peter Mandelson displayed so theatrically on Monday .
The essence of New Labour was a sheer hunger for power , an absolute intolerance for the impotence of opposition .
It is hard to maintain that appetite after 12 long years .
And yet if Labour loses that , it will lose everything .

What Bush Meant :
One morning in 2001 , one of President Bush 's most senior economic advisors [ Glenn Hubbard ] walked into the Oval Office for a meeting with the president .
The day before , the advisor had learned that the president had decided to send out tax - rebate checks to stimulate the faltering economy .
Concerned about deficits and the dubious stimulatory effect of such rebates , he had called the president 's chief of staff , Andy Card , to ask for the audience , and the meeting had been set .
As the man took his seat in the wing chair next to the president 's desk , he began to explain his problem with the president 's decision .
The fact of the matter was that in this area of policy , this advisor was one of the experts , really top - drawer , and had been instrumental in devising some of the very language now used to discuss these concepts .
He was convinced , he told Bush , that the president 's position would soon enough be seen as " bad policy . "
This , it seems , was the wrong thing to say to the president .
According to senior administration officials who learned of the encounter soon after it happened , President Bush looked at the man .
" I do n't ever want to hear you use those words in my presence again , " he said .
" What words , Mr. President ? "
" Bad policy , " President Bush said .
" If I decide to do it , by definition it 's good policy .
I thought you got that . "
The advisor was dismissed .
The meeting was over .
It is one story among many such stories .
Why , you might ask , would the president bother to have advisors who are expert in various constellations of policy - making if he then disregards utterly whatever they have to say ?
The answer is at the heart of the failure of this presidency .
George Walker Bush is not a stupid or a bad man .
But in his conduct as president , he behaved stupidly and badly .
He was constrained by neither the standards of conduct common to the average professional nor the Constitution .
This was not ignorance but a willful rejection on Bush 's part , in the service of streamlining White House decision - making , eliminating complexity , and shutting out dissenting voices .
This insular mind - set was and is dangerous .
Rigorous thinking and hard - won expertise are both very good things , and our government for the past eight years has routinely debased and mocked these virtues .
President Bush was unmoved by any arguments that challenged his assumptions .
Debate was silenced , expertise was punished , and diversity of opinion was anathema , so much so that his political opponents -- other earnest Americans who want the best for their country -- were , to him and his men , the moral equivalent of the enemy .
It is important to note just how different such conduct has been from the conduct of other presidents from both parties .
Anyone who has drawn this sad conclusion has been dismissed as a " Bush hater " by those who defend the president .
I am not a " Bush hater . "
I am a reporter , and it is incumbent in the enterprise to scrutinize power and follow facts .
I began chronicling this administration for Esquire in late 2001 , and have been compelled to write about nothing else since .
Among many other things , I learned that the bright lines typical in a White House between policy - making and political operations had been obliterated in the Bush White House , abandoned in favor of political calculations routed through Karl Rove 's office .
In his critique of this troubling power dynamic , one of my sources , the former director of the president 's faith - based initiative , John DiIulio , called Rove 's swarming operatives the " Mayberry Machiavellis . "
That was in 2002 .
DiIulio could n't have known then just how right he was .
I also learned from another source , Bush 's first treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , that at President Bush 's very first National Security Council meeting , in January 2001 , finding a rationale for overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein topped the agenda .
I learned that the president 's message - makers derided the rest of us who live in the " reality - based community , " as opposed to the alternate reality that they saw it in their power to create .
And most recently I learned that the White House was apprised by the Iraqi intelligence chief in January 2003 -- well in advance of the war -- that Saddam Hussein 's regime possessed no weapons of mass destruction and had no such active weapons programs .
The intelligence chief , in his secret back - channel meetings , also described the mind of Saddam - - his fear of the Iranians finding out he was weaponless -- which explained his odd prewar behavior .
When this fact was borne out after the invasion , the White House directed that a fraudulent document be created to establish a connection between the Iraqi regime and the leader of the 9/11 hijackers , Mohammed Atta .
( This document miraculously materialized in Baghdad in December 2003 ) ...
Arsenal lose top talent - spotter : Scout who found Wilshere quits
By Sportsmail Reporter
Spotted : Jack Wilshere
The man credited with bringing Jack Wilshere to Arsenal has left the club .
Sean O'Connor , Arsenal 's chief academy scout , has walked away apparently citing ' in - house politics ' for his decision .
The top talent - spotter had been at the club for more than 10 years , mainly in a part - time role , and is believed to be negotiating a release settlement .
U.S prosecutors are preparing to impanel a grand jury to consider indicting the former head of American International Group ’s Financial Products unit for securities fraud , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating whether Joseph Cassano overstated the value of mortgage - related contracts and failed to disclose material facts about them to AIG ’s outside auditor , the paper said , citing people familiar with the matter .
The planned jury also could weigh charges against other employees of AIG , the newspaper said .
Cassano has denied any wrongdoing .
A Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter , while Cassano ’s lawyer and SEC representatives could not be reached .
The possible case , which follows an 18 - month investigation , could rely partly on tape recordings of phone calls in 2007 involving employees of AIG Financial Products who discussed the value of credit - default swaps , the people told the Journal .
Cassano ’s lawyer told the paper that AIG was fully aware of his client ’s activities and that he has been cooperating with the inquiry .

Measures needed to tackle global warming could save economies more money than they cost , the world 's top climate change expert said today .
Rajendra Pachauri , the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , told the Guardian : " The cost could undoubtedly be negative overall . "
This is because of the additional benefits that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could bring , beyond limiting temperature rises .
Until now , estimates of the price of preventing dangerous climate change have all indicated significant costs .
The most authoritative study , the 2006 Stern report , concluded that 1 % of global GDP would be required , and he has since said 2 % is now more likely .
Pachauri 's comments came ahead of a press announcement in New York today about the IPCC 's plans for its next series of reports in 2013 .
He said these would include a greater emphasis on the economics , as well as ethical and humanitarian concerns .
Funding for reducing and adapting to climate change in one of the most difficult issues in the negotiations towards a global deal at a UN summit in December in Copenhagen .
But Pachauri argues that if the costs are negative , then " inertia and vested interests would be washed away .
As the Americans say , it would be like dollar bills lying on the sidewalk . "
Alex Bowen , one of the Stern report authors , said : " [ Pachauri's ] is a defensible postion , not delusional .
But I am more of a sceptic . "
" My hunch overall is that it will be a little more costly than we estimated in 2006 .
But if well designed policies are put in place , we can still do it remarkably cheaply .
And there is still no doubt that strong action now is much cheaper than no action , " added Bowen , an economist at the Grantham Research Institute On Climate Change at the London School of Economics .
The associated benefits Pachauri pointed to include better energy security , protecting consumers from oil price spikes , new employment in green industries , more productive agriculture and lower air pollution , cutting health costs .
He said one good example was insulating draughty homes and installing better energy control systems .
" This can yield very high rates of returns , with pay back in one year . "
The idea of co-benefits is also central to the " green new deals " promoted by the UN Environment programme , Lord Stern 's group and others .
Bowen said : " Negative costs depends on assumption that policy design and implementation is sensible and very consistent across countries all over the world .
But we have gone three years [ since the Stern report ] without global policies .
Emissions have grown rapidly and a lot of people now think economic growth will be much higher later in the century . "
The faster you have to reduce emissions , he said , the more expensive it is likely to be .
Pachauri 's comments came as he led discussions what the next set of reports from the IPCC should cover .
Its last report in 2007 is acknowledged to have settled the argument over whether emissions from human activities were causing climate change .
In the next series , due in 2013 , Pachauri said the focus would change .
" The IPCC cannot address the issue in purely scientific terms .
For adaptation and mitigation , we need to put euro or dollar values on those .
But there are also some costs you can't quantify .
For example , take Hurricane Katrina .
You can put a value on property losses , what about psychological , sociological , and institutional costs .
I would not like to try to quantify those . "
The IPCC meeting raised a range of further issues that it believes need more attention , including extreme weather events , new greenhouse gases , the full impacts of aviation and global scale geo-engineering .
The reports take between five and seven years to complete , but Pachauri argued that this is their strength : " The IPCC process of regular peer review means the reports are far more defensible than anything else .
Comments received are posted on our website as are actions . "
It seems like one great way to raise money for your U.S. Senate campaign is not to run .
It seems to be working for Peter Schiff , according to the Hartford Courant ’s Capitol Watch blog .
Schiff has not even declared that he is running , but a group of California libertarians started a grassroots campaign for the financial pundit to run for Senate in Connecticut .
Just the suggestion , the Web site , the Facebook page and the tweets were enough for people to start throwing money toward the man who might , or might not , challenge Sen. Chris Dodd in 2010 .
The total as of Friday is more than $ 1 million , according to Peter Schiff for Senate 2010 .
The rapid - fire donation campaign is the “ money bomb ” approach , according to the Washington Post .
Over 24 hours alone , Schiff supporters collected more than $ 30,000 , according to the Will You Fight Web site .
Incidentally , the Web site includes clips of Schiff on television and a YouTube clip of Braveheart .
So , if you do n't care about donating , you can still see Mel Gibson with a mullet .
For those of you who do n’t know who Schiff is , he ’s the guy who lambasted the federal bank bailout and stimulus efforts on national television and made early predictions of the Wall Street meltdown .
He was also an economic adviser to Ron Paul during Paul ’s presidential campaign , the Post reports .
While Schiff has support in California and the Webisphere , he 's trailing Dodd in popularity , according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll .
When pollsters asked , 43 percent of people polled said they would vote for Dodd and 38 percent would vote for Schiff .
@godlessgirl tweeted , “ I want to be a card - carrying Atheist .
Maybe I should make my own cards … ” and I started to think about it .
I came up with this …
I ’ve often wondered what I would do if , by some unfortunate turn of events , I was no longer capable of expressing my wishes , perhaps following an accident or illness .
What would I do if , one day , Father Friggety turned up at my bedside with his worry beads and started grovelling before his own externalised ego , begging to be forgiven on my behalf ?
Hopefully , they ’ll find a copy of this handy print - out - and - keep , “ stick your religion up your arse ” card in my things , before they start praying , and concentrate more of their efforts on doing something that ’ll actually help me recover instead .

I never mentioned Twilight much on The Vault .
I did n’t read the books and I have n’t seen the movie .
Like Stephen Moyer said : “ What ’s Twilight ? ”
For Fantasy Magazine Cat Rambo spelled out the Top 10 differences between True Blood and Twilight .
1. Sparkliness :
Okay , let ’s get this one right out of the way .
In True Blood , the vampires do not sparkle .
In Twilight they do , and I personally find that absolutely ridiculous .
To me , the idea of sparkling menace does not work .
This is also why , it turns out in Meyer ’s universe , vampires avoid sunlight .
Because they sparkle unnaturally in it .
Serious , this seems mindblowingly stupid to me and I take my hat off to Meyer for managing to get away with it .
Now we can move on .
2 . True accents :
Here it ’s a matter of taste .
I like the flavor of the speech in True Blood a lot better .
There ’s something infinitely sexy about the way Bill Compton , as played by Stephen Moyer , says “ Sookie , ” hissing it out in his intense , tortured manner .
Maybe it ’s the fact that I live in the vicinity of Forks that makes the accents in Twilight invisible to me , but I ’ll take that sultry - flavored drawl anytime .
3 . Strong secondary female characters that are alive : True Blood has them , on both sides of hero / villain .
Twilight does n’t seem to and it ’s as though Bella can only really relate to dead women .
I must confess here that I started this with a strong True Blood bias – I do n’t like the messages for young women that Twilight preaches and have written about that here before , and this is one of them that I find puzzling and distasteful .
4. Music : Again , I ’m drawn much more to True Blood ’s version , including the kickass opening music by Jace Everett , along with songs from Lucinda Williams , the Flying Burrito Brothers and Allen Touissaint .
The music in True Blood sounds more real , less polished , and a whole lot more filled with juicy human goodness .
5 . Target audience age and shameless pandering to it : Twilight ’s biggest fans are teenage girls , while True Blood is shooting for a riper demographic .
While I admire the way Robert Pattinson , who plays Edward Cullen , looks without a shirt , I also feel a little dirty and pedophiliac about that admiration in a way that does n’t pop up when I ’m ogling Ryan Kwanten , playing Sookie ’s lusty brother Jason , strutting about in a pair of tight white briefs .
6. Fangs .
Twilight ’s vampires do n’t have them , just sharp , strong teeth .
Meyer ’s discarded a lot of the traditional vampire notions , and that ’s fine , but sometimes the substitutions she ’s made are a bit unpalatable .
7. Disparate economic classes : True Blood ’s characters are primarily working class : bartenders and drugstore clerks , road workers and waitresses , while Twilight ’s never seem to worry much about the rent .
Indeed , in True Blood , the richer you are , the more unsavory you are , like the hypocritical senator or the mysterious Marianne with her palatial living quarters , table full of non-local fruit , and drawer full of money .
8. Universe : In True Blood , Sookie says to Sam , after he ’s revealed he ’s a shapeshifter ( not a werewolf , he ’s at pains to mention ) , “ What else is true ? ” “ All of it , ” he says , thereby opening up a giddy range of possibilities .
In Twilight , we avoid this question even though there ’s some werewolves there too , closing the door on a closet full of bogeymen , kelpies , faeries , and sundry yetis .
Feh .
I like my supernaturalia in mixed flavors .
9 . Sexualities : Speaking of mixed flavors , Meyer ’s world is pretty vanilla , and strongly against pre-marital sex .
One of True Blood ’s best characters is Lafayette .
He is a classic , sassy gay male but never cliche , and always wonderful .
I ’ll let him speak for himself with a clip from Youtube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxSWnNO0m3k
10 . Last , but certainly not least , the writing : I know I ’m outraging a lot of fans , but the dialogue in True Blood is entertaining and lively in a way that Twilight lacks .
Anna Paquin ’s soft , earnest drawl speaks words that are wry and sympathetic and real .
Unlike Bella , she has no desire to become undead , and perhaps this is why her speech is considerably more vivid and appealing .
Bill Belichick dodged a bullet with Spygate .
But what if Spygate was all a diversion for a far more nefarious plot ?
A plot in which the behooded coach is sending his associates across the country to destroy all those who have ever wronged him .
I investigated Belichick 's scheme .
And I think what I found will shock you .
Target : New York Jets
Bill Belichick does not like the New York Jets .
This much you must know .
The Jets originally gave him the head - coaching job in 1997 , but then pulled it out from under him when they were able to pry Bill Parcells from New England , busting Belichick back to assistant .
As an assistant under Parcells , Belichick 's contract gave him the Jets ' head - coaching job if Parcells resigned .
Parcells did just that in 1999 -- unexpectedly -- so he could step into the Jets ' front office ... and lock his talented assistant into the job before he had any opportunity to interview elsewhere ( namely , New England ) .
Or at least that 's how I interpret the history .
Now , here is where things get interesting : Belichick did not take kindly to Parcells ' attempt to manipulate his career .
So he humiliated the Jets .
At the press conference to announce him as the new head coach of the Jets ... he quit as head coach of the Jets .
Well - played .
Then he took the head job with the Patriots , even though he was still under contract with the Jets .
The Patriots were forced to give the Jets a first - round pick as compensation ; Belichick allowed this so the Jets would think they had the upper hand .
Then he waited .
Baited .
His first season in New England , the Patriots went 5 - 11 .
Meanwhile , the Jets -- coached by Al Groh -- were 9 - 7 and beat the Patriots twice by a combined score of 54 - 36 .
The trap was set .
And Belichick commenced humiliating the Jets on the field .
From 2001 to 2004 , the Patriots finished with the best record in the AFC East every season and won three Super Bowls .
Meanwhile , the Jets went a mediocre 35 - 29 and had three forgettable playoff exits .
But something inside Belichick ( a jet - black soul and a hankering for evil , perhaps ) told him that was not enough , that the Jets had not suffered enough for what they had done to him .
So he pulled his young defensive assistant , Eric Mangini , aside after the 2005 season and convinced him to join his plot to destroy the Jets .
Only this time ... from within .
This is how I imagine the conversation may have gone .
Belichick : " Eric , speak with me . "
( Belichick says this while stroking a hairless cat in a gray hoodie and sitting in a throne in his volcano - top lair . )
Mangini : " Yes , master . "
Belichick : " I want you to take the Jets head - coaching job and destroy them from the inside , piece by piece until there is nothing left .
But to throw people off the scent , we will pretend we dislike each other .
Also , your first season will be a great success .
Then , the destruction will begin . "
Mangini : " Yes , master .
Yes . "
They both laugh maniacally .
( Although Belichick 's laugh is far more maniacal . )
Target : Cleveland Browns
Here 's the thing : Mangini 's mission was not the first such attack on another franchise .
There are so many moving parts to Belichick 's scheme , and a true evil mastermind does n't let anyone else in on the reach of the plan .
Belichick 's first such dispatch was in 2005 after the Patriots won their third Super Bowl .
He sent Romeo Crennel -- quiet , unassuming , lumpy Romeo Crennel : the perfect Trojan horse -- to Cleveland to destroy the Browns .
The Browns , the TEAM THAT HAD DARED TO FIRE BILL BELICHICK !
In fact , while Belichick gave much time and attention to destroying the Jets , he hates the Browns far more .
It was his dismissal in Cleveland in 1995 after five years on the job that caused that switch inside him to flip .
That caused him to come over to the dark side from the darkish - gray side .
You know , or at least that 's the way I interpret it .
Anyway , that 's exactly how it went down .
And Crennel destroyed the Browns as thoroughly as Belichick had asked , going 24 - 40 in four seasons at the helm and sometimes even losing to the Bengals .
The Bengals !
Well - played , again .
And then , after Cleveland finally could take no more Crennel , Belichick went in with a perfectly timed finishing move : Eric Mangini .
Game , set , match .
Target : Notre Dame
Do not think Belichick 's revenge scheme is limited only to the professional ranks .
Not at all .
He can get to someone who has wronged him anywhere and at any time .
This is what caused him to send Charlie Weis to destroy Notre Dame in what is perhaps Belichick 's finest bit of sabotage .
You see , Bill Belichick 's father was a scout and coach for Navy from 1956 to 1989 .
Over his final 26 years at Navy , the Midshipmen did n't beat Notre Dame .
Not once .
Total humiliation .
But then Belichick dispatches his trusted assistant Charlie Weis to South Bend and two short years later ... Navy 46 , Notre Dame 44 .
Perfectly executed .
Target : Denver Broncos
While Belichick was executing his master plan across the country , he got too extended and let things fall apart at home .
The Patriots dynasty ended .
Their Waterloo ?
Denver , January 2006 .
Seeking a fourth Super Bowl title in five years , the Patriots suffered a humiliating defeat to the Broncos in the playoffs .
It was over .
But Belichick 's thirst for revenge was not .
So this year he sent Josh McDaniels out to Colorado to destroy the Broncos as payback .
And the eager , young lieutenant got right to work , ridding Denver of its franchise quarterback with stunning alacrity .
In fact , McDaniels is working so quickly and effectively , he is liable to tip people off to what is really going on .
This is not Mangini starting strong with the Jets in 2006 as a diversion .
McDaniels is going right to work .
I mean , really .
There might be nothing left of the Broncos by Week 1 .
Is McDaniels too young and inexperienced for the job ?
Or is Belichick just getting impatient and sloppy ?
Target : Kansas City
Evidence that it might be the latter : Belichick has now dispatched his first player , Matt Cassel , to take down another franchise .
As you 'll recall , Cassel had not started a football game since high school before Week 2 of last season .
And then he played well only against the poorest teams on New England 's schedule , repeatedly getting bailed out by the likes of Randy Moss and Wes Welker .
And why was it that this inexperienced , flawed quarterback got to play for such a talented team in the first place ?
Because Tom Brady got hurt .
And what team hurt Tom Brady ?
Exactly .
Kansas City .
Duh - duh - DUMMMMM .
It 's all so obvious now .
Or at least it is to me .

Over the past couple of months , and especially over the past couple of weeks , I ’ve been working very hard to write and complete my thesis .
I performed all the work on Windows 7 , but now that the thesis is finally done , submitted , and accepted , I installed Ubuntu – and immediately I was reminded of why I do not do any serious work on Linux : the train wreck that is X.org .
Yesterday , I was quietly using my Ubuntu 9.04 installation .
I have few problems with GNOME as a desktop environment , except maybe for the fact that Evolution and I do n’t get along – for some reason , Evolution crashes about 5 times a day .
It has been doing this for years now , on different machines , and I still do n’t know why .
After a crash , I need to kill all the Evolution - related processes to get the mail client working again .
My wish : replace Evolution with a simple , to the point email client , and leave Evolution to the big boys that really need it .
Anyway , I had a whole bunch of applications running , but I decided to have some fun and watch an episode of 30 Rock .
I browsed to the directory , and double clicked on the episode I wanted to play .
Totem loaded up , but playback was unbearable .
My entire quad - core 4GB powerhouse was brought to a screeching halt , and the video playback was choppy , audio lagging – it was terrible .
Since I never had much love for Totem anyway , I installed VLC , and I tried to play the video with that media player .
VLC performed better , and the video was actually watchable , but it did make the rest of the machine quite slow and unresponsive .
Then , I decided to resize the VLC window to make it a little bigger .
Poof .
And here we see why the X.org stack is a steaming pile of dog poo .
VLC was using the XVideo output , which is what it defaults to .
Apparently , the resize operating crashed XVideo .
Which crashed X.org .
And as all you educated Linux geeks know but some of you might want to forget : if X.org crashes – so do all of your applications .
Evolution .
Chrome with a number of tabs open .
Pidgin with a number of IM windows open .
Twitux .
Evince with an insanely cool study open ( ‘ Mathematical Modelling Of An Outbreak of Zombie Infection ‘ ) .
OpenOffice.org
Writer displaying a friend ’s thesis which I was proofreading .
They were all gone .
Now I know what ’s going to happen .
The Linux fans will come out of the woodwork , and they will start doing two things .
One , they ’ll start saying that this is not a problem , as the machine is still running , and X restarts – and if not , I can ssh into it .
Second , the finger - pointing will begin .
Always with the finger - pointing !
I do n’t care if X restarts , and I do n’t care that I can ssh into it .
I ’m a user , and what matters to me are my applications , and the data and documents they ’re holding .
X restarting or the ability to get my nerd on by ssh’ing into my box is pointless and useless .
And then we get the finger - pointing .
I ’m sure the usual suspects are already busy churning out comments about how this is the fault of the driver , VLC , myself , the 30 Rock video , planetary alignment , anal probes , whatever .
And all of you will miss the point completely : I do n’t care where the problem lies .
Bugs happen .
Crashes happen .
That ’s a fact of life , and something that you have to accept when using software .
However , under no circumstances should resizing a video window result in a complete system failure !
Let ’s take a look at operating systems with a modern , advanced , and robust graphics stack : Windows Vista and Windows 7 .
Both of these have a graphics stack that is so far ahead of X.org that it ’s like comparing an Airbus A380 to the Wright Flyer .
Do you know what happens when a graphics driver crashes on Windows Vista /7 ?
Absolutely bloody nothing .
The screen will flicker a few times , you might get dumped back into Aero Basic for a few seconds , and then the graphics driver will be reloaded , and everything will be back to normal .
A dialog may appear asking you to send debug information to Microsoft .
None of your applications will crash , no data will be lost – in fact , you ’ll barely even notice .
The graphics stack in Windows Vista and 7 is so advanced , that even updating graphics drivers does not require a restart of the operating system or even the graphical environment – the screen will flicker , Aero Basic for a few seconds , and poof , new drivers running ( note , though , that graphics chip makers do not yet take advantage of this , and will still force you to reboot .
Use Windows Update , and you ’ll see how they should do it ) .
The end result of all this is that I simply cannot entrust my work or my documents to a Linux installation .
The graphics stack is so badly designed that resizing a video window can bring down the entire stack , taking with it all your applications , work , and documents .
It would be like changing the radio station in your car , only to have your entire car explode .
This is simply bad design through - and - through , and it has been haunting the Linux desktop for a long time now .
In the X world ’s rush latch onto the “ me - too ” bandwagon of GPU acceleration , they completely forgot to actually fix their bloody design and move it from the 1990s into the 21st century .
As long as X stays the way it is , I will never advise any of my friends or family to use it , because I know that X.org is simply not capable of robustly powering the multimedia and multitasking machines that computers of today have become .
I ’m sure the blame - game will be played thoroughly in the comments , but it will only detract from the real problem here .
The Linux desktop needs a modern , robust , and advanced graphics stack , which makes sure that crashes and bugs remain isolated , without them affecting the users ’ work .
Microsoft has shown us how it ’s done , now all the X world needs to do is follow .
The media have had very little to say about Bill C - 15 , a federal Conservative bill currently working its way through Parliament .
This legislation will require that everyone convicted of growing a single marijuana plant or more must spend a minimum of six months in jail .
The last decade of cannabis cultivation convictions in our province clearly shows that if this mandatory minimum is implemented , there will be close to a 50 per cent increase in the provincial jail population , just to house those who cultivate cannabis .
The projected annual bill for the province for housing these cultivators will be $ 114 million , and that ’s not even counting the capital costs required for the construction of the additional prison cells that will be needed .
I trust that Gordon Campbell and the Liberals are , at least behind closed doors , lobbying against this rather significant drain on the provincial purse .
If Stephen Harper and the Conservatives want to lock up everyone who grows a marijuana plant , why do n’t they make the minimum penalty 2 years imprisonment in a federal prison ?
At least that would make the federal government financially accountable for its folly .
Let ’s acknowledge that there are features of some large scale marijuana grow operations that deserve a strong rebuke : the theft of electricity , the exposure of children to toxic moulds , and the presence of guns or other weapons at the site of a grow .
Penalize these activities , not the growing of cannabis itself — this activity can be engaged in safely , without risk to children , or the surrounding community .
At the end of the day , however , using the criminal law against cannabis is wholly counter - productive .
It ’s criminalization that causes theft of electricity , violence in the cannabis trade , exposure to toxic moulds , and provides folks who are sometimes mindless thugs with millions of dollars in untaxed income .
There ’s no evidence that cannabis use results in anything close to the death toll produced by alcohol and tobacco , even when current — and projected future — rates of use are taken into account .
Marijuana use by consenting adults is a public health issue , not a moral problem .
And those who choose to use it , or grow for their own needs , should not be treated as criminals .
In a more sane world , the drug would be taxed and regulated .
In a more sane world the financially reckless proposals of Stephen Harper and the Conservatives would be regarded as considerably more silly than the antics of Cheech and Chong .

Mercedes - Benz motorsport boss Norbert Haug says McLaren has no qualms about slotting in Kimi Raikkonen alongside Lewis Hamilton next year - as it closes in on a deal with the Finnish driver .
With Ferrari in the final stages of completing moves that will end Raikkonen 's Ferrari deal a year early , and open the way for Fernando Alonso to join the Maranello - outfit , sources have confirmed that the 2007 world champion and McLaren are keen to renew their partnership .
And although the signing of Raikkonen for 2010 would give McLaren one of the strongest driver line - ups on the grid , it could also leave it exposed to the problems it has faced in the past in managing two top - line drivers .
However , Haug thinks that McLaren will have no trouble in dealing with such a situation - and does not risk a repeat of the problems that marred the outfit when Hamilton was partnered with Fernando Alonso .
" Whatever you can do to get the best available drivers , that is what you have to do , " said Haug .
" It 's a question of money , it 's a question of capability , a question of the amount of talent .
Managing two megastars , I do n't think that honestly it was a problem .
" With Alonso there were some noises to the outside world , but in reality inside the team everybody did his job and in reality we should have won the world championship .
But it was not due to not having team orders .
" You can imagine what would have happened in Fernando would not have blocked Lewis in Hungary , no penalty , one point more and you are there .
This is how it goes sometimes .
We won it by one point and we lost it by one point .
" I stress , I do not confirm that there is change .
This is very important .
But managing drivers ifs and whys is the name of the game and we are qualified to do so . "
Although Raikkonen did not enjoy the best of relationships with former McLaren team principal Ron Dennis , Haug says that the team would relish the opportunity to have the Finn back .
" Reflecting on our co-operation which was five years , I think that it was positive , " explained Haug .
" We should have won at least two world championships .
I have to say we missed one with two points in 2003 but I think an engine failure was one of the reasons , so without that he could have done it .
" In 2005 he could have done it , in fairness .
The engines at that stage were not as good and reliable as they are now .
To have Kimi in our team winning two world championships would certainly have been a fair outcome for him .
I have a good relationship with him and I 'm sure he would say the same . "
I was channel surfing last night when I stumbled upon a couple of Citi commercials — or PSAs , since taxpayers own more than 30 % of Citi — that offered viewers a number of depression - era , cost - cutting lifestyle suggestions .
With the billions in bonuses Citi has paid out to their workers , the ads so brazenly mock Wall Street ’s massive plundering of taxpayer wealth that it ’s almost hard to believe that Citigroup had the guts to have them made — and bill us 30 cents of every dollar paid for production and air time costs .
But they did .
The first one starts out with a white post - college hipster type who says he maps out the cheapest gas stations to save a few bucks .
An African American yuppie dad says he buys everything in bulk , including movie tickets .
A white woman in her 40s buys dog food with credit cards that gives her cash back .
A voice over says Citi has ways to help us spend wiser , and then the screen is subliminally flashed with a scattered list of ways you can save : car pool , cheaper gas , buy in bulk , diversify investments , save 2 % of salary , purchase off - seasony , buy generic , drive less , make gifts personally , debit cards with rewards , but most importantly : get FREE FINANCIAL ADVICE .
That part is in bold .
The second one has , among other segments , an office worker talking about biking to work to save the money he spends on gas , and a woman who says she has n’t bought shampoo in years because she takes hotel shampoo bottles when she travels .
Yes , Americans .
Drastic times call for drastic cost - cutting measures , not to mention the use of predatory Citi credit cards and giving the power to Citi financial advisors to diversify your savings into personal bonuses .
As I watched these spots , I could n’t help but think of the $ 5.3 billion in executive bonuses that Citigroup paid out last year , straight out of the $ 45 billion in bailout money we handed over to them .
Then I remembered last week ’s story about the Citigroup trader who ’s fighting for his “ right ” to receive a $ 100 million bonus , which he is willing to sue Citi to get .
The man in question is Andrew Hall , an oil trader for a Citigroup subsidiary called Phibro .
He ’s being supported by Wall Street types because he ’s seen as very important to Citigroup , meaning he ’s made them a lot of money speculating on the oil market and will continue to do so .
Hall is credited with “ predicting ” the price of oil would skyrocket and made hundreds of millions of dollars for the company .
Trader Hits Jackpot in Oil , As Commodity Boom Roars On Mr. Hall Bet Early On Market Shift ; Buoying Citigroup
One of the biggest beneficiaries has been Andrew J. Hall , an enigmatic British - born trader who , five years ago , anticipated an important shift in the way the world valued oil — and bet big .
Over the past five years , Mr. Hall ’s compensation has totaled well over a quarter - billion dollars , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of securities filings and Mr. Hall ’s compensation structure .
Who is Andrew Hall ?
According to New York Mag , he is “ one of the few eccentric and wonderful folks who float among or above the wretched , amoral meatheads ” of Wall Street .
He leaves his office every afternoon to “ to row or practice calisthenics with a ballet teacher ” and is “ also one of the world ’s top collectors of contemporary art . ”
But in reality Andrew Hall , who looks like a cancerous Billy Bob Thornton , is a hardcore insider gambler with a long winning streak .
He works in a trading outfit that has a long history of market speculation by virtue of manipulation .
Hall was one of the key players responsible for driving up the price of oil , creating a speculative bubble that spiked 700 % in price and cost the economy an estimated $ 500 billion dollars just from 2006 to 2008 .
A Secret Oil Gusher Inside Citigroup By PAM MARTENS
If you want to flush out market manipulation , do n’t turn to the sleuths in Congress .
They ’ve been probing trading of the oil markets for two years and completely missed a company at the center of the action .
During that period , a barrel of crude oil has risen from $ 50 to $ 140 , leaving a wide swatch of Americans facing a choice this coming winter of buying food or paying their heating bill .
The company that Congress overlooked should have been an easy suspect .
It launched the oil trading career of the infamous fugitive , Marc Rich , pardoned by President Clinton in the final hours of his presidency .
It was at one time the largest oil and metals trader in the world .
In the late 90s it bought up 129 million ounces of silver for legendary investor Warren Buffet ’s company , Berkshire Hathaway , in London ’s unregulated over - the - counter market .
In 1990 , it was one of the first entrants into an ill - fated Russian oil venture called White Nights .
In 2005 , while part of Citigroup , the largest U.S. banking conglomerate perpetually scolded for obscene executive pay , it handed its chief and top oil trader , Andrew J. Hall , $ 125 Million for one year ’s work .
According to the Wall Street Journal , that was five times the pay package for Chuck Prince , CEO of the entire Citigroup conglomerate that year and $ 55 Million more than the CEO of Exxon - Mobil .

From the Brown Bess to the FN Scar , war rifles have been used for many years .
Some rifle names are well known , such as “ Winchester ” ( as in the famous “ Winchester Ghost House ” in California ) , while others are less commonly known .
Love them or hate them , each of these weapons has a significant place in our country ’s story .
They have been used in many wars , whether to fight against other countries , battle terrorism and oppression , or even confront our own compatriots .
Below , you ’ll find an infographic we ’ve created that highlights a few of the war rifles used throughout history .
We would n’t be where we are today in the beautiful US , the Land of the Free , without rifles .
They ’re a powerful weapon — no doubt about that — but the real honor has nothing to do with a piece of wood ( or resin ) and metal .
The true heroes are the resilient men and women of our military , whether veterans or active duty , who wield these guns to help keep us safe and free .
It takes a lot of courage to put your life on the line , but that ’s what our veterans have done over the years and our active duty servicemembers do every day .
Learning about these rifles should help us remember their sacrifices .
Below , we ’ve listed guns that were popular during different war periods .
Pick a favorite and share it with us in the comments below .
Or , if you know about one that is not listed , leave a comment about that too — we want to hear from you !

Today is the release date for Victor Stenger ‘s new book The New Atheism : Taking a Stand for Science and Reason ( Prometheus Books ) .
Stenger previously authored the God : The Failed Hypothesis , the first - ever book released by Prometheus Books to make it onto the New York Times Bestsellers List .
The new book is a history of atheism … over the past five years .
It essentially spans the release of Sam Harris ‘ The End of Faith in 2004 to the present day , explaining how the “ New Atheism ” rose up .
( Even if you do n’t like the term , it ’s certainly popular and Stenger rightly capitalizes on it . )
He summarizes the New Atheists ’ main points and offers up a few more arguments of his own .
Along the way , Stenger also discusses the critics ’ arguments to what is written in the atheist books — and offers excellent rebuttals to them .
This is a wonderful book for any person who has n’t read an atheist blog over the past five years .
That is to say , older and brand new atheists will enjoy Stenger ’s book — it ’s an excellent primer for godless newbies .
Younger and older - but - Internet - savvy atheists might enjoy it , but much of the time , they ’ll just be saying “ I already know this . ”
Several references in the book have been seen on blogs everywhere — like why Francis Collins is mistaken when he tries to reconciles science with faith .
Other references are known if you ’ve read the other New Atheist books .
Still , there is a lot of good information in here and I ’m not dismissing the book .
There is one serious criticism that I have about it .
In Stenger ’s entire discussion of the New Atheism , he seems to focus exclusively on the works of the bestselling authors .
There is little or no mention of American Atheists , the Freedom From Religion Foundation , the American Humanist Association , and the Secular Coalition for America .
Those organizations have flourished in the wake of the New Atheism .
There is also no mention at all of the atheist blogosphere — even PZ Myers gets short - shrifted .
I ’m not exactly unbiased about this , but I feel like blogs are one of the main ways people find out about what is going on in the atheist community .
To not mention them , even in a section titled “ The Future of Atheism , ” seems like a tremendous oversight .
Stenger comes off as someone who knows all about what gets released by major publishers but relatively little about what gets written on the Internet .
Perhaps that ’s not too surprising .
Even his bio at the end of the book — nearly identical to the one in God : The Failed Hypothesis — includes the line , “ Dr. Stenger maintains a popular Web site ( a thousand hits per month ) … ” A thousand hits per month ?
That was nice a decade ago , but nowadays , no “ popular ” web presence gets only 33 hits per day on average .
( I ’d like to believe more people visit his site and he just has n’t updated the bio . )
Personal rant about ignoring blogs and national organizations aside , The New Atheism is indeed a good introduction to the New Atheism .
It ’s not overly philosophical and provides easy - to - understand arguments to use if you ’re ever in a religious debate .
A few sample chapters from the book can be found here .
Oh , IS Rosetta still there ?
Where did I read something about it either not being there or being optional ...
I have no idea .
If it 's still there , I guess CS and 2 might work , but if Adobe is n't doing anything for compatibility of CS3 , would you think that either of them would run any better ?
I did not know that Rosetta was still there .
Nice ; now I 'll still be able to use some things .
Former Rep. William Jefferson ’s bribery and corruption conviction is “ a big tragedy for the New Orleans Democrat , ” said The Baton Rouge Advocate in an editorial , “ but it ’s an even bigger tragedy for Louisiana . ”
Jefferson became a “ national punch line ” four years ago when FBI agents found $ 90,000 in cash his freezer ; now he ’s also a “ stain on the image ” of a state already suffering under a reputation for corruption .
The bills in the freezer may have “ spawned a thousand jokes about cold cash , frozen assets , and the like , ” said Stephanie Grace in the New Orleans Times - Picayune .
But the “ great irony ” is that while the $ 90,000 , and his unshakable nickname , “ Dollar Bill ” Jefferson , were indirectly responsible for his guilty verdict , he was actually acquitted of the charge related to the freezer cash .
Thank goodness the jury convicted him on 11 other counts , said Marc Moore in PoliGazette .
Jefferson was one of the most “ baldly corrupt politicians of the decade , ” and an acquittal would have undermined our already “ shaky faith ” in the U.S. justice system .
This was a much - needed reminder that the powerful can’t “ do as they please . ”
There ’s still something “ tragic ” in the fall of Louisiana ’s first black congressman since Reconstruction , said Matthew Cooper in The Atlantic .
People in his longtime Democratic New Orleans district were really excited about the election of a black , Harvard - trained lawyer in 1991 .
And if there ’s a “ hopeful sign ” in this mess , it ’s that those same constituents voted him out for a Republican , Joseph Cao , now the first Vietnamese member of Congress .
Data from dirt suggests hurricane activity at 1,000 - year high Controversial study says hurricanes more common
Atlantic hurricanes have developed more frequently during the last decade than at any point in at least 1,000 years , a new analysis of historical storm activity suggests .
The new study , being published Thursday in Nature , attempts to reconstruct Atlantic hurricane activity back to the year A.D. 500 .
In doing so the authors found one era , a medieval period around A.D. 1000 , when storm activity matched or exceeded recent hurricane seasons that included storms such as Katrina and Rita .
The scientists used two methods to reconstruct hurricane activity from a period when there were no satellites , reliable ship records or coastal residents taking notes .
One tack is based on the observation that the powerful storm surge of large hurricanes deposits distinct layers of sediment in coastal lakes and marshes .
By taking cores of sediments at the bottom of these lakes , which span centuries , scientists believe they can tell when large hurricanes made landfall at a particular location .
The second method used a computer model to simulate Atlantic storm counts based upon historical Atlantic sea surface temperatures , El Niños and other climate factors .
The two independent estimates of historical storm activity were consistent , said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann , the paper 's lead author .
Both , for example , pinpointed a period of high activity between A.D. 900 and 1100 .
“ This tells us these reconstructions are very likely meaningful , ” he said .
This is not Mann 's first attempt to use “ proxies ” for actual observations of conditions to tease out historical climate details .
He was among the scientists whose global temperature reconstruction of the last 1,000 years — dubbed the “ hockey stick graph ” because it showed a distinct upward trend since the mid-19th century attributed to greenhouse gases — received both praise and criticism .
Now he appears to be doing the same with hurricane activity , and the new work is not without its detractors .
“ The paper comes to very erroneous conclusions because of using improper data and illogical techniques , ” said Chris Landsea , science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center .
In his criticism , Landsea notes that the paper begins by saying that Atlantic tropical activity has “ reached anomalous levels over the past decade . ”
This ignores recent work by Landsea and a number of other hurricane scientists who found that storm counts in the early 1900s — in an era without satellites and fewer sea - borne observers — likely missed three or four storms a year .
The addition of these storms to the historical record , he said , causes the long - term trend over the last century to disappear .
“ This is n't a small quibble , ” he said .
“ It 's the difference between a massive trend with doubling in the last 100 years , versus no trend . ”
Other scientists suggested that the new Nature paper does the best it can in deriving information about historical hurricane activity from a scant amount of data .
Yet this limits how useful the information is , said Rob Korty , an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University .
“ The bottom line is that I think their work adds new and helpful information , ” Korty said .
“ But we must keep in mind the assumptions this kind of work require are large by nature . ”

Matt C. at the Young Americans for Liberty blog wants to know why there are n’t more libertarian women .
By which he apparently means that he wants to know why more women do n’t read his own personal libertarian blog and why more women do n’t go to the libertarian political events that he personally goes to .
( Which is actually a separate question , although men posting Where ’s the women ?
posts never quite seem to recognize that . )
The first point in Matt ’s discussion is to ask whether this might be the result of intractable forces predisposing women to be anti-libertarian .
( Along with a link to an LRC article arguing , based purely on anecdote and appeal to conventional wisdom , that women are instinctually anti-libertarian because they are too emotional and mostly incapable of abstract thought . )
The second point in Matt ’s discussion is to wish for more women to show up for his Sausage Party because libertarian men are currently being driven insane by the lack of young libertarian women to hit on .
But I do know that a proportional increase in libertarian women would do well to preserve the sanity of libertarian men .
As it stands , the young female “ itinerary ” [ sic ! – R.G. ] is mostly composed of Obama zombies , fully - blown Marxists , and “ murder - all - Iranians ” type chickenhawks .
This undoubtedly needs to change .
The first commenter , Anonymous , adds : Most women / girls are more emotional than logical .
The ones who think with their brain and not their heart are libertarians .
But at the same time most libertarian women have a hard time being libertarian with ALL issues .
The third commenter , John M. , adds : I think many of the libertarian women that read this site would take offense to being labeled as more emotional than logical .
A more scientific distinction would be to argue that the ratio exists because men are naturally more skilled at mathematics and science whereas women are more skilled in the disciplines of reading and writing .
This gives men an advantage at comprehending and anaylzing the ramifications of policies .
But he does want more women in the movement , because he believes ( based on the experience of Sarah Palin , who he insults as having little … brain - power or charisma ) that having a few women on the ticket ( a few women who he believes will need to be politically educated by libertarian men ) they will be useful for getting out the vote .
Commenter Jack , in reply to John M.’s mention of a female professor who once chewed [ him ] up for saying that women are more emotional than logical , adds : LOL .
More indoctrination .
I hate to hear stories of culturally marxist academia .
It would be one thing to politely disagree , but professors these days will eat you up if you try to say that any two people are different than each other in any way .
Matt C. comes back around to use this as an opportunity to tell us what he thinks is wrong with the modern women ’s movement :
The result of the egalitarian , denialist feminist indoctrination of the last few decades has been a generation of guys afraid to act like guys , and women who hate most of us for being fakers .
Matt Co. also comes back around to mention that he opposes a woman ’s right to abortion , and that he considers this position compatible with the politics of individual liberty .
Sometimes , when women do n’t show up for your parties , the best thing to do is not to ask whether there ’s something wrong with women that makes them naturally predisposed not to dig the things you think they should dig .
Because , dude , sometimes the reason that women do n’t want to hang out with you is because there ’s something wrong with you .
And , specifically , because there ’s something wrong with the way that you treat women .
And if you want a good example , why not start with the way you approached your original question ?
Incidentally , be sure to read through the comments thread on the original post — not because the bulk of the comments are enlightening or even maginally original , but rather because radical feminist , left - libertarian Drunkenatheist ’s commentary on the bulk of the comments is .
Props .

Today I witnessed a rare protest in Hong Kong against the cruel practice of shark finning .
In fact ...
I believe it to be a first in this city .
And that honour goes to Ran Elfassy of ' Shark Rescue ' !
Shark Rescue are demanding the Hong Kong Government take the lead in calling for an end to shark finning , which is completely unsustainable .
They are also protesting to highlight a recent International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) report that said that 32 % of open ocean sharks are now threatened with extinction .
The issue has been rumbling along in Hong Kong for quite a while now .
First there was Disney .
Then the Universities took shark fin soup off their banquet menus .
Now the Hong Kong Shark Foundation has come along , but they are still getting their act together .
Expect a splash later in the year .
But today was the first time I have ever seen or heard of a protest being staged at ' ground zero ' of the problem , Des Voeux Road , Sheung Wan , that is to say on what the Hong Kong Tourism Board like to call ' Dried Seafood Street ' .
More like ' Oceanic Apocalypse Street ' .
I 've heard a lot of pub talk about parading a bloodied papier maché shark through the streets of Sheung Wan , or some such stunt , but no one ever follows through with it .
The traders were not exactly happy with Elfassy 's presence , although he did look rather fetching in his silvertip suit .
" Who the hell are you ?
And why are you in my shop ? "
A one man protest pauses for thought by a Whale Shark fin .
It 's great to see someone in Hong Kong finally doing something tangible about this issue .
Elfassy got a few bad looks , but also some encouragement .
So much talk , and not enough action .
Congratulations to Ran Elfassy at Shark Rescue .

Venezuela recalls ambassador and freezes relations in protest at claims it supplied arms to Farc rebels
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
President Hugo Chávez has recalled Venezuela 's ambassador from Colombia and frozen diplomatic relations in a row over weapons supplied to Colombian guerrillas .
The leftist leader also threatened to seize Colombian - owned businesses in Venezuela and to cut trade worth $ 6bn ( £ 4bn ) between the Andean neighbours .
Chávez said the moves were to punish the Bogotá government for claiming that Venezuela had armed leftist Farc rebels , a movement which Colombia , the US and the European Union list as a terrorist organisation and drug trafficker .
" We are not going to accept this irresponsibility , " he told a televised cabinet meeting on Tuesday night .
" We will freeze relations with Colombia . "
The announcement came a day after Colombia said the Farc had obtained AT - 4 anti-tank rocket launchers bought by Venezuela from Sweden 's Saab Bofors Dynamics .
Colombia said it had recently confirmed with Sweden the serial numbers of launchers seized from a rebel arms cache .
Swedish officials said the discovery indicated a violation of end - user licenses and asked Venezuela for an explanation .
Chávez , a former tank commander - turned - socialist revolutionary , said the accusation was a " big manipulation " and that it was unfair to single out Venezuela , which shares a 1,400 - mile border with Colombia , since the guerrillas obtain weapons from many sources , including Israel , Russia and the US .
During his decade in power Venezuela 's president has expressed admiration for the Farc , who share his leftist ideology , but since the group suffered serious military setbacks last year he has distanced himself and urged it to lay down its arms .
The insurgents ' despondency was visible in an address by a senior Farc commander , Jorge Briceño , in a recently leaked videotape .
He admitted the four - decade - old campaign was in trouble and lamented the loss of laptops captured last year by Colombia 's military .
" The secrets of the Farc have been lost completely . "
Despite his recent disavowal of the rebels , Chávez 's relations with Colombia 's president , Alvaro Uribe , a conservative , pro-Washington hardliner , have remained rocky , with both men regularly exchanging insults .
Colombia 's decision to bolster US military bases , which help counter rebels and drug trafficking , prompted a furious response from Caracas , which said it was being encircled and set up for attack just like Iraq .
A US congressional report last week accused corrupt Venezuelan officials of opening their borders to Colombian drug traffickers .
Chávez rejected the allegation as a smear and a veiled threat and said Venezuela would double its number of tanks to deter invasion .
Bogotá 's subsequent accusation over the rocket launchers prompted last night 's televised announcement .
" The Colombian government is showing it does n't care at all about its relations with Venezuela , " said Chávez .
In addition to withdrawing Venezuelan diplomats he threatened to seize Colombian businesses and eliminate imports of Colombian goods .
" We can get them from any other country . "
The socialist leader also warned he may shut down a 139 - mile pipeline which carries up to 300 metre cubic feet of natural gas daily from Colombia to Venezuelan oil installations .
Colombia 's government did not immediately respond to the announcements .
Business leaders on both sides of the border appealed for calm .
" The authorities need to meet and talk .
The worst affected would be ordinary people , " Daniel Montealegre , head of the business association Cavecol , told Venezuela 's Union Radio .
During previous diplomatic rows Chávez has threatened to cut economic links but , minded of the neighbours ' mutual dependence , not followed through .
The televised cabinet meeting doubled up as a 55th birthday party for the president .
After the warnings to Colombia there was a cake , songs and gifts , including a sword from Russia 's government .
Words from the ( investment ) wise for the week that was ( July 27 – August 2 , 2009 )
For some reason the lyrics of Electric Light Orchestra ’s classic , Livin ’
Thing , keep resounding in my head : “ You took me , ooh , woah , higher and higher , baby .
It ’s a livin ’ thing … ” Followed by : “ It ’s a terrible thing to lose … ” But let me get on to the review of the financial markets …
Investors ( or should I say “ Johnny - come - latelies ” ? ) last week again favored the reflation trade on the back of better - than - expected US earnings announcements and economic data , indicating that the trough of the recession might be behind us , or at least be stabilizing at depressed levels .
Newsweek ‘s cover declared : “ The recession is over ” , but a footnote stated “ Good luck surviving the recovery ” , implying a hard and treacherous slog ahead – note the pin below the “ liquidity - inflated ” balloon .
Tempering the bullish sentiment , David Rosenberg ( Gluskin Sheff & Associates ) commented as follows on Friday ’s announcement of a 1.0 % ( quarter on quarter annualized ) contraction in Q2 ’s real GDP : “ While we are past the most pronounced part of the downturn , it may still be premature to call for the end of the recession merely because of the prospect of a positive third - quarter GDP result .
After all , we saw GDP advance at a 1.5 % annual rate in last year ’s second quarter , and if memory serves us correctly , the NBER did not subsequently declare the end of the recession .
And even if the recession is ending , as we saw in 2002 , that does not guarantee a durable rally in risk assets .
Sustainability is the key , and it remains the wild card . ”

Many global stock market indices reached new highs for the year during the course of the week , and the S&P 500 Index closed in on the roundophobia 1,000 level .
Other beneficiaries of investors ’ continued interest in risky assets included commodities , oil , gold ( rebounding strongly after a midweek sell - off of $ 24 an ounce ) , high - yielding currencies and corporate bonds .
On the other hand , the US greenback remained out of favor and the Dollar Index closed the week at its lowest level for the year as investors shunned safe - haven assets .
The past week ’s performance of the major asset classes is summarized by the chart below – a set of numbers that again indicates investors ’ increased risk appetite .
In the case of government bonds , a lukewarm response to the US GDP report took the edge off a poor response to the massive issuance of paper by the Treasury .

A summary of the movements of major global stock markets for the past week , as well as various other measurement periods , is given in the table below .
As the second - quarter corporate results in the US came in thick and fast , the American and other markets extended their rallies to three straight weeks in most instances .
As a matter of fact , if not for the down week of the Dublin ISEQ Index , the entire table would have been green .
But then again , “ green shoots ” seem to be frowned upon by many pundits .
The MSCI World Index ( +1.7 % ) and MSCI Emerging Markets Index ( + 2.5 % ) both made headway last week to take the year - to - date gains to +13.5 % and an imposing +48.8 % respectively .
As seen from the table , July was a solid month for stock markets with all the major indices recording positive returns .
The Dow Jones Industrial Index had its best month since 2002 and the S&P 500 Index , Nasdaq Composite Index and Russell 2000 Index all recorded a fifth successive monthly gain , but were trumped by the Chinese Shanghai Composite Index that notched up seven consecutive positive months .
Click here or on the table below for a larger image .
Stock market returns for the week ranged from top performers such as the Czech Republic ( + 8.7 % ) , Kazakhstan ( + 8.5 % ) , Turkey ( + 8.2 % ) , Indonesia ( + 6.3 % ) and Kyrgyzstan ( + 5.8 % ) to Slovakia ( - 6.3 % ) , Greece ( - 3.6 % ) , Nepal ( - 3.0 % ) , Ecuador ( - 2.2 % ) and Macedonia ( - 1.5 % ) at the other end of the scale .
The Shanghai Composite Index has surged 87.4 % in 2009 as $ 1.1 trillion of bank loans and government spending stimulated economic recovery .
Notwithstanding its gain for the week , the Index plunged by 5.0 % on Wednesday – its largest decline in eight months – on speculation that the government might curb inflows into the stock market .
“ The government is worried that this bubble is becoming too big so they ’re going to cut credit growth by probably half in the second half , ” remarked former Morgan Stanley chief Asian economist Andy Xie .
“ I think the property and stock markets will come under pressure around October , ” he said in a Bloomberg interview .
Of the 97 stock markets I keep on my radar screen , a majority of 74 % ( last week : 82 % ) recorded gains , 22 % showed losses and 4 % remained unchanged .
( Click here to access a complete list of global stock market movements , as supplied by Emerginvest . )
John Nyaradi ( Wall Street Sector Selector ) reports that as far as exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) are concerned , the winners for the week included KBW Regional Banking ( KRE ) ( + 11.1 % ) , MarketVectors Indonesia ( IDX ) ( + 9.2 % ) , PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals ( PSAU ) , and United States Gasoline ( UGA ) ( +6.7 % ) .
At the bottom end of the performance ranking , ETFs included “ all things short ” such as ProShares Short Financial ( SEF ) ( - 3.6 % ) , ProShares Short MSCI EAFE ( EFZ ) ( - 3.1 % ) and ProShares Short Russell 2000 ( RWM ) ( - 2.3 % ) .
As far as the thawing of the credit crisis is concerned , junk bond yields continued declining , as shown by the Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index ( and also by the good performance of the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF ) .
The Index dropped by 57.8 % to 922 from its record high of 2,182 on December 15 , meaning the spread between high - yield debt and comparable US Treasuries was 922 basis points on Friday .
Considerable progress has been made and high - yield spreads “ only ” need to fall another 7.4 % to reach the “ pre-Lehman ” level ( 854 basis points ) .

The quote du jour this week comes from Richard Russell ( Dow Theory Letters ) who said : “ I ’m reading and listening to an awful lot of drivel these days .
Every analyst has his own scenario , and all seem anxious to broadcast their personal opinions .
In this business , there comes a time when the situation is so complex that the most honest thing to do is simply to admit that you do n’t know what the hell is going on .
The best thing to do is to keep your mouth shut and await developments . ”
( Also read Barry Ritholtz ’s related post on “ Analyzing the analyzers “ . )
Other news is that Washington hosted a US - China Strategic Dialogue , as the Chinese are increasingly focusing on America ’s deficit , the value of the US dollar and the implications for their Treasury holdings .
Interestingly , the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet last week contracted for the second consecutive week .
“ Do you think Ben assured Chinese officials earlier this week that the Fed was reducing its balance sheet ? ” asked Bill King ( The King Report ) .
Also , the US House of Representatives on Friday approved a $ 2 billion extension of the government ’s car sales incentive program , “ Cash for Clunkers ” , while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) closed four more banks on Friday , bringing the tally of US bank failures in 2009 to 68 ( 93 since the beginning of the recession ) .
Next , a tag cloud of all the articles I read during the past week .
This is a way of visualizing word frequencies at a glance .
Key words such as “ bank ” , “ economic ” , “ market ” , “ prices ” , “ growth ” , “ China ” and “ Fed ” featured prominently .
The key moving - average levels for the major US indices , the BRIC countries and South Africa ( from where I am writing this post ) are given in the table below .
All the indices trade above their respective 50 - and 200 - day moving averages .
The 50 - day lines are also in all instances above the 200 - day lines and therefore not threatening the bullish “ golden crosses ” established when the 50 - day averages broke upwards through the 200 - day averages .
Importantly , the 200 - day moving average of the S&P 500 Index last week turned up for the first time since January 2008 , after being breached upwards by the Index in early June .
The 200 - day line – generally seen as a key indicator distinguishing between a primary bull and bear market – is now trending higher for all the indices included in the table , with the exception of the Dow Jones Transportation Index and the Russian Trading System Index .
The June highs and July lows are also given in the table as these levels define a support area for a number of the indices .

When considering monthly data , three momentum - type oscillators ( RSI , MACD and ROC ) are reversing course for the first time since the sell signals of 2007 and now either indicate buy signals ( or are getting close to one in the case of MACD ) .

The bulk of the Q2 earnings reports in the US are now in and 71 % of the companies have so far reported better - than - expected earnings – one of the highest quarterly readings over the last ten years and by far the highest since the bear market began in late 2007 ( albeit largely as a result of cost cutting negating a decline in revenues ) .
“ We ’ve now had two straight quarters where the ‘ beat ’ rate has increased quarter over quarter , meaning analysts overestimated earnings to the downside .
This is a very positive sign for the market at the moment … , ” said Bespoke .
Source : Bespoke , July 31 , 2009 .
Expectations for the next earnings season will be high and whether these are met will be determined by the extent of the economic recovery . “… what should matter most for stocks is nominal GDP – price multiplied by volume .
Indeed , the chart below illustrates the case – the rate of change in the S&P 500 ultimately tracks the trend - line in nominal GDP growth , ” said David Rosenberg .

I now know why I keep thinking of those ELO lyrics – it ’s the stretched valuations that bother me .
Based on operating earnings ( i.e. stripping out everything that is bad ) , the historical price / earnings ( PE ) multiple of the S&P 500 is 24.6 ; using reported earnings the figure shoots up to a giddy 777.5 !
Getting past the loss - making fourth quarter of 2008 and calculating prospective multiples through December 31 , 2010 , reduces the valuations to 17.8 and 32.9 respectively – still hardly the type of valuations that will inspire one to be a buyer across the board .
( The earnings estimates are courtesy of Standard & Poor’s . )
Kevin Lane ( Fusion IQ ) said : “ We have been saying for a while now that the market would likely work higher as sentiment was more doubting than embracing , suggesting that many still had not deployed a lot of capital .
That said , we now believe that investors who let the market run away from them or were only partially invested are finally coming into the pool .
The new entrants could certainly fuel things ( i.e. new buying power ) a little bit further before we have another corrective wave .
That said , we think in the not too distant future and a bit higher from these levels there will be an opportunity to make sales before a late summer / fall correction . ”
Looking at the next few weeks , I am of the opinion that stock markets have run away from fundamental reality and that a pullback / consolidation looks likely .
Taking a slightly longer - term view , I think we are in a ( possibly lengthy ) bottoming - out phase as far as slow - growth ( OECD ) countries are concerned , but already in new ( potentially volatile ) uptrends regarding high - growth emerging and commodities - related markets .

The results of last week ’s Survey of Business Confidence of the World achieved their best level since early October , reported Moody ’s Economy.com .
Business sentiment is improving across the globe and businesses ’ broad assessments of current conditions and the outlook into 2010 have brightened meaningfully .
However , despite the steady improvement in confidence , businesses are still cautious and the Survey results remain consistent with a global economy that is still in recession .

Additionally , the Federal Reserve ’s latest Beige Book , released on Wednesday , indicated that the US economic recession was becoming less severe .
While still weak , some regions reported that the pace of the downturn had moderated .
According to the US Commerce Department ’s advance growth estimate , real GDP contracted at an annualized rate of 1 % in the second quarter – smaller than the consensus expectation for a 1.5 % decline .
The rate of contraction slowed from the first quarter ’s - 6.4 % as a result of a much smaller decline in investment , a smaller drop in inventories , less of a decline in exports , and strong government “ stimulus ” spending ( +13.3 % on an annualized basis – see chart below ) .
However , consumer spending fell by a disappointing 1.2 % in the second quarter .
Source : Northern Trust – Daily Global Commentary , July 31 , 2009 .
Summarizing the growth data , Paul Kasriel ( Northern Trust ) said : ” … the worst is over , but the best is not yet at hand .
The imminent recovery will take hold not with some sustainable explosion in one sector or another , but because some hitherto really weak sectors will stabilize and / or grow a little . ”
“ We expect a gradual recovery in the US economy in the months ahead , but the Fed will need to keep the policy setting extremely aggressive to achieve a self - reinforcing upturn in consumer confidence and spending , ” added BCA Research .
Warning of a W - shaped recession , Nouriel Roubini ( RGE Monitor ) said ( via Forbes ) :
“ The global recession may end toward the end of 2009 – instead of sooner – but the global recovery in 2010 will be anemic and well below trend as households , firms and financial institutions are constrained in their ability to borrow , lend and spend .
“ Meanwhile , a perfect storm of the following has inched a little closer on the radar of this cloudy global economic outlook : persistently large fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation ; monetization of such deficits that will eventually increase expected inflation ; rising government bond yields ; soaring oil prices ; weak profits ; still - falling job figures ; and stagnant growth .
It ’s a storm that could blow the recovering world economy back into a double - dip recession by late 2010 or 2011 . ”

Nouriel Roubini ( Forbes ) :
The road ahead for the global economy
“ The global recession may end toward the end of 2009 – instead of sooner – but the global recovery in 2010 will be anemic and well below trend as households , firms and financial institutions are constrained in their ability to borrow , lend and spend .
“ Meanwhile , a perfect storm of the following has inched a little closer on the radar of this cloudy global economic outlook : persistently large fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation ; monetization of such deficits that will eventually increase expected inflation ; rising government bond yields ; soaring oil prices ; weak profits ; still - falling job figures ; and stagnant growth .
It ’s a storm that could blow the recovering world economy back into a double - dip recession by late 2010 or 2011 .
“ After rising sharply for three months , asset markets in the mature economies have paused and started a tentative correction in the last few weeks .
Risk investors that had driven up prices have partially taken profits , and suddenly they are wary .
They are right to be wary .
“ Before the recent correction started , there was a very sharp rise in asset prices , beginning around March 9 .
Equities rose , oil and energy prices rose , commodities rose .
Credit spreads sharply contracted , indicating a surge of new confidence in the corporate sector .
Long - term government interest rates shot up as ten - year Treasurys rose from 2 % to 4 % before retracing , suggesting that markets saw growth returning in the near future .
The volatility of asset prices also fell , and that is always a sign of increasing confidence and lower risk - aversion .
“ Emerging market asset prices – equities , bonds and currencies – have , if anything , been more bullish .
The broad indexes of the BRICs showed that , in early 2009 , some investors again began to believe that these economies , starting with China , will recover and experience further rises in commodity prices .
“ In other words , markets , which only four months ago were pricing - in an L - shaped global near - depression and a near financial meltdown , were three weeks ago pricing - in a rapid V - shaped recovery toward potential growth .
And there are some good reasons for part of this rally .
At the beginning of the year gross domestic product ( GDP ) was falling at a rate that suggested that something close to economic depression really was looming , and there was a widespread sense that many of the world ’s biggest financial institutions were effectively insolvent .
“ Today , both of those fears have been , for now , checked ; the tail risk of an L - shaped near - depression is significantly lower .
We have seen policy action by the US , Europe , Japan , China and many other economies that has been unprecedented , with interest rates reduced to near zero , with much bad debt ring - fenced ( although not written off or worked out ) , with liquidity created by orthodox and unorthodox means and with final demand in many economies primed by central governments .
The rate of output decline has shallowed dramatically , the ‘ tail risk ’ of a chronic slump has been suppressed , and financial institutions are recording profitable quarters , at least on paper , as forbearance and public subsidies are , for now , hiding their mounting losses .
“ All this creates a moment when risk to a rally is to be expected .
As tail risk is reduced , investors move back into equities , credit and commodities . ”

Barry Norris ( Argonaut Capital ) : Viva la “ V ”
“ Most in the markets believe the global economic recovery will be anything but V - shaped – although such a scenario actually looks increasingly likely , says Barry Norris , partner at Argonaut Capital .
“ He says that while the current downturn has been extremely severe , the overlooked story is that compared to previous recessions , real demand for most goods has suffered just a fairly routine fall - off .
“ ‘ This means inventories in many industries have been drawn down to an unprecedented degree .
With very low inventory levels , any normalisation in demand , caused by , say , pent - up demand , is likely to be an equally powerful positive stimulus .
This is how the recovery could be V - shaped after all . ’
“ He says purchasing managers ’ indices not only give a good idea of future activity , but of why economies tend to recover from slumps .
‘ For most managers , conditions wo n’t get any worse than December 2008 and it will not be long before the majority are experiencing better conditions .
“ ‘ Global PMIs are moving back towards equilibrium .
This means economic expansion and the end of recession – and most major economies will return to growth in the second half of 2009 .
This recession is ending in a recovery that is suspiciously V - shaped .
“ ‘ This bottoming out should mark the low point in corporate profits .
When we buy equities now it is increasingly likely we are buying trough earnings . ' ”

Bloomberg : US assures “ concerned ” China it will shrink deficit
“ Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner pledged to rein in the US deficit as China underscored concern about preserving the value of its $ 801.5 billion of Treasury holdings .
“ The US will ensure a ‘ sustainable ’ deficit by 2013 , Geithner said at the beginning of the first round of Strategic and Economic Dialogue talks under President Barack Obama in Washington .
China is ‘ concerned about the security of our financial assets ’ , Assistant Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said .
“ In a shift from meetings under the Bush administration , officials indicated there were few signs of tension over the value of China ’s yuan , which US lawmakers have labeled as artificially cheap and an aid to Chinese exports .
That may be because the ‘ best idea is just to keep the yuan - dollar rate stable ’ given US need for Chinese demand for Treasuries , said Ronald McKinnon , a professor of economics at Stanford University .
“ ‘ The Chinese are trapped with supporting the value of the dollar , ’ McKinnon said in a telephone interview from Stanford , California .
‘ If they withdrew from the market , there ’s a big appreciation ’ of the yuan as a result that would send China ’s exports down , he said .
“ The new focus on the deficit and Treasuries reflects the legacy of China ’s record trade surpluses and its accumulation of dollars as a result of holding down the yuan .
Chinese foreign exchange reserves surpassed $ 2 trillion for the first time in the second quarter , and its holdings of Treasuries reached $ 801.5 billion in May , about 100 % more than at the start of 2007 .
“ Obama said in a speech opening the meetings he wants to engage China in cooperation on a range of issues , beyond acting together to stimulate a global economic recovery .
“ ‘ We must also be united in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , ’ Obama said .
He cited nuclear proliferation , terrorism , piracy , global pandemics , climate change and civil war as other common threats facing the two countries .
In her sessions , Clinton addressed both the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs . ”

Laurence Mutkin ( Morgan Stanley ) :
The borrowers return
“ Recent official lending surveys in the UK and eurozone offer grounds for optimism , says Laurence Mutkin , head of European rates strategy at Morgan Stanley .
“ He says it is vital to identify whether the collapse in broad money growth since the onset of the credit crunch – and particularly in lending to the non-financial sector – is cyclical or secular .
“ ‘ If it is the former , then a cyclical economic upswing should revive credit markets .
Central banks and governments have taken extraordinary measures to achieve this .
“ ‘ But if we are seeing the start of a secular deleveraging , with fiscal and monetary authorities unable to trigger a revival in credit growth , the monetary transmission mechanism will remain impaired – making a period of Japan - style stagnation more likely in the West . ’
“ The latest survey from the ECB provides some reassurance , Mr Mutkin says .
‘ It shows that appetite for lending and borrowing became less negative during the second quarter .
Consumers have moved more quickly than corporations towards being willing to borrow again . ’
“ This trend was also reflected in the Bank of England ’s latest credit conditions survey , he says .
“ ‘ All in all , while credit growth looks set to remain soft , the restored willingness of consumers and businesses to borrow implies a lessening risk of secular deleveraging – although the next half year will prove crucial . ' ”

Radoslaw Bodys ( Bank of America - Merrill Lynch ) : CCE borrowing fears overblown
“ Fears about central and eastern Europe ’s foreign exchange borrowing problem now look to have been overdone , says Radoslaw Bodys , emerging EMEA economist at Bank of America - Merrill Lynch .
“ He points to two major concerns : that borrowing had become a threat to the region ’s external financial stability , and the negative impact on the real economy of the private sector ’s impaired balance sheet .
“ But Mr Bodys says : ‘ We believe the former problem has been largely sorted out given the recent massive balance of payments adjustment , while the latter issue has been blown out of proportion from the very beginning . ’
“ First , he says , the CEE ’s non-financial private sector FX credit exposure is relatively large , but considerably smaller than commonly believed .
“ Second , he argues that the belief that exchange rate depreciation severely hit central Europe ’s non-financial private sector balance sheet is a complete misunderstanding .
“ ‘ The fact is that falling interest rates have more than offset FX depreciation over the past year .
Not only did the service cost of FX loans not increase , but actually fell by between 5.5 % and 7.5 % from the previous year . ’
“ And Mr Bodys believes that calls for , and actions by , regulators to ‘ kill ’ FX lending are pointless .
‘ Banks have already tightened their credit policies so severely that FX lending is already virtually dead . ' ”

Financial Times : Europe braced for rising credit card defaults
“ Lenders in Europe bracing themselves for a rising wave of consumer debt defaults as the credit card crisis that has caused billions of dollars in losses among US banks spreads across the Atlantic .
“ The International Monetary Fund estimates that of US consumer debt totalling $ 1,914 billion , about 14 % will turn sour .
“ It expects that 7 % of the $ 2,467 billion of consumer debt in Europe will be lost , with much of that falling in the UK , the continent ’s biggest nation of credit card borrowers .
“ National Debtline of the UK said that the number of calls it had received from UK consumers worried about loans , credit cards and mortgage arrears had reached 41,000 in May – double the 20,000 calls it had received in May 2008 .
It added that the number of calls showed no sign of abating .
“ In the US , credit card defaults have been rising for months as a spike in unemployment and the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression took their toll on overstretched consumers .
“ The rate of US credit card losses has overtaken the rate of unemployment in recent months – a highly unusual occurrence that makes it more difficult for card issuers to forecast future losses .
“ The severity of the financial crisis coupled with rising unemployment on both sides of the Atlantic have stoked fears of a substantially higher default rate in the coming months . ”

The New York Times : House votes for $ 2 billion fund to extend “ Clunker ” plan
“ As problems go in the nation ’s capital these days , the White House could live with this one .
“ Officials at the Transportation Department figured Thursday morning that they had applications in hand for about a tenth of the $ 1 billion that Congress set aside for the “ cash for clunkers ” program , meant to give rebates to people who turn in old vehicles for new , more fuel - efficient ones .
“ By late Thursday afternoon , they ran to the White House with news that they might have committed the whole $ 1 billion , or even more .
This stimulus program had , in fact , stimulated very heavy demand , which required a quick decision about what to do next .
“ Over the course of 24 hours , the White House changed its mind three times .
At first , it said it would shut off the incentives by day ’s end .
Then it let them continue through Friday , and then through Sunday .
“ On Friday , the House voted to add $ 2 billion , soothing the fears of car dealers , who would have been responsible for paying any money they promised to customers as a rebate .
But the Senate might not follow suit .
Some senators said Friday that the speed at which the money flew out the door was a sign that the government ’s deal was too good , and perhaps should be modified . ”

MoneyNews : Doug Casey – America has died
“ As the Obama administration has taken over the car industry , the banking industry , and the insurance industry , some experts now believe that American style capitalism is dead .
Doug Casey , a free market capitalist and founder and chairman of Casey Research , is one of them .
“ ‘ Unfortunately , the idea of America has died and it ’s been replaced by another political entity called the United States , which in essence is no different from the 200 other countries spread across the globe , ’ he says .
“ In an exclusive interview with Dan Mangru of Newsmax TV and Moneynews.com , Casey tells why he sees American capitalism on the decline and why other countries such as China will eclipse the United States .
“ ‘ The average entrepreneur in China has a lot more freedom than the average entrepreneur does in the United States .
He pays a lot less taxes … he ’s got a lot less regulation , ’ says Casey .
“ Casey goes on to tell Mangru that Communism is a ‘ scam ’ and is designed to cheat workers .
“ Casey also believes that the United States has not seen the worst of the economic crisis .
‘ We ’re just starting to see the beginning of what ’s going to happen , ’ Casey says .
“ The United States has already entered what Casey calls the Greater Depression , one that will be much more serious than the 1930s .
‘ This depression can be as long and as deep as you can possibly imagine , ’ he says .
“ The reason most people do n’t realize this is that the majority of those giving economic opinions are n’t economists describing how the world actually works but political apologists describing how they think it ought to work , Casey notes .
“ ‘ Everyone ’s looking to the government for a solution , but all the government does is tax and regulate and inflate the currency , ’ Casey says .
“ Trillions of dollars of phony inflationary capital people believed were real assets have disappeared , says Casey .
That ’s going to continue to deplete the value of the dollar and guarantee catastrophic inflation in the future .
“ ‘ If you ’re relying on the US dollar , you ’re relying on a figment of the US government ’s imagination , ’ says Casey .
‘ To me , holding US dollars for the long term is about the most stupid thing you can do .
Gold is the only financial asset that is n’t someone else ’s liability . ' ”

Wells Fargo Securities : Recession probability drops again
“ Our monthly recession probability model turned in April , and the sharp drop is now confirmed by our quarterly model .
Recent improvement of the LEI and ISM manufacturing series confirms economic recovery .
“ Economic recovery prospects have improved .
The probability of recession two quarters from now has downshifted sharply over the previous quarter .
As evidenced in the top graph , the latest probability calculation from our model is consistent with prior economic recoveries .
Our model takes a look at a very broad set of variables , and the results suggest economic recovery is likely within the next six months .
The original model estimates were published in “ Forecasting US Recessions with Probit Stepwise Regression Models , ” Business Economics , January 2008 .
Economic improvement began to show up in our model in recent months in the regional Chicago manufacturing survey .
While the official recovery call will come from the National Bureau of Economic Research , our outlook is that the recovery will begin in the third quarter of this year .
“ As evidenced by the graph , the recession probabilities move quickly and thereby emphasize how rapidly the economic cycle can change .
Moreover , the data suggest that while it may be fashionable for some so - called pundits to be always bearish or bullish the reality is that the economy is characterized by cycles and business leaders are best served by economic advice that recognizes that cycle .
“ While we expect consumer spending to improve in the period ahead , we expect such growth to be disappointing to policymakers who anticipate a return to a normal pace of growth .
Moreover , we expect the recovery will not be strong enough to produce jobs as in prior recoveries or to fuel the pace of housing / discretionary spending that we have come to expect .
Slower - than - usual growth produces greater - than - expected pressures on public budgets . ”

Financial Times :
Fed sees signs of economic improvement
“ The pace of economic decline has moderated or stabilised in most parts of the US , the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday , with manufacturing , residential property and even employment showing some signs of improvement .
“ According to the Beige Book , which offers a picture of the economy based on anecdotal evidence provided to the US central bank , overall economic activity has stabilised at a low level since its last report in early June when most regions reported that conditions were weak or worsening .
The report adds to mounting evidence that the worst recession in the past 50 years is easing .
“ The more optimistic tone was a welcome shift from reports earlier in the year signalling that the economy was in freefall .
Many obstacles remain , however , and the Beige Book warned that commercial property , consumer spending and the labour market were still severely weakened .
“ Retail sales remained sluggish in most of the Fed ’s 12 districts , with consumers focused on cheaper necessities while luxury goods ‘ languish ’ .
Car sales were mixed early this summer , with purchases of new cars stalling while five regions reported growing strength in sales of less expensive used cars .
“ Manufacturing activity remained ‘ subdued ’ but improved from earlier in the year , as some districts reported that companies were replenishing inventories after months of clearing stocks to cope with the collapse of consumer demand . ”
“ Unemployment , which has reached a 26 - year high of 9.5 per cent , is an ongoing worry , but there were some glimmers of hope in the Fed ’s report .
Seven districts said that businesses had begun to take advantage of the job cuts by partaking in “ selective hiring ” of top talent that other companies have shed .
But the labour market is still “ slack ” and many businesses continue to cut workers , freeze pay or institute furloughs . ”

MoneyNews : Plosser – Obama risks damaging Fed
“ Charles Plosser , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , said he was concerned about the Obama administration ’s plans to rewrite the nation ’s financial regulations , saying it could leave the US Central Bank with an ill - defined role as bank regulator and make it less effective at its main job of fighting inflation .
“ Plosser is one of 12 Federal Reserve regional bank presidents who have a voice in Fed decisions about interest rates and bank supervision .
“ ‘ You do n’t want an institution that is so heavy into other things that it fails to do its appropriate role on the monetary policy piece , ’ Plosser told The Wall Street Journal .
“ ‘ I would feel more comfortable with this if I had a clearer statement of what it is we ’re expected to accomplish , ’ he said .
“ President Barack Obama has proposed giving the Fed additional power to oversee large financial institutions as part of a regulatory overhaul .
“ Nevertheless , public opinion of the Fed is falling .
“ A Gallup poll , conducted in mid-July , found that only 30 % rated the Fed as doing an ‘ excellent / good ” job , down sharply from the 53 % who thought the Fed was doing an excellent - to - good job in a survey in 2003 , the Associated Press reported . ”

Financial Times : Bernanke explains
Fed ’s new openness
“ Ben Bernanke has explained his decision to turn the normally secretive US Federal Reserve into something of an open house , saying his unusually large number of recent public appearances are the result of the ‘ extraordinary ’ times the country faces .
“ The Fed chairman has turned up at everything from a 60 Minutes television interview to a Kansas City town hall session over the past few weeks , prompting some to wonder if he is trying to ensure he is re¬appointed when his four - year term ends in January .
“ However , Mr Bernanke said he was answering a clear public need .
‘ Normally Fed chairmen do n’t do this kind of thing because we want to avoid causing near - term market volatility as people try to anticipate our next FOMC ( Federal Open Markets Committee ) meeting , ” he told the Financial Times this week .
“ ‘ But this is an extraordinary period .
We want to answer the questions we know people have about what hit them in this economic crisis , what the Fed is doing about it and how we expect economic developments to play out . ’
“ The Fed ’s new openness is well timed .
This week , as the debate continues over the bank ’s role in the financial crisis and proposed prudential powers , Gallup showed it is held in lower esteem than the Internal Revenue Service .
“ More seriously , there is a populist headwind in Congress among some lawmakers who want to remove the Fed ’s monetary independence .
“ Cynics believe Mr Bernanke is using this public relations outreach to ensure he is reappointed next January .
But Mr Bernanke says the goal is to educate the public about what the Fed does at a time when it keeps getting caught in the crossfire over its role in the crisis and its future prudential powers . ”
“ The chairman ’s personal standing remains high .
‘ I would be astonished if Ben is n’t re¬appointed , ’ says Alice Rivlin , a former vice - chairman of the Fed .
‘ He has become very good at interacting with people beyond the usual circles and he is good at avoiding traditional Fed - speak . ' ”

Nouriel Roubini ( The New York Times ) : The Great Preventer
“ Last week Ben Bernanke appeared before Congress , setting off a discussion over whether the president should reappoint him as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends next January .
Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed .
Both the conventional and unconventional decisions made by this scholar of the Great Depression prevented the Great Recession of 2008 - 2009 from turning into the Great Depression 2.0 .
“ Mr. Bernanke understands that in the Great Depression , the collapse of the money supply and the lack of monetary stimulus during contractions worsened the country ’s economic free fall .
This lesson has paid off .
Mr. Bernanke ’s decision to keep interest rates low and encourage lending has , for now , averted the L - shaped near depression that seemed highly likely after the financial collapse last fall .
“ To be sure , an endorsement of Mr. Bernanke ’s reappointment comes with many caveats .
Mr. Bernanke , a Fed governor in the early part of this decade , supported flawed policies when Alan Greenspan pushed the federal funds rate ( the policy rate set by the Fed as its main tool of monetary policy ) too low for too long and failed to monitor mortgage lending properly , thus creating the housing and credit and mortgage bubbles .
“ He and the Fed made three major mistakes when the subprime mortgage crisis began .
First , he kept arguing that the housing recession would bottom out soon ( it has not bottomed out even three years later ) .
Second , he argued that the subprime problem was a contained problem when in reality it was a symptom of the biggest leverage and credit bubble in American history .
Third , he argued that the collapse in the housing market would not lead to a recession , even though about one - third of jobs created in the latest economic recovery were directly or indirectly related to housing .
“ Mr. Bernanke ’s analysis was mistaken in several other important ways .
He argued that monetary policy should not be used to control asset bubbles .
He attributed the large United States current account deficits to a savings glut in China and emerging markets , understating the role that excessive fiscal deficits and debt accumulation by American households and the financial system played .
“ Still , when a liquidity and credit crunch emerged in the summer of 2007 , Mr. Bernanke engineered a U - turn in Fed policy that prevented the crisis from turning into a near depression .
He did this largely with actions and programs that were not in the traditional toolbox of monetary policy . ”

BCA Research : US GDP – major benchmark revision to growth
“ US output net of inventories stabilized in the second quarter , which could foreshadow positive growth in the second half as inventory levels are rebuilt .
“ Although the advanced GDP report for the second quarter beat expectations , it also indicated that the 2008 downturn in growth and consumer spending was considerably weaker than previously thought .
Gross domestic product contracted by 6.4 % ( at annual rates ) in the first quarter , a much weaker result than the previous estimate of 5.5 % .
Consumer spending was also revised markedly lower .
Interestingly however , real final sales of domestic product – i.e. GDP net of the change in inventory – has stabilized , a fairly positive sign that growth can turn positive in the second half of the year as inventories are rebuilt .
“ Bottom line :
We expect a gradual recovery in the US economy in the months ahead , but the Fed will need to keep the policy setting extremely aggressive to achieve a self - reinforcing upturn in consumer confidence and spending . ”

Asha Bangalore ( Northern Trust ) : Jobless claims report makes a case that the labor market is improving
“ Initial jobless claims rose 25,000 to 584,000 during the week ended July 25 .
There were seasonal distortions in the early part of July which have been more or less corrected now .
Typically , layoffs at auto companies increase in July for retooling .
This year the layoffs occurred in May and June and were related to the GM and Chrysler bankruptcy issues .
This shift in layoffs led to lower seasonally adjusted jobless claims in July and the readings we see now are gains after the artificial decline .
Despite the increase in initial jobless claims in the past two weeks , the peak in initial jobless claims has occurred in March 2009 ( 674,000 ) . ”
“ Continuing claims , which lag initial jobless by one week , fell 54,000 to 6.197 million .
Continuing claims have declined in four out of the last five weeks . ”

The Wall Street Journal : Consumer - debt picture shows one sign of improvement
“ Fewer American households appear to be falling behind on their debt payments , according to a new study , but some economists question whether the data reflect a meaningful easing of consumer - credit problems .
“ ‘ I feel very confident we are at a turning point , ’ said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody ’s Economy.com .
‘ Household credit conditions are set to improve significantly by this time next year , ’ he said .
Mr. Zandi attributed the turn to tightening lending standards .
“ Mr. Zandi ’s outlook is based largely on his analysis of 7.5 million credit files supplied by Equifax Inc. , the credit - reporting titan based in Atlanta .
The files analyzed represent 5 % of US consumers .
The analysis showed that the number of mortgage , credit - card and other consumer loan payments that were 30 and 60 days past due fell by nearly 1.1 million to 13.9 million at the end of June , on a seasonally adjusted basis , from three months earlier .
Nearly two - thirds of the decline came from falling credit - card delinquencies .
“ The analysis of ‘ early - stage ’ delinquencies can be key to spotting changing trends .
When such data show a slowing , it could indicate that total delinquencies will come down in the next six to 12 months .
But the data do n’t mean the broader credit problems plaguing banks and other lenders will be eliminated anytime soon .
“ In fact , the total number of seriously delinquent borrowers and those in default will keep rising for some time , as borrowers who are 30 , 60 and 90 days delinquent move to the next phase of delinquency .
Overall , household liabilities in delinquency and default rose to $ 1.15 trillion in June , 10 % of total liabilities , according to Mr. Zandi ’s analysis of the Equifax data .
The delinquency and default rate in June was up from 8.96 % in March and 8.01 % in December .
“ Still , Mr. Zandi said the reduction in newly delinquent borrowers is a positive sign for the economy , especially coming at a time when ‘ the job market and housing market are still bad and getting worse .
Once those markets stabilize , when combined with the tighter underwriting , we will see a dramatic improvement in credit quality . ’
“ But not all analysts are convinced .
Some believe that improvements in the data represent little more than temporary blips that will reverse as a new wave of credit problems emerge . ”

The bottom of the housing market appears to have occurred in January 2009 ( 329,000 ) .
Sales of new single - family homes have dropped 72 % from the peak registered four years ago in July 2005 .
On a year - to - year basis , sales of new single - family homes fell 20 % in June , a noteworthy deceleration following the largest cyclical drop in January 2009 ( 45.5 % ) . ”
“ The inventory - sales ( I - S ) ratio of new single - family homes has dropped significantly .
This ratio has dropped in four of the five months ended June .
The median I - S ratio is roughly a 6 - month supply .
The I - S ratio of all new homes was an 8.8 - month supply in June , down from a 12.4 - month supply in January .
Unsold and sold homes are reported as three sub- categories – not started , under construction , and completed homes .
Within the sub-category of unsold / sold completed homes , the I - S ratio was an 8.0 - month supply in June vs. a peak of a 12.8 - month supply in January .
“ The median number of months to sell a new single - family home continues to advance , and in June it reached a new record high of an 11.8 - month supply .
“ The median price of a new single - family home was $ 206,200 in June , down 11.9 % from a year ago .
The elevated level of inventories continues to influence prices of new single - family homes .
“ In sum , the housing market is stabilizing with sales of both new and existing single - family homes having advanced in each of the three months ended June and the I - S ratios of new and existing unsold homes have peaked . ”

Standard & Poor ’s : Case - Shiller – home price declines continue to abate
“ Data through May 2009 , released today by Standard & Poor ’s for its S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices , show that , although still negative , the annual rate of decline of the 10 - City and 20 - City Composites improved for the fourth consecutive month in 2009 .
“ The chart above depicts the annual returns of the 10 - City and 20 - City Composite Home Price Indices .
The 10 - City and 20 - City Composites declined 16.8 % and 17.1 % , respectively , in May compared to the same month last year .
These values are improvements over April ’s data , which show annual declines of 18.0 % and 18.1 % , respectively .
After 16 consecutive months of record annual declines , beginning in October 2007 and ending in January 2009 , the indices have now shown four consecutive months of improvement in annual returns .
“ ‘ The pace of descent in home price values appears to be slowing , ’ says David Blitzer , Chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor’s .
‘ There is a clear inflection point in the year - over - year data , due to four consecutive months of improved rates of return , after the steep decline that began in the fall of 2005 .
In addition to the 10 - City and 20 - City Composites , 17 of the 20 metro areas also saw improvement in their annual returns compared to those of April .
Looking at the monthly data , 13 of the 20 metro areas reported positive returns ; and the 10 - City and 20 - City Composites reported positive returns for the first time since the summer of 2006 .
To put it in perspective , these are the first time we have seen broad increases in home prices in 34 months .
This could be an indication that home price declines are finally stabilizing . ' ”

Floyd Norris ( The New York Times ) : Politicians accused of meddling in bank rules
“ Accounting rules did not cause the financial crisis , and they still allow banks to overstate the value of their assets , an international group composed of current and former regulators and corporate officials said in a report to be released Tuesday .
“ The report , from the Financial Crisis Advisory Group , also deplored successful efforts by politicians to force changes in accounting rules and said that accounting standards should be kept separate from regulatory standards , contrary to the desire of large banks .
“ ‘ The message to political bodies of ‘ Do n’t threaten , Do n’t coerce ’ flies in the face of some of what has been coming from the European Commission and from members of Congress , ’ said Harvey Goldschmid , a co-chairman of the group and a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ ‘ We have become increasingly concerned about the excessive pressure placed on the two boards to make rapid , piecemeal , uncoordinated and prescribed changes to standards , outside of their normal due process procedures , ’ the group wrote in its report , which was commissioned by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board .
“ ‘ While it is appropriate for public authorities to voice their concerns and give input to standard setters , in doing so they should not seek to prescribe specific standard - setting outcomes , ’ the report added . ”

CFO : Five firms hold 80 % of derivatives risk , Fitch report finds
“ Members of Congress probing threats to the global financial system – especially the threat of concentration of risk – will have a lot to ponder in newly mandated disclosures highlighted by a Fitch Ratings report issued last week .
While derivatives use among US companies is widespread , an ‘ overwhelming majority of the exposure is concentrated among financial institutions , ’ according to the rating agency ’s review of first - quarter financials .
“ Concentrated , in fact , among a mere handful of financial - services giants .
About 80 % of the derivative assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheets of 100 companies reviewed by Fitch were held by five banks : JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Morgan Stanley .
Those five banks also account for more than 96 % of the companies ’ exposure to credit derivatives .
“ About 52 % of the companies reviewed disclosed there were credit - risk - related contingent features in their derivative positions .

Bloomberg : Schumer presses SEC for ban on “ unfair ” high - frequency trades
“ Charles Schumer , the third - ranking Democrat in the US Senate , asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban so - called flash orders for stocks , saying they give high - speed traders an unfair advantage .
“ Schumer ’s letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro yesterday raised the stakes in a debate over the practice offered by Nasdaq OMX Group , Bats Global Markets and Direct Edge Holdings LLC , which handle more than two - thirds of the shares traded in the US .
With flash orders , exchanges wait up to half a second before they publish bids and offers on competing platforms , giving their own customers an opportunity to gauge demand before other traders .
“ ‘ This kind of unfair access seriously compromises the integrity of our markets and creates a two - tiered system , where a privileged group of insiders receives preferential treatment , ’ Schumer wrote in the letter .
“ Flash orders make up less than 4 % of US stock trading , according to Direct Edge and Bats .
They have drawn criticism from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , which is Wall Street ’s main lobbying group , and Getco LLC , one of the biggest firms that uses high - frequency trading strategies to make markets in stocks and options .
NYSE Euronext , owner of the world ’s largest exchange by the value of companies it lists , told the SEC in May that the technique results in investors getting worse prices .
“ Schumer , a member of the Senate Banking Committee , said he will introduce legislation to ban flash orders if the SEC does n’t act on his request . ”

Financial Times : Emerging markets rush to issue debt
“ Emerging market bond issuance has risen to record levels as investors hungry for greater risk switch to the securities because of attractive yields .
“ The surge in issuance this year , to its highest since records began in 1962 , is an encouraging sign for the world economy as activity in emerging market bonds had seized up until a few months ago .
“ The bond market freeze had made it difficult for governments and companies , especially those in eastern Europe hit by the credit crunch and needing to refinance debt .
“ Bond volumes in emerging markets have risen to $ 352 billion so far this year , according to Thomson Reuters , up 45 % on the same period in 2007 before the financial crisis .
“ July , typically a slower month as investors wind down for the summer holidays , has been the second highest for new volumes , with issuance rising to $ 60 billion .
“ China has been the biggest issuer this month , but countries such as Poland and Hungary have been able to tap markets .
“ Hungary , which was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for financial support , this month launched its first international bond since June 2008 .
“ Bankers said the pick - up in bond yields had been a big factor in attracting investors .
“ Yields on emerging market sovereign bonds , measured by JPMorgan ’s Embi Index , are nearly 2 percentage points higher than those on single A rated US corporate bonds .
“ Bryan Pascoe , global head of debt syndicate at HSBC , said : ‘ Although emerging market bond spreads have narrowed , they still offer a lot of value compared with developed market corporate spreads , with better credit fundamentals in many cases . ' ”

“ The S&P 500 is up 11.24 % since July 10 , which is a significant move in such a short period of time .
The recent gains also put the index up nicely at 8.28 % year to date .
As shown below , the US has performed well relative to the rest of the world .
Since July 10 , it ranks 22nd out of 82 countries .
Russia is up the most with a gain of 24.23 % , followed by Hungary , Poland , Norway , Romania , and Germany .
Middle and Eastern European countries have seen some of the biggest gains in recent weeks .
“ While China has been the second best performing country ( behind Peru ) year to date , it is only up 10.32 % since July 10 .
This is better than most countries , but it has n’t been the worldwide leader that it was earlier in the year .
Five of the G - 7 countries have outperformed China , and all seven G - 7 countries are in the top 50 % in terms of performance .
This is a sign that developed markets have been holding their own against emerging markets in recent weeks .
Only ten out of 82 countries are down since July 10 , with Slovakia leading the way at - 5.67 % . ”

Bespoke : Dividend stocks outperform during the rally
“ Prior to the 2008 financial crisis , investors typically flocked to stocks with high dividends as safety plays when the overall market was in correction mode .
However , since so many financial stocks had nice yields , dividend stock indices and ETFs actually underperformed the S&P 500 throughout the last bear market .
The ability for companies to actually pay their dividends eventually came into question , and that added even more fear to owning high yield stocks .
“ Below we highlight the performance of the Dow Jones Dividend Select Index versus the S&P 500 during the bear market that ran from 10/9/07 to 3/9/08 .
As shown , the dividend index was down 60.3 % versus the S&P 500 ’s decline of 56.7 % .
Since the March 9 bottom , however , dividend indices have outperformed .
As shown in the bottom chart , the same dividend index is up 51.16 % while the S&P 500 is up 45.18 % . ”

Bespoke : Q2 earnings growth versus estimates
“ At the start of the second quarter , the consensus estimate was that S&P 500 earnings versus Q2 ’07 would be down 31.3 % .
As shown below , this estimate trended downward to a low of - 35.1 % on May 15 , picked back up again through the end of May , and then dropped to - 35.2 % on July 10 just when earnings season was beginning .
“ One of the reasons the market has done so well this earnings season is because actual earnings growth has come in better than expected .
Fifty percent of the S&P 500 has reported second quarter numbers , and the collective change in earnings from Q2 ’ 07 to Q2 ’08 has been - 24.8 % .
This is a negative number , but compared to the estimates , it ’s a positive . ”

Bloomberg : China stocks plunge on tightening concern
“ China ’s stocks plunged , driving the Shanghai Composite Index down the most in eight months , on speculation the government will curb inflows into a market that had doubled from last year ’s low .
“ The benchmark gauge lost 5 % , snapping a five - day , 7 % advance that pushed valuations to their highest since January 2008 .
The gauge has gained 79 % this year as government stimulus spending , record bank lending and an economic rebound spurred demand for equities .
“ ‘ Speculation the central bank may take steps to rein in liquidity worried the market , ’ said Gabriel Gondard , deputy chief investment officer at Fortune SGAM Fund Management Co. , which oversees about $ 7.2 billion in assets .
‘ A lot of people were looking to take profit ’ after the market gains .
“ ‘ Expensive valuations and jitters among investors about fast share - price gains are enough to trigger panic selling like today , ’ said Larry Wan , Shanghai - based deputy chief investment officer at KBC - Goldstate Fund Management Co. , which oversees about $ 583 million in assets .
“ Stocks plunged amid speculation the central bank is poised to order lenders to set aside larger reserves , Beijing - based Caijing magazine reported today on its website .

MoneyNews : China says loose monetary policy to stay
“ China ’s central bank pledged to maintain loose monetary policy to support the economy and said it would ensure sustainable credit growth without resorting to heavy - handed quotas to rein in a lending spree .
“ In a statement that analysts said was intended to calm skittish markets , the People ’s Bank of China Vice Governor Su Ning said the central bank ‘ will unswervingly continue to apply appropriately loose monetary policy and consolidate the economic recovery momentum . ’
“ The statement was posted on the bank ’s website after Wednesday ’s 5 % fall in the Chinese stock market , its biggest daily drop in eight months , which had been sparked in part by worries that Beijing would restrict bank lending .
“ But there was also a hint of a gradual shift in policy footing when an unnamed official was quoted by state - run Xinhua news agency as saying that the central bank would ‘ fine tune ’ its loose monetary stance and keep prices ‘ within a reasonable and controllable range ’ .
“ Officials have expressed concern about the risk of stock and property bubbles inflating because of an unprecedented surge in bank lending , and the central bank said this week that consumer prices , now in mild deflationary territory , could start rebounding after the third quarter .
“ China has in the past used a quota system to control lending , telling banks not to exceed specific ceilings .
This credit management was a key prong of China ’s monetary tightening in 2008 and it was subsequently blamed for contributing to the economy ’s sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter .
“ Su ’s comments appeared to rule out an imminent return to a strict , central bank - directed quota system .
“ ‘ They are responding to an incorrect interpretation by the market , ’ said Ting Lu , economist with Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong .
“ Beijing has tamped down a little on the tide of money washing through the economy , but it is seen as unwilling to shift to more substantial tightening until a full - fledged recovery is assured . ”

MoneyNews : Gross : Wall Street to blame for high fees
“ Bill Gross , the influential manager who runs top bond fund PIMCO , on Wednesday lambasted his industry for charging investors hefty fees for subpar performance amidst the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
“ In his latest investment letter to clients , Gross , co-chief investment offer of Pacific Investment Management Co. , said roughly 90 % of the $ 1.5 trillion in 401 K and other defined contribution assets in mutual funds are ‘ actively managed ’ .
And yet many of those portfolio managers posted unspectacular performance for exorbitant fees , close to 1 % , he asserted .
“ He likened the situation to the infamous Madame Rue selling Potion # 9 .
“ ‘ I ’ve never known any gold - capped tooth money managers , but without squinting very hard there is undoubtedly a strong resemblance between all of us ‘ managers ’ and the infamous Madame Rue selling Potion # 9 , ’ Gross said .
‘ Instead of love , though , we sell ‘ hope ’ , but very few are able to seal the deal with performance anywhere close to compensating for the generous fees we command . ’
“ Gross said investors paying for those potions during an era of asset appreciation with double - digit returns may have been ‘ tolerable ’ , but if investment returns gravitate close to 6 % as his firm envisions , ‘ then 15 % of your income will be extracted based on the beguiling promise of Madame Rue ’ .
“ He highlighted a recent Barron ’s article that pointed out that stock funds extract an average 99 basis points or virtually 1 % a year in fees from an investor ’s portfolio , while bond managers at 75 basis points .
Many money market funds manage to charge 38 basis points .
“ ‘ Since money market funds barely earn 38 basis points these days , much of the return winds up in the hands of investment managers , ’ Gross said .
‘ A mighty expensive potion indeed . ’
“ For his part , Gross ’ PIMCO Total Return Fund , whose assets under management of $ 164 billion makes it the world ’s largest mutual fund , ranks as a strong performer .
The Fund charges 46 basis points to investors .
“ Gross reiterated that economic growth for the United States will fall short of recent years , expanding around 3 % a year once it emerges from recession .
The US economy was growing at 5 - 7 % a year for 15 years before it plunged into the worst recession in decades .
“ Slower growth means lower profit growth , permanently higher joblessness , constrained consumer spending and increased government involvement , Gross added .
“ ‘ The ‘ new normal ’ nominal GDP , the future return on our stock of labor and capital investment , will likely be centered closer to 3 % , for at least a few years once a recovery is in place beginning in this year ’s second half , ’ Gross said .
‘ Diminished capitalistic risk taking and constrained policymaker releveraging will lead to that likely conclusion . ' ”

Steve Barrow ( Standard Bank ) : SNB battles stubborn franc
“ Signs are finally emerging that the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) may succeed in its aim of driving down the franc , believes Steve Barrow , currency strategist at Standard Bank .
“ He notes that it is highly unusual for a central bank to promise to keep a currency from rising .
‘ It is more common for them to aim to avoid currency weakness .
This is a very important difference . ’
“ Usually , he says , central banks looking to defend their currency face the problem that they could run out of reserves .
Any hint of this happening can lead to intense pressure on the currency .
But for the SNB , no such constraint exists – it can intervene with a potentially limitless supply of newly - printed francs , which should leave the market running scared .
“ So why has the franc stubbornly refused to fall ?
“ ‘ All theories concerning the effectiveness of intervention stress the importance of falling interest rates , ’ Mr Barrow says .
‘ The problem for the SNB has been that rates are about as low as they can go with a three - month Libor target of 0.25 % .
But there are signs of a bit more rate divergence now , especially further down the curve .
For instance , quite a gap has opened up in 10 - year bond spreads between Germany and Switzerland .
“ ‘ With similar , if smaller , divergences creeping in at the front end , the euro could be on its way back to the SFr1.5450 level seen in the wake of the original decision to target franc weakness in March . ' ”

“ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it is maintaining its forecast that West Texas Intermediate crude oil will reach $ 85 a barrel by year end as the recent weakness in market fundamentals will be temporary .
“ Oil demand will be supported by stabilization in US industrial activity and a positive outlook for China ’s economic growth , the bank said in a report today .
“ ‘ Concerns over economic growth and weak oil statistics led a commodity sell - off yesterday , ’ said Goldman analysts , led by London - based Jeffrey Currie .
‘ However , we believe most of these drivers are less negative than they first appear . ’
“ ‘ We maintain that demand stabilization will be critical to a sustainable rise in oil prices that we expect later this year , ’ the analysts said .
‘ Stabilization in industrial activity and a nascent slowing in industrial destocking give us confidence in this view . ’

Nationwide : UK house prices up for third month in a row
“ The price of a typical house rose for the third consecutive month in July , increasing by 1.3 % on a seasonally adjusted basis .
The 3 month on 3 month rate of change – generally a smoother indicator of the near term trend – rose from 1.0 % in June to 2.6 % in July , the highest level since February 2007 .
House prices are still 6.2 % lower than 12 months ago , but this represents another sharp improvement from the 9.3 % year - on - year decline in June .
“ Even if prices were to remain unchanged for the rest of 2009 , the year - on - year rate would continue to improve since prices were falling very sharply in the second half of last year .
For the first seven months of 2009 as a whole , prices have risen by a cumulative 1.3 % , suggesting there is now a reasonable chance that prices could end the year slightly higher than where they started .
Only a few months ago , such an outcome would have appeared unthinkable . ”

The Wall Street Journal : UBS , Swiss reach pact on US tax probe
“ UBS AG and the Swiss government , rocked by months of embarrassing details about bank secrecy and guilty pleas for UBS clients , agreed to settle a tax - evasion probe with US authorities .
“ The agreement appears to signal that thousands of US client accounts , hidden in offshore shadows , will be turned over to US revenue agents .
“ The settlement , announced during a teleconference with a federal court judge Friday ahead of a scheduled hearing in Miami on Monday , closes one chapter in the long - running case that centered on the Internal Revenue Service ’s demand that UBS turn over the identities of 52,000 UBS accounts that belong to UScitizens .
“ Details of the settlement were n’t provided during the call , with the Justice Department simply reporting that the parties had reached an agreement in principle and would work to resolve remaining issues in the coming week .
Another conference that could shed more light on the deal is set for Friday .
“ But lawyers involved in the case said one likely scenario is that UBS will turn over the identities of some , but not all , of the 52,000 accounts .
“ ‘ I think it ’s possibly going to push north of 10,000 , ’ said William Sharp , a Tampa , Fla. , lawyer who is representing UBS clients and was working on the case in Zurich in the past week .
“ ‘ We have never before seen so many US citizens and residents potentially subject to criminal tax prosecution on the same basic issue , ’ said Bryan Skarlatos , a partner at New York law firm Kostelanetz & Fink LLP who is representing UBS clients .
“ UBS and the Swiss government argued in the tax - evasion case that Swiss bank - privacy law meant the bank could n’t hand over the account identities .
It now appears that UBS and the Swiss government have combed through the files and identified enough potential fraud to make them willing to hand over information about certain accounts .
“ Swiss laws do n’t provide confidentiality if people engage in fraudulent activities such as setting up accounts with shell companies that lack any real business substance . ”

Unfortunately , it seems more likely that the administration 's public unveiling of Cheney 's " Kill anyone that even looks like it might oppose the empire and their families and their little dog too " squads is ... yet even more kabuki .

Oh , maybe the fact that he 's letting people go jobless and homeless and hungry to keep the vampire capitalists in profits after their corrupt feeding frenzy .
Or maybe he wants to distract us from the imperialist advances in " Ir - Af - Pak " or the loopholes on his no torture edict as they apply to Bagram or the fact that he's not succeeding in keeping the dollar as the global reserve currency or just that he 's unwilling to prosecute the big fish for any crime .
It could be all kinds of stuff ... but it very seriously does look like kabuki ... a let 's keep it a Democratic Corporatocracy rather than a Republican Corporatocracy ... which is vexing to me because , I think to myself , why bother distinguishing between them , but then I remember that if they do n't keep up the illusion of being on different sides , people might actually stop being too distracted to rise up and smack them down ....

Let 's see .
Democrats have been blocking any and all investigation on any and all Bush Administration crimes for how long ?
And one ( or two ) lone Democrats --- in this case , Feingold ( who has been one of the very few to try , at least , to see the right thing done consistently over the years ) --- call for an investigation , and that 's , somehow , in Gos ' mind " pushing the PARTISAN ANGLE " .

Brad , I guess I can see why repugs might consider it " partisan " because they are proving themselves to be the party of lawlessness .
So you are being unfair and picking on them to hold them to the standards of a society based on laws .
And their morals and values are n't really so good either ...

I really really really wish that following Feingold was a ' partisan ' thing because it would mean he's not the lone member of congress with any ounce of integrity .
Sadly though , Feingold is regarded in many cases as ' fringe ' .
Remember when he actually brought up the " censure bush " proposal , the other ~ 50 - ish dems just let him hang there alone ?
All senators and congressmen / women should be impeached until they demonstrate the integrity Feingold has displayed .
We might be left with 2 or 3 people in congress then .

until a whole bunch of people in government start seeing the inside of a prison cell , there is no law .
which begs asking , why should anybody obey any law if there is no law ?
cause we have a conscious ?
how much longer is that going to be ?
Because they raided our retirements , we should charge people who are in " We The People " 's government corruption database 1000 times the normal price for a widget , loaf of bread or bag of beans .
If they want to dis our constitution , then any small ass thing they do should cost them big time .
Would n't that be funny ?
New signs going up in ever store , if you are a government official , the cost is 1000 x normal cost .
Maybe they would get a clue but I doubt it , I also doubt business 's have the balls to do it .
But if they did , you 'd see a typical conversaion .
You do have your ID with you sir do n't you ?
We need to see your ID so we can tell if your a criminal .
If your one of the criminals your price is 1000 times normal .
( Also this protects them by having a sign up where they do n't have to sell at the listed price )
Of course they will try to use proxies , ( peons who shop for them ) but when it comes to getting your home painted your kind of fucked at that point when the painter wants $ 222,000 for a 4000 sq foot home and he 's the low bid out of 100 contractors ..
I told you , these people did everything .
There should n't be a question in your mind what they spied on , or what torture they use .
they abuse anything electronic , they use high tech shit that see 's through walls , they use high tech shit that causes pain if your a TI ( Targeted Individual ) they use satellites , they kill , they threaten , they blackmail , they are themselves exactly that which we had thought we had taken oaths and were fighting against .
They use your monetary transactions , they use your drivers license , they do anything and everything .
Germs , gas , health care , bombs , bullets , knives , food , water , the web , brute force .
whatever it takes , however much it costs in lives or money .
Can I prove it ?
no .
Am I paranoid ?
no .
I just do n't give a fuck anymore .
So you might as well make the same assumptions .
Anything you can think of , they 're doing it .
That 's why it 's secret , that 's why nobody is in a fucking prison cell .

In today ’s deadline driven , digital world , taking the time to ‘ shoot the breeze ’ with a coworker , neighbor , or passing stranger can seem like a waste of time .
But , in reality , nothing could be further from the truth .
Whether you ’re a Washington politician or a barista at a local coffee shop , every one of us has the unique ability to inspire change in our lives and in the lives of others around us .
And small talk is the key .
When we were writing our book , THE POWER OF SMALL : Why Little Things Make All the Difference , we discovered a truly amazing story that brought our attention to the unexpected ways in which ‘ small talk ’ can change and save lives .
In this case , it all started with a cup of coffee and a simple conversation .
The Story of Annamarie and Sandie
Every morning , when Annamarie Ausnes would head to her local Starbucks to pick - up her usual coffee , she looked forward to making a bit of small talk with the barista , Sandie Anderson , but she never imagined that those little conversations would one day save her life .
Over time , what had begun as a casual , “ How ’s your morning ? ” or “ Nice weather , huh ? ” eventually grew into more personal exchanges about their grandkids , weekend plans , and holiday traditions , until one day Sandie noticed something was n’t quite right with her “ short - drip double - cupped ” customer .
And instead of ignoring it , she decided to trust her instincts and asked one simple question : “ Are you okay ? ”
At first , Annamarie was reluctant to confide in her barista buddy , but with a little prodding , she opened up .
“ Actually , I ’m not doing so well , ” she sighed .
“ I was just placed on the national kidney transplant list and I ’m getting ready to go on dialysis . ”
To her shock , Sandie would discover that her friendly customer faced a bleak future .
Distraught and determined to help , Sandie announced that she would get tested to see if she could become a donor .
As luck would have it , Sandie turned out to be a match and donated a kidney to Annamarie .
Today Annamarie is not only alive and well , the two women are dear friends .
And it all started with a cup of coffee and a little small talk .
Of course , not all of us have the ability or courage to make the huge gesture Sandie made by donating her kidney to a virtual stranger , but by simply making small talk , we open ourselves up to new people , new experiences , and new opportunities .
As children , we make friends easily .
We ask for each other ’s names , we join in and play with one another .
But as we grow older , we tend to close ourselves off , shield ourselves with technology , and forget to acknowledge the people who are right in front of us .
So put away the iPhone for a minute , look up from your laptop , and take the first step by saying hello to the stranger sitting next to you .
You never know , they just might be the hero you ’ve been hoping for .
In Their Own Words
Here ’s a short video clip of Annamarie and Sandie sharing their story in their own words :
Linda Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval are co-authors of the national bestseller THE POWER OF SMALL : Why Little Things Make All the Difference , which debuted on the best seller lists of the Wall Street Journal , USA Today , and The Washington Post .
He plunged into the new job with Kennedy enthusiasm .
But fate , and the Kennedy recklessness , intervened on July 18 , 1969 .
Mr. Kennedy was at a party with several women who had been aides to Robert .
The party , a liquor - soaked barbecue , was held at a rented cottage on Chappaquiddick Island , off Martha ’s Vineyard .
He left around midnight with Mary Jo Kopechne , 28 , took a turn away from the ferry landing and drove the car off a narrow bridge on an isolated beach road .
The car sank in eight feet of water , but he managed to escape .
Miss Kopechne , a former campaign worker for Robert , drowned .
Mr. Kennedy did not report the accident to the authorities for almost 10 hours , explaining later that he had been so banged about by the crash that he had suffered a concussion , and that he had become so exhausted while trying to rescue Miss Kopechne that he had gone immediately to bed .
A week later , he pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and was given a two - month suspended sentence .
But that was far from the end of the episode .
Questions lingered in the minds of the Massachusetts authorities and of the general public .
Why was the car on an isolated road ?
Had he been drinking ?
( Mr. Kennedy testified at an inquest that he had had two drinks . )
What sort of relationship did Mr. Kennedy and Miss Kopechne have ?
Could she have been saved if he had sought help immediately ?
Why did the senator tell his political advisers about the accident before reporting it to the police ?
The controversy became so intense that Mr. Kennedy went on television to ask Massachusetts voters whether he should resign from office .
He conceded that his actions after the crash had been “ indefensible . ”
But he steadfastly denied any intentional wrongdoing .
His constituents sent word that he should remain in the Senate .
And little more than a year later , he easily won re-election to a second full term , defeating a little - known Republican , Josiah A. Spaulding , by a three - to - two ratio .
But his heart did not seem to be in his work any longer .
He was sometimes absent from Senate sessions and neglected his whip duties .
Senator Byrd , of West Virginia , took the job away from him by putting together a coalition of Southern and border - state Democrats to vote him out .
That loss shook Mr. Kennedy out of his lethargy .
He rededicated himself to his role as a legislator .
“ It hurts like hell to lose , ” he said , “ but now I can get around the country more .
And it frees me to spend more time on issues I ’m interested in . ”
Many years later , he became friends with Mr. Byrd and told him the defeat had been the best thing that could have happened in his Senate career .
Turmoil at Home
In the next decade , Mr. Kennedy expanded on his national reputation , first pushing to end the war in Vietnam , then concentrating on his favorite legislative issues , especially civil rights , health , taxes , criminal laws and deregulation of the airline and trucking industries .
He traveled the country , making speeches that kept him in the public eye .

So remember how we wondered whether Frank DiPascali was getting enough from the feds for his cooperation in the investigation in Bernie Madoff 's scam ?
Well , it turns out that part of his deal is having the feds overlook his history of taking illegal drugs , carrying an illegal firearm right up until the time of his arrest and reporting that he had no income during a year when he earned $ 4 million .
The New York Post 's Kaja Whitehouse reports :
According to documents released yesterday by federal prosecutors , DiPascali , the former CFO at Madoff 's investment firm , agreed to spill the beans about Madoff in part to guarantee the feds did n't go after him on " use of controlled substances prior to 1992 " and for possessing illegal firearms up until last Friday .
The 52 - year - old Queens native , who is cooperating with prosecutors in the Madoff scandal , is also avoiding criminal prosecution for evading taxes , the documents show .
Indeed , DiPascali cheated Uncle Sam out of several million dollars between 2002 and 2007 through a number of shady schemes , including depositing his income into accounts under other names and filing false returns .
In 2006 , for example , DiPascali reported zero dollars in taxable income even though he actually earned $ 4 million that year .
He also reported no income in 2002 and 2005 .

Publicly funded family planning prevents nearly 2 million unintended pregnancies and more than 800,000 abortions in the United States each year , saving billions of dollars , according to new research intended to counter conservative objections to expanding the program .
The data are in a report being released Tuesday by the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive - health think tank whose research is generally respected even by experts and activists who do n't share its advocacy of abortion rights .
Report co-author Rachel Benson
Gold called the family planning program " smart government at its best , " asserting that every dollar spent on it saves taxpayers $ 4 in costs associated with unintended births to mothers eligible for Medicaid - funded natal care .
Despite such arguments , federal funding for family planning is a divisive issue .
Last month , under withering Republican criticism , House Democrats abandoned an attempt to include an expansion of family planning services for the poor in the economic stimulus bill .
One anti-abortion activist , Troy Newman of Operation Rescue , called the short - lived proposal a " shameful population control program that targeted low - income families . "
However , Democrats in Congress are not abandoning their overall goal .
They plan to push soon for a major funding increase for Title X , the main federal family planning program , as part of broader legislation endorsed by President Obama to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies .
The Guttmacher report provides ammunition for those who will advocate the funding increase .
Surveying data from the 2006 fiscal year , the report says the national family planning program prevented 1.94 million unintended pregnancies , including almost 400,000 teen pregnancies .
Based on statistical analysis and projections , these pregnancies would have resulted in 860,000 unintended births , 810,000 abortions and 270,000 miscarriages , according to the report .
Without publicly funded family planning , it said , the U.S. abortion rate would be nearly two - thirds higher , and nearly twice as high among poor women .
Other findings : • More than 9 million women — including nearly 2 million under 20 — received publicly funded contraceptive services in 2006 .
•
Six in 10 women who use a family planning center consider it their basic source of health care .
The services they receive often include pelvic and breast exams , tests for HIV , screenings for reproductive cancers , high blood pressure and diabetes and referrals to other health providers .
• Public expenditures for family planning in 2006 totaled $ 1.85 billion , with 71 % of the funds coming from the joint federal - state Medicaid program .
Twenty - seven states have expanded eligibility for family planning for low - income women who otherwise would n't qualify for Medicaid .
" States as varied as Texas , New York , South Carolina and Missouri have decided to undergo the cumbersome and time - consuming process to seek federal permission , known as a waiver , to expand family planning services , " Gold said .
" It 's a popular policy because it helps women while saving public dollars .
It more than pays for itself . "
The report recommends that Congress eliminate the waiver requirement and allow states to use the same income criteria to determine eligibility for family planning under Medicaid that they use to determine eligibility for pregnancy - related care .
It also recommends lifting a ban on family planning coverage for legal immigrants in their first five years in the United States .
The report also endorses pending congressional legislation that would increase funding for Title X family planning .
Some advocacy groups hope to more than double the current funding to $ 700 million a year .
Some conservatives , however , dislike Title X because one of its big recipients is the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , a major provider of abortions as well as family planning services .
Title X funds cannot be used for abortions , but critics contend the federal money frees up other Planned Parenthood funds for its abortion services .
" It 's another Planned Parenthood bailout , " said Tony Perkins , president of the conservative Family Research Council .
" It covers their overhead . "
He also expressed concern about the concept of public funding of contraception for unmarried people .
" The issue is whether taxpayers should fund , and thereby encourage , behavior that 's risky and morally questionable , " he said .
One of the Democrats leading the push for more family planning money , Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado , bristles at such criticism .
" Right - wing Republicans continually use sex as a weapon when they do n't have an effective argument to stand on , " she wrote earlier this month .
" They attack commonsense policies that not only save taxpayers money , but also promote public health . "
Adam Sonfield , a Guttmacher policy expert who co-authored the new report , said the institute is concerned by statistics showing low - income and minority women with higher rates of unintended pregnancies and abortions than U.S. women as a whole .
He expressed hope that proposals for improving family planning for low - income women would be part of the overall conversation as policymakers tackle health care reform .
" Family planning should be non-controversial , " Sonfield said .
" In this economic climate , it 's so important in terms of ability to get an education , to stay in the workforce . "

When you find that your roof has got some issues , you can decide either to restore or replace it .
Roof restoration and replacements have their advantage , but it is good to choose the one that suits your specific situations .
Restoring the roof has become one of the most preferred options among many homeowners because of the many benefits it offers over replacing the roof .
A good roofing company can help in restoring your roof in a way that it will become more functional and at the same time , improve the entire look of your house .
Here are the significant benefits of roof restoration over replacement .
Cheaper option
Roof restoration is a more cost - effective option compared to the replacement of the roof .
Note that when you are doing the replacement , you have to remove your damaged roof and have it replaced with a new one .
You will have to invest in a new roof for the replacement to be done .
Besides , your roofer will also spend more time and put a lot of efforts for the project to be completed successfully .
When it comes to restoring , just the part that has been damaged is repaired or renovated ; thus it will cost you less because you do not have to remove the roof and replace it with a new one .
It is also a job that can be done with an hour or two , and everything will be in place .
All these make it a cost - effective option , especially when you are working with a small budget .
Fewer inconveniences
Restoration of your roof can be done within a short time compared to doing a roof replacement .
Thus , you do not face a lot of inconveniences in your home .
The work comes to be done the same day , meaning you get back settled in your house .
However , if you decide to do replacement , it might take a day or two for the job to be completed .
This means that you might be forced to look for another house to stay as the job is done .
Improve the overall appeal of your home
Roof restoration by www.dragonroofing.com.au makes your home have a better look .
Depending on the way that you want to renovate it , you can be sure that the overall appeal of your roof and entire home will be significantly improved .
The good thing is that the curb appeal of your home will be enhanced by a fraction of the amount that you would otherwise spend if you decide to replace your entire home .
Enhance the value of your property
When you restore your roof , you will improve the value of your home in a significant way .
This is because buyers will look at its appeal and also the condition of the roof .
The value will go up to a higher amount compared to the ones that you spend doing the restoration .
You will also gain more benefit because you do not spend a lot of money like the one you would otherwise spend doing roof restoration .
Larry Gelbart , the award - winning comedy writer best known for developing the landmark TV series “ MASH , ” co-writing the book for the hit Broadway musical “ A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ” and co-writing the classic movie comedy “ Tootsie , ” died Friday morning .
He was 81 .
Gelbart , who was diagnosed with cancer in June , died at his home in Beverly Hills , said his wife , Pat .
Jack Lemmon once described the genial , quick - witted Gelbart as “ one of the greatest writers of comedy to have graced the arts in this century . ”
“ Larry Gelbart was among the very best comedy writers ever produced in America , ” said Mel Brooks , whose friendship with Gelbart dated to when they both wrote for Sid Caesar ’s comedy - variety show “ Caesar ’s Hour ” in the 1950s .
Gelbart “ had class , he had wit , he had style and grace .
He was a marvelous writer who could do more with words than anybody I ever met , ” Brooks said .
In a statement Friday , Woody Allen called Gelbart “ the best comedy writer that I ever knew and one of the best guys . ”
Said Carl Reiner , who had also known Gelbart since the “ Caesar ’s Hour ” days when Reiner was a cast member :
“ The main thing about Larry , he was a comedy prodigy who developed into a national treasure .
The man was one of the most gifted satirists who ever lived . ”
For many , Gelbart is best remembered for his work on “ MASH , ” the long - running series whose blend of laughter and tragedy made TV history .
Set in the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War , TV’s “ MASH ” grew out of director Robert Altman ’s hit 1970 movie written by Ring Lardner Jr. , which was based on the 1968 novel by Richard Hooker ( the pen name of Dr. Richard Hornberger , who had been a military surgeon in Korea ) .
Gelbart and his family were living in London , and he was producing the British TV show “ The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine ” in 1971 when producer - director Gene Reynolds called him about writing a pilot script for a TV series based on “ MASH . ”
In writing the pilot , Gelbart recalled in his 1998 memoir “ Laughing Matters , ” he knew that it “ was going to have to be a whole lot more than funny .
Funny was easy .
How not to trivialize human suffering by trying to be comic about it , that was the challenge . ”
“ MASH ” debuted on CBS in 1972 , with Gelbart serving as executive script consultant .
He and Reynolds were both executive producers of the show -- and shared Emmys -- when it won the award for outstanding comedy series in 1974 .
Gelbart ’s influence on “ MASH , ” Reynolds told the New York Times in 1989 , was “ seminal , basic and enormous . ”
“ Larry not only had the wit and the jokes , ” Reynolds said , “ he had a point of view .
He not only had the ribald spirit , he had the sensibility to the premise -- the wastefulness of war . ”
As for the regulation - breaking surgeon Hawkeye Pierce -- the lead character played by Alan Alda -- Gelbart told the New York Times , “ I did n’t have to think of why he was saying what he said .
He was saying what I felt .
I mean , he is an idealized me . ”
Hawkeye , he said , “ is capable -- that is , at work , at what he does .
He ’s an idealist .
He ’s a romantic .
Somebody who cares about himself and other people .
He ’s often frustrated by whatever particular system he finds himself fighting against . ”
“ MASH ” ran for 11 years .
But Gelbart ’s involvement ended in 1976 after four years and 97 episodes .
As he later told The Times , “ After four years , I had given it my best , my worst and everything in between . ”
In a statement Friday , Alda said : “ Larry ’s genius for writing changed my life because I got to speak his lines -- lines that were so good they ’ll be with us for a long , long time ; but his other genius -- his immense talent for being good company -- is a light that ’s gone out and we ’re all sitting here in the dark . ”
Gelbart ’s more than 60 - year career began in radio during World War II when he was a 16 - year - old student at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles .
He wrote for “ Duffy ’s Tavern ” and radio shows starring Eddie Cantor , Joan Davis , Jack Paar , Jack Carson and Bob Hope , with whom he traveled overseas when Hope entertained the troops .
He moved into television with Hope in 1950 and spent the next few years writing for the comedian as well as for Red Buttons ’ comedy - variety series .
In 1955 , Gelbart joined the writing staff of “ Caesar ’s Hour , ” Sid Caesar ’s post -" Your Show of Shows ” TV comedy - variety series , whose writers included Neil Simon .
In the writers ’ room , as Reiner later told Time magazine , Gelbart “ popped jokes like popcorn . ”
Indeed , after Gelbart went to work for “ Caesar ’s Hour , ” Hope contacted Caesar to say , “ I ’ll trade you two oil wells for one Gelbart . ”
During his time on Caesar ’s show , Gelbart shared three Emmy nominations for comedy writing -- in 1956 , ’ 57 and ’ 58 .
Moving to Broadway in 1961 , Gelbart bombed with the musical “ The Conquering Hero , ” for which he wrote the book .
The show closed after eight performances .
But Gelbart returned to Broadway in triumph in 1962 with the hit Stephen Sondheim comedy musical “ A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . ” Gelbart and Burt Shevelove wrote the book , which they based on the comedies of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus .
“ Forum , ” whose cast included Zero Mostel , ran on Broadway for more than two years and won a Tony Award for best musical , as well as a Tony for Gelbart as co-author .
Gelbart later wrote the 1976 - 78 Broadway comedy “ Sly Fox , ” his updated adaptation of Ben Jonson ’s “ Volpone ” ; the 1989 satirical comedy “ Mastergate ” ; and the book for the 1989 - 92 Broadway comedy musical “ City of Angels , ” the Tony best musical winner for which Gelbart won a Tony for best book of a musical .
For films , he wrote the screenplay for “ Neighbors ” and co-wrote “ The Notorious Landlady , ” “ The Wrong Box , ” “ Not With My Wife , You Don’t ! , ” “ Movie Movie ” and “ Blame It on Rio . ”
He also received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for “ Oh , God ! , ” the 1977 comedy starring George Burns and John Denver .
And he shared a screenwriting Oscar nomination with Murray Schisgal and Don McGuire for “ Tootsie , ” the 1982 comedy starring Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange .
Among his other credits , he wrote the screenplays for the HBO movies “ Barbarians at the Gate ” ( 1993 ) , “ Weapons of Mass Distraction ” ( 1997 ) and “ And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself ” ( 2003 ) .
The son of Eastern European immigrants -- his barber father was from Latvia and his seamstress mother was from Poland -- Gelbart was born Feb. 25 , 1928 , in Chicago .
Growing up on Chicago ’s West Side , he spoke only Yiddish until he was 4 .
“ My mother was extremely witty and caustic , ” he told People magazine in 1998 , “ and my father knew more jokes than anyone I ’ve ever known . ”
In 1942 , Gelbart ’s family moved to Los Angeles , where his father ’s Beverly Hills clientele included actors and agents .
Gelbart had his father to thank for the launch of his comedy writing career in 1944 at age 16 .
One of his father ’s show business customers was comedian Danny Thomas , who had a weekly segment playing a Walter Mitty - type character on “ Maxwell House Coffee Time , ” a radio show starring comedian Fanny Brice .
After Gelbart ’s father boasted that his son had a gift for writing comedy , Thomas told him , “ Have the kid write something and let ’s see just how good he is . ”
At the time , Gelbart recalled in his memoir , “ my only real ‘ gift ’ was for showing off , doing imitations , putting together sketches , speeches , monologues at Fairfax High School . ”
But he wrote a sample comedy sequence for Thomas , who showed it to the radio show ’s head writer , and Gelbart suddenly had an after - school job writing comedy for “ Maxwell House Coffee Time . ”
He was an 18 - year - old staff writer on radio’s popular “ Duffy ’s Tavern ” when he received a postwar draft notice .
But his career was not sidelined by his military service : Assigned to Armed Forces Radio Service , he continued to live at home while writing for the star - studded AFRS variety show “ Command Performance , ” as well as continuing his other radio - writing jobs .
In December 2008 , the still - professionally active Gelbart found himself the subject of an Internet hoax on the online bulletin board alt.obituaries , which reported that he was “ gravely ill . . . from a massive stroke . ”
He was fine , of course -- and in fine comedic fettle .
Referring to his alleged pending demise , he e-mailed alt.obituaries : “ Does that mean I can stop exercising ? ”
But ever the rewriter , Gelbart came up with another witty response in a brief chat with an inquiring Los Angeles Times reporter : “ I was dead , but I ’m better now . ”
He continued writing until three weeks ago , his wife said .

.- Pope Benedict XVI received President Barack Obama this afternoon in his private library , and after 36 minutes of private conversation , the pair emerged without providing any details about their topics of conversation .
Nevertheless , the Holy See revealed that the Pope gave Obama an “ unannounced gift ” --a Vatican document on bioethics and the right to life .
" The G8 has been very productive , 20 billion dollars have been allocated [ to poor countries ] ; that 's something concrete , " President Obama told the Pope when he asked about the summit , as photographers and journalists were ushered out of the Papal library .
The meeting between the Pope and the U.S. President started at 4:25 p.m. local time , after an unusually short meeting of ten minutes with the Secretary of State , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone .
After the private conversation , and again in front of the cameras , President Obama gave the Pontiff a stole that was drapped upon the body of St. John Neumann from 1988 to 2007 .
The Pope instead presented the president with a mosaic portraying St. Peter 's Square and the Vatican Basilica , and an autographed copy of his latest social encyclical “ Caritas in Veritate . ”
“ I will have something to read on the plane , ” President Obama joked after receiving the encyclical .
In addition to his family , Obama ’s entourage included Kaye Wilson , General Jim Jones , Denis McDonough , Mona Sutphen , Robert Gibbs , David Axelrod , Julieta Valls ( currently responsible for the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See ) , Alyssa Mastnaco Clay Beers , Melissa Winter , Joseph Clancy and interpreter Elisabeth Ullman .
They all received commemorative medals and blessed Rosaries .
At the end of the meeting , the Pope said in English , " I pray for you and bless your work . "
" I am very grateful , I hope we will have fruitful relationships , " the President responded .
Despite the fact that the Vatican did not release an official statement about the nature of the meeting , the “ unannounced ” gift to Obama of the 2008 document " Dignitas Personae " on bioethics and the right to life , could be a signal of the nature of at least part of their conversation .
The Khronos Group revealed this week that it will move forward with its plans to build a new 3D standard for the Web .
Khronos , a technology industry consortium that developed OpenGL and a number of other prominent graphical standards , will devise new JavaScript APIs for natively rendering 3D graphics in webpages without requiring browser plugins .
The effort is being undertaken in collaboration with Mozilla , Opera , and Google , indicating that it will receive broad support from prominent browser vendors .
Khronos first demonstrated an interest in bringing 3D to the Web back in March when it issued a joint announcement with Mozilla .
At roughly the same time , Google was working on its own 3D Web technology called O3D .
Google 's O3D is a high - level engine that can load and display models .
Mozilla 's 3D
Web prototype takes a very different approach and aims to expose the conventional OpenGL APIs through JavaScript .
It was previously unclear how these competing visions would converge into a single standard .
The announcement this week reveals that Khronos intends to adopt Mozilla 's approach .
The organization has established a WebGL workgroup that will define a JavaScript binding to OpenGL ES 2.0 which can be used to build 3D engines for the Web .
Model loading and other functionality will be facilitated by third - party libraries that will sit on top of the underlying OpenGL JavaScript APIs .
One example of such a library is C3DL , a JavaScript framework that can load Collada models and perform other high - level tasks .
C3DL is being developed by a team at Seneca University using Mozilla 's early WebGL prototype .
" The Web has already seen the wide proliferation of compelling 2D graphical applications , and we think 3D is the next step for Firefox , " said Mozilla 's Arun Ranganathan , chair of the WebGL working group .
" We look forward to a new class of 3D - enriched Web applications within Canvas , and for creative synergy between OpenGL developers and Web developers . "
Google has committed itself to implementing WebGL , but will also continue developing its own O3D system .
Google 's view is that JavaScript is still too slow to handle raw OpenGL programming .
The search giant is skeptical that WebGL will be able to deliver sufficient performance with real - world 3D usage scenarios .
Google software engineer Gregg Tavares expressed his views on this subject on Tuesday in an O3D Google Group discussion thread .
" O3D is not going away .
WebGL is a very cool initiative but it has a lot of hurdles to overcome .
The direction of WebGL is trying to just expose straight OpenGL ES 2.0 calls to JavaScript .
JavaScript is still slow in the large scheme of things , " he wrote .
" WebGL , being 100 % dependent on JavaScript to do an application 's scene graph , is going to have serious problems drawing more than a few pieces of geometry at 60 hz except in very special cases or on very fast machines . "
He also points out that OpenGL ES 2.0 is not ubiquitously supported on common hardware , which means that not every user will be able to view WebGL content .
Despite his skepticism , he says that he and others at Google are still enthusiastic about WebGL and hope to make it work .
A single team at Google is responsible for implementing both O3D and WebGL , he says , and they are strongly committed to the success of both technologies .
O3D product manager Henry Bridge , who we spoke with about the project back in April , posted a message in the thread to further clarify the nature of Google 's plans for 3D .
He says that O3D and WebGL are both suited for different kinds of 3D workloads right now and that Google wants to make it easy for developers to use both simultaneously .
Khronos hopes to have the first official public release of the WebGL specification ready for publication in the first half of 2010 .
The group is encouraging industry stakeholders to participate in the effort and contribute to producing the specifications .

Since I think we have n’t been having enough fun lately on OSNews , I decided it ’s time we do something fun for a change .
We all have our little pet annoyances when it comes to other people ’s comments .
Fixed expressions or comment styles that annoy the living daylights out of you .
Here are mine .
“ My 2 cents ”
This has to be one of the most superfluous fixed expression in the history of the internet .
Unless you regularly get asked to post other people ’s opinions under your own OSNews account , “ my two cents ” or “ but that ’s just my opinion ” serve absolutely zero purpose .
They ’re just as annoying empty statements online as they are offline .
“ I recently ditched Windows and … ”
So , you switched away from Windows to another operating system – full time – and you ’re so proud of it that you have to squeeze into every possible story – no matter how unrelated the subject matter .
Switching away from Windows does n’t make you special .
It does n’t make you cool .
It ’s certainly not information that has any effect on the world around you whatsoever .
Thousands of people switch away from Windows every day .
It ’s like bragging about waking up in the morning .
“ 80 % of users use only 20 % of the functionality ”
A standard quote , which is most often used when trying to defend OpenOffice.org .
The statement is probably entirely correct , and I ’m sure few people use more than 20 % of the functionality of the more complex applications out there – the problem is just that for every user , it ’s a different 20 % .
Please , stop quoting the 80/20 rule to justify an application which lacks in functionality compared to its competition .
“ I ’m not a fanboy … ”
Yes you are .
A lack of punctuation
Not using punctuation ( which includes capital letters ) does not , I repeat , it does not make you cool .
It does n’t make you seem defiant , it does n’t make you different , it does n’t make you stand out .
It only makes you look lazy and incapable .
By not using punctuation you ’re advertising your own incompetence .
A lack of paragraphs
Related to not using punctuation , but maybe even more annoying .
A lack of punctuation is technically bearable , but a lack of paragraphs makes your comment completely and utterly unreadable .
A paragraph is a self - contained unit of discourse which covers a single point or idea .
By not using paragraphs , you sound like a raving disorganised lunatic .
Please lay off the coffee , and sit on your lawn and do nothing for a while .
Staccato comments
A staccato comment presents an entirely different point in every sentence , making it impossible to follow what you ’re trying to say .
Like a lack of punctuation and / or paragraphs , this is related to coherency .
A comment which lacks coherency is a bad comment .
“ What ’s the point of this operating system ? ”
Say you and your wife decide to have another baby .
After a lot of hard work , she gets pregnant .
After nine difficult months and the troubles of childbirth , youbring a new beautiful little person into this world .
You could not be happier .
This is the best moment of your life .
Then imagine me walking in , and saying : “ What ’s the point in yet another human being ? ”
“ I have a MAC . ”
I ’m sure you do .
If you ’re commenting on OSNews , you ’ve got a MAC .
In fact , I ’ve got a whole boatload of MACs .
I ’ve got about as many MACs as I have network interface cards and network adapters .
Please , for the love of the gods : the correct abbreviation of “ Macintosh ” is “ Mac ” .
“ MAC ” is an acronym which stands for Media Access Control ( among a whole load of other things ) .
“ Why is this on OSNews ? ”
Because I say so .
This is just a selection .
I ’m sure you boys and girls can come up with a load of other recurring comment annoyances .
Jason Calacanis , CEO of Mahalo.com , wrote this post last summer .
With Apple having since passed Microsoft in market cap , nixed Flash , and booted competitive mobile ad platforms off its iPhone , it seems even more relevant now .
About six years and $ 20,000 ago , I made the switch to Apple products after a 20 - year love affair with Microsoft .
That love affair started with the humble PCjr and ended with an IBM ThinkPad .
From DOS to the first version of Windows ( the run- time version that only loaded one program ) , and on to Windows 95 and XP , I dealt with the viruses , driver incompatibilities and other assorted quirks of Microsoft 's wildly open ecosystem .
It sucked to have to buy anti-virus software and reinstall Windows every 12 months , so moving to Apple 's rock - solid and virus - free OS was , in a word , delightful .
Sure , everything on the Mac platform costs twice as much , but considering the fact that my entire career centers around a desktop connected to the Internet , it really does n't matter if I spend $ 2 a day or $ 20 a day for my hardware .
I replace everything at about a two - year pace ( i.e. phone , MP3 player , desktop and laptop ) .
So , at $ 10 a day , what some folks spend on Starbucks , I have a two year budget of $ 7,500 for my gear .
In fact , the only things I do n't replace every two years are my 30 " and 24 " Dell Monitors , which I tend to keep for five years .
Over the last 12 - 18 months , my love affair with Apple has waned .
Steve Jobs ' peculiar , rigidly closed , and severe worldview have started to cramp my style .
It 's not entirely Steve 's fault , as Apple 's style and grace are a large part of what drew me to the platform initially .
My collection of Mac products now includes seven iPods ( $ 1,500 ) , four Mac laptops ( $ 8,000 ) , two Airports ( $ 500 ) , a Time Capsule ( $ 500 ) , two Mac towers ( $ 4,000 ) , a Mac Mini ( $ 600 ) , two iMacs ( $ 4,000 ) and all three iPhones ( $ 1,500 ) .
The cost of these items is just over $ 20,000 , or about $ 3,300 a year .
That 's almost exactly $ 10 a day -- what I budget for technology in my life .
Half of that is personal , half of that is probably business .
While I know I am a high - end consumer , since I do this for a living , I think there are many folks putting $ 5 - 10 a day toward hardware .
Blogger Robert Scoble of RackSpace must spend $ 20 a day and Leo Laporte of This Week in Tech must spend $ 40 a day !
Key Point 1 : For the past six years , if Steve makes something , I buy it .
Sometimes , I buy two ( one for my wife ) .
Key Point 2 : I over - pay for Apple products because I perceive them to be better ( i.e. Windows - based hardware is 30 - 50 % less -- but at 38 years old I do n't care ) .
The Love Affair Ends
===================
Steve 's a great guy , and the love affair has been wonderful , but I 'm starting to look past him and back to Microsoft for a more healthy relationship that is less -- wait for it -- anti- competitive in nature .
Years and years after Microsoft 's antitrust headlines , Apple is now the anti-competitive monster that Jobs rallied us against in the infamous 1984 commercial .
Steve Jobs is the oppressive man on the jumbotron and the Olympian carrying the hammer is the open - source movement
For folks in the tech industry , this is not a new discussion .
Another radical visionary , Steve Gillmor , has been hosting this discussion since Apple 's draconian iTunes updates led smart people to * downgrade * their software .
Think about that mind bomb for a second : people downgrading their software to maintain their freedoms -- is this a William Gibson novel ?
Steve Jobs is on the cusp of devolving from the visionary radical we all love to a sad , old hypocrite and control freak - - a sellout of epic proportions .*
[ * Important Note : I 've written this piece three times over the past year and never released it .
It felt like releasing something like this about a personal hero when they were , according to all counts , dying , was too harsh .
With Steve back to work and healthy for what will probably be his last five to ten years of full - time work ( based on when most folks retire ) , I feel obligated to let this out .
I know many folks in the industry are saddened to see our LSD - taking , radical free - thinking and fight the power hero , turning to the Dark Side .
This note is written from a place of admiration and love . ]
The Case , The Five Parts
===================
I 'd like to discuss four major issues around Apple 's current product line that I believe are stifling the industry , consumer choice and pricing .
Instead of just giving a simple solution to the problem , I thought long and hard about the opportunities for Apple to be less controlling and more open .
For example , if the iPhone was available on more carriers , Apple would sell many , many more units , which would inevitably lead to people switching from Windows desktops to Macs ( which is what happened with the iPod ) .
Bottom line :
Of all the companies in the United States that could possibly be considered for anti-trust action , Apple is the lead candidate .
The US Government , however , seems to be obsessed with Microsoft for legacy reasons and Google for privacy reasons .
The truth is , Google has absolutely no lock - in , collusion or choice issues like Apple's , and the Internet taught Microsoft long ago that open is better than closed .
Let 's look at the case against , and the opportunities for , Apple :
1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices
--------------------------
There is no technical reason why the iTunes ecosystem should n't allow the ability to sync with any MP3 player ( in fact , iTunes did support other players once upon a time ) , save furthering Apple 's dominance
with their own over - priced players .
Quickly answer the following question : who are the number two and three MP3 players in the market ?
Exactly .
Most folks can't name one , let alone two , brands of MP3
players .
On my trips to Japan , China and Korea over the past couple of years , I made it a point to visit the consumer electronics marketplaces like Akihabira .
They are filled with not dozens , but hundreds , of MP3 players .
They are cheap , feature - rich and open in nature .
They have TV tuners , high - end audio recorders , radio tuners , dual - headphone jacks built - in and any number of innovations that the iPod does not .
You simply will not see those here because of Apple 's inexcusable lack of openness .
Not only does Apple not build in a simple API to attach devices to iTunes , they actually fight technically and legally block people from building tools to make iTunes more compatible .
Think for a moment about what your reaction would be if Microsoft made the Zune the only MP3 player compatible with Windows .
There would be 4 chan riots , denial of service attacks and Digg 's front page would be plastered with pundit editorials claiming Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were Borg .
Why , then , does Steve Jobs get a pass ?
Steve Jobs gets a pass because we are all enabling him to be a jerk .
We buy the products and we say nothing when our rights are stripped away .
We 've been seduced by Steve Jobs : he lifts another shiny object
over his head with a new eco-friendly feature and we all melt like screaming schoolgirls at Shea Stadium in ' 65 .
Simple solution and opportunity :
An iTunes API which allows the attachment of any mass storage device , not just a short list of players that jumped through Apple 's hoops .
If need be , perhaps consumers pay a simple licensing fee of $ 1 - 5 a unit to attach a non-Apple MP3 player to iTunes ( i.e. pure profit for Apple ) .
2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications
--------------------------------------------------------
Apple 's iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking -- wait for it -- AT&T 's monoply in the ' 70s and ' 80s .
We broke up the Bell Phone only to have it put back together by the iPhone .
Telecommunications choice is gone for Apple users .
If you buy an Apple and want to have a seemless experience with your iPhone , you must get in bed with AT&T , and as we like to say in the technology space , " AT&T is the suck . "
Simple solution and opportunity : Not only let the iPhone work on any carrier , but put * two * SIM card slots on the iPhone and let users set which applications use which services .
( Your phone could be Verizon
and your browser Sprint ! )
Imagine having two SIM cards with 3G that were able to bond together to perform superfast uploads and downloads to YouTube .
3. Draconian App
Store policies that are , frankly , insulting
--------------------------------------------------------
Like lemmings , we fell for your bar charts extolling the openness of the iPhone App platform and its massive array of applications .
We over - paid for your phone -- which you render obsolete every 13 months , like clockwork -- and then signed our lives away to AT&T .
The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police , deciding what applications we can consume on the device we over - paid for !
Yes , every application on the phone has to approved by Apple , and if you were interested in something adult in nature ... well ... you ca n't do that .
Apple 's justification for this nonsense is that they have to protect AT&T 's network .
Oh really ?
Are n't there dozens and dozen of open phones on everyone 's network ?
The network has n't crashed yet , and even if someone did create a malicious iPhone application , you would know EXACTLY who was running the application and be able to block and / or turn off their phone .
The network was MADE to deal with these issues on a NETWORK level .
To say you have to control people down to the application level defies all logic .
A second year CS student understands this .
Who in their right mind feels the need to control the application - level anyway ?
It 's absurd .
Imagine for a moment if every application on Windows Mobile or Windows XP had to be approved by Microsoft - - how would you react ?
Exactly .
Once again we 've enabled Steve Jobs ' insane control freak tendencies .
This relationship is beyond disfunctional -- we are co-dependent .
Simple solution : Apple could have a basic system setting that says " Allow Non-Approved Applications . "
When you click this setting , a popup could come on warning that , if you click this setting , you are waiving your previously - understood customer service arrangement ( i.e. only people with approved applications can hand over their money at the Genius bar ) .
4 . Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone
--------------------------------------------------------
Opera is a fantastic browser built by a company in Oslo , Norway .
In fact , a decade ago , I had a speaking gig there and got to interview the CEO of the company for Silicon Alley Reporter .
( Sidebar : Man , do I miss being a journalist .
I wish I could split 50 % of my time being a journalist and 50 % of my time being a CEO . )
For over a decade , Opera has been making lighting - fast , lightweight and quirky browsers .
Long before Apple launched Safari , with the goal of designing the fastest browswer on the Web , Opera was already there .
Opera 's mobile browsers are " full of WIN , " as the kids like to say these days .
If you 're a Windows Mobile or Blackberry user , you 've probably downloaded them and enjoyed their WINness .
The company started an iPhone browser project but gave up when faced with Apple 's absurd and unclear mandate to developers :
Do n't create services which duplicate the functionality of Apple 's own software .
In other words :
" Do n't compete with us or we will not let you in the game . "
The irony of this is not lost on anyone who had a computer before they had an Internet connection .
Apple was more than willing to pile on after Microsoft 's disasterous inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows .
In fact , what Apple is doing is 100x worse than what Microsoft did .
You see , Microsoft simply included their browser in Windows , still allowing other browsers to be installed .
In Apple 's case , they are not only bundling their browser with the iPhone , but they are BLOCKING other browsers from being installed .
Simple solution and opportunity : Do n't be a control freak and hypocrite .
Allow people to pick their browser ; the competition to make a better browser will increase the overall use of iPhones and mobile
data services .
5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone
--------------------------------------------------------
Apple took Google 's innovative and absurdly priced phone offering , Google Voice , out of the App Store and is currently being investigated by the FCC for this action .
This point is similar to the browser issue , in that Apple wants to own almost every extension of the iPhone platform .
How long before Apple decides to ban a Twitter client in favor of an Apple Twitter - like product ?
Seems crazy , I know , but by following Apple 's logic you should not be able to use Firefox or Google Chrome on your desktop .
Simple solution and opportunity : Let people have three or four phone services coming in to their iPhones and perhaps charge a modest licensing fee for those types of service .
Or , just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they 've BOUGHT AND PAID FOR .
That 's the joke of this : you 're paying for the data services that Apple is blocking .
You pay for the bandwidth and Apple does n't let you use it because , you know , they know better than you how you should consume your data minutes .
In Summary
--------------------------------------------------------
I 'm not a huge fan of government involvement in business , so I would rather see Apple resolve these issues for themselves .
In fact , I believe many forces are already at work , with Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and Peter Rojas of GDGT.com ( and founder of Engadget ) coming out publicly against these very issues .
Neither of these two individuals will use an iPhone * specifically * because it is incompatible with their lives .
Apple will face a user revolt in the coming years based upon Microsoft , Google and other yet - to - be - formed companies , undercutting their core markets with cheap , stable and open devices .
Apple 's legendary comeback ability will be for naught if they do n't deeply examine their anti-competitive nature .
Making great products does not absolve you from technology 's cardinal rule :
Do n't be evil .
It also does n't save you from Scarface 's cardinal rule :
Never get high on your own supply .
Questions :
1 . Do you think Apple would be more , or less , successful if they
adopted a more open strategy ( i.e. allowing other MP3 players in
iTunes ) ?
2 . Do you think Apple should face serious antitrust action ?
3 . Do you think Apple 's dexterity and competence forgive their bad behavior ?
World Population
Day has come and gone and among other things it has brought forth a rash of soul searching about the ' big picture ' of population growth , climate change , unrestrained consumption and resource depletion .
We are now incessantly being told that more people means less for everyone , less for cattle herders in Africa , less land for farmers throughout the developing world , less energy and food for poor nations , and more conflict and uncertainty .
There are now 6.9 billion of us and more on the way .
By 2050 there may well be more than 9 billion people in the world .
To ensure that environmental harm is kept to a minimum we need to reduce individual consumption rates .
Or so we are told .
It is as if someone has reignited the old Malthusian debate of the 1970s and 80's .
More people are bad , something has to be done about it , and population control is the way to go .
Interestingly , Malthusians have also assumed a new guise .
Family planning and birth control in the developing world has become the catch - cry of a new generation of security experts , particularly in the US .
A new security agenda has emerged in which the field of Security Demographics has become the war - wagon of neo-Malthusians who stridently claim that the Western model of small families , birth control , low fertility and middle aged - elderly populations is the only way to deliver stable government and social and economic security .
Population growth and rapidly increasing urbanisation in the developing world are seen as creating large numbers of poor , unemployed and discontented young males - all prone to radicalism and ready recruits for terrorist networks .
Implicit in this is the view , strongly put by US demographic think tanks like Population Action International , the Population Institute and the Worldwatch Institute , is that there are ' favourable ' and ' unfavourable ' age structures and that nations in the early and middle stages of the demographic transition are significantly more vulnerable to civil conflict than are those with low fertility and relatively mature aged populations .
So there we have it .
High fertility , rapid population growth and a youth bulge are all indicators of insecurity and conflict whereas ageing nations are more likely to be peaceful and democratic .
In reality the link is based on squeaky logic which simply states that because population growth and civil unrest and terrorism happen to coincide they must , therefore , be linked .
But the answer put forward is population control , restricted fertility and emulation of the Western model .
All this reminds me of what Keith Buchanan said almost 40 years ago when he referred to the efforts of ' The White North ' to impose population solutions on the rest of the world by arguing that rapid population growth was a cancer that would erode a nation 's chance of development and security , and that birth control and family planning was the solution to all the ills facing world society .
The traditional Malthusian argument that population would always outstrip food production was I thought laid to rest some decades ago .
But come back Paul Erlich and the population doom - mongers .' People pollution ' is back on the agenda , the ' population bomb ' now has another connotation , and like 40 years ago the response smacks of neo-colonialism , particularly when it is tied to threats or aid .
Population growth is the problem , because it creates vast numbers of hungry , footloose and dangerous ' Third Worlders ' .
We know best , and the answer is to impose the Western experience , and if you want investment and aid you had better adopt a family planning strategy .
There is a great irony here .
On the one hand developed nations are strongly committed to the belief that all women have the right ( at least in their own countries ) to determine their own fertility performance .
On the other , they are often the first to insist that family planning and birth control programs should be actively promoted and formalised throughout the developing world .
Surely it is a basic human right that choices about fertility and child bearing are voluntary and not imposed by governments or international agencies ?
As Frank Furedi has recently argued , we now have a new security agenda where the emphasis has shifted from the geopolitical domain to the demographic and environmental domains .
In all of this there is also more than a hint of environmental determinism , which links increasing population , environmental degradation , climate change and declining natural resources and sees them all as major threats to world security .
In such an environment it seems that nearly everyone is prepared to jump on the bandwagon of insecurity and ' the war on terror ' .

For the child who has everything ...
A Breastfeeding Doll ?!?!?
Spanish toymaker Berjuan is proud to present ( against their better judgment , I hope ) Bebe Gloton , the first - ever breastfeeding doll .
First - ever !
I bet that 's true .
Because it 's a bad idea .
If I invented the combination Baby - Changing Table / Table Saw it would be the " first - ever . "
But that does n't make it a good idea .
I could easily be the first to market the " Shotgun - Rattle , " too .
Or the " Rooftop car seat . "
Am I digressing ?
I always do that !
The purpose of Bebe Gloton ( Spanish for , roughly , " Gluttonous Baby " , ) is allegedly to promote breastfeeding .
Reaching children early with the idea that breastfeeding is natural .
However , of course it 's natural !!!
I do n't think any mom ( pre-teen or otherwise ) is contesting the fact that breastfeeding is healthy and natural .
I think it 's the clogged ducts and the cracked nipples that put them off .
I 'm all for breastfeeding .
But , as a man , I 'm quite certain no one cares what I think about it .
My very courageous and unselfish wife breast fed our children for over a year apiece ( including a set of twins . )
I think it was great , and they grew strong and healthy , without costing us a nickel on baby formula .
To " play " with this toy , the young girl ( or boy I suppose ? ) puts on a halter / bra type vestment and Bebe Gloton suckles on it around the nipple area .
Weird .
And I 'm not sure that as elementary - school - aged children we need to be plugging anything too specific in terms of baby rearing .
Especially right before they hit puberty and we start beating it into their heads that it'd better be a loooooong time before they get pregnant .
Let 's find a way to market the notion of breastfeeding to people who are approaching that stage in their life .
I 'd like to think that there 's a less creepy way to instill the notion of breastfeeding in the minds of children if that 's something we need to do .
What 's next ?
Bebe Sot -
The doll who has a problem with a different kind of bottle , and loses his family , job and feelings of self worth ? ?
Bebe Limp -
The male doll who experiences erectile dysfunction ?
Bebe Cell Mate -
A weak unimposing doll that experiences all the indignation and humiliation of life in prison .
Toy themes should be age appropriate .
I think so anyway .

Here are the facts !
Cholesterol is not a deadly poison , but a substance vital to the cells of all mammals .
There are no such things as good or bad cholesterol , but mental stress , physical activity and change of body weight may influence the level of blood cholesterol .
A high cholesterol is in fact beneficial , probably because it partake in our immune system .

A high blood cholesterol is said to promote atherosclerosis and thus also coronary heart disease .
But many studies have shown that people whose blood cholesterol is low become just as atherosclerotic as people whose cholesterol is high .

Your body produces three to four times more cholesterol than you eat .
The production of cholesterol increases when you eat little cholesterol and decreases when you eat much .
This explains why the ” prudent ” diet cannot lower cholesterol more than on average a few per cent .

There is no evidence that too much animal fat and cholesterol in the diet promotes atherosclerosis or heart attacks .
For instance , more than twenty studies have shown that people who have had a heart attack have n’t eaten more fat of any kind than other people , and degree of atherosclerosis at autopsy is unrelated with the diet .

The only effective way to lower cholesterol is with drugs , but neither heart mortality or total mortality have been improved with drugs the effect of which is cholesterol - lowering only .
On the contrary , these drugs are dangerous to your health and may shorten your life .

The modern cholesterol - lowering drugs , the statins , do prevent cardiovascular disease , but the effect is minuscule and is due to other mechanisms than cholesterol - lowering .
Unfortunately , they also stimulate cancer , disturb the functions of the muscles , the heart and the brain and pregnant women taking statins may give birth to children with malformations more severe than those seen after thalidomide .

Many of these facts have been presented in scientific journals and books for decades but are rarely told to the public by the proponents of the diet - heart idea .
The reason why laymen , doctors and most scientists have been misled is because opposing and disagreeing results are systematically ignored or misquoted in the scientific press .

A plan to demolish a building in Cankiri , central Turkey went badly wrong when the 25 - metre high structure rolled over onto its roof .
The building , a flour factory built in 1928 which had been idle since the 1980s , was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a shopping centre .
No -one was reported to have been injured .
Designing and building a simple solar array is a good father - son project or even a good science fair project for any young scientist .
The array that we will build in this article will produce 12 volts with a maximum load current of 3 Amperes .
Knowing how something works is just as important to the DIY electrician as the knowledge of how to build it is .
Knowing how something works is important because if something goes awry during the construction phase and you have to troubleshoot your project you will need to know how it was suppose to work before you can effectively troubleshoot it .
Back in the days when I was getting my start in electronics there were two types of people working in the field , technicians and parts changers .
The parts changers didnâ€™t really have a good understanding of the theory involved ; they didnâ€™t understand how a particular circuit operated , so when something went wrong they just haphazardly changed parts until they stumbled across the one that solved the problem .
They eventually solved the problem but it was a very time consuming method and a very expensive method for their customers because they ended up paying for many parts that they didnâ€™t need .
The technician , on the other hand , understood the theory of how a circuit operated , knew how to effectively test it and isolate the problem quickly .
The technician didnâ€™t replace good parts and that kept their customerâ€™s cost to a minimum .
For the DIY electrician , that could mean the difference between spending $ 70 for a Clothe Drier motor when all they need to replace was a $ 10 centrifugal switch ,
Before we get into building our solar array letâ€™s spend a minute or two talking about the history of the solar array and the theory of how solar cells work .
Iâ€™ll spare you as much of the physics and math as I can but an overview is important .
Photovoltaicâ€™s , as a science , has a long history .
Photovoltaicâ€™s is the science of converting light energy into electrical energy .
As you probably recall from your physics classes , the First Law of Thermodynamics , the Law of the Conservation of Energy , states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can be converted from one form to another .
In 1838 , 19 years old physicist , Edmund Becquerel , observed and wrote about the phenomenon .
In 1873 , 35 years after this young scientist first observed the phenomenon ; Willoughby Smith discovered the Photovoltaic properties of the element Selenium while working on undersea cable for the Telegraph Construction Company located in Great Britain .
This observation led to the eventual invention of the Selenium solar cell in 1883 by Charles Fritz .
The Fritz Selenium cell was the first solar cell to produce usable electrical energy but with a conversion efficiency of 1 to 2 percent , no commercial applications were forthcoming .
In the late 1920â€™s , copper oxide , another metallic semiconductor was also known for its Photovoltaic properties .
The first real use of the Selenium and the Copper Oxide cells were in light measuring instrument like the photometers used by the photographers of the day .
There conversion efficiency of approximately 1 percent limited their usefulness .
No real advances were made in Photovoltaicâ€™s until 1954 when Bell Laboratory scientists , G.L. Pearson , Daryl Chapin , and Calvin Fuller , discovered that Silicon when doped with certain impurities produced minute electric currents .
The first modern photo cell emerged from Bell Laboratories with an efficiency of approximately 6 percent .
Today solar cell efficiency has reached 37 percent with the use of light concentration technology .
Modern solar cells are a three layered device based on solid physics .
In essence they are a P - N Junction Photodiode with a large photosensitive area .
The first of the three layers is composed of an N - Type semiconductor material which simply means that itâ€™s a semiconductor material is rich in electrons .
The second layer is the P - N Junction , called the â€œabsorber layer .â€ 
The third layer is composed of a P - Type semiconductor material which is electron â€œpoor.â€ 
The P - Type Semiconductor material is rich in â€ œHolesâ€  which means that current flows across the junction from the N - Layer to the P - Layer .
The light enters the cell through a metal grid , the positive electrode .
The negative electrode is a solid metal plate covering the back of the cell .
Designing the array
The two solar cell parameters that we are going to be concerned with as we select cells for our project will be their Voc ( Maximum Open Circuit Voltage ) at zero output current and its Isc ( Short Circuit Current ) at zero Output Voltage ) .
A single 2â€ square solar cell produces a Voc of 0.5 Volts at 0.5 Amperes .
To achieve our goal of 12 Volts and 3 Amps we will need to connect our cells in a series - parallel configuration .
Connecting cells in series increases the voltage while the output current of the series circuit remains the same as that of a single cell .
Since one cell produces 0.5 Volts , we need to connect 24 cells in series .
The number of cells needed equals the required output voltage divided by the voltage of a single cell or # =Vout / 0.5 .
Paralleling batteries increases the current available while keeping the voltage the same .
To achieve our goal of 3 Amperes we need to parallel 6 solar cells .
To achieve 12 Volts at 3 Amperes we need to parallel 6 series strings .
To construct a series string , connect the solar cells negative to positive .
To parallel the series circuits connect all the positive terminals of the last cell in each string together and connect all the negative terminals of the first cell in each series string together .
Mounting the cells
For your 12 Volt , 3 Ampere array you will need to mount a total of 144 solar cells .
Since each cell measures 2 inches to a side your completed array will fit on a 24â€  X 24â€ sheet of Ñ˜â€ plywood .
The physical dimensions can vary from one manufacturer to another so you may have to adjust the size of the mounting board .
Radio Shack is a good source for the solar cells .
These cells sell for approximately $ 5 each so your array will cost you about $ 720 to build .
Solar power isnâ€™t inexpensive but once the array is built it is relatively cost free power .
There ’s good news and bad news in the FDIC ’s quarterly profile of the banking sector .
The good news is that FDIC has more resources than you think to handle the problem banks on its radar .
The bad news is that the too - big - to - fail banks are n’t on it .
The balance in the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund ended the quarter at $ 10.4 billion — its lowest since the savings and loan debacle — but it is n’t the only security blanket protecting insured depositors .
The agency also has a “ contingent loss reserve . ”
If you add the loss reserve to the deposit insurance fund balance , the FDIC ’s total resources were $ 42 billion at the end of the second quarter .
Despite 24 bank failures during the quarter , that total actually increased by half a billion dollars .
How could that be ?
The biggest reason is that the FDIC is finally getting serious about charging premiums for the insurance it provides .
Member banks were charged $ 9.1 billion to replenish the fund last quarter .
That ’s up from $ 2.6 billion in the first quarter and $ 640 million a year ago .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
A similar amount may be raised this quarter if the agency charges banks another “ special assessment . ”
While that decision wo n’t be made till next month , it looks likely .
That ’s great news for taxpayers who would otherwise have to plug the hole if the FDIC runs out of money .
Banks complain that special assessments put too much pressure on them at a tough time .
But it ’s their own fault the deposit insurance fund is running so low .
According to a Boston Globe article by Michael Kranish earlier this year , about 95 percent of banks paid nothing for their deposit insurance from 1996 - 2006 .
But that was n’t FDIC ’s fault ; they were prevented by law from charging premiums .
Congress did n’t think it was necessary .
Oops .
So the deposit insurance fund will be under pressure for some time .
FDIC ’s problem bank list grew to 416 at the end of last quarter .
These banks have $ 300 billion of assets .
In total , FDIC estimates the banking sector is wrestling with $ 332 billion worth of loans and leases on which borrowers have stopped making payments .
That excludes hundreds of billions worth of underwater loans that may be current now but will ultimately default .
Many banks , including the largest ones , are likely to struggle for some time .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
And that ’s the bigger story here .
Citigroup and Bank of America have received hundreds of billions of dollars of government support , but , precisely because of that support , they ’re not on the FDIC ’s list .
Adding them to it would multiply total problem assets 10 times , to $ 3 trillion .
Overall , the deposit insurance fund is tiny compared with the total amount of deposits that are insured .
The official total is $ 4.8 trillion , but that excludes “ temporary ” increases in deposit insurance instituted last fall .
One program , which increased insurance limits to $ 250,000 for individuals , now backs $ 725 billion of deposits .
Earlier this year it was extended to 2013 .
The other program , which provides unlimited insurance coverage for transaction accounts , backs $ 736 billion of deposits .
On Wednesday , that program was extended through June of next year .
Add those amounts to the official figure and you have the real total : $ 6.3 trillion , huge relative to the resources of the insurance fund .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
Asset prices are n’t going back to their highs of 2006 - 2007 , so loans held against them will be generating losses for years .
The FDIC may raise enough cash from banks to fund depositor losses in small and medium - sized banks , but it is clear that the biggest banks are far too large for them to handle .
As a result , the government ’s emergency rescue measures are n’t going away for a while .
And taxpayers should expect to be writing fat bailout checks to the financial system for years to come .

You 've found it
In 1492 , Columbus sailed west .
In 1991 , the Soviet Union collapsed .
These two events bracketed the European age .
Once , Mayans lived unaware that there were Mongols , who were unaware there were Zulus .
From the 15th century onwards , European powers collectively overwhelmed the world , creating the first truly global geopolitical system in human history , to the point where the fate of Australian Aborigines was determined by British policy in Ireland and the price of bread in France turned on the weather in Minnesota .
Europe simultaneously waged a 500 - year - long civil war of increasing savagery , until the continent tore itself apart in the 20th century and lost its hold on the world .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , there was no longer a single European nation that could be considered a global power of the first rank .
Another unprecedented event took place a decade or so earlier .
For 500 years , whoever controlled the North Atlantic controlled Europe 's access to the world and , with it , global trade .
By 1980 , the geography of trade had shifted , so that the Atlantic and Pacific were equally important , and any power that had direct access to both oceans had profound advantages .
North America became the pivot of the global system , and whatever power dominated North America became its centre of gravity .
That power is , of course , the United States .
It is geography combined with the ability to exploit it that matters .
The US is secure from attack on land or sea .
It is vulnerable to terrorist attack but , outside of a nuclear exchange , faces no existential threat in the sense that Britain and France did in 1940 - 41 , or Germany and Japan did in 1944 - 45 .
Part of its advantage is that , alone among the combatants , the US actually profited from the Second World War , emerging with a thoroughly modernised industrial base .
But this itself can be traced to the country 's core geography .
The fertility of the land between the Appa­lachians and the Rocky Mountains , and the configuration of the country 's river system , drove an economic system in the 19th century that helped fund an economy which today constitutes between 25 and 30 per cent of global economic activity , depending on how you value the dollar .
Just as important , perhaps , is that while the population density of Japan is about 365 people per square kilometre and that of most European states between 100 and 300 per square kilometre , the US population density , excluding Alaska , is about 34 people per square kilometre .
The US has room to grow and it manages immigration well .
Its population is not expected to decline .
It is the pre-eminent power not because of the morality of the regime , the virtue of its people or the esteem in which it is held , but because of Europe 's failures and changes in global trade patterns .
This is a geopolitical reading of history .
Geo­politics argues that it is geography which defines power , and that military , economic and political power are different parts of a single system .
Geopolitics tends not to take policies or politicians very seriously , seeing them as trapped in reality .
The finest statesman ruling Iceland will not dominate the world ; the stupidest ruling ancient Rome could not undermine its power .
Economists talk about an invisible hand - a concept , if not a term , they have borrowed from Machiavelli .
Geopolitics applies the concept of the invisible hand to the behaviour of nations and other international actors .
Geopolitics and economics both hold that the players are rational and will pursue their self - interest , if not flawlessly , then at least not randomly .
Think of a chess game .
On the surface , it appears that each player has 20 potential opening moves .
In fact , there are many fewer , because most of these moves are so bad that they would quickly lead to defeat .
The better you are at chess , the more clearly you see your options , and the fewer moves you regard as being available : the better the player , the more predictable the move .
The grandmaster plays with absolute predictable precision - until that one brilliant , unexpected stroke .
Geopolitics assumes two things : first , that human beings organise themselves into units larger than families and that they have a natural loyalty to the things they were born into , the people and the places ; second , that the character of a nation is determined to a great extent by geography , as is the relationship between nations .
We use the term " geography " broadly .
It includes the physical characteristics of a location , but it goes beyond that to look at the effects of a place on individuals and communities .
These are the foundation of geopolitical forecasting .
Opinion and reputation have little to do with national power .
Whether the US president is loathed or admired is of some minor immediate import , but the fundamentals of power are overarching .
Nor do passing events have much to do with national power , no matter how significant they appear at that moment .
The recent financial crisis mattered , but it did not change the basic geometry of international power .
The concept of American decline is casually tossed about , but for America to decline , some other power must surpass it .
There are no candidates .
Consider China , most often mentioned as the challenger to the US .
Han China is surrounded by four buffer states , Manchuria , Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang and Tibet .
Without these buffers , the borders of China move inward and China becomes vulnerable .
With these four buffers in place , China is secure - but as a landlocked island , bounded by mountainous jungle , the Himalayas , the steppes of central Asia and the Siberian wasteland .
China is blocked in all directions but the sea .
The vast majority of China 's population lives within a thousand miles of the Pacific coast .
Beyond this line , water supply will not support large populations .
Most industrial development has taken place within a hundred miles of the coast .
Consider the following numbers , culled from official Chinese statistics .
About 65 million Chinese people live in households with more than $ 20,000 a year in income .
Around 165 million make between $ 2,000 and $ 20,000 a year .
Most of these live within 100 miles of the coast .
About 400 million Chinese have household ­incomes between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 a year , while about 670 million have household incomes of less than $ 1,000 a year .
China is a land of extra­ordinary poverty .
Mao made the Long March to raise an army of desperate peasants to rectify this sort of extreme imbalance .
The imbalance is there again , a volcano beneath the current regime .
China would have to triple the size of its economy - and the US would have to stand still - if China were to pull even with the US in GDP .
Militarily , China is impotent .
Its army is a domestic security force , its ability to project power blocked by natural barriers .
Its navy exists mostly on paper and could not possibly pose a serious threat to the US .
Casual assertions of China surpassing the US geopolitically ignore fundamental , overwhelming realities .
China could conceivably overcome its problems , but it would require most of the century to overcome problems of this magnitude .
Europe , if it ever coalesced into a unified economic and military power , could certainly challenge the US .
However , as we have seen during the recent financial crisis , nationalism continues to divide the continent , even if exhaustion has made that nationalism less virulent .
The idea of Europe becoming a multinational state with a truly integrated economic decision - making system - and with a global military force under joint command - is as distant a dream as that of China becoming a global power .
This is not an Americentric view of the world .
The world is Americentric .
The US marshals the economic resources of North America , controls the world 's oceans and space , projects force where it wishes - wisely or not .
The US is to the world what Britain once was to Europe .
Both nations depended on control of the sea to secure their interests .
Both nations understood that the best way to retain control of the sea was to prevent other nations from building navies .
Both understood that the best way to do that was to maintain a balance of power in which potential challengers spent their resources fighting each other on land , rather than building fleets that could challenge their control of the sea .
The US is doing this globally .
Its primary goal is always to prevent the emergence of a single power that can dominate Eurasia and the European peninsula .
With the Soviet Union 's collapse , China 's limits and the EU 's divisions , there is currently no threat of this .
So the US has moved to a secondary goal , which is to block the emergence of any regional hegemon that could , in the long term , grow into something more dangerous .
The US does what it can to disrupt the re-emergence of Russian national power while building relations with bordering countries such as Poland and Turkey .
It encourages unrest in China 's border regions , using the ideology of human rights as justification .
It conducts direct or surrogate wars on a seemingly random basis , from Somalia to Serbia , from Iraq to Afghanistan .
Many of these wars appear to go badly .
However , success is measured not by the pacification of a country , but by its disruption .
To the extent that the Eurasian land mass is disrupted , to the extent that there is perpetual unrest and disunion from the Atlantic to the Pacific , the US has carried out its mission .
Iraq is paradigmatic .
The US intervention resulted in a civil war .
What appeared to be a failure was , in fact , a satisfactory outcome .
Subjectively , we would think George W Bush and his critics were unaware of this .
But that is the point of geopolitics .
The imperatives generate ideologies ( a democratic Iraq ) and misconceptions ( weapons of mass destruction ) .
These , however , are shadows on the wall .
It is the geopolitical imperatives , not the rhetoric , that must be understood in order to make sense of what is going on .
Thus , the question is how these geopolitical and strategic realities shape the rest of the century .
Eurasia , broadly understood , is being hollowed out .
China is far weaker than it appears and is threatened with internal instability .
The Europeans are divided by old national patterns that prevent them from moving in a uniform direction .
Russia is using the window of opportunity presented by the US absorption in disrupting the Islamic world to reclaim its sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union , but its underlying weakness will reassert itself over the next generation .
New powers will emerge .
In the 19th century , Germany , Italy and Japan began to emerge as great powers , while in the 20th century global powers such as Britain and France declined to secondary status .
Each century , a new constellation of powers forms that might strike observers at the beginning of the century as unthinkable .
Let us therefore think about the unthinkable .
The United States conducts an incautious foreign policy .
The relative power of the US is such that it has a margin of error far beyond that of the countries it confronts .
It also has a strategic disruptive imperative , based on geopolitical interests .
This will make the planet an uncomfortable place , particular for rising powers .
There is another dimension built into US foreign policy - using subordinate regional powers as surrogates , exchanging their willingness to incur risks from a major power opposed to the US for substantial benefits .
These range from strategic guarantees and support against smaller neighbours to trade advantages and technology transfers .
The recovery of West Germany and Japan during the cold war are classic examples of this .
There are three nations that are already major or emerging regional powers that will be important to the US in dealing with Russia in the next decade or so : Japan , Turkey and Poland .
Japan is already a great power .
It is the world 's second - largest economy , with a far more stable distribution of income and social structure than China .
It has east Asia 's largest navy - one that China would like to have - and an army larger than Britain 's ( since the Second World War , both Japan 's " army " and " navy " have officially been non-aggressive " self - defence forces " ) .
It has not been a dynamic country , militarily or economically , but dynamism comes and goes .
It is the fundamentals of national power , relative to other countries , that matter in the long run .
Turkey is now the world 's 17th - largest economy and the largest Islamic economy .
Its military is the most capable in the region and is also probably the strongest in Europe , apart from the British armed forces .
Its influence is already felt in the Caucasus , the Balkans , central Asia and the Arab world .
Most important , it is historically the leader in the Muslim world , and its bridge to the rest of the world .
Over the centuries , when the Muslim world has been united , this has happened under Turkish power ; the past century has been the aberration .
If Russia weakens , Turkey emerges as the dominant power in the region , including the eastern Mediterranean ; Turkey is an established naval power .
It has also been historically pragmatic in its foreign policies .
Poland has the 18th - largest economy in the world , the largest among the former Soviet satellites and the eighth - largest in Europe .
It is a vital strategic asset for the US .
In the emerging competition between the US and Russia , Poland represents the geographical frontier between Europe and Russia and the geographical foundation of any attempt to defend the Baltics .
Given the US strategic imperative to block Eurasian hegemons and Europe 's unease with the US , the US - Polish relationship becomes critical .
In 2008 the US signed a deal with Poland to instal missiles in the Baltic Sea as part of Washington 's European missile defence shield , ostensibly to protect against " rogue states " .
The shield is not about Iran , but about Poland as a US ally - from the American and the Russian points of view .
To gauge what it means for a country to be a strategic asset of a global power , consider the case of South Korea .
Any suggestion in 1950 that it would become a major industrial power by the end of the century would have been greeted with disbelief .
Yet that is what Korea became .
Like Israel , South Korea formed a strategic relationship with the US that was transformative .
And both South Korea and Israel started with a much weaker base in 1950 than Poland has today .
Russia cannot survive its economic and demographic problems indefinitely .
China must face its endemic social problems .
So , imagine an unstable , fragmented Eurasia .
On its rim are three powers - Japan to the east , Turkey to the south and Poland to the west .
Each will have been a US protégé during the Russian interregnum , but by mid-century the US tendency to turn on allies and make allies of former enemies will be in play , not out of caprice but out of geopolitical necessity .
Two of the three major powers will be maritime powers .
By far the most important will be Japan , whose dependence on the importation of virtually all raw materials forces it to secure its sea lanes .
Turkey will have a lesser but very real interest in being a naval power in the eastern Mediterranean , and as its power in the Muslim world rises it will develop a relationship with Egypt that will jeopardise the Suez Canal and , beyond it , the Arabian Sea .
Poland , locked between Russia and Germany , and far more under US control than the other two , will be a land power .
US strategy considers any great power with significant maritime capabilities a threat ; it will have solved one problem - the Russian problem - by generating another .
Imagining a Japanese - Turkish alliance is strange but no stranger than a Japanese - German alliance in 1939 .
Both countries will be under tremendous pressure from the established power .
Both will have an interest in overthrowing the global regime the US has imposed .
The risk of not acting will be greater than the risk of acting .
That is the basis of war .
Imagining the war requires that we extrapolate technology .
For the US , space is already the enabler of its military machine .
Communications , navigation and intelligence are already space - based .
Any great power challenging the US must destroy US space - based assets .
That means that , by the middle of the century , the US will have created substantial defences for those assets .
But if the US can be rendered deaf , dumb and blind , a coalition of Turkey and Japan could force the US to make strategic concessions .
War depends on surprise , and this surprise will have to focus on the destruction of US space forces .
If this sounds preposterous , then imagine how the thought of a thousand bomber raids in the Second World War would have sounded in 1900 .
The distance travelled technologically between 1900 and 1945 was much greater than the one I am suggesting by 2050 .
There are no breakthroughs required here , only developments of what already exists .
It is difficult to imagine an American defeat in this war , although not major setbacks .
The sheer weight of power that the US and its Polish ally can throw against the Japanese and Turks will be overwhelming .
The enemy will be trying to deny the US what it already has , space power , without being able to replace it .
The US will win in a war where the stakes will be the world , but the cost will be much less than the bloody slaughters of Europe 's world wars .
Space does not contain millions of soldiers in trenches .
War becomes more humane .
The ultimate prize is North America .
Until the middle of the 19th century , there were two contenders for domination - Washington and Mexico City .
After the American conquest of northern Mexico in the 1840s , Washington dominated North America and Mexico City ruled a weak and divided country .
It remained this way for 150 years .
It will not remain this way for another hundred .
Today , Mexico is the world 's 13th - largest economy .
It is unstable due to its drug wars , but it is difficult to imagine those wars continuing for the rest of the century .
The heirs of today 's gangsters will be on the board of art museums soon enough .
Mexico has become a nation of more than 100 million people with a trillion - dollar economy .
When you look at a map of the borderland between the United States and Mexico , you see a huge flow of drug money to the south and the flow of population northward .
Many areas of northern Mexico that the US seized are now being repopulated by Mexicans moving northward - US citizens , or legal aliens , or illegal aliens .
The political border and the cultural border are diverging .
Until after the middle of the century , the US will not respond .
It will have concerns elsewhere and demographic shifts in the US will place a premium on encouraging Mexican migration northward .
It will be after the mid-century systemic war that the new reality will emerge .
Mexico will be a prosperous , powerful nation with a substantial part of its population living in the American south - west , in territory that Mexicans regard as their own .
The 500 years of European domination of the international system did not guarantee who would be the dominant European power .
Nor is there any guarantee who will be the dominant power in North America .
One can imagine scenarios in which the US fragments , in which Mexico becomes an equal power , or in which the US retains primacy for centuries , or an outside power makes a play .
North America is the prize .
In due course , the geopolitical order will shift again , and the American epoch will end .
Perhaps even sooner , the power of the US will wane .
But not yet , and not in this century .

BECK THE BAILOUT BOOSTER ….
When it comes to right - wing populism , last year ’s bailout of the financial industry holds a unique place in the panoply of conservative complaints .
Despite having come from a conservative Republican president and his conservative Republican Treasury secretary , the idea of throwing $ 700 billion at banks that nearly collapsed the global economy draws the intense ire of the Tea Party crowd .
The trick , then , is for conservative leaders to ride the wave of anger effectively .
We talked yesterday about Mitt Romney , who said earlier in the year that “ bailing out banks was “ necessary to prevent a cascade of bank collapses , ” but who ’s since changed his mind .
But a Romney flip - flop is about as common as the sunrise .
Of greater interest is Glenn Beck ’s reversal .
Yesterday , in an apparent attempt at bipartisanship , Beck targeted TARP .
“ [ Obama ] will say that Bush started us down the path toward socialism , and he’d be right by that , ” Beck told his Fox News audience .
“ Bush started the crazy spending .
He would be right again .
Bush started the bailouts .
Yes , he did — [ I ] hated him for it . ”
And while this rhetoric is no doubt applauded by Teabaggers , Beck had a very different message last fall .
Indeed , exactly one year ago today , Beck publicly endorsed the bank bailouts .
“ [ W]e are in the middle of an all - out financial emergency , and emergencies have a way of really testing people .
“ In normal times , under normal circumstances , if you tune in to me , you know me as somebody who would tell the federal government exactly where to take their bailout plans and shove it right up their you - know - what .
But these are anything but normal times .
“ I thought about it an awful lot this weekend , and while it takes me — it takes everything in me to say this , I think the bailout is the right thing do .
“ The ‘ Real Story ’ is : The $ 700 billion that you ’re hearing about now is not only , I believe , necessary , it is also not nearly enough , and all of the weasels in Washington know it . ”
Beck probably does n’t remember calling the bailout “ necessary ” and the “ right thing to do , ” and he probably hopes his followers do n’t remember it either .
But that ’s what he said .
D - Day added , “ Beck saw a movement stirring on the furthest reaches of the right and got out in front of it .
Before that he was pretty firmly behind his President in bailing out the top banks .
The difference is that now , the political energy on the right is with the teabaggers , and it makes sense to Beck to capitalize on that energy .
But he has nothing approaching a coherent worldview .
Whatever gets the most eyeballs . ”
I ’ll look forward to Glenn Beck ’09 denouncing Glenn Beck ’08 as a socialistic sell - out who does n’t care about our freedoms .
The handwringing over the supposedly disastrous consequences of our growing national debt shows no sign of abating anytime soon .
Perhaps most troubling is that the unwarranted alarmism comes not just from rabid ever - grizzlies like ZeroHedge but also from some respectable information sources .
At every turn , the Cassandras remind us that the US has total outstanding national debt of $ 11.8 trillion and $ 3 million of new national debt every minute .
( They conveniently fail to mention that that 's only a 100 % increase in the debt since 2001 . )
They seem to get satisfaction from pointing out that the debt is so large , it does n't even fit on most calculators .
And they note that even according to the conservative estimates of the Obama Administration , the federal budget deficit in 2009 will be $ 1.6 trillion , over 11 % of the overall economy , the highest on record since the end of WWII .
And that in 2019 , the national debt will represent over 75 % of GDP , the highest proportion since just after WWII .
They claim that , in these circumstances , the international reserve status of the dollar will not survive , leading , at best , to a crippling rise in interest rates and the cost of debt service , and at worst , a collapse of the American monetary system .
Either way , they claim , the US economy will " teeter on the edge of a black hole . "
Defeatist data like these are causing pundits and ordinary folks alike to start thinking about the issue -- never a good thing .
It 's clear the debt hysteria wo n't ebb until either Americans are distracted by a new reality show or the experts debunk the myth that debt is bad .
Fortunately , Congressman Pete Stark has gotten the ball rolling by noting that the national debt is actually an indication of our country 's wealth ( before politely telling his interviewer to " get the fuck out or I 'll throw you out the window " ) .
And Nobel - winning economist Paul Krugman has helped out by suggesting that national debt does n't really matter .
I fear , though , that these lone voices of fiscal sanity wo n't be enough .
So , in an attempt to break down the facts in a way that a six - year - old -- or even Tyler Durden -- could understand , I 've composed clear , straightforward answers to frequently - asked questions on this much - misunderstood topic .
Feel free to add any queries not addressed , but I think this pretty much ends the debt debate .
( However , if after reading the FAQs you 're still a bit anxious about the debt , you 're in luck .
The Treasury Department has been kind enough to allow concerned citizens to make a " gift " to the government to reduce the debt . )
FAQs About The National Debt
" Will the growing federal deficits increase the US 's borrowing costs , creating a vicious cycle of spiraling debt ? "
Once upon a time , people thought so , but recent economic history has proven that theory wrong .
In fact , debt and borrowing costs enjoy an inverse relationship .
For example , in the past few years , the national debt and deficit have skyrocketed , but interest rates have plummeted to record lows .
Ergo , the more debt we assume , the lower our borrowing costs will be , which will allow us to access funds to service the balooning debt at ever - cheaper prices .
By my calculation , if the US had the good sense to increase its debt by a few trillion more , we could reach a point where investors pay for the privilege of lending us their hard - earned cash .
" Does n't a massive federal deficit mean we 're spending much more than we produce ? "
Absolutely .
That 's the beauty of it -- you get to spend money like a drunken sailor even though you 're on a drunken sailor 's salary .
" Wo n't investors stop lending to us altogether at some point ? "
This is America .
Governments , corporations and individuals in this country and around the world are lined up around the block waiting patiently to throw money at us .
Since the queue 's end is n't even visible from here , there 's no reason to believe it actually has an end .
" Do n't sound principles of personal finance dictate that it 's unsustainable for an individual to continue borrowing and spending more than he earns ? "
Yes .
In short order that person 's credit rating will fall , which will require him to pay more to get additional credit .
At some point -- and it wo n't be long -- lenders will refuse to provide any more credit .
If he is n't able to increase his income to meet his debt service obligations and other expenses , he 'll go bankrupt .
" Would n't the same thing happen to a government that borrows and spends more than it produces ? "
Yes .
" So , does n't that mean the same thing will happen to the US Government ? "
No .
The economic realities applicable to individuals and other governments do n't apply to the US .
This phenomenon is what 's known as the economic component of American Exceptionalism .
" What makes the US exempt from economic reality ? "
A surplus of factors .
First , the almighty dollar .
For decades it has been the international reserve currency , which is a fancy way of saying the rest of the world has eternal blind faith in our money .
In God we trust .
In the Dollar they trust .
Second , we have the largest economy in the world , which means the rest of the world knows that a hole in our boat would drag the rest of the world 's dinghies to the bottom of the ocean with us .
That keeps them cooperative .
And third , America is the greatest , freest , richest , most egalitarian country in the history of the world .
We 're a beacon to the rest of humanity .
We 're the modern age 's greatest national success story .
These colors do n't run ( except , of course , where the red , white and blue at issue are the colors of France . )
And , what 's more , we 're the greatest .
How could a country like that go bankrupt ?
" But has n't China hinted at replacing the dollar as the reserve currency ? "
China schmina .
" Is n't China expected to overtake the US as the world 's largest economy ? "
That 's not going to happen any time soon -- at least not for 3 or 4 years .
And if and when it does happen : China schmina .
" Is n't deficit spending by the government contrary to conservative economic principles ? "
Not at all .
Government debt as a means of centrally planning a nation 's economy is what laissez - faire capitalism is all about .
For those whose French is rusty , " laissez - faire " generally means " let - do , " " leave - alone " or " step - the - fuck - off , Uncle Sam " .
Except when the economy veers off the anticipated course , in which case it means " government - should - intervene-by- sticking-its-arm-up-the-economy's- ass-and - making-it- dance - like -a- hand - puppet " .
Worry not -- Adam Smith and Milton Friedman are resting peacefully .
" What about the Fed 's policy of monetizing the debt by expanding its balance sheet ?
Is n't that even more dangerous because it finances deficit spending by , in effect , printing money ? "
That 's what the press is there for .
Printing money devalues a currency , sparks inflation and merely postpones an inevitable day of painful reckoning only when third world countries do it .
" Are you sure we 've got nothing to worry about ? "
As sure as I am that the Obama Administration 's deficit projections are right on the money .
" So , debt is , for lack of a better word , good ? "
Precisely .
Debt is right ; debt works .
Debt clarifies , cuts through , and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit .
Debt , in all of its forms -- debt for bank bonuses ; debt for shiny new cars ; debt for that i- Phone app that makes the farting noises of different ethnic groups around the world -- has marked the upward surge of consumerkind and debt , you mark my words , will not only save Ben Bernanke 's job , irresponsible homeowners and Citigroup , but also that country with a mild case of economic performance anxiety called the USA .
Mr. Dover will be on a secret fact - finding tour of Europe for the next few weeks .
Originally written for the Dreamcast 's 10th anniversary , this retrospective from Dan Whitehead is still a remarkable tribute to Sega 's final home console .
We 're republishing this today , the 20th anniversary of the Dreamcast 's launch in North America , as fans worldwide celebrate that legendary 9/9/99 release date .
( Though Europe had to wait until 14th October . )
In the annals of console history , the Dreamcast is often portrayed as a small , square , white plastic JFK .
A progressive force in some ways , perhaps misguided in others , but nevertheless a promising life cut tragically short by dark shadowy forces , spawning complex conspiracy theories that endure to this day .
So to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its launch , which passed recently , Eurogamer is going all CSI to consider who - or what - killed the Dreamcast .
Was it grinchy old EA , withholding the precious lifeblood of its licensed sports games ?
Or did the fiendish pirates help to sink the SEGA ship , cracking the GD - ROM format and allowing anyone with a CD burner to brazenly copy Dreamcast games ?
Or was it that big mean bully Sony , tucked away on the grassy knoll , blowing the head off the competition with a bullet of ruthless PR chicanery ?
By November 1998 , when the Dreamcast first arrived in Japanese shops , it had been ten long years since the popular Megadrive , a decade punctuated by a triple whammy of high - profile hardware mistakes .
The SEGA CD add - on was the first , an over - priced and poorly supported multimedia attachment for the Megadrive that relied on the thankfully short - lived craze for FMV - based " interactive movies " .
Customers soon wised up to the fact that beneath the grainy video footage , they really were n't getting any more gameplay for their money .
Following up this clunky bit of kit with the even more pointless 32X add - on merely deepened SEGA 's malaise in 1994 .
Another expensive add - on , the 32X flopped hard , selling less than a quarter of a million units .
Software support was virtually non-existent , and the whole sorry affair was brushed under the rug in less than a year .
SEGA fans who had faithfully bought each new product were left with pricey lumps of plastic and a severe case of buyer 's remorse .
It did n't help that the 32X was developed by SEGA 's American arm , allegedly unaware that at the same time their Japanese colleagues were working on the SEGA Saturn .
By E3 1997 , SEGA had given up on the Saturn .
Released a few months ahead of Sony 's dark horse PlayStation , the Saturn seemed poised to restore SEGA 's console fortunes .
But SEGA had n't banked on Sony successfully appealing to a wider audience , with PlayStation 's clubland aesthetic and slicker image , and with the Saturn 's internal architecture proving something of a tangle , many developers switched their attention to Sony 's more accessible and successful platform .
Despite fairly strong sales in Japan , the system struggled in America and Europe and soon found itself trailing in third place behind the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 .
With dwindling third - party support , SEGA 's American head honcho Bernie Stolar announced at E3 in 1997 that " the Saturn is not our future " .
Coming off a run of three high - profile failures , SEGA took the unusual step of getting two competing R&D teams to come up with a console capable of putting the company back on top .
One team was based in Japan , the other in the US .
Both had different ideas as to which combination of chips and parts would fit the bill , and the American team signed a deal with 3dfx to use a custom version of the company 's Voodoo 2 graphics chip .
Unfortunately , during the development period , 3dfx was looking to sell shares and as part of the documentation it revealed lots of juicy details regarding the top - secret SEGA console .
The US plan was ditched and SEGA opted to go with the Japanese design , prompting the newly floated 3dfx stock to drop by 43 per cent .
3dfx filed a lawsuit , claiming breach of contract .
The case was quickly settled out of court , but it was the sort of speedbump that SEGA could ill afford .
After a tepid Japanese debut launched the console with a resounding thud in November 1998 , we poor saps in America and Europe would have to wait almost a year to get our hands on it .
Finally going global in the autumn of 1999 , the Dreamcast swiftly made up for its poor Japanese performance , breaking US sales records by clocking up 300,000 pre-orders and shifting over 500,000 units in the first two weeks .
We still would .
It was a deserved success , carried on the shoulders of solid technical specifications and innovative new features .
The Dreamcast was n't the first console to offer online functions - even the SNES had tentatively dipped a toe in those waters - but it was the first to come with a modem built in and its own ISP for online gaming , thus enabling online play for all , rather than those who purchased a chunky peripheral .
It was also the first to offer a memory card that doubled as a gaming device in its own right , with the Visual Memory Unit able to download mini-games , swap data with friends and act as a rudimentary battery - guzzling personal organiser .
It 's true that Electronic Arts opted not to support the system , denying the Dreamcast the guaranteed sales that brands like Madden provided , but contrary to what the conspiracy theorists will tell you the Dreamcast software line - up managed just fine thanks to the SEGA Sports label .
SEGA 's own NFL 2K1 , marketed as the first football game with online play , even outsold the official Madden game during its first weeks on the market .
Away from the sports field , the games were just as popular .
Exclusive titles like Sonic Adventure and Power Stone showcased SEGA 's bright and bold aesthetic , while nigh - perfect arcade ports like Soul Calibur and Crazy Taxi put the aging PlayStation to shame .
But there was already a fly in the ointment , and the fly was called Sony .
In March 1999 , realising that SEGA was about to leapfrog a hardware generation and get its next - gen machine on the shelves first , Sony had publicly unveiled PlayStation 2 - then still a year away from release .
The prospect of the successor to the world - conquering PlayStation was enough to cut the already wobbly legs off the Dreamcast in Japan , with most gamers opting to wait for the sure - to - be - awesome PS2 , with its mysterious " emotion engine " and games that would literally emerge from the screen and fellate you senseless .
Even in the west , as the PlayStation 2 drew closer the Dreamcast lost momentum .
It was at this point that the legacy of SEGA 's worthless Megadrive expansions and the fumbled Saturn came back to haunt the company .
In what would become a grim self - fulfilling prophecy , many punters were understandably quicker to put their cash towards the established and widely loved PlayStation brand rather than risk ending up with another SEGA system with few games and no long - term future .
In the face of such competition , the Dreamcast 's technical features proved of little value .
SEGA , arguably about five years ahead of its time , had gambled on the importance of online play but console gamers in 2000 were a lot less interested in networked games than their PC counterparts .
Back then , MMORPG was just a really bad handful of Scrabble tiles , so a pioneering effort like Phantasy Star Online just was n't what joypad lovers were looking for .
With the PlayStation 2 doubling as a DVD player , a desirable technology that had just tipped over into mass - market must - have status , the ability to play Chu Chu Rocket over the internet was n't likely to turn the tide in Dreamcast 's favour .
As the PS2 sold more and more on its epic ten - year journey to become the world 's best - selling games console , Dreamcast sales dried up .
In March 2001 , a mere two years after the Dreamcast 's impressive US launch , SEGA announced that not only was it discontinuing production on the console , but it was withdrawing from the hardware side of the industry altogether .
The words " end of an era " do n't even begin to cover it .
One of the DC 's best , but by now it was too late .
If you want a snapshot of how fast the Dreamcast died then consider the fact that in June 2001 , only a few months after becoming a software - only publisher , SEGA released Crazy Taxi for the PS2 .
By Christmas you could pick up a brand new Dreamcast , plus a game , for less than GBP 70 .
And in June 2003 , SEGA finally switched off almost all the Dreamcast servers , with only Phantasy Star Online kept alive on digital life support .
It seemed that the last embers of SEGA 's hardware empire had finally sputtered out .
The story does n't quite end there though .
Despite being pronounced dead , the Dreamcast lived on in Japan - the nation so underwhelmed by it at launch - long past its official expiration date .
Shops still sold the console until as recently as 2006 , and new software is still being produced today by the indie community - albeit sporadically .
For reasons that may never be fully understood , the Japanese shoot - 'em - up fraternity decided that the Dreamcast was the place to be , giving the system a stay of execution with cult favourites like Ikaruga hitting in 2002 and Triggerheart Exelica in 2007 .
It 's not exactly a new lease of life , but it 's certainly a testament to the appeal of the sleek white brick .
At least SEGA the console maker went out on a high - in critical terms if not commercial .
It was petite , stylish and many of the ideas it pioneered have since become standard features for the current console generation .
SEGA was certainly visionary in its championing of an online future , while the connectivity between the Dreamcast and its VMU was but a taster of the cross - platform content sharing now at the heart of the PS3 and PSP , and the Wii and DS .
For Japanese gamers , the Dreamcast was the first console to have its own digital camera , and the first to feature a karaoke game with microphone peripherals .
With the separate VGA adaptor and 60 Hz PAL capability it was even , technically speaking , one of the first HD consoles , even if it could only muster 480 p resolution .
So much of what the Dreamcast offered forms the core of the console wars today , and yet at the time nobody seemed bothered .
Off the hook .
The Dreamcast was arguably the right console at the wrong time , but who struck the killer blow ?
Probably not Sony , although it's hard to begrudge Dreamcast fans their lingering resentment that a technologically inferior console with a fairly dire line - up of early titles was able to so easily steamroller their beloved box just on the basis of brand loyalty .
Sony certainly did its best to spoil the Dreamcast launch with its carefully timed PS2 announcement , and can therefore perhaps take a hefty chunk of the blame for the console 's limp performance in Japan , but to say that Sony killed the Dreamcast would be a gross overstatement .
Ditto for Electronic Arts .
Its lack of support for the system was merely a symptom of the real problem rather than the cause .
The Dreamcast simply came too late in SEGA 's hardware decline to reverse a long - running downward trend .
For all its technological innovations and excellent games , SEGA 's misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name .
Confidence in any new SEGA console was low , and with the PlayStation brand in the ascendancy such trepidation was enough to ensure that the Dreamcast would always struggle to maintain its early momentum in the face of stiff competition .
Even if it had shipped with a champagne fountain and a nozzle that fired a constant stream of chocolate and diamonds into the player 's lap , it seems likely that many potential owners would still have adopted a " wait and see " attitude .
The Dreamcast died and , perversely , in doing so it may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever .
Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise , especially when so much potential is left unfulfilled .
There 's a reason why few people get misty - eyed for the Saturn , but are inspired to passionate defence and blissful nostalgia by the Dreamcast .
It 's not the technology , or even the brand .
It 's the games .
With that in mind , we 've come up with a rundown of the best of the bunch , and of course our own Dreamcast Cult Classics .
Wray Herbert reports research showing that a sense of power gives people the illusion of control over random events :
One recent study may offer some insight into the connection between power and hubris and delusional thinking .
Stanford University psychologist Nathanael
Fast actually started off exploring the positive effects of power .
His idea was that power creates a false sense of control over life ’s events , and that this feeling of control in turn boosts self - esteem and optimism .
But his findings apply just as well to prideful overconfidence .
Here ’s the experiment :
Fast and his colleagues used a well - tested laboratory technique to prime some volunteers ’ sense of power .
Then they used a clever test to see if these feelings of power influenced their sense of control over random events .
They had all the volunteers play a dice game to see if they could win a prize , and they were allowed to either roll the dice themselves or to let someone else roll the dice .
A roll of dice is random , no matter who rolls them , so those who chose to roll the dice were displaying an unrealistic sense of control over random events .
The results were unambiguous .
As reported in the journal Psychological Science , each and every one of the volunteers who was primed for power ( compared to controls who were not ) grabbed the dice .
They had the delusional belief that , by rolling the dice themselves , they could control the outcome .
Earlier this week , Ethan Trex taught us the history of shaving .
Several readers left comments inquiring about when women started shaving their legs and underarms , so we cracked open the mental_floss book In the Beginning : The Origins of Everything .
Here 's what we learned :
Underarms
American women had no need to shave their underarms before about 1915 " “ after all , who ever saw them ?
Even the word " underarm "  was considered scandalous , what with it being so near certain other interesting body parts .
Then came the sleeveless dress .
An ad in the fashion mag Harper 's Bazaar decreed that to wear it ( and certainly to wear it while participating in " Modern Dancing "  ) , women would need to first see to " the removal of objectionable hair . " 
They did n't need much convincing , and by the early ' 20s , hairy underarms were so last decade , at least in America .
Legs
The ' 20s fashion was risqué on the bottom half , too , but most women of the era did n't seem to feel the need to shave their legs , and when hemlines dropped again in the '30s , the point became moot .
The '40s , however , brought even shorter skirts , sheerer stockings , and the rise of leggy pin-ups such as Betty Grable .
" The removal of objectionable hair "  suddenly applied to a lot more surface area .
Naughty Bits
Was it porn actresses who started this one ?
GIs concerned about disease ?
The Brazilians ?
Nah .
For hundreds of years , the bikini wax has been a common practice among a group more often associated with extreme modesty : Muslim women .
In much of the Middle East and North Africa , brides - to - be remove all their body hair before the wedding night .
Yes , all of it .
Frequently , they stick with the aesthetic after marriage " “ and some men do likewise .
You can pick up a copy of ' In the Beginning ' in the mental_floss store .
LOAD OF RUBBISH : Olivia Jones is one of many Huntly people who fell prey to an inorganic rubbish collection hoax .
Dozens of Huntly households have been duped by a hoax flier promoting an inorganic rubbish collection in the town , leaving some of its streets covered in junk .
Yesterday the corner of Rayner Rd and Croft Tce , in Huntly East , looked like Steptoe 's yard with broken TVs , a clothesline , a rusted wheelbarrow , carpet offcuts , clapped - out car seats , wooden doors , a vacuum cleaner and even a dog - eared scuba diving manual piled up on the grass verge .
And the Croft Tce kerbside littered with a disused toilet , broken microwave , and toy slide was spouting more rubbish than a parliamentary backbencher .
Problem is , Waikato District Council does its annual inorganic rubbish collection in November , and has no intention of removing this load of old rubbish .
Residents were prompted to create this magnificent display of kerbside junk by a " Midwinter Inorganic Rubbish Collection " flier fraudulently using Waikato District Council 's colour logo and signed by a non-existent CH Burrows which was distributed to letterboxes in parts of Huntly over the weekend .
The council is urging Huntly residents to disregard the false flier and remove their rubbish from the kerbside as soon as possible , while it attempts to find out who was behind the flier .
" We are running a mid-winter inorganic rubbish collection covering the whole of the Huntly area , " the forged flier said , advising that rubbish could be placed on the kerbside from Saturday , August 15 , with the collection starting on August 25 .
" A good chance to clean up around the house , " the flier enthused .
" All inorganic forms of rubbish will be collected , old fridges , stoves , car parts , corrugated iron , timber , carpet etc . "
Council chief executive Gavin Ion was concerned that residents had been misled , but said his staff would not be removing the junk .
" The council does not endorse this inorganic collection . "
There is no CH Burrows on the council 's staff or ratepayer register .
Just as annoyed was Croft Tce resident Olivia Jones .
" Our family spent all day clearing out our junk , " she said .
" What a stupid prank . "
Mr Ion said the stunt had come out of the blue .
" Whoever it is , they must be aiming to get something out of it .
They may be looking to take what they want and leave the rest .
" The problem is someone will have to clean up afterwards . "

[ HTML2 ] Now , you may not realize this , but during my day job I ’m constantly sifting through media reports .
Gargantuan PDFs or documents that contain a series of clipped links and snippets about specific clients or subjects .
The reports are unwieldy at best .
And I can only imagine what kind of workload this effort creates for the agencies that compile them for me — and any number of other clients — on a daily basis .
Long story short , the whole “ tracking media coverage ” thing — whether for PR firms or otherwise — could use some help .
And do n’t even get me started on the whole social media angle .
But now , there may be hope .
You see , Portland - based Iterasi might have an answer with their latest effort .
Introducing PositivePress from Iterasi .
[ Editor :
In the interest of full disclosure , I have been a paid consultant for Iterasi in the past .
Some of that consultation was related to PositivePress .
I was not involved in the launch or promotion of the product . ]
You may remember Iterasi as the service that I touted as “ giving you your own personal Wayback Machine . ”
That functionality showed a great deal of promise — but it did n’t promise a great deal of revenue .
So the folks at Iterasi decided to retool a bit , finding an application for their technology that solved a particular business need .
An application that also had the potential for supporting a “ for pay ” model .
The result of that retooling ?
Iterasi ’s archiving technology seemed perfectly suited for media coverage .
So with PositivePress they ’ve taken on the effort of fixing the whole media coverage tracking problem .
How ?
By giving public relations types a simple way to track terms and topics and create agency - branded client consumable reports with a few simple clicks .
And its those reports that Josh Lowensohn of CNET sees as the high - point for PositivePress :
These reports are one of the areas where PositivePress shines .
The service lets users brand these to match their company .
It also tracks how many people have viewed it and who originally put it together , meaning that if it ’s stuck into an e-mail , the creator knows how many people have seen it while he or she gets the credit for making it .
How does the content get in there ?
Well , I know the data geeks around here will be happy to hear that — unlike its original manually controlled tool — Iterasi is using RSS feeds as the mechanism to feed its archiving engine .
Simply point PositivePress at an RSS feed and it will archive anything and everything in that feed — and it will continue to do so every time the feed changes .
We really did n’t have to look too far to find the best method to monitor and capture interesting stories on the Web.
Real Simple Syndication ( RSS ) is both simple and ubiquitous .
It is simple in that it exists on virtually every news source , blog , search engine and social media source .
Most browsers identify RSS feeds automatically .
RSS has emerged as the de-facto technology used throughout the Internet to pass information .
Think of RSS as the silk that makes the Internet into a Web .
From simple tools like browser - based readers to complex programming tools like Yahoo Pipes , RSS is the answer to subscribing to information flow in the Open Web .
Not an RSS savant or aspiring to be the next Marshall Kirkpatrick ?
That ’s okay .
PositivePress has a wizard that will help you get the RSS feeds into the product quickly and easily .
Tracking temperamental Twitter
It seems interesting that on the same day that ReTweet is waging war on Tweetmeme , we have a local company entering the fray with a product that promises to change the way people look at the conversations and shared links on Twitter .
Yes , yes .
Tracking Twitter is all the rage with the kids these days .
And in talking to Pete Grillo , Iterasi ’s CEO , it ’s clearly that Twitter archiving feature of which the Iterasi folks are most proud .
What ’s it do ?
Well , the Twitter archiver works just like the other options , archiving tweets as they arrive .
But here ’s the interesting thing .
If you ’ve got a link in that tweet ?
PositivePress will go out and archive that page as well .
Not only that , but it will associate the archived tweet and the archived page , so that you ’ve got some connective tissue there , relating the two .
Why is that a big deal ?
Well , anyone who has used Twitter realizes that it can be a little temperamental at times .
Tweets randomly disappear .
Search is limited in its scope .
Many historical tweets are completely inaccessible .
Well , and then there ’s always the FAIL whale .
And that says nothing of the links that are being shared and shrunk and whatnot .
Those pages are equally here today , gone tomorrow .
So what we ’ve got today is a fairly unreliable anecdotal record of the word of mouth conversations that are occurring on Twitter .
What good is that ?
Well , it ’s a lot of good today .
But not so much tomorrow .
And even less the next day .
With PositivePress archiving the tweet and any other related pages , we may be getting close to an accessible historical record of what ’s actually happening on Twitter .
That promises some pretty interesting analysis and whatnot .
And for as much interest as corporations have in tracking what ’s said about them on Twitter , that PositivePress Twitter feature may prove to be a very big deal .
We ’ll just have to wait and see .
Current Iterasi user ?
Things just got Personal
While mucking around with their new product , Iterasi spent some time retooling their original product .
It ’s now called Iterasi Personal .
And a few things have changed .
The most noticeable change ?
No more bookmark importing .
We have also removed ‘ Import Bookmarks ’ as an option .
This feature costs us a lot in terms of bandwidth and performance and was getting limited use .
It may reappear but , frankly put , it requires too much horsepower to be given away for free .
So if it reappears it will most likely be as part of a monthly - subscription product .
But there ’s also some tweaks to the interface which should improve the usability of the site .
And hopefully , those will carry with them some performance improvements , as well .
So carry on with your archiving .
As you were .
Are you getting PositivePress ?

Editor 's note :
This report is part two of a two - part series .
TAMPA , Florida ( CNN ) --
For Rick Kelly , the first sign of cancer was a feeling of discomfort in his chest .
Jim Fontella , diagnosed with cancer in 1998 , was based at Camp Lejeune in 1966 - 67 .
Read his story in Part 1 .
" My wife would hug me , and it became almost unbearable , " he said .
" I went to a doctor , and they sent me to the oncologist , and they did biopsies on both sides .
And then I ended up with a double mastectomy . "
Kelly is one of 20 retired U.S. Marines or sons of Marines who once lived at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , and who are now suffering from breast cancer , a disease that strikes about one man for every 100 women who get it .
Each of the seven men CNN interviewed for this report has had part of his chest removed as part of his treatment , along with chemotherapy , radiation or both .
All 20 fear that water contaminated with high levels of toxic chemicals may have caused their illnesses , but the Marine Corps says no link has been found between the contamination and their diseases .
Without that link , the men are denied treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs , which says it can't treat them for a condition that has n't been shown to have been " service - related . "
Watch " That 's when I was shocked " »
Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998 , 16 years after he served at Camp Lejeune .
Now a single father of a 7 - year - old boy and without health insurance , he filed a claim with the VA to help pay his medical bills .
Kelly said his VA representative told him , " It 's not the VA 's problem , it 's the Marine Corps ' problem . "
Watch Marine Corps general respond to some of the allegations »
And Peter Devereaux , who was stationed at Camp Lejeune in the early 1980s , was told in writing that his breast cancer " neither occurred in nor was caused by service . "
But Kelly , Devereaux and other stricken men CNN interviewed say the Marine Corps knew about the contamination in tap water years before it shut down tainted wells in the mid-1980s .
Now they want the service to acknowledge that the water from those wells made them sick , which could make them eligible for VA benefits .
" They want it to go away , and it kind of just makes you sick with disgust , " Devereaux said .
The men with breast cancer are among about 1,600 retired Marines and Camp Lejeune residents who have filed claims against the federal government .
According to congressional investigators , they are seeking nearly $ 34 billion in compensation for health problems they say stemmed from drinking water at the base that was contaminated with several toxic chemicals , including some the federal government has classified as known or potential cancer - causing agents .
Jerry Ensminger is a former Marine Corps drill instructor who was stationed at the base in 1976 , when his daughter , Janey , was born .
She died of childhood leukemia at age 9 .
" We were being exposed when we went bowling , " Ensminger told CNN .
" We were being exposed when we went to the commissary .
We were being exposed when we went to the PX .
And then when we went home , we were being exposed over there . "
Ensminger helped start a Web site , " The Few , The Proud , The Forgotten , " which was set up to organize people who believe they have been affected by the contamination .
He also testified at a 2007 congressional hearing on the issue .
He and others say the Marine Corps waited too long to test and shut down the wells after learning the drinking water was contaminated .
" Five years they knew they had this stuff in the tap water , " Ensminger said .
" They never went and tested the wells .
I think it 's just criminal . "
In 1980 , the Navy hired experts to test for trihalomethanes , a byproduct from chlorination , in the base tap water .
The experts reported that some of the base tap water was " highly contaminated , " according to a test report .
In 1981 , the lab again found " water highly contaminated " -- and added the word " solvents , " with an exclamation point .
In August 1982 , the experts found one sample with levels of trichloroethylene , a degreaser believed to cause cancer , of 1,400 parts per billion .
Today 's EPA safe level for the substance is five parts per billion .
" We 've never seen 1,400 parts per billion of trichloroethylene , so that is very high , " said Frank Bove , an epidemiologist with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry .
" These are very toxic chemicals we 're talking about , " Bove said .
But it would take until late 1984 and early 1985 for the Corps to begin widespread testing of wells on the base and shutting down ones that had been polluted .
In addition to trichloroethylene , chemicals eventually identified in the drinking water included benzene , which the federal government identifies as a known cancer - causing agent ; and the dry - cleaning solvent perchloroethylene , a suspected carcinogen .
The Marine Corps said two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses .
And in a statement to CNN , the Marine Corps wrote , " Once impacted wells were identified , they were promptly removed from service . "
A fact - finding panel created by the Corps in 2004 ruled that officials acted properly and that the water was " consistent with general industry practices " at the time .
And investigations by the Bush administration 's Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency found no criminal conduct by Marine Corps officials and no violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act .
Tyler Amon , an EPA investigator , told a House committee in 2007 that some employees interviewed during the criminal investigation appeared coached and were not forthcoming with details .
The Justice Department decided against filing charges based on his concern , however .
The Corps told CNN that its actions " must be considered in the context of the state of science at the time " and should be viewed with a " contemporary understanding " of the chemicals involved and the " evolving regulatory structure " of the time .
But while chemical solvents may not have been tightly regulated back then , there was a clear general awareness on base about the need for proper handling .
In June 1974 , the base commander issued an order calling for the " safe disposal " of organic solvents , warning that improper disposal could create " hazards " such as " contamination of drinking water . "
And as far back as 1963 , the Navy 's Bureau of Medicine outlined similar guidelines .
Two years ago , Congress ordered the Marine Corps to notify all Marines and their families who might have been exposed -- an estimated 500,000 people .
The Marines say they have worked with environmental and health agencies " from the beginning " to determine whether the contamination resulted in any illness , and " this collaboration continues to the present day . "
" I think if cancer of the breast in men or other kinds of cancer have been linked to this exposure , that we ought to know about that , " said Richard Clapp , a nationally recognized epidemiologist who has studied clusters of cancer cases at toxic sites .
" The families deserve that .
The veterans themselves should know about that , and they should be compensated if the link can be made . "
But for now , there is no proven link -- just Marines and their families who say they are suffering .
" Having been a former drill instructor where I trained over 2,000 brand new civilians and made them into Marines , I instilled in those Marines our motto , which is Semper Fidelis -- our slogan , that we take care of our own , " Ensminger said .
" Nobody in this world has been more disillusioned than I 've been .
I feel like I 've been betrayed . "

TOGLIATTI , Russia ( Reuters ) - AvtoVAZ will slash its workforce by a quarter in the face of the plunging demand that has pushed Russia ’s largest carmaker to the edge of bankruptcy , the company ’s chief executive said on Thursday .
AvtoVAZ , part - owned by French car maker Renault , has agreed with trade union leaders to shed upto 27,600 jobs at its plant on the Volga river , where the Lada has been produced since Soviet times .
“ Our plant is in a critical financial condition , ” AvtoVAZ Chief Executive Igor Komarov told a local television channel .
“ Losses for 2009 will be 35 billion roubles ( $ 1.2 billion ) , which raises serious questions about our ability to keep running in the future , ” he said .
“ Our main goal is to avoid bankruptcy , which could lead to the plant being sold off in pieces . ”
Sales of new cars in Russia fell 54 percent year on year in August , scuppering Russia ’s hopes of overtaking Germany as Europe ’s biggest car market this year .
The Association of European Businesses expects 1.4 million cars to be sold in Russia this year , down from 3.2 million in 2008 .
The AvtoVAZ cuts , which follow mass protests in the city of Togliatti , are the latest challenge to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in his attempts to keep a lid on simmering unrest in one - factory towns hit by Russia ’s first recession in a decade .
In March , Putin ordered 25 billion roubles in state funds to be disbursed to AvtoVAZ and asked state banks to provide bridging loans of another 8 billion roubles .
“ We have been granted a 25 billion rouble loan which allowed us to live through the summer , pay salaries and debts , but I am sure that support in the same form will not be given to us again , ” Komarov said .
“ You know perfectly well that many consider AvtoVAZ a black hole . ”
Its Moscow - traded stock closed down 5.75 percent , while the wider MICEX index ended the day down 1.80 percent .
JOB CUTS
AvtoVAZ , also part - owned by state conglomerate Russian Technologies , has halved salaries and reduced the working week at the plant in Togliatti , a city 900 km ( 560 miles ) southeast of Moscow built in the 1960s to serve the car plant .
“ The enterprise is working on one shift and at 65 percent of capacity .
Cutting personnel is essential in such a situation , ” AvtoVAZ , which employs 102,000 people , said in a statement .
“ It ’s hard to find another job in Togliatti .
AvtoVAZ is everything for this town , and nobody is waiting for us in other cities , ” said assembly line worker Alexander Afanasyev .
Aton analyst Mikhail Pak estimated that AvtoVAZ could save approximately 8 billion roubles ( $ 266.7 million ) a year by cutting its workforce by 27,600 .
Unemployment in Russia has eased in recent months , falling to 6.2 million , or 8.1 percent of the workforce , in August from 6.3 million in July .
But analysts have warned job losses might rise again as companies plan autumn layoffs .
About 2,000 workers protested in Togliatti last month , demanding the state nationalise the car plant .
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov has called for special measures to save jobs .
AvtoVAZ said those to be dismissed would include 13,000 pensioners , who are expected to leave in September or October , as well as 5,500 people approaching pensionable age .
The company said around 6,000 of the 9,100 younger workers to be laid off “ would once again be required ” from the start of 2012 , when AvtoVAZ and Renault plan to launch a joint project .
Rumors that Radio Shack was going to rebrand themselves as " The Shack " appear to be true .
In fact , the switchover is officially slated to begin tomorrow .

To celebrate the event , as rumored in Remainders a few days ago , The Shack is holding a " Shack Summer Netogether " from August 6th - 8th involving two 17 - foot laptops placed in Times Square in NYC and Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco .
Equipped with webcams , the two gigantic screens will stream live video and audio to each other from 3000 miles apart .

Will dropping the archaic " Radio " from their title help to boost a sinking franchise ?
We shall see — although it does n't seem like Radio Shack has a prayer of becoming hip .
It 's kind of like your grandfather getting an earring or something .

LAS VEGAS – For the last four years DefCon 's badges have been designed with circuit boards that attendees have been encouraged to hack as part of a contest .
This year , the badge hackers were competing to win a black über badge , which gives the recipient free entry to DefCon for life .
The contest badges were embedded with a microphone and digital signal processor connected to a full - color LED .
The LED flashed and changed color in sync with the level and frequency of ambient sound .
About 30 contestants participated this year .
Many of them spent days working on their creations using tools they brought with them or that were provided to them in the conference 's hardware hacking area .
One contestant named Ben , who asked that his last name not be mentioned , created a frequency meter that he dubbed " the 15 output FFT . "
His badge uses a fast Fourier transform algorithm to compute the input frequency , which it then displays by lighting up one of the 15 LEDs .
One team of contestants , who called themselves " Optimized Tom Foolery , " modified their badge with a Geiger counter - based random number generator with a wireless link .
As the Geiger counter detected radiation , the badge used the sound ticks from it to generate random numbers , which were sent wirelessly via a Zigbee radio to a laptop .
The number of random numbers generated varied depending on the amount of radiation detected by the Geiger counter .
One group of contestants , who achieved runner - up status , designed a badge - propelled blimp .
The balloon was powered by three badges attached to motors .
The dirigible used the built - in microphones on the badges to home in on the loudest source of sound and fly toward it .
But none of these ingenious hacks could beat the winner of the contest who used an array of LEDs soldered into a baseball cap to thwart facial recognition systems .
His plan , theoretically , was to use the cap to sneak into the room of Joe " Kingpin " Grand – the designer of DefCon 's badges – and steal the black über badges stored in his room .
This year , the DefCon badge was n't the only electronic badge at the conference .
Ninja Networks , which throws a popular party each year at the conference , produced an electronic badge of its own to gain access to its party .
Over 500 badges were made by hand .
The badges featured ten segmented LED displays , four buttons and several microchips on the back .
Once powered on , the LED 's blinked random , scrambled letters that froze to form the words " NINJA PARTY " after 100 seconds .
The badge was also programmed with a game of Simon - Says .
Owners could alter random segments of the badge 's memory through a keypad on the badge .
The badges were created by Amanda Wozniak , who designed the circuitry , and Brandon Creighton , who wrote the badge firmware .
Most of the work on the badges was completed in Boston before the conference , but workers scrambled to finish some of the final soldering in their DefCon hotel room in the days before the party .

Bush Administration Actions that Weakened USDA Organic Label
Concern has been raised recently about the integrity of the USDA organic label .
Non-organic additives have been allowed in USDA organic labeled products , and consumer groups and Congress are concerned .
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) explains , “ It will unravel everything we ’ve done if the standards can no longer be trusted .
If we do n’t protect the brand , the organic label , the program is finished .
It could disappear overnight . ”
The Obama administration has pledged to “ protect the label ” , but under the Bush administration several directives weakened organic standards .
The Washington Post describes some of the non-organic additives that are allowed under the weakened USDA organic label :
Grated organic cheese , for example , contains wood starch to prevent clumping .
Organic beer can be made from non-organic hops .
Organic mock duck contains a synthetic ingredient that gives it an authentic , stringy texture .
How did these additives enter the organic market ?
As large food corporations have bought up smaller organic labels , lobbyists have pressured the USDA .
Repeatedly , the Bush administration caved into demands to weaken organic standards .
The National Organic Program ’s ( NOP ) director Barbara Robinson “ overruled staff who had determined that omega - 3 DHA and ARA oils should not be approved in organic production ” of infant formula .
Instead of decreasing the number of non-organic additives , as intended by the original law , “ That list has grown from 77 to 245 substances since it was created in 2002 . ”
“ Optional ” pesticide testing has never been implemented .
Antibiotic use is allowed in organic dairy cows “ with zero input from the public or the National Organic Standards Board “ .
Antibiotics can be used on sickly cows , whose milk still qualifies as organic if 12 months have passed since the antibiotic use .
Cattle ranchers can feed cows non-organic fish meal that may contain PCBs , mercury , and preservatives and still qualify the meat as organic .
A legal directive was issued allowing “ some synthetic pesticides on organic farms “ .
Organic certification was limited to just livestock and crops , while ignoring the development of organic standards for “ fish , nutritional supplements , pet food , fertilizers , cosmetics , and personal - care products . ”
Director Robinson “ opted not to issue standards spelling out how organic food must be grown , treated or produced , ” and she failed to act on 65 recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board .
“ Access to pasture ” was not clarified or interpreted allowing organic dairy farmers to use feedlots .
Several of these directives were rescinded by Bush ’s agriculture secretary Ann Veneman , but concern over the weakened organic label has not gone away .
The Cornucopia Institute ’s senior farm policy analyst Mark A. Kastel explains :
The stewardship of the organic program at the USDA has been an absolute abomination .
It was not just management by neglect — it was an intentional monkeywrenching of the Department ’s oversight of the industry …
The Washington Post investigative story is a scathing indictment of the National Organic Program ’s current director , Barbara Robinson .
The example of her overruling professional staff at the NOP , by allowing synthetic , gimmicky additives to be included in organic baby food , after a phone call from a powerful Washington lobbyist , is absolutely reprehensible .
President Lincoln called the US Department of Agriculture the “ People ’s Department “ .
Hopefully Obama ’s secretary Vilsack will restore the integrity of the USDA organic label .

It 's the wardrobe malfunction to end them all .
Italian Olympic swimmer Flavia Zoccari was forced to sit out a championship race at the Mediterranean Games yesterday after her bathing costume burst open in a very unfortunate place .
Flavia , 22 , was wearing the controversial £ 318 top - of - the - line Jaked J01 swimsuit when disaster struck at the Games in Pescara , Italy ...
She burst into tears as she was forced to stand down from her race .
Jaked boasts that the full - body swimsuit - complete with back hinge - is ' more than skin ' .
However the aerodynamic costume has been the subject of controversy after it was banned by FINA ( the International Swimming Federation ) earlier this year because it gave swimmers wearing it an unfair advantage .
FINA lifted the ban on the swimsuit a month later , in June of this year , after Jaked , which sponsors the Italian national swim team , protested the ban .
Zoccari - who is nearly six feet tall - later apologised for the embarrassing incident .
A teenager has been detained for three months in a young offenders ' institution for harassing a woman on social networking website Facebook .
Keeley Houghton swore at and threatened Emily Moore in person and on the internet in July , Worcester Magistrates '
Court heard .
The 18 - year - old of Elgar Avenue , in Malvern , Worcestershire , admitted a charge of harassment on 31 July .
She was also given a five - year restraining order .
Houghton is prohibited from contacting Ms Moore , or commenting about her on any social networking system or website during that time .
' Tackle bullying '
Emma -Jane Cross , chief executive of charity Beatbullying , said the sentencing was the first of its kind in the UK .
She said although cyber - bullying is increasing , the government , networking sites like Facebook and charities should work together to tackle the problem of bullying generally .
" Today 's sentencing of an 18 - year - old girl for cyber - bullying is the first of its kind in the UK and sets an important precedent , " she said .
" Cyber - bullying is a worrying and fast - growing trend which can be more harmful than typical schoolyard bullying .
" However , the solution is not to limit young people 's internet access and phone usage .
" Instead , social networking sites like Facebook , along with the Government and charities like Beatbullying , must work together to tackle the real root of the problem - the bullying itself . "
You ’d think that Côte des Neiges and Notre Dame de Grâce , being so young , urban , working - class and eco-friendly , would have lots of bike paths spread across its huge territory .
And yet , when you look at a map , you see only one , along de Maisonneuve Blvd .
next to the tracks .
So I ’m sure plenty of people got excited when they heard last Friday that the borough is working to vastly improve its bike path network , adding a new east - west corridor on the north side , about where the 51 bus travels .
It would start from the western end of the de Maisonneuve path , go up West Broadway , east along Fielding and Isabella , then along Lacombe and Édouard - Montpetit until it reaches the Outremont town limit , where it will link up with the new path along Côte - Sainte - Catherine Rd .
Well , almost .
You see , looking at the map ( French - only PDF ) , you see this strange grey zone with a grey bike path in the middle .
That ’s the town of Hampstead , and the grey bar in the middle seems to indicate that there will be a bike path of some sort on Ellerdale Rd. Except Hampstead has n’t announced any such path .
( A city representative had no idea of such a thing being approved . )
View New bike paths in CDN / NDG in a larger map
The new network is n’t perfect ( notably lacking in north - south routes ) , but it ’s a start .
The only thing is , none of these are bike paths .
They ’re , at best , bike lanes , meaning painted lines on the asphalt .
In the Google map above :
Red lines indicate shared roads , meaning there ’s no actual path , just some bike icons painted on the road .
Cars and bikes are expected to share the road , just as they do on every other road in the city .

Cars and bikes are expected to share the road , just as they do on every other road in the city .
Orange lines indicate bike lanes between traffic and parked cars .
These are both annoying and dangerous , creating the perfect conditions for cyclists getting hit in the face by the driver - side door of a parked car .

These are both annoying and dangerous , creating the perfect conditions for cyclists getting hit in the face by the driver - side door of a parked car .
Yellow lines indicate bike lanes next to the sidewalk , where parking has either been removed or was n’t there to begin with .
These are much more tolerable than the other two , but still are n’t as safe as isolated paths .
These contrast with the path on Côte Sainte - Catherine , which is isolated from traffic with a median .
De Maisonneuve missing link is a death trap
Meanwhile , in case you missed it , the borough finally took a step a while back toward solving the missing link on de Maisonneuve Blvd .
Before , the path would mysteriously end in a U - turn just before Decarie Blvd. , only to reappear when it enters Westmount .
Cyclists wanting to take both paths would have to navigate around busy intersections and lots of moving buses , all because nobody thought to connect the two .
The ideal solution would have been to continue running the path along the tracks , where it would n’t have to deal with traffic .
Unfortunately , that would require expanding the overpasses over Upper Lachine and Decarie , and finding a way to squeeze it in next to the Vendôme train station .
( UPDATE : Fortunately , as James points out in the comments below , this is exactly the plan when the new superhospital is built sometime in the year 3577 . )
So instead , the borough just painted a bunch of lines on the ground .
Allow me to explain with pictures , starting from the West .
The bike path between the tracks and de Maisonneuve Blvd. is n’t fantastic .
At best you ’ll have some poles keeping the traffic away .
But on the plus side , there ’s no crossing traffic so your trip is uninterrupted .
Heading east , the first thing that happens is this extremely abrupt left turn , which I estimate at somewhere between 100 and 110 degrees .
More importantly , the turning radius is tiny , especially on the westbound side .
This is a recipe for bikes colliding with each other .
Assuming you make it out of that alive , you now have to cross de Maisonneuve Blvd .
( you ’ll have to cross back a block later ) .
This crossing is confusing , partly because of the patchwork of asphalt , partly because of the faded paint , and partly because instead of going on the right side of the median , cyclists are supposed to go on the left ( with traffic ) .
This means that cyclists actually cross each other here , even if they ’re not exactly made aware of that .
These things might be contributing to the fact that I did n’t see any cyclists actually making those two sharp turns .
Instead , most went diagonally and crossed when there was a break in traffic .
Looking east , other than the strangeness of driving on the left , everything seems routine here .
The uphill climb heading west is certainly straightforward .
But heading east , the bike path disappears as the road becomes two ways .
They do n’t have much of a choice here , there ’s simply not enough room for two lanes of traffic and a bike lane , so they have to share .
Then it becomes confusing .
Not only is there no path , but there ’s no indication anywhere at the route you ’re supposed to take .
Archeologists studying this area might eventually conclude that there was once a short bike lane here , but it has long faded away .
Again , it ’s not clear , but you ’re supposed to make a left turn from this lane back onto de Maisonneuve Blvd. , returning to its southern side .
There ’s no light for this , of course , so cyclists just kind of do what they want .
For some , they ’ll cross one way and then cross the other .
Some might follow the green light like other traffic ( even though they ’d be turning left from the right lane ) , and some jut wait until a break in traffic and cut across diagonally .
Right away , you ’re met with pothole hell if you ’re not paying attention .
If you survive that , you face the gauntlet , sandwiched between speeding drivers on the left and parked cars or waiting taxis on the right , with the occasional jaywalking pedestrian thrown in randomly .
When you reach the bus stops at Vendôme , the lane disappears .
From the odd dotted line here , I guess it means this lane is some sort of bus stop / bike lane combo .
It ’s not clear what that means if a bus is parked in the lane .
Do you go on the left , trying to squeeze in between a bus and car traffic , do you wait until the bus pulls away , or do you hop on the sidewalk ?
Finally , once you get to Claremont , you ’re placed in the warm , comforting hands of a separated bike path , and you thank your lucky stars you ’ve entered Westmount .
From now on , you think , I ’m in a place that actually cares about cyclists and their safety , and does n’t use awkward shortcuts to get around problems .
NDG ’s paths are a step in the right direction , but the borough still has a long way to go before it can call itself bike - friendly .
UPDATE ( June 10 ) : The Suburban ’s cover story this week is about NIMBY OUTRAGE that ( some ) street parking is being sacrificed in order to construct this bike path .
They simultaneously argue that their businesses are doomed and that these streets are too dangerous for cyclists anyway .
The borough passes the buck like a hot potato to Montreal city hall , and there ’s talk of possibly rerouting the path from Isabella to a neighbouring street .
6 Reasons Why You Never Need
to Win an Argument
Winning an argument is always tempting .
Who does n’t want to be right ?
Have the last word ?
Be the meanest and sharpest and smartest with their words ?
Be victorious !
Not feeling it ?
Argument is usually corrosive to healthy relationships , and here are six reasons why you never need to win one :
1 . You can never technically “ win ”
Presidential debates stir up the media , and people love to vote on which candidate performed better .
But in the end , neither candidate wins — because there are no judges , no standards , no rules .
The country may have voted in one candidate ’s favor — but loyal supporters of the opponent will hold strongly to their version of how victory went down .
So when you argue with someone and you think you can win or that you have won… think about it more carefully .
Even if you make better points and counter each of theirs — that does n’t mean you ’ll convince them that you won .
More likely , it means that they ’ll get even more upset because you shut them down , or worse — they ’ll avoid you , resent you , or be passive aggressive in revenge .
2. Arguing perpetuates conflict
For the same reasons that no one wins an argument , arguing only adds more tension to conflict .
If you work well with your emotions and are crafty enough , you can shift arguments into meaningful , intimate , constructive conversations .
But most of the time , arguments just turn things into bigger problems and you end up saying what you do n’t really mean .
You end up miscommunicating your feelings because you decided to use your words as weapons , instead of magic .
3 . The legal system is based on arbitration
Most of time , you can solve your problems with other people directly .
For more serious interpersonal disputes , you can hire a lawyer , who ’s trained to defend your legal rights .
But even then , your lawyer ’s not going to war , but to court .
Where a jury decides who ’s right .
Whether or not that jury is “ right ” is a whole different story .
The point is , the jury makes the decision — because it is n’t directly involved in the argument .
So the most serious interpersonal disputes are resolved through arbitration , not argument .
4 . No one can argue against feelings
Your feelings exist whether or not someone tries to argue them into nonexistence .
When someone does n’t like hearing what you think … and what you feel — let them .
They have a right to their own opinion .
They have a right to not be considerate of you in that moment .
They have a right to only think for themself .
They can try to argue against your feelings , by telling you that you should n’t have them , you ’re being unreasonable , your being illogical or irrational , you ’re too sensitive , or you ’re overreacting .
They can try all they want — but just because they argue does n’t mean they win ( remember # 1 ) .
What would they win anyway ?
Completely invalidating you ?
They can give you cause to feel invalidated by arguing against your feelings .
But if you hold your personal boundaries and do n’t argue back ( simply healthily deflect back ) , you ’ve won .
You ’ve held your ground .
You ’ve not let them sway you .
It ’s when you argue back , by defending your feelings when you never have to … that you let them win .
5 . No one can argue against needs
The same thing goes for your basic needs in your relationships .
You know them .
You have them .
You can communicate them to others .
If someone disrespects your needs , then you need to have boundaries in place to inform you what you will and will not tolerate from them .
What you do n’t need to do is argue with them about why they should care about your needs enough to respect to them .
If you have to pull teeth to convince them to care , then how much of your time are they worth anyway ?
6 . Trying to control another person ’s opinion oversteps both their boundaries and yours
Arguing has one objective : to control .
What someone thinks .
What they feel .
What they should do .
What they want .
What they need .
What ’s good for them .
You do n’t want others controlling you .
And you do n’t want to control others .
That ’s lose - lose for everyone .
Avoid the temptation
Argument is war , but with words .
The objective is to attack , counter - attack , and parry .
Your relationships are not about war , but cooperation .
If you find yourself in a heated argument , or firing up for one , ask yourself :
Do you want your relationship to go to war ?
And can anyone win in the first place ?
When argument seems tempting , consider the more emotionally intelligent and response able alternative : having an honest discussion about the real problem that needs to be fixed .

A trio of genome - wide studies – collectively the largest to date – has pinpointed a vast array of genetic variation that cumulatively may account for at least one third of the genetic risk for schizophrenia .
One of the studies traced schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , in part , to the same chromosomal neighborhoods .
" These new results recommend a fresh look at our diagnostic categories , " said Thomas R. Insel , M.D. , director of the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , part of the National Institutes of Health .
" If some of the same genetic risks underlie schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , perhaps these disorders originate from some common vulnerability in brain development . "
Three schizophrenia genetics research consortia , each funded in part by NIMH , report separately on their genome - wide association studies online July 1 , 2009 , in the journal Nature .
However , the SGENE , International Schizophrenia ( ISC ) and Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia ( MGS ) consortia shared their results – making possible meta-analyses of a combined sample totaling 8,014 cases and 19,090 controls .
All three studies implicate an area of Chromosome 6 ( 6p22.1 ) , which is known to harbor genes involved in immunity and controlling how and when genes turn on and off .
This hotspot of association might help to explain how environmental factors affect risk for schizophrenia .
For example , there are hints of autoimmune involvement in schizophrenia , such as evidence that offspring of mothers with influenza while pregnant have a higher risk of developing the illness .
" Our study was unique in employing a new way of detecting the molecular signatures of genetic variations with very small effects on potential schizophrenia risk , " explained Pamela Sklar , M.D. , Ph.D. , of Harvard University and the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research , who co-led the ISC team with Harvard 's Shaun Purcell , Ph.D .
" Individually , these common variants ' effects do not all rise to statistical significance , but cumulatively they play a major role , accounting for at least one third – and probably much more – of disease risk , " said Purcell .
Among sites showing the strongest associations with schizophrenia was a suspect area on Chromosome 22 and more than 450 variations in the suspect area on Chromosome 6 .
Statistical simulations confirmed that the findings could not have been accounted for by a handful of common gene variants with large effect or just rare variants .
This involvement of many common gene variants suggests that schizophrenia in different people might ultimately be traceable to distinct disease processes , say the researchers .
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share genetic roots that appear to be specific to serious mental disorders , and are not shared by non-psychiatric illnesses .
Bars representing different study samples show that the same genetic variations that account for risk in both mental disorders account for virtually none of the risk for coronary artery disease , Crohn 's disease , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis , or Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes .

" There was substantial overlap in the genetic risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that was specific to mental disorders , " added Sklar .
" We saw no association between the suspect gene variants and half a dozen common non-psychiatric disorders . "
Still , most of the genetic contribution to schizophrenia , which is estimated to be at least 70 percent heritable , remains unknown .
" Until this discovery , we could explain just a few percent of this contribution ; now we have more than 30 percent accounted for , " said Thomas Lehner , Ph.D. , MPH , chief of NIMH 's Genomics Research Branch .
" The new findings tell us that many of these secrets have been hidden in complex neural networks , providing hints about where to look for the still elusive – and substantial – remaining genetic contribution . "
The MGS consortium pinpointed an association between schizophrenia and genes in the Chromosome 6 region that code for cellular components that control when genes turn on and off .
For example , one of the strongest associations was seen in the vicinity of genes for proteins called histones that slap a molecular clamp on a gene 's turning on in response to the environment .
Genetically rooted variation in the functioning of such regulatory mechanisms could help to explain the environmental component repeatedly implicated in schizophrenia risk .
The MGS study also found an association between schizophrenia and a genetic variation on Chromosome 1 ( 1p22.1 ) which has been implicated in multiple sclerosis , an autoimmune disorder .
" Our study results spotlight the importance not only of genes , but also the little - known DNA sequences between genes that control their expression , " said Pablo Gejman , M.D. , of the NorthShore University HealthSystem Research Institute , of Evanston , ILL , who led the MGS consortium team .
" Advances in biotechnology , statistics , population genetics , and psychiatry , in combination with the ability to recruit large samples , made the new findings possible . "
The SGENE consortium study pinpointed a site of variation in the suspect Chromosome 6 region that could implicate processes related to immunity and infection .
It also found significant evidence of association with variation on Chromosomes 11 and 18 that could help account for the thinking and memory deficits of schizophrenia .
The new findings could eventually lead to multi- gene signatures or biomarkers for severe mental disorders .
As more is learned about the implicated gene pathways , it may be possible to sort out what 's shared by , or unique to , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , the researchers say .

Six hundred million people , or one fifth of mankind at the time , watched Neil Armstrong ’s first steps on the Moon in 1969 .
But seeing live transmissions from that historic event would n’t have been possible – and the Apollo missions would n’t have possible either – without reliable communications and accurate tracking capabilities .
To support the Apollo Program , NASA built the Manned Space Flight Network ( MSFN ) with three 85 foot ( 26 meter ) antennas equally spaced around the world at Goldstone , California , Honeysuckle Creek , Australia and Fresnedillas ( near Madrid ) , Spain .
Because of the movie “ The Dish ” however , most people think the Parkes Radio Antenna was the only dish used in Australia .
But the Honeysuckle Creek dish was the real star of the Apollo missions .
Most notably , it supplied voice and telemetry contact with the lunar and command modules but it also provided the first televised pictures of the Apollo 11 moonwalk .
“ It was a job well done by many people all over the world , ” said Bruce Ekert , a technician with the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station .
“ When I reflect that we were part of history , it is still amazing that it came together and worked so smoothly . ”
The Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station ( HSK ) was a radio - quiet location in the Australian Alps surrounded by granite peaks 32 km southwest of Canberra , Australia ’s capital .
Ekert helped install a microwave relay link from HSK to the Red Hill Radio Terminal in Canberra .
“ This link was the “ missing link ” as at that time , there was only a telephone line from HSK to Canberra , and this was unsuitable for TV pictures , ” Ekert told Universe Today .
Ekert was working for the government telecommunications department and in April 1969 he was told his next job would be to install a microwave link so that when Australia ’s side of the world was pointed toward the Moon , all the communications to the Moon and back could be relayed to NASA and mission control in Houston .
It may have been summer in the US , but in Australia it was winter .
1969 was cold and snowy , especially in snow country at 1200 m ( 3600 ft ) up in the mountains , making the work difficult .
“ It was cold and we had a lot of snow that year , ” Ekert said , “ Aligning microwave dishes on towers in cold weather , the bolts tend to lock up , and it ’s difficult to move them around to get the best signal .
Moving them with cold hands and cold steel is not the easiest things to do .
But we installed microwave dishes on towers and equipment in the buildings .
We also had to install a temporary tower with two dishes on it to redirect the signal through the mountains to get it out to the rest of the world . ”
“ We were running by the seat of our pants at one stage , ” Ekert continued .
“ It was all thrown together and we knew it would work , but still , since we threw it together we hoped it would work according to plan . ”
Ekert and his co-workers had to make sure the temporary links stayed working for the duration of the Apollo 11 mission .
“ We maintained the equipment in a hands - off position , ” he said .
“ As we say now , if it ai n’t broke do n’t fix it .
We worked for the complete duration of the mission , but we were n’t allowed to touch anything if it was working – just let it run .
If it had failed , then we would have had to fix it , but since everything just coasted along and there were n’t any problems , we just watched and waited like everyone else . ”
But those at HSK had one little advantage .
“ The staff at Honeysuckle Creek actually were the first people in the world to see the pictures coming from the Moon , by a few milliseconds , ” Ekert said .
“ So that is our claim to fame . ”
Ed von Renouard , working at HSK was the first man in the world to see the pictures from the Moon as they came from the receiver in the dish .
( See top image of Ed back in 1969 , and below is Ed with Bruce Ekert )
But then after 8 minutes , NASA decided the larger 64 meter Parkes Radio Telescope , 300 kilometers away , was getting a clearer signal and switched over for the remaining coverage of the spacewalk for the next two - and - a - half - hours .
Yes , there was a wind storm at Parkes , which threatened to blow the dish off course , as portrayed in “ The Dish , ” but Ekert said the movie was a typical Hollywood type creation .
“ There were no crises where they were going to lose communications , ” he said .
“ There was a big storm , where they had winds up to 60 mph ( 100 kph ) at Parkes not long after the landing happened .
They did fear the dish might be blown off course , but they always had the standby of Honeysuckle Creek , which was still receiving pictures , and at that point the moon had risen higher in the sky and pictures were actually better .
So if the Parkes dish had actually been blown off course , they would have immediately switched back to Honeysuckle Creek . ”
Parkes was part of MSFN’s “ wing ” stations to provide back - up and additional coverage .
This meant that each of the three locations around the world would have two stations capable of communicating with Apollo spacecraft at lunar distances .
In addition to just redundancy , there was another reason for having two Apollo - capable stations at each location .
For project Apollo , communications used the higher frequency S - Band ( around 2.2GHz ) , and the beam width of the 85 foot antennas at those frequencies was only 0.43 degree .
Ideally , one antenna would track the Command Service Module in Lunar orbit and the other would track the Lunar Module to the surface .
Parkes was also called in to assist with the Apollo 13 emergency .
In addition , a number of other stations supported Apollo , including a facility at Tidbinbilla , 20 km away from HSK , which also had dedicated Apollo equipment and people to operate as an additional receive / transmit facility .
More permanent microwave relays were installed , and HSK was part of all the Apollo missions , and in 1974 at the conclusion of the Skylab program , HSK Creek joined the Deep Space Network as Deep Space Station 44 , working deep space missions like Viking , Voyager , Pioneer and more .
It was closed in December 1981 , with its 26 meter antenna relocated to the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex at Tidbinbilla , and renamed Deep Space Station 46 , where it is still in use today .
The original HSK site has been leveled , and only the concrete foundations remain , but in 2001 an outdoor display was added .
During Apollo 11 celebrations in July of this year , Ekert joined about 200 other people who worked at HSK , Parkes and Tidbinbilla to commemorate their achievements with Apollo .
“ We traveled to the site of the HSK tracking station , for a ceremony unveiling a new plaque to show visitors and tourists where history was made on 21st July , 1969 , ” said Ekert .
“ We then moved over to another part of the site and a time capsule was filled with memorabilia from 1969 until now .
My wife , who is Russian , put in a 50 Ruble note , with the words that there is not a “ Cold War ” anymore .
The time capsule was buried , with instructions for the park rangers that it is to be dug up in 60 years time to mark the 100th anniversary of man ’s first footsteps on the moon . ”
Neil Armstrong also sent a note of congratulations for the ceremony , touching on the misconceptions the rest of the world might have because of things portrayed in the movie “ The Dish . ”
“ Some of you , I expect , may have had mixed emotions about the film , THE DISH .
I understand , because as technical people , we like things to be correct and accurate .
And the film did not always accurately capture the roles of those of you at Honeysuckle Creek , those of you at Parkes , and those of you at Tidbinbilla .
But for most of the viewers of the film around the world , those were not the details that they would remember anyway .
What they will remember is that down in Australia there were some very dedicated people , with some very big antennae and complex electronic equipment that did remarkable things that were instrumental in the success of man ’s first flights to the moon .
They will have a sense that you were having a great time doing what you were doing .
And what they remember will , in fact , be the truth . ”
— from Neil Armstrong ’s message to the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex

The celebrations continued in Australia in Canberra and at exactly 12.51 pm local time , they showed a replay of the moon walk , with Neil Armstrong jumping down off the ladder of the lunar module to the surface of the Moon at exactly 12.56 pm .
“ The audio came over the auditorium sound system , and the atmosphere was awesome , ” Ekert said .
“ It was a great celebration , where we patted ourselves on the back and had a salutatory drink to the whole situation . ”
And a well deserved drink it was .
The rest of the world sends its thanks to those who made watching television from the Moon possible .

A legal standoff has developed in Arizona between sheriff ’s deputies and county officials over a management system overhaul .
Last week officers from Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office raided government buildings and took over computer systems shared between law enforcement and county officials .
Sysadmins were marshalled away under threat of arrest , while the deputies changed passwords on servers and secured rooms .
County officials called in the judges for help , with superior court judge Joseph Heilman ordering control of the system to be handed over by next Wednesday .
However , Chief Deputy David Hendershott is holding firm , refusing to hand over the passwords even under threat of going to jail for contempt of court .
Heilman has held hearings on a dispute between the sheriff and the Board of Supervisors over the running of an integrated criminal justice system since April .
Kerry Martin , a lawyer acting for the sheriff ’s office , said deputies had taken over the system to stop county managers applying a management system they disagreed with .
Martin , repeatedly quizzed by judge Heilman on why it did n’t bring this aspect of the dispute back to court before acting , claimed that the deputies had the authority to take control .
The Wild - West–style standoff between sheriffs and county threatens local access to the National Criminal Information Center and the Arizona Criminal Justice Information system .
The judge declined to issue a restraining order against the sheriff , instead convening a sit - down meeting between civilian staff , lawyers , probation offices and the sheriffs next Tuesday .
To add extra flavour to an already heady mix , Hendershott stated that the sheriff ’s office accessed the systems as part of a criminal investigation into suspected mismanagement of the computer system involving other judges .
More on the story can be found in the local Arizona media here , and here . ®
This experimental film looks at the world and more specifically the effect man has had on the landscape and the environment .
Without narration , the film shows the world in a pristine condition and untouched : blue skies , beautiful landscapes and endless vistas .
The man -made world is much less appealing .
Essentially a montage using a variety of film techniques to provide a visually stunning montage of images .

Enlarge Smithsonian Institution The Hope Diamond with the new setting planned for it .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Hope Diamond is going bare to celebrate a half - century at the Smithsonian Institution .
The mysterious blue gem was donated to the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History more than 50 years ago , and the museum is celebrating by having a new setting designed .
Starting in September , the 45.52 carat diamond will be exhibited as a stand - alone gem with no setting .
New York jeweler Harry Winston donated the fabled diamond to the museum , and his company is designing three possible new settings .
Starting Wednesday the public is being invited to vote online for their favorite , at http:www.smithsonianchannel.com/hope
The winning setting will be announced late this year , and the gem will be shown in the setting starting next May , to mark the premiere of a Smithsonian Channel documentary on the diamond .
The Hope has been removed from its setting for cleaning from time to time , but this is the first time it will be on public view by itself .
Previously it has been shown in a platinum setting , surrounded by 16 white pear - shaped and cushion - cut diamonds , suspended from a chain containing forty - five diamonds .
The Hope will return to this original setting in late 2010 .
" This is a rare and exciting opportunity for people to see the Hope Diamond as it has never been seen before , " said museum director Cristian Samper .
Formed more that a billion years ago , the diamond was mined in India and is believed later to have been part of the French crown jewels , having been stolen during the French Revolution .
It later came into the possession of Henry Philip Hope , whose name it carries .
The Hope Diamond was long thought to bear a curse that brought bad luck to its owners .
Smithsonian officials say it has been kind to them , drawing throngs of visitors over the decades .

The Canadian Stubby Beer Bottle Website
This site is dedicated to the Canadian Stubby Beer Bottle .
From the late 1960's to about 1983 all major Canadian brewers used the Stubby beer bottle to bottle and distribute their beer in .
The bottles were generic with no embossing to identify any one brewery and could be used multiple times by different breweries .
The images on this site are from my ( Leonard Whistler ) Stubby collection - I started collecting the Stubbies in 1976 and stopped collecting in 1983 .
Parafraseando a Horacio Ferrer , se podría decir que los mozos de Buenos Aires tienen un qué sé yo : son capaces de tomar pedidos diferentes de varias mesas , volver y entregar los platos y bebidas sin equivocarse .
¿ Cómo hacen ?
Al parecer , tras años de entrenamiento , aprenden a construir un mapa mental que vincula la cara de sus clientes con un lugar en la mesa .
Encontrar la respuesta a esta pregunta llevó a un grupo de científicos argentinos a realizar una investigación que acaba de publicarse en la revista Behavioural Neurology y cuya metodología sorprende por su audacia .
Es tan innovadora que otros investigadores la califican de " antropología experimental " o de " neuropsicología social " porque , en lugar de llevar a los mozos a un laboratorio , como suele hacerse , lograron dilucidar sus procesos cognitivos " en vivo y en directo " .
En 2003 , durante un encuentro con otros siete amigos en el Café Tortoni , Facundo Manes , director del Instituto de Neurología y Medicina Experimental , y del Instituto de Neurociencias de la Fundación Favaloro , se preguntó cómo podía ser que los mozos argentinos recordaran tantos pedidos sin anotar .
" En los Estados Unidos –dice Manes– , anotan tanto los mozos de los restaurantes más distinguidos como los estudiantes universitarios que trabajan en cafés populares .
Este era un experimento que sólo podía hacerse en la Argentina . "
Admitiendo que los mozos son expertos memoriosos , Manes y su equipo , encabezado por Tristán Bekinschtein , primer autor del trabajo , e integrado también por Julián Cardozo , diseñaron un experimento que permitiera entender qué estrategias emplean .
" De hecho –cuenta Bekinschtein , que participa en la conversación a través de la línea telefónica desde Londres , donde está completando su formación– , en la bibliografía sólo dimos con un antecedente acerca de un mozo que se había autoentrenado con un sistema complicadísimo . "
Durante varias semanas , Bekinschtein , Manes y Cardozo visitaron los bares clásicos porteños ( el Tortoni , el London City , el Británico , La Ideal y otros ) siempre con otras cinco personas .
Se sentaban , pedían y , cuando el mozo no los veía , los ocho se cambiaban de lugar .
" El mozo volvía con las bebidas y , claro , algo había cambiado –dice Bekinschtein– .
Después medíamos si los mozos cometían errores al servir los pedidos . "
A partir del número de aciertos y errores , los científicos pudieron analizar los procesos mentales de los mozos .
" Si sólo hubieran memorizado las caras y lo que pedíamos , entonces no hubieran tenido problemas en servirle su pedido a cada comensal –agrega– .
Si , por el contrario , la estrategia de los mozos radicara en asociar el lugar en el que están sentados los clientes con el pedido , entonces lo servirían en la ubicación correcta , pero a la persona equivocada . "
Los resultados fueron casi siempre una mezcla de ambas situaciones : algunos mozos volvían y dejaban los pedidos en el lugar de la mesa " correcto " ( pero no a la persona correcta ) y otros se los entregaban a las personas correctas , a pesar de que ahora éstas estuvieran en otro lugar de la mesa .
" Generaban un mapa de personas en ubicaciones específicas y asociadas con los pedidos " , dice Manes .
" Los mozos [ que en este experimento tenían entre 9 y 17 años de experiencia ] aprenden a incorporar estos « esquemas » de memoria y llenarlos con los datos de cada mesa cuando nuevos clientes hacen su pedido –dice Bekinschtein– .
Al cambiarse de lugar , el esquema se rompe y esta « memoria especial » ya no funciona .
Por suerte , ¡no todos los comensales experimentan con los mozos ! "
" Algo interesante de nuestro experimento es que arroja evidencias de que la « memoria de trabajo » no duraría sólo segundos , como se cree " , dice Manes .
Y enseguida reflexiona Bekinschtein : " Además , es bastante resistente a las interferencias , porque el mozo maneja varios pedidos simultáneamente .
Decididamente , está utilizando alguna otra red o agrandando su red de trabajo para poder mantener semejante cantidad de ítems para utilizarlos 10 minutos más tarde y , al mismo tiempo , atender otras mesas ... "
Para Diego Golombek , investigador en neurociencias y ritmos circadianos , que no participó en el trabajo , la investigación muestra que los mozos emplean más una estrategia de memoria espacial , que de reconocimiento de caras .
" Justamente , las actividades y experiencias de todos los días son un punto de partida muy estimulante para encontrar una pregunta científica y buscar la respuesta de manera experimental –afirma– .
Este es un ejemplo más de que las neurociencias cognitivas , un área muy relegada en el país , donde la psicología ha sido históricamente una disciplina casi exclusivamente clínica , están creciendo en la Argentina . "
Por su parte , Mitul Mehta , de la División de Neurociencias y Salud Mental del Imperial Collage , de Londres , respondió por via electrónica que el trabajo coincide con algunas ideas emergentes de que la memoria experta depende de algunas regiones específicas del cerebro que se utilizan para la atención y para trazar estrategias .
" Si esto es así –escribió– , con las estrategias correctas y la atención indispensable cualquiera puede convertirse en experto . "
Hace varios años , neurocientíficos ingleses investigaron la memoria de los taxistas de Londres , porque observaban que tenían la capacidad de navegar en las innumerables callejuelas de la capital británica con gran facilidad .
Vieron que estos tenían más desarrollada un área del cerebro relacionada con la memoria , el " hipocampo " , pero no supieron cómo funcionaba esa destreza .
En todo caso , dadas las evidencias que existen sobre la importancia de ejercitar la memoria , cabe preguntarse si los mozos , que deben mantenerla tan ágil , alejan así el riesgo de demencia en la vejez .
" El tema está sujeto a controversia –concluye Manes– .
Para confirmarlo , habría que volver a revisarlos dentro de un par de décadas . "
Qué dicen los mozos memoriosos
" El trabajo es lo que estimula la memoria .
La verdad ... no se cómo hago para acordarme de todo .
Tengo mucha memoria .
Atiendo cinco o seis mesas a la vez y en 32 años nunca tuve miedo de no recordar los pedidos . "
" Generalmente atendemos entre 15 y 20 clientes a la vez , pero a veces ese número es mucho más grande .
Ayer , un compañero atendió él solo a 60 clientes . "
CARLOS ALBERTO MESA
64 años ; desde hace 32 , trabaja en Las Cuartetas
" Al principio , me costó agilizar la mente , porque acá trabajamos sin anotar nada .
En esta casa , todo es cantado .
La atención así es más rápida . "
" Somos 22 mozos , que atendemos unos 400 o 500 cubiertos los viernes , y los sábados llegamos hasta los 500 o 600 .
Si no estás fuerte de la memoria , es imposible hacer este trabajo . "
CLAUDIO ALEJANDRO ESPERANZA

" Lo más importante en el tema de la memoria es querer el trabajo que hacés .
Amar tu oficio es fundamental para aprender a ejercitar la memoria y retener los pedidos . "
" No uso ninguna mnemotecnia .
Uso las sonrisas y la buena disposición porque una buena atención es clave para hacer bien tu trabajo . "

I hate mp3 , and this post will tell you why .
DO NOT read this post if you have a large collection of mp3s , enjoy listening to them and can’t hear any problems with them , because it ’ll ruin them for you !
There ’s been plenty written on how mp3 works , and why lossy compression sounds worse than uncompressed audio in general .
My aim here is to demonstrate how mp3 sounds bad , for all the people who keep telling me there ’s no difference .
I ’m going to give you clear guidelines and examples on what to listen for and the negative effects of mp3 , but there ’s no going back – once you can hear the problems , you ’ll never stop hearing them .
This is n’t limited to audiophiles , or “ golden ears ” , by the way – in my opinion anyone can hear this stuff , with a few pointers .
So seriously , unless you ’re prepared to start using Ogg Vorbis , FLAC or AAC – stop reading now !
Still here ?
Good .
First , I need to make this clear – I have nothing against lossy audio or data compression in itself – I do most of my casual listening on an iPod , using 128 kbps AAC files – they sound fine .
Not as good as the original CDs , obviously , but OK .
And yes , I ’m well aware that AAC is just a more advanced version of mp3 .
But the fact is that mp3 has fundamental limitations – even at higher bitrates .
Next – I ’m also a pragmatist .
mp3 is a temporary phenomenon , just like AM radio , cassettes and CDs .
In the long run , none of those have killed music , and neither will mp3 , or lossy compression in general .
So , why the rant ?
Because people keep saying mp3 sounds great , or “ indistinguishable from CD ” and it ’s just not true .
mp3 is n’t good enough
It does n’t matter what encoder you use , it does n’t matter what settings you use or what pre-processing you apply – mp3 just does n’t cut it .
AAC and later , more sophisticated encoders use more advanced encoding methods , and sound better to varying degrees , but mp3 just FAILs .
How does it fail ?
That depends a little on the encoder being used , but some of my own pet hates include :
mp3 sizzle – the artificial , unnatural swirling metallic noises that sound like someone ’s added chime bars to everything , or there ’s a mosquito buzzing in your ear .
Some people actually say we prefer these noises in mp3s – but the research says bullshizzle !

Added distortion –
Yet another side effect of the so - called Loudness Wars .
mp3 encoders rarely include any headroom for the encoding process itself , so the added processing pushes the music even further over the limits , generating inter-sample peaks and adding even more distortion in the process

Flat , two - dimensional sound mp3 works by throwing away musical information that we supposedly can’t hear – up to 90 % of the original information , at 128 kbps .
That means all the subtle , delicate stuff , like ambience , space and realism .
So a lush , three - dimension original is reduced to a flat , cardboard replica of itself

So a lush , three - dimension original is reduced to a flat , cardboard replica of itself Mushiness
All but the very best mp3 encodes just sound fuzzy , muddled and – well , mushy !
Hear for yourself
Do n’t take my word for it – here are some examples .
First , a truly nasty 128 kbps mp3 example , from a Deep Purple live album I mixed a while back :
3 TalkAboutLoveAmLow
( Before anyone jumps on me , I ’ve heard even a 256 kbps mp3s sounding like this – I ’ve just used a low quality version to make the point . )
If that does n’t sound too bad to you at first , try this – I ’ve filtered the file to highlight the high frequencies .
You can hear the problems most clearly when the vocals start :
swirlies
Some people describe this effect as “ sizzle ” , or “ swirlies ” .
It ’s not just that I ’ve removed all the bass , what I ’m pointing out is the unatural bubbling , twinkling “ chime - bar ” type sound , or as my friend and fellow mastering engineer Nick Watson once called it , the “ flocks of tweeting ultrasonic birdies ” .
It also reminds me of someone crinkling up tin foil !
Once you ’ve picked it out , listen the first version again .
Does n’t sound so nice now , does it ?
Can you ignore the swirlies , now you know they are there ?
Now listen to the original file :
3 TalkAboutLove
Listen to the clarity , punch , and bite of the WAV , compared to the swirly , soggy mess of an mp3 .
Which one do you prefer ?
The loss of depth , richness and three - dimensionality is more subtle side - effect , but just as unfortunate .
Here ’s a snippet of a recording I did for the brilliant Hans Koller , featuring Christine Tobin on vocals :
GreatBearTheSmall
( This is a much better mp3 encode , with far fewer heinous swirlies .
But still …)
Here ’s the WAV version :
GreatBearTheSmall
Do n’t expect the difference here to leap out at you straight away , it ’s more a case of feeling it – listen to the swirls of the harp from 30 seconds in , listen to the piano and Christine ’s voice – on the wav file , there ’s a warmth , and a depth , and a sparkle that in the mp3 has just gone .
Listen to the wav several times over , then switch to the mp3 .
Do you honestly feel it sounds as good ?
The mp3 is OK , but it ’s just … meh .
I ’m not drawn in , my attention wanders , it does n’t move me .
Something essential has been lost , and you ca n’t get it back .
And once you ’ve heard that loss , even cranking the data - rate up does n’t help .
The only solution is a more advanced format , or lossless files .
Try listening to the mp3s in your music collection .
Go back and compare them to the CDs you ripped them from .
… Sorry .
Update :
I ’ve had lots of interest in this post , and lots of discussion , especially on link - sharing sites .
There are a few common responses that I want to answer here .
No - one uses 128 kbps mp3s
Wrong .
If you ’ve made this comment , you probably already know about LAME and the all other flavours of mp3 codec , and you probably do choose to use higher bit-rates , but you ’re in the minority .
Most “ regular listeners ” go for the default settings – and even in iTunes this is only 160 kbps .
192/320 kbps sounds fine
Sometimes .
This depends so heavily on the material , the encoder and the codec – you simply can’t make blanket assumptions .
Ironically one of the factors that makes mp3 so popular – the fact that there are so many encoders and players , some of which are free – also makes it far harder to get a decent encode .
By contrast , the grip Apple have over the AAC format at least ensures consistently high standards of encoding .
You ’re just an Apple fanboy
No .
Well alright , yes – I am a big fan of Apple ’s products , but there are plenty of other alternatives to mp3 – OGG Vorbis , FLAC etc .
The only reason I mention AAC a lot is it ’s a format I have deep experience of , and always sounded good ( but not perfect ! ) to me .
And another thing
To everyone who keeps saying “ just use 320 kbps ” , I say – why ?!?
mp3 simply has inherent limitations compared to other formats .
The whole point of lossy audio is to save space .
At 128 kbps that saving is 90 % – well worth having .
At 320 kbps though , that saving is only 60 % and it still does n’t sound great – I ’d far rather go with FLAC or Apple lossless , which can often achieve an almost equivalent 50 % saving in space , and have something that sounds identical to the source .
Update # 2 ( 2014 ) :
Five years later , and the mp3 ( and lossy data compression in general ) is still with us .
AAC sounds even better since Apple ’s Mastered for iTunes initiative , and even offers tantalising glimpses of a lossless future .
Meanwhile Neil Young has his heart in the right place with his Pono initiative – but I have some concerns .
And Harman seem to regard the whole thing as nothing more than a marketing opportunity .
For another chance to hear the problem with 128 kbps mp3s for yourself , try this test :

It ’s only 128 kbps versus 320 kbps unfortunately , but it ’s an interesting exercise all the same .
Here ’s how I did :
Let ’s just go lossless and be done with it !

Alleged cyber bully Lori Drew was officially acquitted on Friday when US District Judge George H. Wu issued a ruling in which he said that violating a website 's terms of service is not a criminal offense .
This ruling affirms an opinion that he issued last month when he revealed his intention to throw out the conviction against Drew .
Drew was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2008 for her role in a MySpace hoax that led to the suicide of 13 - year - old Megan Meier .
Prosecutors charged her under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) , contending that her violation of MySpace 's terms of service was tantamount to hacking .
They rationalized this legal theory by arguing that using a website while failing to conform with its usage policy constitutes " unauthorized access , " which is forbidden by the CFAA .
The Jury found Drew guilty of misdemeanor counts of unauthorized access , but Judge Wu did not accept the reasoning and suggested in his opinion last month that the CFAA was not devised as a vehicle for criminalizing simple contractual violations on the Internet .
As the issue hinges on interpretation of the law rather than a dispute over the facts of the case , Wu has the authority to override the Jury 's decision .
He granted Drew 's original motion for dismissal in his decision on Friday .
In his decision , he discusses the meaning of " unauthorized access " and explains the basis for his interpretation .
" It is unclear that every intentional breach of a website 's terms of service would be or should be held to be equivalent to an intent to access the site without authorization or in excess of authorization , " Judge Wu wrote in his decision .
" This is especially the case with MySpace and similar Internet venues which are publicly available for access and use . "
The ruling will be welcomed by the EFF and other Internet rights groups that filed Amicus briefs calling for the courts to remain cautious about setting broad precedents that could criminalize many legitimate Internet behaviors .
Only three words can describe the Guardian Legend for the NES : Classic , Unique , and Underrated .
It leaves a wonderful and fun feeling from the time you press the Power button to the moment you savor sweet victory against the final boss and everything in - between .
Personally , the title screen and music is an extraordinary moment in 8 - bit gaming and seen few that can rival it .
The Guardian Legend ( a.k.a. Guardic Gaiden in Japan ) is a NES game released in the USA in 1989 by Broderbund , produced by Irem , and created by Compile .
It is a combination of Metroid , Zelda , and scroll shooting games weaved masterfully together into a masterpiece with vast exploration , an array of powerful weapons , tons of boss fights , and an experience that which make every second worth its while .
You play as Miria ( Alyssa in Japan ) , " The Guardian " of the Earth and its sworn protector .
Before Tomb Raider , Resident Evil , and Super Princess Peach , most females in 8 - bit games were either kidnapped , captured , held hostage , killed , dead , evil , or just none .
Back then , females fitted best in supportive roles like the helper or the sidekick .
It is quite rare to see the leading role fulfilled by a female , even better when with one that transform into a jet .
( How many women do you know that can do that ? :)
) Story : One day , a spaceship , nearly the size of a planet , is found on a collision course with Earth .
As the Guardian , you set out to infiltrate the flying fortress .
Upon arriving on the surface , you come across the final message left by its remnants and learned that Naju , their home , has been taken over by evil life forms .
To prevent Earth 's destruction , you must find the 10 seals of the self - destruct mechanism scattered across Naju 's labyrinth - like surface .
The story combines elements from both Zelda and Metroid in which you must search for the seals but , at the same time , shrouds the atmosphere with a sense of isolation since you are alone to fend against whatever horrors and dangers that lie ahead .
Gameplay :
Here is where TGL truly shines as it plays like a shooter and action - adventure game , but so much more .
Rarely do you find games that combine and execute multiple genres so well , and that alone does make TGL really stand out .
The game begins as a regular shooter , but with some key features .
First , you have a life bar , but that 's a misleading name cause you do n't die when it reaches zero .
Just when you 're hit with zero life , either way , start worrying when life is low .
The score counter increases the life bar as the more points are accumulated and does give itself an RPG - type twist .
( Hint : Try to kill as many enemies as you can . )
Chips serve many purposes in TGL as its used as currency , increase your regular weapon 's firepower , and a requirement to utilize special weapons ( More on that later ) .
All of Naju 's corridors are going to be shooter - type stages .
The pace of the game will change frequently as for some stages can start going fast then begin to slow down and vice versa .
When reaching the end of level , you fight the corridor 's boss and receive special items as a reward for beating him .
Unlike typical shooters , the enemies here do more than just fire a huge buttload of ammunition .
You have enemies that teleport out of nowhere , enemies that will fake out , enemies that can multiply themselves and barrage you , enemies that your regular gun can't destroy , enemies that attack from underground , etc .
They do give the game a distinguishing yet exciting and classic feel to it compared to other shooters and another reason to love it more .
The other aspect is the action - adventure mode with 3/ 4 perspective overhead and , armed with a blaster , you must explore Naju for the 10 sealed corridors ( Corridors 1 - 10 ) .
Think of it playing as Link but with the Mega Buster .
A cool concept is Miria can walk and shoot in 8 directions giving gameplay a new level as I felt it gave more freedom and flexibility .
It was n't as restrictive as most NES games and some SNES games and shows that Compile created something that was ahead of its time .
By pressing SELECT button , a menu will appear along with a map indicating where the corridors and relieves the frustration in finding them .
But opening them is a different matter as there are hidden message rooms that will tell how to unlock , making exploration a necessity .
Use this opportunity to search for power - ups .
Some clues are straight - forward , like shooting at the door , while others are cryptic and require some thought .
The corridors you seek are sealed in areas that require a key and can only be obtained by defeating a certain boss .
It does give the game a much more linear - tone , but TGL makes up for it with additional corridors ( Corridors 11 - 20 ) .
These corridors are optional , unlock automatically , and will reward you with a power - up .
( Also , a good chance to harvest points to increase your life bar . )
Unlike the shooter stages , you can freely move around at your own pace .
The enemies here are n't as difficult as in the corridors , but do n't get cocky , they will take a big chuck of life if you let them .
The best part for boss fights here is that you have the option to not fight them by simply moving to another room .
However , it must be done before you 're sealed in .
The game does help by providing additional weapon to help combat against your enemies , such as , a light saber , seeker missiles , fireballs , twin lazers , etc .
These can be mainly found lying on the surface or bought from the Blue Landers ( Compile 's mascot ) in exchange for chips .
You can level - up all weapon up to 3 times , but as their levels increases , so does the number of chips they consume .
The Enemy Eraser is a super special weapon destroying all enemies within the screen , except for bosses and certain enemies .
My advice is CONSERVE them for boss fights and only use them if it gets too hectic .
Unlike other special weapons , Enemy Eraser do n't rely on chips and can only be replenished by finding more Enemy Erasers , dropped by enemies very few often .
Challenge : Despite the numerous power - ups and weapons , the game is still challenging .
On top of that , there are 48 bosses in the Guardian Legend ranging from fairly easy to difficult .
Some fights will have you fighting the same boss , with a different color each time , but do n't be fooled .
They are tougher .
Strategies successful on previous forms may not work on their stronger counterparts .
This forces players to think on their feet and come up with new strategies with what they got .
The beauty of it is your strategies are n't limited to using one particular weapon over and over again .
For some bosses , I 've defeated with either the light saber and seeker missiles and regular blaster , while others say to use fireball .
It 's okay to go with what float your boat and Compile programmed that well into their game .
( Hint :
If you 're weapon are too weak , then I suggest searching surrounding areas for power - ups before fighting the boss again . )
Graphics and Sound : For an 8 - bit game , the graphic designers at Compile really did a marvelous job .
They spared no detail in character , enemy , and background design and give each an distinguish outlook .
But the graphics do flicker from time and time as the screen fills up with enemies , however I do n't feel it impedes the gameplay too much .
Also , they could have made some backgrounds a bit more colorful , but I 'm not complaining .
The music , in short , is good , despite the fact the game has a limited sound track .
Not for one moment did I feel it was repetitive or dull , and has a catchy tune that you 'll most likely hum to while walking or driving .
Password :
The only drawback to this game are the password , which can be obtained by entering a save room ( the pink room with the Blue Lander in it ) .
The passwords are 32 characters long and consists of both upper and lower - case letters , numerics , and " !? " .
I felt they overboard with the password system , even with a password checker .
It has become sort of a nuisance when writing and inputting them , especially for gamers that play this for short intervals .
But I doubt it 'll be that bad since you 'll be too preoccupied fun on this thing for hours and hours on end .
For all pure shooter fans , if you input the password " TGL " , the game will allow you to play all corridor stages ( including the optional stages ) , without having to explore Naju .
This password is shown after you 've beaten the game for first time and adds replay value for those that love shooter games or just want a bigger challenge .
Overall : The Guardian Legend is a game combined with the great qualities from Metroid , Zelda , and shooter games , and still holds many endearing traits that allows it stand on it two feet alone .
But in a sea of famous titles , it went unnoticed and become criminally unknown for far too long .
The game can be bought on Ebay for as low as 3 bucks and I think that low .
It is one the NES ' biggest sleeper classics , and I feel it is a must have for any NES gamer .
The Guardian Legend is that awesome .
On that final note : Merry Christmas , Everyone !!!!!

How do you defeat a health care reform proposal in Washington ?
By asking Congress to support a gutted version that makes it sound like something it ’s not .
Essentially , that is former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich ’s analysis of the state of the debate over health care legislation so far .
The biggest issue on the table is the so - called public option , which would create a new government vehicle for the purchase of individual health insurance .
But insurers are fearful that the plan would drive down prices , or at least provide unfair competition .
So they are proposing to take the punch out of it by promoting regional , or even state , variations , where authorities can be more easily bought off , reducing pressure on more traditional plans .
We should be having a national conversation about this , pro and con .
I do n’t doubt that there are valid arguments to be made on each side .
Personally , I like the public option and outlined my reasons in a past post .
Others disagree .
They believe that health care should be run purely as a competitive business , and the government only makes the process more inefficient by sticking its nose into the pie .
For details on that view , see this recent analysis in The National Review .
But Washington often takes what I prefer to call the weasel - route .
That is , legislation is passed that seems to mean one thing , but in practical application means something entirely different .
You can see what I mean by reading Reich ’s post in its entirety , here .
But basically , insurers and pharmaceutical interests are trying to hatch a bill that would seem to allow for a public option in name only .
But it would be rendered completely ineffective .
Regardless of where you come down on the issue , I ’d recommend e-mailing your U.S. rep as well as your senators and telling them to have enough guts to take a clear stand .
We should be able to tell , after legislation comes out of Congress during the next few weeks , whether we have a public option or we do n’t .
You ca n’t please all the people all the time .
But we should n’t let our elected officials hide behind obfuscation and hollow legislation that fools people into thinking something ’s been accomplished when it has not .
According to the people at Improbable Research , who collect interesting and completely ridiculous studies done in many scientific fields ( including the social sciences ) , the longest known oath required of witnesses in a judicial proceeding was the oath required in Burmese courts until sometime in the 19th century .
The oath was 374 words long , at least in its English translation as recorded in Burmah and the Burmese , an 1853 book by Kenneth R.H. Mackenzie .
It goes into slightly greater detail than the more familiar " truth and nothing but the truth " formulation we boringly use today :
" I will speak the truth .
If I speak not the truth , may it be through the influence of the laws of demerit , viz. , passion , anger , folly , pride , false opinion , immodesty , hard heartedness , and scepticism , so that when I and my relations are on land , land animals , as tigers , elephants , buffaloes , poisonous serpents , scorpions , &c , shall seize , crush , and bite us , so that we shall certainly die .
Let the calamities occasioned by fire , water , rulers , thieves , and enemies oppress and destroy us , till we perish and come to utter destruction .
Let us be subject to all the calamities that are within the body , and all that are without the body .
" May we be seized with madness , dumbness , blindness , deafness , leprosy and hydrophobia .
May we be struck with thunderbolts and lightning , and come to sudden death .
In the midst of not speaking truth , may I be taken with vomiting clotted black blood , and suddenly die before the assembled people .
When I am going by water , may the water Nats [ spirits ] assault me , the boat be upset , and the property lost ; and may alligators , porpoises , sharks , or other sea monsters , seize and crush me to death ; and when I change worlds , may I not arrive among men or Nats , but suffer unmixed punishment and regret , in the utmost wretchedness , among the four states of punishment , Hell , Prita , Beasts and Athurakai . "
I would not be too concerned about the porpoises , but the rest of that seems fairly nasty .
Just in case the oath itself was not enough , the court also got into the act , praying that false witnesses " die of bad diseases , be bitten by crocodiles , [ and ] be drowned .
. . .
May they be killed with swords , lances and every sort of weapon .
May they be precipitated into the eight great hells and the 120 smaller ones . . .
May they be changed into dogs , " and , worst of all , " may everyone ill - treat them and raise lawsuits against them . "

Miss Dean was born with her left forearm missing A disabled woman from north - west London has won her employment tribunal against clothing giant Abercrombie and Fitch .
Riam Dean , 22 , who has a prosthetic arm , claimed she was " diminished " for not fitting the " look policy " at the Savile Row store in central London .
A central London tribunal awarded Miss Dean £ 8,000 for unlawful harassment and ruled that Abercrombie and Fitch failed to comply with employment law .
But the tribunal found Miss Dean did not suffer disability discrimination .
Miss Dean , who has just finished exams at Queen Mary University in east London , had claimed she was made to work in the stockroom for not fitting the brand 's " all - American " image .
The tribunal heard she resigned from the store following the spat and was left " distraught " .
Riam showed great courage in bringing this case against a huge multi-national company
Steve Beverley , Miss Dean 's solicitor Abercrombie and Fitch ( A&F ) maintained throughout the hearing that it valued inclusiveness .
But the tribunal upheld Miss Dean 's claim that she had been unlawfully harassed for a reason relating to her disability .
The judge found that A& F 's handling of the row had failed to comply with employment law .
The tribunal surmised that Miss Dean , from Greenford , was wrongly dismissed .
But her claim of direct disability discrimination was described as " not well founded " .
' Felt humiliated ' Miss Dean was awarded £ 136 basic compensation and £ 1,077 for loss of earnings .
The panel , which accepted she felt " humiliated " and experienced a " loss of confidence " following the dispute , also awarded her £ 6,800 for hurt feelings .
Abercrombie and Fitch 's Savile Row shop is its flagship UK store Miss Dean , who was forced to work in the stockroom after wearing a cardigan to cover her prosthetic arm , had originally sued the company for up to £ 20,000 .
The ruling stated : " The tribunal is satisfied the reason for the claimant 's dismissal was her breach of the look policy in wearing a cardigan .
" Whilst the tribunal is satisfied the claimant 's dismissal was a consequence of her unlawful harassment , it can not be characterised direct disability discrimination . "
Solicitor Steve Beverley , who represented Miss Dean at the tribunal , said : " I 'm delighted for Riam who showed great courage - not only in bringing this case against a huge multi-national company , but in facing a challenging cross examination .
" It is all very well having glossy staff handbooks dealing with discrimination procedures - but you must actually apply them . "
In a statement , counsel for A&F David Cupps , said the findings of the Tribunal were based " on the events of a single day " and that these " were not at all representative of Ms Dean 's overall employment with A&F " .
" We continue to believe that these events resulted from a misunderstanding that could have been avoided by better communication on the part of both parties , " said Mr Cupps who added that the company continued to support the rights of disabled individuals .

Everybody needs a Stephen Timms .
The amiable financial secretary to the Treasury is the handy neighbour you get round to change a fuse , mend a leaky tap or go on the Today programme to defend your lamentable economic record .
Timms is the guy you call when you remember that you had promised a shiny new " Digital Britain " , but then realised that the lord you 'd commissioned to write the agenda - setting report has left and you 'd forgotten to put someone else in charge .
As of last week , Timms has the task of making sure we all have high - speed broadband by 2012 .
It is a noble aim .
Except it does n't really matter , because in 2010 the nation has got David Cameron pencilled in to become prime minister .
Besides , as a political battleground , the Tories have kind of already won the internet .
It is n't that they have winning policies .
Their response to the digital Britain agenda was to try to turn it into another conversation about how the BBC costs too much and how Labour are generally rubbish .
" Instead of digital dithering from a dated government , " said Jeremy Hunt , shadow culture secretary , nonchalantly thumbing the keys of his hand - held Glib 2.0 Cliche - O - Meter , " we need new economy dynamism from a new Conservative government . "
They get away with it because Team Cameron is breezily at home with the new technology , while Team Brown is queasily at sea .
After the McBride - Draper email smear scandal , Downing Street should probably have abandoned any thoughts of trying to be clever with a computer .
But they could n't .
So the symbolic moment where Labour actually surrendered the web came when Gordon Brown recorded that YouTube video during the expenses row : restless pacing through the Downing Street garden , his words stripped of meaning after their uncomfortable journey through that gritted , staccato smile .
When some future tragedian writes Gordon Brown : The Opera , that will be the mad scene , when the great unravelling began .
" He is an analogue politician in a digital age , " David Cameron once said of Brown in a Commons clash .
It was a clever , spiteful jibe .
No one could be entirely sure what it meant , but in some slippery way , it felt true .
So what ?
Gordon is a bit of a Luddite and Cameron is effortlessly webogenic , disgorging faux - intimate video diaries on demand .
What has any of that got to do with real politics , the economy , public spending ?
Quite a lot , according to the Tory high command .
Key members of Cameron 's inner circle worship new technology with revolutionary fervour .
They have seen the way the internet has transformed the worlds of commerce and media and foresee – rightly – that politics is due an equivalent , massive change .
There are , in fact , two distinct ways in which digital technology has a direct impact on the way politics operates .
First , it opens up a new media arena in which a campaign can be fought , which can include blogging , social networking and soliciting donations online .
Second , it opens up new channels for the delivery of public services , which could include anything from taking tax payments to processing school applications to prescribing Tamiflu .
The Tories have got the campaigning part sewn up .
They 've never had a go at the e-governing part , but flatter themselves that they'd be pretty good at it .
In every sector , the disruptive force of the internet has tended to be centrifugal and atomising – dispersing power to individual consumers .
That , David Cameron believes , makes it inherently conservative .
This is what he means when he bangs on about the " post - bureaucratic age " .
And he is n't pretending .
Cameron is too image - obsessed to use such an ugly phrase unless he thinks it is profound .
" We 're instinctively sceptical of the state … and instead trust society .
That 's why we 've always been the party of the free market and now , more than ever , history is on our side , " the Conservative leader said in a speech last year , a couple of months before history went off the free market .
" Dynamic change in commerce and in our broader culture is helping to make the top - down model history .
The internet is transforming people 's lives , making their ambitions greater and their horizons broader . "
In other words , the digital revolution is Thatcherite ; tomorrow belongs to the Tories .
Steve Hilton , Cameron 's chief strategist , has been pivotal in developing this idea .
He spent much of the last year commuting between London and San Francisco , where his partner , Rachel Whetstone , has been working for Google .
George Osborne , a bit of a geek at heart , is fully signed up .
So is Nick Boles , an old Eton friend of Cameron and part of his " implementation unit " , responsible for weeding rash spending promises and other ideological impurities out of every idea the shadow cabinet comes up with .
The Tory techno advantage is partly just an accident of generations .
Tony Blair had never sent an email before he arrived in Downing Street and did n't send any once he got there .
When the real explosion of new media happened , the Labour top brass was a bit bogged down with the analogue stuff of government ; wars and the like .
While George Osborne was dreaming up phrases like " the Googlisation of politics " , Peter Mandelson was working out EU trade policy .
Most web evangelism is born of listless intellectual energy and frustrated ambition .
It sounds like a minor detail , but it matters that the younger members of the Tory team have simply had a bit more time on their hands to fiddle around online .
Partly , the Tories have also been encouraged by the loose anti-government , anti-state bias in the world of blogging and social media .
Web culture sprang out of Californian techno - hippy libertarianism .
Online , the individual voice is sovereign and any attempt to introduce rules or regulation is injurious .
The Cameroons think that makes the Tories more naturally prepared for the Brave New World than Labour ( which they insist plots to expand the state for the sake of it ) .
Cameron likes to point out that ConservativeHome , the Tory activists ' frothy online salon of choice , has become an organic component of the party while retaining total independence from the leadership and sometimes hosting trenchant attacks on it .
Gordon Brown , he speculates , would never tolerate such a thing .
He is right .
But it 's much easier to tolerate dissenting voices when they are the minority .
And the fact of being against the incumbent government has given the Tories a digital advantage .
Identifying gleefully with the anti-government techie culture may become a problem once they actually are the government .
Cameron thinks he 's solved this one .
The magic of the internet is that it does some things on the cheap .
The joy of " post bureaucracy " , you see , is that it does n't employ bureaucrats .
The idea , Cameron says , is " not just shaving a bit off this budget here ; that cost there " .
Instead , he envisages " replacing whole chunks of the expensive , bureaucratic government machine with more modern methods " .
By outsourcing public services online you shrink the state , give power to the people and balance the national budget .
Historic conservative mission accomplished .
That is the kind of thinking that led the Tories last month to float the cockamamie notion of using Google Health , the search engine 's medical data storage unit , to host NHS records and ease pressure on the Department of Health budget .
" So naive I could only hope that it was an unapproved kite - flying exercise by a young researcher in Conservative HQ , " thundered David Davis , knowing full well that the idea was first touted by Cameron in a speech in April .
The Tories will doubtless make some digital cost savings .
They could hardly be more profligate on IT gizmos than Labour , as anyone who has used the NHS " choose and book " system knows .
( Your GP tells you to go to the nearest hospital and prints out a telephone number , which you later call to make your appointment – total cost : £ 3.6bn . )
But lopping big money off budgets is n't easy .
The Digital Britain report included a chapter on the wider benefits of providing public services online .
But the only net budget saving it could cite from e-government was £ 8 m from the DVLA allowing people to process car tax online .
That 's around 0.009 % of the deficit recouped .
Now for the other £ 89.99bn .
The Tories are sailing towards power on a strong technological tail wind .
But for Cameron and Co to think that translates into a long - term political advantage , let alone a cogent ideology , is delusional .
They look admiringly at the energy of social networking sites and at the voluntarism and entrepreneurship that characterise web innovation and they see in it a vast store of civic power .
If only , they think , that could be harnessed to meet the social obligations that Labour thinks belong to the state .
This is the Holy Grail of so - called compassionate conservatism : to pull back the tide of government , confident that civil society will grow organically into the gap .
But there is no substance to it , no evidence , just wireless faith .
What will actually happen is that chunks of the public sector will be parcelled out to online providers , but instead of mass privatisation it will be called post - bureaucratisation .
And when it emerges that Facebook and Mumsnet are not quite equal to the task of supplanting the welfare state , social policy will be back to the old , analogue drawing board .
When Debbie Phillips tried to report a crime , police just snickered .
" I told him that someone came into my house and cleaned , " the president of the Putnam County School Board said .
" He just laughed . "
The problem was n't that her home smelled a little fresher or looked a little tidier .
The problem was that Phillips had no idea who the mystery cleaner was .
Her husband denied cleaning up the joint .
So did her next - door neighbor .
Everyone she asked denied responsibility .
All she knew was the rugs were n't where she had left them that morning in June .
Trinkets had been rearranged and in the master bedroom , the bed was made differently .
It did n't look like anything had been stolen , but she could n't be sure .
Nearly a month passed before the mystery was solved .
Her son called her at work recently after a cleaning lady arrived at the front door .
As it turns out , her neighbor across the street , with a similar house number , the same number of rooms to be cleaned and a house key hidden in a similar spot outside , had hired a cleaning service .
" They just came to the wrong door , " Phillips said .
