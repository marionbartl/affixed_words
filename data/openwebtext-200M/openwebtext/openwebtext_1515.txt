College Football
Playoff will not expand to eight teams for 2020 season
I host a number of websites on a “ cloud ” service where they automatically bring webservers up and down to adjust to the need .
I was running into an error message the other day so I opened a chat with tech support :
Me : I ’m trying to create a mysql stored procedure , but I ’m getting error X .
Tech :
Oh no !
Me : Did I break the cloud ?
Tech :
You made it rain ;(
I think the world would be a much more interesting place if every tech support person was trained to say “ Oh no ! ” to whatever problem you present .
Notice that emoticon .
Frowning and winking at the same time is a bit hard to do .

It ’s been two and a half years since scandals at UltimateBet and Absolute Poker rocked the online poker world .
But new evidence is being reported on the superuser that allegedly won millions by cheating .
A blog post by Haley Hintze , a former reporter / writer for pokernews.com who covered the scandals , alleges that Scott Tom , Absolute Poker co-founder , was more than simply a part of the scandal or on the periphery , but that he was actively using superuser accounts at AP .
Here ’s what Hintze had to say in her blog post :
… Scott Tom was the real force behind the ongoing scandal at AP .
While there is a miniscule chance that the evidence was somehow doctored itself before it reached me , its content correlates so well with what I ’d already learned elsewhere that I believe it to be genuine .
In full and honest faith , I believe the images you ’ll see to undoctored , and that Scott Tom himself was the primary Absolute Poker cheater .
A little bit of backstory on the AP scandal , if you are unfamiliar with it or forget the details :
In the fall of 2007 , several accounts playing high - stakes games had drawn suspicion at Absolute Poker .
Despite playing against conventional strategy , several accounts were crushing high - stakes limit hold ’em cash games , well beyond what could be accounted for by statistical variance .
Many of the people looking into the case believed the accounts could see their opponents ’ hole cards , despite AP ’s assurances to the contrary .
The break in the case came when a user who had seen a thread at twoplustwo.com about the alleged “ superusers ” came forward about his experience during a $ 1,000 buy - in tournament , in which he was suspicious of the play of the tournament ’s winner — “ POTRIPPER . ”
The player had requested a hand history from AP , in which the hole cards of all the players were revealed .
It was now obvious that a superuser who could see his opponents ’ cards did exist .
IP addresses included in the file that this player provided allegedly linked Tom to the POTRIPPER account , but not closely enough for anyone to say that Tom has actually been using the account .
Until the new information that came into Hintze ’s possession .
In her blog , Hintze details a functionality of Absolute Poker ’s architecture called “ ieSnare , ” which assigns numbers to each computer that uses AP ’s software .
A previous account allegedly linked to Scott , well before the superuser scandal , called “ potchopper , ” showed Scott ’s device number .
Hintze went on to detail that the same device was used to log in to the “ POTRIPPER ” account .
A screenshot of the logins corresponds with the $ 1,000 tourney that POTRIPPER won , outlined above .
More from Hintze :
But wait , there ’s more , much much more , though I ’m only publishing a small percentage of it today .
Device “ 11451887 ” ( a /k/a Scott Tom ) was tied to more than just the PotRipper account ; it enjoyed a lengthy relationship over long stretches of time with several of the major cheating accounts .
Hintze also produced a screenshot of a transaction history for POTRIPPER that links Tom to the account further .
And she also produces more evidence that the highest levels of AP were involved with the account and the cover -up of the superuser scandal :
I mentioned those internal high - level directives to handle these cheating accounts with kid gloves .
Several such accounts carried special notations like PotRipper ’s : “ Please do not close this account for any reason .
Issues please consult with Brent , Adrian or Nolan . ”
So the customer - level support staff was being warned to leave these accounts alone , and this Brent is believed to be Brent Beckley , Scott Tom ’s step - brother , also involved with AP from its inception .
Hintze ends saying she plans to release a lot more information she has come into possession of , so the last of the AP / UB superuser scandals has not been heard .
Read the whole thing here .
Walking above the village of Mehrauli on Delhi ’s southern perimeter , we pass a woman with a half - empty bottle of water — one of several we have already noticed since daybreak .
Dressed immaculately in a brightly - colored sari , she emerges from behind a prickly bush on a tract of waste ground .
If she were a man we might not have merited such discretion .
India is about the only country in the world where you actually see human adults defecating .
When traveling by road or rail you can be struck by the image of men squatting openly , impervious to the public gaze .
The UN estimates that 600 million people — or 55 per cent of the Indian population — still defecate out of doors .
The practice is clearly born of necessity in a crowded country where the development of public amenities has conspicuously failed to keep pace with economic and demographic growth .
Conspicuous defecation , however , is restricted to males .
Female modesty — enjoined by Hinduism , Islam , and Sikhism alongside age - old patriarchal codes — dictates that women may relieve themselves only after dark , or in the most secluded reaches of the forest , a practice that exposes them to violence or even snake bites .
The consequences for women ’s health can be devastating .
Women of the poorest classes notoriously suffer from a range of urinary and bowel disorders born of taboos about pollution and other social constraints applied to the most basic and banal of bodily functions .
My companion and I are looking for the walls of Lal Kot — the oldest of Delhi ’s seven cities , dating from the tenth century , before the first Muslim invasion .
The three - kilometer walls enclose a space that has been largely abandoned to jungle .
The cladding of irregular quartzite blocks has been cut so accurately that no mortar was needed to hold them together .
Set high on a ridge overlooking the present - day city , Lal Kot is a magnificent outpost of a forgotten civilization — a worthy precursor to the great Delhi Sultanate that flourished during the centuries of Islamic rule , as well as to its grandiose successor , New Delhi , designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker barely two decades before Britain was forced to abandon its empire .
Lal Kot is far from the tourist trail .
To reach it you have to cross a large rubbish dump , and negotiate the odiferous detritus — what used to be known as night soil — left by Mehrauli ’s less favoured human residents .
They sleep rough , in old tombs or in flimsy home - made shacks erected near the open sewers that intersect the area ’s magnificent architectural monuments .
In the absence of municipal services , refuse disposal is performed by long - haired pigs , which eat up every kind of organic matter , not excluding human and canine waste .
( As Moses and Muhammad taught their followers , ham and bacon are best avoided in southern latitudes . )
The lack of sanitation is emblematic of India ’s failure as an emerging economic giant to include most of its population in its achievements .
India is now home to the fourth largest number of billionaires .
According to Tim Sebastian , the former BBC journalist who chairs a forum in Doha , Qatar , for debate about social and political issues in the Middle East , some 60 million people in India — who make up the world ’s most populous and most powerful middle class — now enjoy living standards higher than Britain and France .
Yet the vast majority are excluded from India ’s version of the American dream .
As a former government minister Mani Shankar Ayar told Sebastian :
“ We have a tiny elite that is obsessed with itself .
If democracy does n’t deliver for the rest — we could be heading for violence .
We ’re seeing a failure to bring 900 million people inside the system of entitlements .
Without entitlements , you pick up the gun . ”
A third of the country ’s districts are now facing rural insurgencies spearheaded by the Maoist Naxalites .
Is it not just a matter of time before violence spreads to major conurbations such as Delhi , home to 20 million people , many of them living on less than a dollar a day ?
A visit to one of Delhi ’s poorest quarters provides a glimmer of hope .
The Nizamuddin district takes its name from the shrine of a holy man — Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya ( 1238 –1325 ) — renowned for his religious inclusiveness , his commitment to the poor , his disdain for rulers , and a love of music and dance that set him apart from his more austere Muslim contemporaries .
The shrine attracts visitors from all over the Islamic world , as well as non-Muslim devotees .
It typifies the spiritual syncretism one finds in India , where the tombs of holy persons attract followers from all religions .
Until recently this run-down area was crammed with rural migrants and pilgrims hoping to benefit spiritually from the Shaikh ’s baraka ( blessedness ) , or materially by taking odd - jobs serving other pilgrims .
With no serviceable toilets available for pilgrims , the ground beneath the pillars of the overhead metro railway that is now under construction ( causing a huge disruption to Delhi ’s burgeoning traffic ) has become an open latrine , a magnet for flies and disease .
Now the Aga Khan Foundation , in partnership with other NGOs and agencies , is rehabilitating the area in a major initiative with the municipal corporation of Delhi .
Measures include the organized collection of refuse , the provision of public toilets managed by the community , where users are charged a small fee for cleaning and supervision , and the re-housing of squatters who had constructed precarious additions to the fourteenth - century baoli or stepwell — the water is reached by descending flights of steps — now being dredged and reconstituted using the latest radar technology .
The local government school in Nizamuddin has received a comprehensive make - over funded by the Aga Khan Foundation in collaboration with one of India ’s oldest charities , the Sir Ratan Tata Trust .
In addition to bright new classrooms , well - designed for children , a vital outcome of the project , the headmaster suggests , is the renovated toilet block with separate cubicles for girls and boys .
In Delhi—as in rural Gujarat , where similar conditions prevail — school drop - out rates have been highest among girls .
Purely cultural factors — such as the demands of mothers for domestic help — are partly responsible .
But teachers and aid workers see the lack of toilets as the primary reason girls have not been attending school , since there is no private place where they can relieve themselves .
A program for building school toilets in Gujarat I looked at several years ago has yielded not just improvements in family health and hygiene , but a marked increase in female school attendance .
Fifteen of the girls who took part in the program — whereby the children themselves cleaned the toilets — were going on to higher education .
Since the introduction of the new toilets in the Nizamuddin school , female drop - out rates have declined dramatically : the ratio of girls to boys attending the school is now 55 – 45 percent .
Living in London one takes the humble loo for granted .
A fortnight in Delhi reveals its potential for kick - starting a social revolution .
Lessons from the Brain : Toward an Intelligent Molecular Computer
Evolving patterns on this molecular processor mimic patterns displayed by the human brain .
Anirban Bandyopadhyay image .
A team of researchers from Japan and Michigan Technological University has built a molecular computer using lessons learned from the human brain .
Physicist Ranjit Pati of Michigan
Tech provided the theoretical underpinnings for this tiny computer composed not of silicon but of organic molecules on a gold substrate .
“ This molecular computer is the brainchild of my colleague Anirban Bandyopadhyay from the National Institute for Materials Science , ” says Pati .
Their work is detailed in “ Massively Parallel Computing on an Organic Molecule Layer , ” published April 25 online in Nature Physics .
“ Modern computers are quite fast , capable of executing trillions of instructions a second , but they ca n’t match the intelligent performance of our brain , ” says Pati .
“ Our neurons only fire about a thousand times per second .
But I can see you , recognize you , talk with you , and hear someone walking by in the hallway almost instantaneously , a Herculean task for even the fastest computer . ”
That ’s because information processing is done sequentially in digital computers .
Once a current path is established along a circuit , it does not change .
By contrast , the electrical impulses that travel through our brains follow vast , dynamic , evolving networks of neurons that operate collectively .
The researchers made their different kind of computer with DDQ , a hexagonal molecule made of nitrogen , oxygen , chlorine and carbon that self - assembles in two layers on a gold substrate .
The DDQ molecule can switch among four conducting states — 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 — unlike the binary switches — 0 and 1 — used by digital computers .
“ The neat part is , approximately 300 molecules talk with each other at a time during information processing , ” Pati says .
“ We have mimicked how neurons behave in the brain . ”
“ The evolving neuron - like circuit network allows us to address many problems on the same grid , which gives the device intelligence , " Pati says .
As a result , their tiny processor can solve problems for which algorithms on computers are unknown , especially interacting many - body problems , such as predictions of natural calamities and outbreaks of disease .
To illustrate this feature , they mimicked two natural phenomena in the molecular layer : heat diffusion and the evolution of cancer cells .
In addition , their molecular processor heals itself if there is a defect .
This property comes from the self - organizing ability of the molecular monolayer .
“ No existing man -made computer has this property , but our brain does , ” Bandyopadhyay says .
“ If a neuron dies , another neuron takes over its function . ”
“ This is very exciting , a conceptual breakthrough , ” Pati says .
“ This could change the way people think about molecular computing . ”
Pati ’s work at Michigan Tech is supported by the National Science Foundation .

NAJAF , Iraq —
No one man in Iraq has more power to change the outcome of the country ’s elections on Sunday than a frail cleric who lives in an ascetic house in this holy city .
And yet he has refused to wield it , shaping the relationship between Islam and the state at a crucial juncture in Iraq ’s history .
The cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , Iraq ’s senior Shiite spiritual leader , has repeatedly refused to endorse any of the electoral coalitions fighting for votes among the country ’s Shiite majority .
He did so most recently three days ago .
For a figure whose electoral blessing would be decisive , it reflects a reversal from the role he played in orchestrating a unified Shiite coalition during Iraq ’s first national elections in 2005 .
He has urged Iraqis to vote — implored them , in fact , in edicts that carry the weight of religious law — but insisted on maintaining the neutrality of the Shiite religious elite , known as the marjaiya , that he and three other senior clerics now represent .

I ’ve spent the last few days playing with my new iPad .
I do n’t really think of myself as an Apple fanboy , but evidence might be starting to mount .
I originally wanted an iPad for application testing – I ’m working on a few projects that would benefit from ultra-mobility and reasonable screen size .
To me this is a whole new category of device , and I wanted to get a real feel for what this thing was all about .
I already have or use the devices around the niche the iPad appears to be destined for – the MacBook , the iPhone , netbook – but I really did see this as Something Completely Different .
I desperately wanted to like the Windows Tablet ; I ’d been an early Palm user ( III / V / m105 ) and I tried two early generations ( a Compaq TC1000 and a Toshiba M205 ) .
I carried them from meeting to class to meeting , but it never clicked .
I saw the potential , but the experience was truly lacking for me .
Yes , I am still ticked off that there ’s no Flash – I enjoy building apps in Flex and AIR .
I ’m even more disappointed that Apple appears to have removed the blue brick icon when a missing plugin is needed for page content .
I have yet to see one in Safari when browsing Web sites .
This was serving as an ensign for the Flash community .
If Apple has indeed removed this emblem , perhaps Flash developers should put that icon in the alternate content area of the embed / object tag .
[ Update 4/13/10 : Someone has done precisely that ]
But the real amazing thing to me has been all the vitriol about the iPad – it ’s like the usual unsocialized nonsense of Slashdot has exploded all over the Web .
It frankly reminds me of the early days of Twitter – “ Why would anyone want to know what I had for breakfast ? ” was the usual slant .
And that showed that they did n’t * get it *
I also feel the same sort of guarded optimism as I did with Twitter – something ’s different here .
Now that folks with an inclination to develop have the actual devices , There Will Be Code .
And from that code will come new kinds of applications and uses that we have only begun to consider .
A Home Office advertising campaign that highlights one of Labour 's key election policies on crime and policing is to be banned by the advertising industry watchdog , the Guardian has learned .
The Advertising Standards Authority has told the Home Office that its television adverts highlighting the government 's " policing pledge " that neighbourhood officers can now be expected to spend 80 % of their time on the beat is to be banned with immediate effect .
The ASA says in an adjudication to be published next week that the television ad breaches its " legal , decent , honest , truthful " code because it is misleading on at least three counts .
" The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form .
We told the Home Office to ensure the basis of claims was made clear in future .
We also told them to ensure they held adequate substantiation for future claims , " says the final ASA adjudication , leaked to the Guardian .
The decision is embarrassing to Gordon Brown and the home secretary , Alan Johnson , who highlighted the neighbourhood policing pledge this month which was central to Labour 's crime and justice policy in the coming election campaign .
Labour has already issued a campaign video in effect accusing the Tories of being the " burglar 's friend " for opposing the retention of DNA profiles of innocent people and the extension of CCTV coverage .
The ASA said the ad was misleading because while it said that 80 % of officers ' time would be spent " on the beat " , it did not make it clear this included duties other than patrolling the streets .
It also said the ad did not make it sufficiently clear that the pledge does n't apply to all 140,000 police officers in England and Wales , but only the 13,500 neighbourhood constables and 16,000 community support officers in neighbourhood policing teams .
The watchdog is also concerned that the advertised standard for time on the beat is not actually being met and " [ the advert ] does not make clear the commitment would not necessarily be delivered " .
The ban follows a decision by the UK Statistics Authority to censure the Conservatives for their " misleading " use of violent crime statistics , raising the prospect that law and order will become one of the most disputed battlegrounds in the coming campaign .
The banned film is part of a Home Office campaign of TV , radio , press and online adverts launched last November to highlight the policing pledge , which makes clear what the public can expect from the police .
The offending promise was also included in a leaflet delivered to more than 6 million households in 60 areas across the country .
Chief constables across England and Wales signed up to the pledge in December 2008 which committed them to a national minimum standard of policing for the first time , including the promise that neighbourhood police officers would spend 80 % of their time on the beat .
The watchdog launched its investigation after two viewers made official complaints , challenging whether the 80 % claim could be substantiated and claiming it was misleading .
The Home Office told them that the pledge actually committed neighbourhood policing teams , but not all frontline police officers , to spending 80 % of their time " visibly working in neighbourhoods .
That included , for example , public meetings and school visits as well as patrolling the streets . "
Although all 43 forces in England and Wales signed up more than 15 months ago to the pledge , the latest report by Her Majesty 's Inspector of Constabulary , published five months ago , showed that 35 were falling short of the required standard .
Some forces are not even monitoring the amount of time officers spend " working visibly " in their neighbourhoods .
The policing pledge was billed as the most radical reform from the government 's shake - up of policing , and is supposed to entitle the public to a consistent national minimum standard of service from the police – including response times to 999 calls .
The ad campaign also focused on a promise that the public can make an appointment to see the local police at a time that suits them within 48 hours about a non-emergency problem .
The Home Office has stated that " as of January 2009 is being delivered by all 43 police forces " .
Polling published at the same time that the advertising campaign was launched showed that only 3 % of people think that their local police spend 75 % of their time on the beat in their area .
Gordon Brown , in his crime speech earlier this month , set out what he described as " new neighbourhood policing strategy " which includes the pledge for neighbourhood police to spend 80 % of their time on the beat , a response to non-emergency issues within 24 hours and a public right to monthly beat meetings to discuss priorities .
A Home Office spokesperson said : " We are extremely disappointed by the ASA 's decision as the advert was approved by the recognised body prior to its broadcast .
We believe that ' on the beat ' is a recognised term for what the police do whilst working in neighbourhoods and engaging with communities .
This can be patrolling , talking to the public in the street , attending a residents ' meeting , challenging people 's actions and of course , where necessary , making arrests .
We also believe that the adverts made it explicitly clear in the voiceover that it was neighbourhood policing teams who would be on the beat . "
" We believe it is important to inform the public that they have a right to expect these national minimum standards , which is why we launched an advertising campaign to highlight these promises .
Unless the public know what they have been promised , they cannot then hold their local forces to account if they fail to achieve the standard . "
In Nov. 2008 I applied for the United States Border Patrol and passed the written test with a 93 % .
I was a very good student , had years of Spanish under my belt , and was more physically fit than many of the kids my age .
I was READY to work the Border .
As the hiring process went on I passed everything beautifully , like I knew I would , like the oral , medical , physical exams and even the majority of the background investigation .
I remember waiting anxiously for any news about my status , seeing that I would be graduating from college in less than 6 months and was ready to have a job lined up .
I got a call one day from a polygraph examiner by the name of Mike Cerot ( or Serot ) who basically TOLD me that I had to report to take a polygraph on a specific day at a specific time less than a week away .
Being ready for a job and having nothing to hide I made the 400 + mile drive to the nearest CBP location to take the test .
I did n't research polygraphs because I did n't have anything to hide and was n't even nervous .
I remember getting to the building and waiting in the waiting room .
Mr. Cerot came out to greet me and led me to a window - less conference room in the office suite .
There was one door in , a large table spanning the length of the room in the middle and two chairs at the far end of the room , one in the corner .
I was directed to sit in the chair in the corner and told to relax while I watched as Mr. Cerot set up a laptop and attached various cords and whatnots to it .
I was actually interested and intrigued as to how the whole process worked .
While he was setting it up he began explaining to me that he has performed polygraph examinations for over ten years with the Central Intelligence Agency and is now working with the Customs and Border Protection to polygraph new applicants .
I remember him telling me " Your body is going to tell me if you lie .
You are going to know it , and you are going to make it known to me .
Let me tell you , this never fails .
It always works .
Always . "
I did n't know what to make of that and I actually believed that my body would let him know .
( Had I done some research I would 've known that he was full of crap and that he was using scare tactics on me ) .
Once he was done setting up he began talking to me and asking me all sorts of questions asking about personal relationships ( " Do you hate your parents ? " ) and weird questions ( " Have you ever had sex with any domesticated animals ? " ) , all of which - even though weird - I answered truthfully .
This little interview did n't last very long and Mr. Cerot was very reassuring adding comments about his own personal experiences that seemed to match mine .
He told me that he was going to hook me up to the machine so he could get it tuned and explained each of the parts to me as he put them on .
I was still fascinated by it .
We began a practice test which consisted of him writing the number 4 on a piece of paper and having me say " no " when asked if the number was a 4 .
I thought it was stupid and pointless at the time , but whatever , this guy knows what he is doing .
When the real test was about to begin he said he would go over the questions to make sure I was n't surprised by any of them .
I can't remember them all now , but they were common questions about lying to loved ones , stealing , using drugs , etc. etc ... things I have n't ever experienced or had a problem with .
We did the test .
It took a while .
I felt completely comfortable and fine .
We took the test again .
Same thing .
Fine as wine .
After the third time the test ended Mr. Cerot ( who had appeared friendly to me throughout the entire experience ) became very agitated and began typing and clicking on his laptop .
I just continued to sit in my chair , happy to be done with the test and wondering when I could go to the bathroom and have a break ( we had been in the room for almost 3 hours ) .
With a loud exhaled breath Mr. Cerot became angry and spun the laptop around showing me a series of graphs with waves running across the screen .
He said to me " DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT ? "
" No . "
" THIS IS QUESTION 3 .
YOU HAVE BEEN HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME , SHOWN EACH TIME YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION ( pointing to a specific crested section of the charts ) .
DO YOU KNOW WHAT QUESTION 3 IS ? "
" No . "
" QUESTION 3 IS THE DRUG QUESTION . "
When he said those words , my mind went berserk .
I had never even SEEN or SMELLED any drugs !
How could I fail THIS question ????
Out of all of them , the DRUG one ?!?!?
I was so shocked !
I did n't know what to say to him and I imagine that I looked white as a ghost .
I remember him saying " You are n't telling me something .
I know it .
You know it .
Tell me what it is .
If you tell me what it is I can make it all go away .
I have a magic eraser that can make anything go away , as long as you tell me what it is . "
I was scared to death .
I sat there trying to think of anything that I had experienced in my lifetime that would even be close to USING DRUGS .
I remember shaking my head constantly and repeating " I have n't ever done anything like that " ...
At that time he said " Alright .
Im going to give you a break to walk around and use the bathroom , and I am going to make some calls . "
I was booted into the hallway outside of the suite .
I could n't breathe , my mind was racing , searching , struggling to find something .
Anything .
Nothing was coming to mind .
I waited in agony for 15 minutes racking my brain until I was invited to come back into the suite .
We went back into the room and sat back down .
It felt different that time .
His attitude made me feel like he was going to pull out some rolled up torture tools and start pulling out my fingernails ... " SO " he asked " have you thought of anything you want to tell me ? "
" No .
I honestly can't think of anything to tell you sir " I said holding back my tears .
I was SO frustrated !
" Well I am afraid that there is nothing I can do for you further if you are n't going to tell me what you are hiding .
I know that you are hiding this from me and I do n't know why .
Like I said , I can make things go away .
A guy that I tested yesterday admitted to using drugs 3500 times and guess what ...
HE gets a job !
It 's that simple .
If you are done talking then I am afraid that we are done here .
You can't ignore this .
THIS is huge .
Like ignoring a 400 pound Gorilla in the room . "
I was absolutely devastated inside .
Physically , mentally and emotionally drained .
When I told my family and friends that I failed the test because of suspected drug use , they all laughed and thought I was joking with them ; knowing that I do n't have / never have had anything to do with drugs .
Some people suggested that they were just messing with me to see if I would change my attitude or admit something during the test , something I tried to believe .
I got a letter in the mail two days after graduation informing me that I was no longer being considered an applicant for the Border Patrol .
It haunted me .
I was petrified of the drug question and polygraphs .
I remember asking myself at random times " Have you ever used illegal drugs ? " and then responding to myself with a stern " NO . "
Applying for police officer positions in the United States that do n't require applicants to take a polygraph is tough .
The only state that does n't require polygraphs is Michigan , and they are laying off more police officers than anywhere .
I applied and tested for a PD in Northeastern Wyoming in May of 09 .
Passed everything gloriously , except for one question .
On the polygraph .
The question that I had been DREADING hearing since the last time it was asked of me .
I failed .
The examiner called me a liar and told me that I was full of $ hit and that he was n't buying any of my story .
I did n't get that job .
The polygraph has haunted me .
I am thankful for this site because I NOW know that I am not alone in my struggle and that many are struggling with me , ESPECIALLY now since seeing the article recently put out about the Border Patrol 's failure of 60 % of the total 10 % of applicants over the past hiring year .
With my career in jeopardy , I do n't know where to turn .
I want to be a police officer but I have a very large mountain in my way resembling the polygraph .
At 23 , I am now forced to stick with my security job or entirely change careers .
Good luck everyone .
And thanks for letting me vent .
I was set to graduate in May of 2009 from a great school with a Bachelor 's Degree in Law Enforcement .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Iceland ’s Eyjafjallajökull Volcano burst into life for the first time in 190 years on March 20 , 2010 .
A 500 - meter - ( 2,000 - foot ) long fissure opened in the Fimmvörduháls pass to the west of the ice - covered summit of Eyjafjallajökull .
Lava fountains erupted fluid magma , which quickly built several hills of bubble - filled lava rocks ( scoria ) along the vent .
A lava flow spread northeast , spilling into Hrunagil Gully .
This natural - color satellite image shows lava fountains , lava flows , a volcanic plume , and steam from vaporized snow .
The image was acquired on March 24 , 2010 , by the Advanced Land Imager ( ALI ) aboard NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite .
The lava fountains are orange - red , barely visible at the 10 - meter ( 33 - foot ) resolution of the satellite .
The scoria cones surrounding the fissure are black , as is the lava flow extending to the northeast .
White volcanic gases escape from the vent and erupting lava , while a steam plume rises where the hot lava meets snow .
( The bright green color along the edge of the lava flow is an artifact of the sensor . )
The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull was presaged by a series of earthquakes starting in early March .
Over time , the earthquakes rose towards the surface , and land near the volcano rose at least 40 millimeters ( 2 inches ) — both indications that magma was moving underneath the volcano .
The eruption continued through at least March 26th , and may continue for several more months .
Previous eruptions in the area have caused flooding due to the melting of glacial ice ( a Jökulhlaup ) , but the current eruption is in an area covered by winter snow , not permanent ice .
Although some past eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull were followed by larger , explosive eruptions at nearby Katla Volcano , there is currently no sign of activity at Katla .

Detective Comics
No 27 sells for more than $ 1 m , beating record set by book featuring rival superhero

This article is more than 10 years old
The 70 - year - old comic book in which Batman made his debut has sold at auction for more than $ 1 m ( £ 655,000 ) , breaking a record set earlier this week by a Superman comic .
The rare copy of Detective Comics No 27 , which cost 10 cents when it was first sold in 1939 , fetched $ 1,075,500 from an anonymous buyer on Thursday , according to Heritage Auction Galleries .
" It pretty much blew away all our expectations and now it 's the highest price ever raised for a comic book , " said Barry Sandoval , director of operations of Heritage 's comics division .
A copy of the first comic book featuring Superman , a 1938 edition of Action Comics No 1 , sold on Monday for $ 1 m in a deal between a private seller and private buyer .
The transaction was conducted by the New York City auction site ComicConnect.com .
" We can really say that Batman has nosed out Superman , at least for now , " Sandoval said .
He said the seller had bought the Batman comic in the late 1960s for $ 100 .
With a bright yellow background , it features Batman swinging on a rope above city rooftops .
" That cover is one of the most famous of all comic book covers , " Sandoval said .
JC Vaughn , associate publisher of The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide , said most people had predicted it would be the comics with the first appearance of Superman and Batman that broke the $ 1 m barrier .
Both comics that sold this week were in great condition , scoring an 8.0 on a scale that goes to 10 , he said .
George Pantela , owner of GP Analysis , based in Melbourne , Australia , which tracks sales of certified comics from more than 20 auction houses and dealers , said the previous record was about $ 317,000 , paid a year ago for a lesser - grade Action Comics
No 1 than the one sold this week .
Vincent Zurzolo , chief operating officer of Comicconnect.com , said : " It 's an exciting week in comic books when you have two comics selling for $ 1 million . "

As well as naming Guy Rundle and Liam Byrne , Jones specifically refers to an article of mine , written at the time of the Israeli invasion of Gaza , called The Warsaw ghetto uprising – it is right to fight back .
He says :
Self - described ‘ revolutionary ’ John Passant published a blog post ―
The Warsaw Ghetto uprising – it is right to fight back , making an analogy between the fascist Hamas movement and Ghetto - fighters , and Israel with Nazi Germany .
Actually I praised the incredible courage of the Jewish resistance in Warsaw against the Nazis and the inspiration it provided for the 1944 Uprising .
I finished off the article this way :
What courage , what humanity the Warsaw Ghetto Jews showed in resisting the monolith of Nazism .
There is a universal message here .
It was right then to fight back against the Nazi occupiers .
It is right now , even in the face of overwhelming force , to resist foreign occupation and invasion .
Evidently it is this paragraph which , in Jones ’s words is ‘ intellectually and racially / religiously offensive … to the Jewish community . ’
Of course the criticism is nonsense and elides anti-zionism into anti-semitism .
As I have written elsewhere on this blog , anti-zionism is not anti-semitism .
The accusation is designed to shut down debate about Israeli crimes and the nature of the Israeli regime .
Marek Edelman , hero of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , wrote a letter in 2002 to the Palestinians , prompted by the Israeli show trial of Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti .
Here is how Paul Foot , writing in the Guardian , described it :
Now in his 80s , Mr Edelman wrote a letter early this month to Palestinian leaders .
Though the letter criticised the suicide bombers , its tone infuriated the Israeli government and its press .
He wrote in a spirit of solidarity from a fellow resistance fighter , as a former leader of a Jewish uprising not dissimilar in desperation to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories .
He addressed his letter to “ commanders of the Palestinian military , paramilitary and partisan operations – to all the soldiers of the Palestinian fighting organisations ” .
The references to the partisans and fighting organisations show clearly that Edelman was identifying with the Palestinian resistance .
While it is easy to defame me with accusations of anti-semitism , it is not so easy to do that with one of the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising , a man who remained a fierce opponent of zionism all his life .
A freedom fighter himself , Edelman saw in the Palestinians the next generation of freedom fighters and with his words drew the analogy between the Warsaw Ghetto resistance and the resistance of the Palestinians .
As he said , ‘ to be a Jew always means always being with the oppressed and never the oppressors . ’
It was this ‘ siding with the oppressed ’ and fighting the oppressors that gave Edelman the moral authority to both write to the Palestinians as brothers in arms and to then criticise suicide bombings and the futility of such actions , actions the ghetto fighters never undertook .
A word document copy of his letter is here .
Here is how David Rosenberg put it in a comment on a blog after Edelman ’s death :
The arguments about who has the right to claim the history of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and the holocaust more generally and for what purpose were addressed by Edelman himself .
In common with a number of other Bundist survivors he was angered by any attempt by Israel ’s leaders to appropriate the Holocaust and use it to justify its political / military actions .
He made clear on many occasions that he opposed Israel ’s continued occupation of Palestinian territory , while urging Palestinian leaders ( whom he poignantly addressed as “ soldiers of the Palestinian Fighting Organisations ” ) to firmly reject terroristic methods of advancing their struggle .
But the general conclusion he drew from the experience is that this history belongs to no one exclusively but to everyone : that humanity must fight for equality , democracy , human dignity and human rights wherever these are threatened or suppressed .
And addressing himself particularly to those Jews who drew a narrow nationalist lesson from the tragedy that was inflicted by the Nazis , he stated simply that “ to be a Jew always means always being with the oppressed and never the oppressors ” .
Like Edelman , I and many others on the Left side with the oppressed against the oppressors .
That is the reason apologists for Zionism attack us , just as they ferociously attacked Edelman .
Time Magazine and Jon Stewart have taken up a cause that I think is long overdue .
Calling out Fox News for its blatant lies and deceptions occurring ever more frequently .
Fox News with its motto of “ Fair and Balanced ” is yet again engaging in self - deception about how the Fox News Network is run .
Time and again there are cases where the network deliberately lies and deceives the public all too often about its own news broadcasts .
News media cannot afford such muddying the truth and outright prevarications – it taints all news organizations with the attitude that “ Fox only does it because everybody else shades the truth or fails to provide dissenting viewpoints ” .
Jon Stewart deserves credit for being “ on the story ” first and with pluck and black humor .
Time gets kudos for exposing Fox News and its blatant misrepresentations so explicitly .
The Time report on Bill O’Reilly catches Bill blatantly lying to his viewers .
O’Reilly takes to task Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma who had called into question FOX reporting that stated that not getting health insurance would lead to fines and imprisonment .
Here is Bill O’Reilly ’s blatant lie :
“ We researched on Fox News if anybody had ever said you ’re going to jail if you do n’t buy health insurance .
Nobody ’s ever said it . ”
Time was able to produce half a dozen quotes from Fox News broadcasts that clearly have Fox News reporters saying things like Glen Beck – “ But if you do n’t play by their new rules on health care — oh , here ’s a new little twist .
Have you heard this ?
You ’re going to be looking at a fun little stint in jail . ”
Now Time has graciously supplied Tom Coburn with an opportunity to pick up some campaign funding .
He can sue Fox News for libel and slander .
This is only said half in jest because one of the best ways to get Rupert Murdoch to control the “ fair and balanced ” Fox News is to hit him constantly in the pocket book .
The constant suits , most of which he should lose , the drain on profitability and credibility might loosen the notions of Fox News and Roger Ailes being worth the while .
Around noon he asked for a pad of paper and scribbled
LSD - try it
intermuscular
100mm
In a letter circulated to Aldous 's friends , Laura Huxley described what followed : ' You know very well the uneasiness in the medical mind about this drug .
But no ' authority ' , not even an army of authorities , could have stopped me then .
I went into Aldous 's room with the vial of LSD and prepared a syringe .
The doctor asked me if I wanted him to give the shot - maybe because he saw that my hands were trembling .
His asking me that made me conscious of my hands , and I said , ' No , I must do this . '
An hour later she gave Huxley a second 100 mm .
Then she began to talk , bending close to his ear , whispering , ' light and free you let go , darling ; forward and up .
You are going forward and up ; you are going toward the light .
Willingly and consciously you are going , willingly and consciously , and you are doing this beautifully — you are going toward the light — you are going toward a greater love …
You are going toward Maria 's [ Huxley 's first wife , who had died many years earlier ] love with my love .
You are going toward a greater love than you have ever known .
You are going toward the best , the greatest love , and it is easy , it is so easy , and you are doing it so beautifully . '
All struggle ceased .
The breathing became slower and slower and slower until , ' like a piece of music just finishing so gently in sempre piu piano , dolcamente , ' at twenty past five in the afternoon , Aldous Huxley died .
( CNN ) --
A fifth heart attack , such as the one suffered this week by former Vice President Dick Cheney , is not rare because of advances in modern medicine , cardiologists say .
" It 's something we see often enough that we 're not surprised about it , " said Dr. Cam Patterson , chief of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine , who is not involved in Cheney 's care .
" But it 's also an indication that somebody has some luck on their side . "
More patients are surviving multiple heart attacks because of procedures and drugs , Patterson said .
" We have patients who are taken to the [ cardiac catheterization labs ] to have blocked arteries opened up , " he said .
" We have stents to keep blocked arteries opened and high - potency drugs like statins that protect against risk factors that make heart disease progress rapidly . "
Although these options help heart disease patients , they may not prevent another heart attack .
Patients who 've suffered a heart attack usually have more blockages in other vessels that were n't problematic earlier .
But over time , the blockage builds and could cause future heart attacks , doctors said .
Cheney , 69 , went to the George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains Monday and underwent a stress test and a heart catheterization , according to his office .
In a cardiac catheterization , a thin , flexible tube is threaded into the heart , usually from the groin or the arm , to examine blood pressure within the heart and how much oxygen is in the blood .
Cheney has a long history of heart problems .
He suffered his first heart attack in 1978 , when he was 37 .
He had his second heart attack in 1984 and a third in 1988 and underwent a quadruple bypass surgery to unblock his arteries .
Shortly after Cheney was elected vice president in November 2000 , he had a fourth heart attack and received a stent to open an artery .
In some cases , even patients who follow instructions do not respond to therapies and drugs , and they continue to get heart attacks , said Dr. Randall Starling , vice chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic , who also is not involved in Cheney 's care .
" I 'd like to believe that if patients take their meds , exercise , they 're on a great diet , they reduce their risk , " he said .
" But unfortunately , there are patients who have progressive disease even by following all their doctor 's orders .
That 's where some of the genetics get into things . "
In 2001 , doctors implanted a monitoring device to keep track of Cheney 's heart rhythm and slow it down if necessary .
In 2008 , he underwent a procedure to restore his heart to a normal rhythm after doctors found that he was experiencing a recurrence of the condition , known as atrial fibrillation .
Since Cheney left office in 2009 , the former vice president has remained visible , appearing on political talk shows , most recently on ABC's " This Week , " where he was highly critical of President Obama 's policies .
Cheney is expected to be discharged from the hospital in the next day or two , according to his office .
This month , former President Clinton was also hospitalized briefly because of a heart problem .
Clinton received two stents to restore blood flow to a coronary artery after doctors discovered blockage .
The two have heart disease .
This condition is the leading cause of death in the United States ; more than 630,000 people die each year from it , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Having the kind of medical care that Clinton and Cheney receive increases the chances of the patient 's survival .
" There is very strong data that shows both access to care and socioeconomic status has marked impact on outcomes with people with heart disease , " said Patterson , director of the UNC McAllister Heart Institute .
And even after several heart attacks , someone like Cheney can continue to live an active life .
" If his heart function remains strong , he 's got good medical care and is taking care of risk factors , he can be in very good shape , " Patterson said .
CNN 's John King contributed to this report .
HONG KONG — The Heavenly Palace , the first module in China ’s permanent space station , will be launched next year , a senior aerospace official confirmed Wednesday .
The official , Qi Faren , said the craft , an orbiting laboratory known in Mandarin as Tiangong - 1 , would initially serve as a docking station for other spacecraft .
His remarks were carried by Xinhua , the official news agency .
A model of the module was unveiled during New Year celebrations last year .
The 8.5 - ton laboratory is expected to be 30 feet long , with a crew of three .
The China National Space Administration said it planned three docking missions with the lab next year .
The space agency ’s long - range plans include a permanent space station that will incorporate the Tiangong - 1 , and a lunar mission by 2022 .
China ’s space program has made major inroads since it launched its first satellite in April 1970 , a craft called Dong Fang Hong - 1 , or The East Is Red .
In October 2003 , China ’s first manned spacecraft made 14 orbits of the Earth .
The country ’s first spacewalk took place 18 months ago .
Aerospace experts and military officials say the Chinese military space program has made significant advancements in recent years , notably when it tested an antisatellite system in 2007 , using a ballistic missile to shoot down one of its own weather satellites 540 miles up .
Posted by John , January 18th , 2010 - under Rudd Government , Rudd Labor , Tax .
Australians think we should tax the rich and big business more and the poor and middle income earners less .
And we should spend more on health and education .
These are the unsurprising findings of a Per Capita tax survey of 1000 Australians released yesterday .
Per Capita summarises its findings this way :
Australians believe in a progressive tax system and a society that invests in the provision of public goods and services …
Compare the desires of Australians with the actions of the Rudd Labor Government .
It has just received two reports into tax ; reports it commissioned to justify more tax largesse to capital .
One , by the Australian Financial Centre forum , recommends that government establish ‘ an investment manager regime to reduce or eliminate the tax burden on non-resident investors using local managers , brokers or other agents … ’
It wants less regulation of the foreign funds .
Once again finance capital has raised its dream of using our money to make Australia a regional – it used to be global – financial centre .
New York .
London .
Sydney .
I do n’t see it .
In other words , set up a tax haven in Australia for Wall Street .
That ’s a good strategy .
Import the thinking that gave us the global financial crisis into the country .
At the height of the impact of that crisis in Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd railed against ‘ extreme capitalism and bankers ’ greed ’ .
If he adopts this report ’s recommendations then he will have , unsurprisingly , joined them .
Labor ’s policies are neoliberalism with a keynesian tinge .
This is a government that says one populist thing after another and then implements policies for its rich mates .
The second report is the Henry Tax Review .
Henry is the head of Treasury and has been arguing for less taxes on capital .
Labor will agree , perhaps adding in a few tax cuts for low income earners .
Neoliberalism with a keynesian tinge can do little else .
Yet this lessening of tax on capital will only , in the long term , exacerbate the problems of capitalism .
As I wrote in Real tax reform : a love letter to Ken Henry :
… my proposals relate to the tax system as it is , but from a perspective that recognises that within the exploitative relationship there is a need to understand and recognise that labour creates all the wealth of society in the productive sector .
For that reason taxation should fall lightly on the labour of workers ( if at all ) and heavily on capital and the income of capital and their managers .
Of course Labor wo n’t tax the rich .
They rule for them .
As I wrote in Why wo n’t Labor tax the rich ? :
Labor wo n’t tax the rich because it believes in the primacy of profit and the lie of the trickle down theory – what ’s good for the rich is good for the rest of us .
Listen to voters , Labor , and not your big business mates .
Tax the rich , tax big business , tax the polluters .
Spend the extra money on health and education .
How much does weed cost ?
I do n’t have a medical card nor do I grow illegally so I have to go out and find marijuana on the “ black market . ”
One question that comes up often when talking to weed smokers all over is “ how much should weed cost ? ”
It ’s an interesting question that depends on a lot of different factors .
Here are a few things that go into determining the price of the weed you put into your bong bowl :
How good is the weed ?
Obviously , the dankest of the dank will run you more than a bag of swag .
How to tell if your weed is good is a whole separate topic , but if you have been smoking for a while , you will know what you like .
What part of the world do you live in ?
I have lived in many different parts of the U.S.
And prices very wildly .
I have paid as much as $ 70 for an eighth of an ounce and less then half of that in other parts .
How good is your “ connection ? ”
This is a big factor .
If you are buying weed from a cool person who you are friends with , you are less likely to get shorted or taxed ( for those of you who do n’t know , this is the extra $ 5 to $ 10 someone could charge on top of the actual cost ) .
That ’s the risk you run when you buy from strangers .
Is it harvest time locally ?
This is only important if you live in a place that marijuana grows well outdoors .
When harvest time comes around , everyone is working to get rid of their crop at the same time , which brings the prices way down .
Yes , the concept of supply and demand even applies to the weed market .
All these factors combine to create a fair market price for your area .
In Oregon , I consider $ 25 - $ 40 for an eighth of an ounce ( 3.5 grams ) or $ 150 – $ 250 for an ounce ( 28 grams ) to be an average price for some good weed ( no seeds , no unnecessary stems , well manicured , good smell , ect ) .
But that ’s Oregon where some of the best marijuana is grown ( and a lot of it too ! ) so maybe I ’m spoiled .
I invite you to post what the average price for weed in your area is .
If you have a medical exception and your state has marijuana dispensaries , your input is also welcome .
I do n’t want this to become a “ meet - a - dealer ” advertising board but I think this is constructive debate that would be helpful for folks who want to know if they are getting ripped off or not .
P.S. No names or anything incriminating please !
“ Big brother ” could be watching !
While most of these wonders will be known to a few people , they are , on the whole , not as well known as the famous “ seven wonders ” .
Despite that , each has a reason for being considered wonderful and deserves its spot on this list .
Enjoy the list and be sure to share other lesser - known wonders in the comments
10 . Banaue Rice Terraces - Philippines
The Banaue Rice Terraces are 2000 - year old terraces that were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people .
The Rice Terraces are commonly referred to by Filipinos as the “ Eighth Wonder of the World ” .
It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment , largely by hand .
The terraces are located approximately 1500 meters ( 5000 ft ) above sea level and cover 10,360 square kilometers ( about 4000 square miles ) of mountainside .
They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces .
It is said that if the steps are put end to end it would encircle half the globe .
Locals to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces .
The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic “ steps ” , which need constant reconstruction and care .
9.Sigiriya - Sri Lanka
Sigiriya ( Lion ’s rock ) is an ancient rock fortress and palace ruin situated in the central Matale District of Sri Lanka , surrounded by the remains of an extensive network of gardens , reservoirs , and other structures .
A popular tourist destination , Sigiriya is also renowned for its ancient paintings ( frescos ) , which are reminiscent of the Ajanta Caves of India .
The Sigiriya was built during the reign of King Kassapa I ( AD 477 – 495 ) , and it is one of the seven World Heritage Sites of Sri Lanka .
Sigiriya may have been inhabited through prehistoric times .
It was used as a rock - shelter mountain monastery from about the 5th century BC , with caves prepared and donated by devotees to the Buddhist Sangha .
8.Tower of Hercules - Spain
The Tower of Hercules is an ancient Roman lighthouse on a peninsula about 2.4 kilometers ( 1.5 miles ) from the centre of A Coruña , Galicia , in north - western Spain .
The name Corunna is said to be derived from the ancient column .
The structure is 55 meters ( 180 ft ) tall and overlooks the North Atlantic coast of Spain .
It is almost 1900 years old , was rehabilitated in 1791 , and is the oldest Roman lighthouse still used as a lighthouse .
7.Toruń - Poland
Toruń is a city in northern Poland , on the Vistula River .
The medieval old town of Toruń is the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus .
The first settlement in the vicinity is dated by archaeologists to 1100 BC .
During medieval times , in the 7th - 13th centuries , it was the location of an old Polish settlement , at a ford in the river .
The Teutonic Knights built a castle in the vicinity of the Polish settlement in the years 1230 - 31 .
In 1263 Franciscan monks settled in the city , followed in 1239 by Dominicans .
In 1264 the nearby New Town was founded .
In 1280 , the city ( or as it was then , both cities ) joined the mercantile Hanseatic League and was soon turned into an important medieval trade centre .
As you can see from the photograph above , it is a beautiful medieval city and well worth visiting .
6.Ajanta Caves - India
The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra , India are rock - cut cave monuments dating from the second century BC , containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art .
By AD 480 the caves at Ajanta were abandoned .
During the next 1300 years the jungle grew back and the caves were hidden , unvisited and undisturbed until the Spring of 1819 when a British officer in the Madras army entered the steep gorge on the trail of a tiger .
Somehow , deep within the tangled undergrowth , he came across the almost hidden entrance to one of the caves .
Exploring that first cave , long since a home to nothing more than birds and bats and a lair for other , larger , animals , Captain Smith wrote his name in pencil on one of the walls .
Still faintly visible , it records his name and the date , April 1819 .
5.Valley of Flowers - India
The Valley of Flowers is an outstandingly beautiful high - altitude Himalayan valley that has been acknowledged as such by renowned mountaineers and botanists in literature for over a century and in Hindu mythology for much longer .
Its ‘ gentle ’ landscape , breathtakingly beautiful meadows of alpine flowers and ease of access complement the rugged , mountain wilderness for which the inner basin of Nanda Devi National Park is renowned .
Valley of flower is splashed with colour as it bloomed with hundreds different beautiful flowers , taking on various shades of colours as time progressed .
Valley was declared a national park in 1982 , and now it is a World Heritage Site .
The locals , of course , always knew of the existence of the valley , and believed that it was inhabited by fairies .
4.Metéora
The Metéora ( “ suspended rocks ” ) is one of the largest and most important complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Greece , second only to Mount Athos .
The six monasteries are built on natural sandstone rock pillars , at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the Pineios river and Pindus Mountains , in central Greece .
Access to the monasteries was originally ( and deliberately ) difficult , requiring either long ladders lashed together or large nets used to haul up both goods and people .
This required quite a leap of faith – the ropes were replaced , so the story goes , only “ when the Lord let them break ” .
3.Bagan - Myanmar
Bagan is an ancient city in the Mandalay Division of Burma .
Formally titled Arimaddanapura or Arimaddana ( the City of the Enemy Crusher ) and also known as Tambadipa ( the Land of Copper ) or Tassadessa ( the Parched Land ) , it was the ancient capital of several ancient kingdoms in Burma .
Bagan was submitted to become a UNESCO heritage site [ 1 ] but many speculate of politics as partly the reason for the exclusion .
UNESCO does not designate Bagan as a World Heritage Site .
The main reason given is that the military junta ( SPDC ) has haphazardly restored ancient stupas , temples and buildings , ignoring original architectural styles and using modern materials which bear little or no resemblance to the original designs .
Nevertheless , this is still a must - see wonder of the world .
2.Leptis Magna - Libya
Leptis Magna was a prominent city of the Roman Empire .
Its ruins are located in Al Khums , Libya , 130 km east of Tripoli , on the coast where the Wadi Lebda meets the sea .
The site is one of the most spectacular and unspoiled Roman ruins in the Mediterranean .
The city appears to have been founded by Phoenician colonists sometime around 1100 BC , although it did not achieve prominence until Carthage became a major power in the Mediterranean Sea in the 4th century BC .
It nominally remained part of Carthage ’s dominions until the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then became part of the Roman Republic , although from about 200 BC onward , it was for all intents and purposes an independent city .
1.Library of Celsus - Turkey
This is number one for strictly personal reasons .
I love books , I love libraries , and this site is dedicated to knowledge ( as are libraries ) .
The library of Celsus ( in Turkey ) was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus ( who had been consul in 92 AD , governor of Asia in 115 AD , and a wealthy and popular local citizen ) .
The building is important as one of few remaining examples of an ancient Roman - influenced library .
It also shows that public libraries were built not only in Rome itself but throughout the Roman Empire .
In a massive restoration which is considered to be very true to the historic building , the front façade was rebuilt and now serves as a prime example of Roman public architecture .
Before my short lived pre-teenage career in newspaper delivery , I had no idea that dogs could run 100 + mph .
It turns out that every dog in my neighborhood could , and they chased me like my pockets were full of delicious steak .
The highlight of every dog ’s day was when I tried to sneak up to the front door with my GIANT yellow newspaper bag that might as well have said “ attack me ” on the side of it .
Looking back , I think I spent about 10 % of my delivery time actually delivering newspapers , and 90 % throttling my BMX away from the fastest dogs in the entire universe .
For years this traumatized me into fearing dogs and all other animals for that matter .
For all I knew – horses , cows , sheep , Bison , and turtles could chase me down , knock me off my bike and bite my legs .
Luckily for me , this all changed in high school .
A good friend of mine got a dog that was the biggest , scariest looking , friendliest , most lovable dog you could ever imagine .
This dog was the turning point for me & animals .
So since cars are my passion and animals are just plain fun , I put together this animal & car – friendly photo collage for your enjoyment .
Send me your “ animal & car ” pictures at jnutt@1aauto.com and I will add them in !

A group of scientists led by researchers from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) has engineered a type of artificial optical material -- a metamaterial -- with a particular three - dimensional structure such that light exhibits a negative index of refraction upon entering the material .
In other words , this material bends light in the " wrong " direction from what normally would be expected , irrespective of the angle of the approaching light .
This new type of negative - index metamaterial ( NIM ) , described in an advance online publication in the journal Nature Materials , is simpler than previous NIMs -- requiring only a single functional layer -- and yet more versatile , in that it can handle light with any polarization over a broad range of incident angles .
And it can do all of this in the blue part of the visible spectrum , making it " the first negative index metamaterial to operate at visible frequencies , " says graduate student Stanley Burgos , a researcher at the Light - Material Interactions in Energy Conversion Energy Frontier Research Center at Caltech and the paper 's first author .
" By engineering a metamaterial with such properties , we are opening the door to such unusual -- but potentially useful -- phenomena as superlensing ( high - resolution imaging past the diffraction limit ) , invisibility cloaking , and the synthesis of materials index - matched to air , for potential enhancement of light collection in solar cells , " says Harry Atwater , Howard Hughes Professor and professor of applied physics and materials science , director of Caltech 's Resnick Institute , founding member of the Kavli Nanoscience Institute , and leader of the research team
What makes this NIM unique , says Burgos , is its engineering .
" The source of the negative - index response is fundamentally different from that of previous NIM designs , " he explains .
Those previous efforts used multiple layers of " resonant elements " to refract the light in this unusual way , while this version is composed of a single layer of silver permeated with " coupled plasmonic waveguide elements . "
Surface plasmons are light waves coupled to waves of electrons at the interface between a metal and a dielectric ( a non-conducting material like air ) .
Plasmonic waveguide elements route these coupled waves through the material .
Not only is this material more feasible to fabricate than those previously used , Burgos says , it also allows for simple " tuning " of the negative - index response ; by changing the materials used , or the geometry of the waveguide , the NIM can be tuned to respond to a different wavelength of light coming from nearly any angle with any polarization .
" By carefully engineering the coupling between such waveguide elements , it was possible to develop a material with a nearly isotopic refractive index tuned to operate at visible frequencies . "
This sort of functional flexibility is critical if the material is to be used in a wide variety of ways , says Atwater .
" For practical applications , it is very important for a material 's response to be insensitive to both incidence angle and polarization , " he says .
" Take eyeglasses , for example .
In order for them to properly focus light reflected off an object on the back of your eye , they must be able to accept and focus light coming from a broad range of angles , independent of polarization .
Said another way , their response must be nearly isotropic .
Our metamaterial has the same capabilities in terms of its response to incident light . "
This means the new metamaterial is particularly well suited to use in solar cells , Atwater adds .
" The fact that our NIM design is tunable means we could potentially tune its index response to better match the solar spectrum , allowing for the development of broadband wide - angle metamaterials that could enhance light collection in solar cells , " he explains .
" And the fact that the metamaterial has a wide - angle response is important because it means that it can ' accept ' light from a broad range of angles .
In the case of solar cells , this means more light collection and less reflected or ' wasted ' light . "
" This work stands out because , through careful engineering , greater simplicity has been achieved , " says Ares Rosakis , chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science at Caltech and Theodore von Kármán Professor of Aeronautics and Mechanical Engineering .
Their work was supported by the Energy Frontier Research Centers program of the Office of Science of the Department of Energy , the National Science Foundation , the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek , and " NanoNed , " a nanotechnology program funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs .
Like most parents , Mara and Dave Lateiner wanted their two children to love reading .
The couple , from Millburn , N.J. , did the usual library outings , as well as daily read - alouds , sometimes for as long as two hours .
But the usual evolved into something more when last July the family went live with its own book - review blog , the Lateiner Gang Family Book Review Spot .
The book - review blog is a family affair .
All four Lateiners — Dave , 33 ; Mara , 34 ; Lauryn , 11 ; and Sami , 9 — contribute .
Since Mr. Lateiner kicked it off with a 1,100 - word post on James Dashner ’s “ The Maze Runner ” ( “ Lord of the Flies MOVE OVER ! ” ) , the Lateiners have reviewed 27 books and attracted nearly 600 followers .
“ We figured it would motivate the kids to read more , ” said Ms. Lateiner , a stay - at - home mother and a former preschool teacher .
“ Now the blog has turned into the family ’s hobby . ”
Islamabad ( AsiaNews ) - Arshed Masih died last night in hospital from the serious injuries - burns covering 80 % of his body – which the 38 year old Pakistani Christian suffered when he was set on fire because he refused to convert to Islam .
The funeral of man , who died after three days of agony , should take place in the late afternoon , but the family has asked that " before an autopsy is performed . "
The Christian community of Pakistan condemns " with firmness " the latest episode of violence and denounces the " slowness " of the federal and provincial government to punish those responsible .
On March 19 a group of Islamic extremists burned alive Arshed Masih , a driver employed by a wealthy Muslim businessman in Rawalpindi .
His wife worked as a maid in the same estate , situated in front of a police station .
Recently disagreements had arisen between the employer , Sheikh Mohammad Sultan , and the couple because of their Christian faith .
The couple had suffered threats and intimidation to force them to convert to Islam .
Arshed Masih ( pictured ) died last night at 7.45 local time after three days of agony and suffering at the Holy Family Hospital in Rawalpindi , Punjab province .
His wife Martha Arshed was raped by police en she sought to denounce the violence inflicted on her husband .
The couple 's three children - ages 7 to 12 years - were forced " to witness the torture inflicted on their parents .
Since 2005 Arshed Masih and his wife had worked and lived on the estate of the late Sheikh Mohammad Sultan .
The pressure on them to renounce Christianity had lately become incessant .
The owner had come so far as to threaten " dire consequences " , to persuade them to embrace Islam .
The couple were also accused of a recent theft by the owner who has promised to drop the complaint for their conversion .
Arshed Masih 's funeral should be held in the late afternoon , although tension remains high in the area .
Local witnesses tell AsiaNews that " the whole family is in shock and I s demanding an autopsy is carried out before burial . "
Several Christian associations and human rights activists - including Life for All , Christian Progressive Movement , Pakistan Christian Congress and Protect Foundation Pakistan - " protests are being stepped up outside the hospital . "
Peter Jacob , executive secretary of the Justice and Peace Commission of the Catholic Church of Pakistan ( NCJP ) , expresses to AsiaNews his " strongest condemnation " for the crime against the man and the rape of women perpetrated by police who should protect law and order .
The Catholic organization has been active to ensure protection to the woman and children , of whom there are no immediate reports .
The Catholic activist notes with regret the silence of the Federal Minister for Minorities , the Catholic Shahbaz Bhatti , and denounces " the slow pace and the inaction of the federal and provincial government .
" The executive - said Peter Jacob - has not yet taken concrete steps to prevent violence and abuse on minorities and punish the guilty . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
In a significant victory for news media , a federal appeals court said the Federal Reserve must disclose records on emergency lending programs to banks bailed out by the government in the financial crisis .

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered the Fed to release details of programs it adopted starting in late 2007 to shore up the financial system and forestall a complete meltdown of global financial markets .
Bloomberg LP , the parent of Bloomberg News , and News Corp ’s Fox News Network sought details of the central bank ’s actions under the federal Freedom of Information Act , or FOIA , which requires government agencies to make documents public .
The Fed argued against disclosure , citing an exemption that it said lets federal agencies keep secret various trade secrets and commercial or financial information .
It also said allowing disclosure of participants in the programs and the collateral they posted could cause “ competitive and reputational harm , ” perhaps triggering bank runs , and impede the central bank ’s ability “ to effectively manage the current , and any future , financial crisis . ”
Writing for a unanimous three - judge appeals court panel , Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs said , however , that to give the Fed power to deny disclosure because it thinks it best to do so “ would undermine the basic policy that disclosure , not secrecy , is the dominant objective of .
“ If the Board believes such an exemption would better serve the national interest , ” he added , “ it should ask Congress to amend the statute . ”
Bloomberg had won its case at the district court level , while Fox News had lost its case .
The Second Circuit threw out the ruling against Fox , and ordered a lower court judge to decide what materials must be disclosed .
Sen . Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat , said the rulings will help shed light on the Fed , which he called “ the least transparent institution ” in government , as lawmakers debate how far to overhaul the financial regulatory system .
“ We do n’t know how much was shoveled out of the back door of the Federal Reserve Board and to whom , ” Dorgan , chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee , said in a telephone interview .
“ Finally , we will be able to get some sense of who got the money , some of the biggest institutions in the country , how much and how they used it . ”
FED DISAPPOINTED , MEDIA PLEASED
Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said the central bank is reviewing the decision and weighing options for reconsideration or appeal .
An appeal could go to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The Clearing House Association , a group of major U.S. and European banks , said it was disappointed with the decision .
It said the court did not reach the “ fundamental issue ” of whether disclosure would have competitively harmed banks , general counsel Paul Saltzman said in a statement .
“ I do n’t think it will be do or die for the Fed ’s ability to put emergency programs into place , ” said Robert Eisenbeis , chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors Inc in Sarasota , Florida , and a former Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta head of research .
“ It will force the Fed to be more forthright and transparent to the public about the terms and conditions . ”
Bloomberg sued to obtain records of Fed actions to shore up the financial system starting in late 2007 , including the March 2008 sale of Bear Stearns Cos to JPMorgan Chase & Co .
It sought information about loans conducted at the Fed ’s discount window , the primary dealer credit facility , the term securities lending facility and the term auction facility .
The discount window is the program through which the 12 Federal Reserve Banks make short - term loans .
“ We ’re completely thrilled about the decision , ” said Amanda Bennett , executive editor of projects and investigations at Bloomberg News , in an interview .
“ The transparency of Federal Reserve Board decision making is something the American public has a right to , ” she said .
“ The argument that it could harm the market is largely theoretical .
Markets get in trouble not when people know too much about what is going on , but know too little . ”
In a separate statement , Kevin Magee , an executive vice president of Fox Business Network , said , “ We are pleased that this information is finally , and rightfully , going to be made available to the American public . ”
Reuters is part of a group of media organizations that submitted a brief to the appeals court supporting Bloomberg .
PLAUSIBLE DEFENSE
The media ’s principal argument included that the public interest in disclosure trumped any potential risk of harm to borrowers , and that the identity of those borrowers was itself not confidential .
Jacobs wrote that the Fed and Clearing House set forth “ plausible , and forcefully made ” arguments that disclosure “ would harm the banks that borrowed ( by disclosing their prior distress ) and the banking system as a whole ( because banks under stress may hesitate to seek relief or rescue ) . ”
But he said the disclosure sought would not cause Federal Reserve banks “ the kind of harm contemplated by the ‘ privileged or confidential ’ requirement ” of an exemption from FOIA . ”
“ It ’s important information for the markets to know , ” said Kenneth Thomas , a Miami banking consultant who said he has made several hundred FOIA requests to the Fed alone .
“ When we know what the Fed did in this case , market participants will have a better idea what the Fed will and wo n’t do the next time . ”
Eisenbeis , the former Atlanta Fed official , said banks “ might be more resistant to participate in some programs if they know their participation is going to be made public . ”
But he added : “ If your firm is in trouble , and going to the Fed is your last opportunity to get out , you ’ll do it . ”
Bennett said Bloomberg called the Fed after Friday ’s decision came down to again request the material sought .
“ There is still a great deal to be learned , ” she said .
Clearing House members include the ABN Amro Bank NV unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Bank of America Corp , Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Citigroup Inc , Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings Plc , JPMorgan , UBS AG , US Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co .

[ I am ] a passionate pacifist and anti-militarist .
I am against any nationalism , even in the guise of mere patriotism .
Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and pernicious , as did any exaggerated personality cult .
Where are our Einsteins today ?
It seems that even ordinary citizens with in an interest in politics bare a greater resemblance to James Carville than Einstein or Martin Luther King or John Steinbeck .
Radicalism has waned in politics , and although moderation is frequently what uncreative thinkers in the media salivate over , this is a terrible shame .
Less radicalism means less ideas on the fringe of mainstream politics and less people radically involved in politics .
Now , the " fringe " is often derided as a place that not many people want to be and of those people that are there anyway , many are crazy .
That 's an unfair characterization .
Before an idea reaches mainstream acceptance , it must pass first through the fringe - in fact , almost every good idea in politics first emerges from some fringe before it reaches mainstream acceptance and then possibly societal acceptance .
Founding Father John Adams understood this idea .
He realized that it was not bullets and combat that made independence from Britain inevitable , but a radicalization of the people of the American colonies .
" The Revolution was effected before the War commenced .
The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people ; a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations ...
This radical change in the principles , opinions , sentiments , and affections of the people , was the real American Revolution . "
Unfortunately , today there are few prominent and openly radical leaders - like John Adams and George Washington and Ben Franklin were in the early 1770s - in the political world .
We have let ourselves be consigned to a surprisingly partisan world , in which the two major political parties and a sympathetic media , for the most part , determine what is acceptable discussion in politics .
One of the great radical leaders of our time , Noam Chomsky , does a good job of summarizing what is wrong with this in his famous lecture " Manufacturing Consent . "
Perhaps this is an obvious point , but the democratic postulate is that the media are independent and committed to discovering and reporting the truth , and that they do not merely reflect the world as powerful groups wish it to be perceived .
Leaders of the media claim that their news choices rest on unbiased professional and objective criteria , and they have support for this contention in the intellectual community .
If , however , the powerful are able to fix the premises of discourse , to decide what the general populace is allowed to see , hear , and think about , and to " manage " public opinion by regular propaganda campaigns , the standard view of how the system works is at serious odds with reality ... ... The mass media are not a solid monolith on all issues .
Where the powerful are in disagreement , there will be a certain diversity of tactical judgments on how to attain generally shared aims , reflected in media debate .
But views that challenge fundamental premises or suggest that the observed modes of exercise of state power are based on systemic factors will be excluded from the mass media even when elite controversy over tactics rages fiercely .
The significance of Einstein is that when figures as prominent and well - respected as him are vocally in favor of radical ideologies like socialism , they can get through a media blackout and radicalize and mobilize the population .
That 's what Cassiodorus was talking about - there were proudly radical intellectuals , which meant there was a large section of the populace that was proudly radical , as well .
Just read some of Einstein 's famous essay " Why Socialism ? " - it does not offer the same creed of compromising with those in power and bending to their prejudices in order to succeed as " Taking on the System . "
That may be an unfair comparison , but Moulitsas is often portrayed as some kind of radical on the fringe of acceptable political debate ( in fact , " radical " is in the subtitle of his book ) .
Another unabashed radical in today 's political discourse , Chris Hedges ( a man who recently called for a return en masse to socialist philophies and the Green Party ) , addressed this idea in his most recent column from a slightly different angle .
Liberals in particular , he says , have been neutered by the ruling political class , and that is preventing any sort of useful rebellion , like the kinds seen in the late 1800s , early 1900s , 1930s , and 1960s , to name a few notable times .
Those in power have disarmed the liberal class .
They do not argue that the current system is just or good , because they cannot , but they have convinced liberals that there is no alternative .
And Glenn Greenwald - who is not a particularly ideological commentator , but is radically in favor of the rule of law and civil liberties ( should n't that be a contradiction ? ) - delved into this idea recently , paying particular attention to how political consultants have influenced the Democratic Party .
And since the progressive " movement " has voluntarily and stubbornly attached itself to the Democratic Party , that has a tangible and negative effect on progressive change .
Whether one agreed with their original view or their election - year view mattered little ; what was clear is that they were poll - driven opportunists with no core beliefs who were eager to shift with the slightest change in wind .
That -- far more than any specific position on war and Terrorism -- is what makes Democrats appear to be weak losers , and it's what they 've been doing -- and what the Carville / Greenberg faction -- has been urging for years and years .
That 's the same mindset that led Democrats to pretend to want to end the Iraq War so that they could win the 2006 mid-term election by exploiting anti-war sentiment , but then , once they won , continue to fund the war without limits or conditions because they were politically afraid to follow through on their alleged convictions ( and like clockwork , there , in 2007 , was Democracy Corps predictably warning Democrats not to equate opposition to the war with a desire for Congress to actually end the war ) .
At the same time , powerful Democrats have been playing to radical desires for peace and other things without actually making radical change , and playing the game of the power structure by limiting radical thought through their influence on media and political discourse .
This would not be much of a concern for radical and progressive activists if progressives ( and unfortunately , many radical or formerly radical activists ) had n't made themselves dependent on the Democratic Party .
If the Democrats do n't support radicalism at all ( and one would n't expect them to , since those in power rarely do , except radicalism that keeps them in power ) , then the progressive foot soldiers supporting the party naturally wo n't either .
And let me make myself clear .
That is not a good thing .
This disappearance , or at least extreme marginalization , of radicalism is unhealthy for politics .
Howard Zinn adressed this in a broad sense when , in response to MoveOn and other progressive organizations congratulating Democrats on a meek and fruitless effort to end the war in Iraq in 2007 , he wrote ,
When a social movement adopts the compromises of legislators , it has forgotten its role , which is to push and challenge the politicians , not to fall in meekly behind them .
We who protest the war are not politicians .
We are citizens .
Whatever politicians may do , let them first feel the full force of citizens who speak for what is right , not for what is winnable , in a shamefully timorous Congress .
------------------------------------
Things do not change in a positive direction without radicals .
They are one of several important ingredients present in any large shift in policy .
There were the populists and Greenbacks and Socialists and progressives that ended the Gilded Age through reforms like initiative and referenda , anti-trust actions , regulation , and so on .
There were the hippies and yippies and followers of Martin Luther King and followers of Malcom X and Black Panthers that affected some mighty societal and political changes that we 're all very aware of .
Today , that ingredient is missing , in a sense .
Before her tragic passing , Granny D had something to say about this :
A century ago , the ordinary people of America joined together to tie down the giant .
The antitrust laws and environmental laws and the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for wages and benefits all joined to nurture the restoration of a great middle class -- always the bedrock of democracy .
The robber barons , the great giants , remained tied down , no longer free , liberated , to do as they pleased in crushing us with their great wealth and political power .
And so it was for a time .
And now , loosed again , these giants have taken over our television networks and most of our newspapers , turning them against our interests and against the truth itself .
These giants send our young people off to fight their commercial wars -- great profitable ventures .
Despite this seemingly desperate message , Granny D kept her head up .
She did not do so because she was willingly ignorant of how hopeless her situation was , but because she really believed , as do I , that positive change is possible .
If they could do it during the Gilded Age , we can do it now .
Yes , let 's continue our efforts to reform our government , most especially with campaign finance reform .
But , with revolutionary new tools , we are capable of redefining democracy at a critical moment .
Let us not be shy about it for time is short .
We stand for love and fairness in the world .
That is not gentle work , nor is it painless or bloodless , as so many people around the world know .
I definitely agree with this , as do most of the people reading this , probably .
But the question remains of how do we get from sitting on our rear ends and whining to creating change .
Traditional protest has become ineffective , say some , at achieving any sort of ends we would have in mind .
But Howard Zinn once again has something to contribute on this topic .
The responses are never adequate , until they build and build and something changes .
People very often think that there must be some magical tactic , beyond the traditional ones -- protests , demonstrations , vigils , civil disobedience -- but there is no magical panacea , only persistence in continuing and escalating the usual tactics of protest and resistance .
The end of the Vietnam War did not come because the Left suddenly did something new and dramatic , but because all of the actions built up over time .
Of course , there 's no reason to stop people from protesting creatively , but the overall message is that the ineffectiveness of traditional forms of protest is greatly exaggerated .
Even with regards to the Iraq war , which is rightfully lamented as having an unfortunately small movement opposing it , the effect of protesters is there .
Noam Chomsky contended in a lecture called " Crises and the Unipolar Moment " that he gave in October ,
The Iraq War - there was massive protests before it officially started , and I stress " officially " because your candidate for president of the , presidency of the EU , and his colleague George Bush knew that they were already ... start[ing ] the war when they were putting on a show about wanting diplomacy and so on .
But before it was officially started - March , 2003 - there was a massive international protest .
I think that 's the first time in history that an imperialist war has been massively protested before it was officially begun .
And it had an effect .
The United States could not use - the United States and Britain - could n't use the tactics they used in South Vietnam .
There was no saturation bombing by B - 52s , there was no chemical warfare - horrible enough , but it could 've been a lot worse .
And furthermore , the Bush Administration had to back down on its war aims .
Step by step , it had to allow elections , which they did n't want to do ; mainly a victory for nonviolent Iraqi protest .
They could kill insurgents , they could n't deal with hundreds of thousands of people in the streets , and their hands were tied by the domestic constraints .
They had to abandon ... officially , at least , virtually all the war aims - I mean , as late as November , 2007 , the US was still insisting that the Status of Forces agreement allowed for an indefinite US military presence and ... privileged access to Ira[q ] 's resources by US investors .
Well , they did n't get that on paper , at least .
They had to back down ... Iraq 's a horror story , but it could 've been a lot worse .
So , yes , citizen protest can do something ... we know that from this and many other examples .
When there 's no protest and no attention , the power just goes wild .
Like in Cambodia , Northern Laos .
The frequent feeling of desperation , however , may come from our willingness to believe what we are told .
That 's not necessarily a bad thing , but it can contribute to bouts of hopelessness .
A lifetime ago , in September 2009 , I went to a protest of a video game military recruiting center , then did some amateur reporting about it online .
I cited an article in which a military spokesperson said that there were going to be no more recruiting centers like this for economic reasons .
When I posted this , David Swanson saw it much more clearly than I had , and said ,
for godsake we 're shutting the place down thanks to your work , and you quote their nonsense about an economic motive ???
as if they did n't knwo the cost all along ??
as if they do n't want more recruits ??
CLAIM VICTORY .
It is nothing else .
They will not announce our victories for us .
I had bought the military 's excuse , when in reality they 're probably closing the center because of the awful press it gets them .
It 's just one of these places , and they were all over the newspapers , TV , and internet ( not to mention , a Frontline special that I almost made it onto ) just because a few hundred angry , disgusted people showed up .
That 's people power right there , something that is mostly ignored by the media .
The important conclusion of what Howard Zinn was saying when I quoted him earlier is this :
If you listen to the media , you get no sense of what 's happening .
I speak to groups of people in different parts of the country .
I was in Austin , Texas recently and a thousand people showed up .
I believe people are basically decent , they just lack information ....
And there are people taking action against the warfare state , the corporate state , poverty , corruption , and all kinds of other things all over the place .
Cindy Sheehan , for instance , is one of the great dissidents of our time .
Her latest project is a permanent encampment on the National Mall that will be opening this week .
And closing once our troops are out of the Middle East and getting fair treatment from the government .
And it 's not just political celebrities that are doing this .
Some of the best resistance comes from everyday people like you and me who are fed up with being dehumanized and taken advantage of .
In fact , there is going to be a large peace march in Washington on Saturday , March 20 ( and complementary demonstrations in San Francisco and Los Angeles ) .
If you have n't joined these people in their resistance yet - if your political action is limited to blogging or donations or calling your congressperson - then there 's no better time than that .
It 's not even necessary that we all become leaders .
Some of us , however , need to take the plunge and get behind people like Cindy Sheehan , or else the ideas of people like that will never have mainstream acceptance , and they will never be adopted by government or society .
Although it is funny , the following video offers a valuable lesson on how leadership and movements work .
------------------------------------
Howard Zinn , Granny D , Noam Chomsky , Cindy Sheehan , David Swanson - these are all ( at least ) somewhat prominent radicals in our world today .
This seemingly goes against everything I said about Einstein and the lack of radicalism in our political discourse .
It is true that these are some great dissidents , but they are not quite the same as the towering cultural figures that John Steinbeck and Albert Einstein were .
Along with that , there is the problem of these people being consistently marginalized and not being backed up by large enough political movements to counter that .
Instead of cheering on Cindy Sheehan and working for her campaign of radical dissent against Nancy Pelosi , many progressives - the same exact ones who are attached to the Democrats - wrote her off for not being loyal to the Democratic Party .
It was not only the party leadership that did this , but many ordinary people who are also progressive activists .
In an interview with Bill Moyers a few months before his death , Howard Zinn said ,
I think there are people like [ the protesters of yore ] today .
But very often , they 're ignored in the media .
You know , or they appear for a day , you know , on the pages of the Times or the Post .
They - and then they disappear .
But , well , you know , there are those people recently who sat in Chicago in this plant that was going to be closed by the Bank of America and these people sat in and refused to leave ... But there are people — there are people today who are fighting evictions , fighting foreclosures .
And , you know , very often , there 's a superficial understanding of a passive citizenry today , which is not true ... the media are not covering them very well .
So maybe there are a few incarnations of Einstein out there today .
But , like Zinn says , having a radical action in the news for one day is not the same as having a large and consistent radical movement .
We as activists must not be afraid to be radicals .
And we as radicals must commit ourselves to being activists .
That is how we create a culture in which figures like Einstein can emerge , because right now there is no powerful and famous figure like Einstein doing it for us .
I thought I had seen it all when I read Richard ’s article about the car made out of Legos , but then I found this car which is surely to be the ultimate dream car for any geek .
It ’s nothing fancy like the Porsche 918 Spyder that was just unveiled this week .
A geek ’s style is n’t flashy like that ; a geek has truly unique taste .
Meet the car covered in used computer keyboards .
That ’s what I ’m talkin’ about baby !
Where does a person get enough keyboards to cover a car like this ?
Who knows , but it will definitely be high on the coolness scale for any geek .
If you look closely , you ’ll see that it kind of resembles a giant mosaic , like a piece of art .
I found two different cars to show you .
Both of these cars are covered in thousands of computer keys and both are so geeky they make me want to find my pocket protector .
Thank you for the great pictures !

A few years ago one of my best pals phoned me up from comic - con .
He had somehow just wrangled defenseless Damon Lindelof into a corner for a nice chat .
Mostly comics talk .
The best part for me was that Damon confirmed a bunch of our theories about LOST including the Watchmen / X - Men references .
It ’s probably common knowledge now , but for a couple of nerds from Utah it was an awesome validation at the time .
Can you guess Damon Lindelof ’s favorite comic was while growing up ?
Watchmen .
His second favorite ?
X- Men
I have n’t heard too many remixes of Rihanna ’s smash Rude Boy but I came across the DVW Remix and it ’s pretty fucking good .

From I.M.D.B. David Mills , writer of the best shows on television — The Wire , Homicide : Life on the Street , and the upcoming Treme — died last night of a brain aneurysm at the age of 48 .
Mills ’ death comes on the heels of that of New Orleans musician and Treme star Bernard " Bunchy " Johnson , who died of a heart attack on March 21 .
We can only assume that the pilot will be dedicated to both their memories .
Say what you will about Dr. Jack Shephard ; whatever your beef may be — and there are plenty to choose from — the man has a knack for remembering a name .
The name in question is that of Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , whom Jack met only briefly on a transpacific flight .
( We first saw him in Season Two as the mysterious hatch - number - enterer . )
But , hey , this quite terrific episode belonged to Desmond and when you 're the guest of honor , people tend to remember your name .
This episode explains so much , but it ’s hard to explain what it explains .
Let me explain :
My girlfriend does not watch Lost ( she 's busy living something called " her life " ) , but she was curious to see an episode of the show that has kept me so preoccupied since the calendar year began .
( Oh , pre-Lost Mike of 2009 — your ignorance really was bliss . )
She found it slower - paced than she expected and , naturally , had absolutely no idea what was going on .
That 's my fault , but what was I supposed to tell her ?
It would take longer to explain than the time she would possibly care to spend on the subject .
This episode was a lot like the song " Tomorrow Never Knows " by the Beatles .
Only true Beatles fans love this song because , as the last song on Revolver , it set up the more experimental music yet to come on Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour .
To non-Beatles fan , though the song sounds like noise .
" Happily Ever After , " to a non-Lost fan , even more so than other episodes , was noise .
" I understand . "
These two words were uttered for the first time in the six - season history of Lost .
O.K. , that ’s possibly not true , but it has to be the first time the person saying them , in this case Desmond , was 100 percent correct .
That 's what 's exciting : he 's the first character to figure this whole mess out .
Strange , considering the small amount of time it took him back on the island to do so — so much for your sleuthing skils , Doctor Shephard .
Have you ever had a dream when you realize that you 're in a dream and can sort of control the dream ?
This is what 's going on with Desmond .
He , too , has an entirely different life in the alternate dimension where Oceanic Flight 815 did not crash ; there , he has no special someone in his life and works as a sort of consigliere for Charles Widmore , his bitter enemy ( and father - in - law ) in the original timeline .
But thanks to an attempted drowning murder - suicide by the not dead , flash - sideways Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) — honestly , if I hear Drive Shaft 's " You All Everybody " one more time , I 'm going to drive a car off of a bridge , too — Desmond has seen flashes of his island life , including of his wife , Penny .
Desmond eventually learns how to keep his memories from both timelines intact while shifting consciousness from one timeline to the other .
How is Desmond doing this ?
Well , he 's sort of done it before .
In Season Four , as I 'm sure you recall , Desmond was caught between two time periods in the same dimension ; now he ’s caught between two time periods in different dimensions .
Nifty trick .
Widmore thinks so , too , which is why he " volunteers " Desmond for some sort of electromagnet experiment that , Widmore believes , will trigger Desmond 's time - traveling ability .
Widmore was right .
In Season Four , Desmond , uncontrollably hopping back and forth between 2004 and 1996 , seeks out help from Daniel Faraday , a leading time - travel researcher , by tracking him down in the U.K in 1996 .
This Season , there 's good news and there 's bad news .
The bad news :
In the main , plane - crash timeline , Faraday died in Season Five .
The good news :
In the alternative , non–plane crash timeline , Faraday , who is Widmore 's son , still lives at home .
Not only that , he 's also had visions !
He even knows about the nuclear bomb that altered the future and split the timeline into two dimensions .
Faraday explained to Desmond that he , too , had a vision of his true love , and that , when he woke up , even though he 's just a musician ( and apparently a pretty bad one since he could n't even get Drive Shaft to play with him ) , he sketched out his ideas for time travel ... or dimension hopping ... or something .
Disappointingly , it looked nothing like the flux capacitor .
It 's an exceptionally inconvenient truth .
Only one American in three believes that human beings are responsible for climate change : a polling result 10 % down on where opinion rested the year before .
Worse , the number of Americans who believe that climate change is a hoax or a scientific conspiracy – not doubting , just damned blank certain – has doubled since 2008 .
Add in those who assert that the changes , if any , are of " no significant concern " , and you 've got 30 % of the US denying , scoffing and just walking on by .
Are the issues clearer , the people more committed , here in Britain ?
Call for the latest evidence from Ipsos Mori – and find that the proportion of UK adults who believe that global warming is " definitely " a reality has plummeted from 44 % to 31 % in the last 12 months .
Figures like these , on both sides of the Atlantic , are getting more sceptical week by week .
The real change of electoral climate is that fewer and fewer voters pay any heed to scientists and politicians .
It is n't hard to collate the factors that drive disillusion .
Professors with a colloquial touch writing " awful " emails ; a recession so tough that it blows future shock away ; a cold , cold winter the Met Office did n't forecast ; scientific angst about swine flu revealed as way over the top ; dodgy figures , dodgy reporting , dodgy issues way up to UN level .
These are only a few of our least favourite things .
Mix them together in the stew of pre-election politics , and the result is lethal inertia .
Once upon a quite recent time , David Cameron seemed bent on playing a new green giant .
Now he 's just another family - friendly campaigner , keen on pressing pounds sterling into sweaty palms .
Environmental issues have slithered down the greasy pole of public anxiety .
They wo n't get much of a mention on the hustings in May : no fresh commitments , no crucial pledges .
In one sense , the heat may by rising ; in another , the heat is off .
And that , of course , is cause for very significant concern .
Democracies move in particular ways .
Voters have to clamber on board when sacrifices are required .
They have to see the need for pain , to sense the danger of doing nothing .
They have to lead their leaders as well as follow – once they switch off , nothing good happens easily , if at all .
An Obama stalled on healthcare reform in the Senate is n't going to be able to deliver sweeping global warming policies .
He may not be George Bush , but he already seems to know when he's on a loser .
And , without him , you can write the Chinese or Indian scripts .
You can tell that the follow - ups to Copenhagen will be feebler , not stronger : true cause for despair .
Kick away any mass impetus for tackling climate change as schedules of imminent necessity fade and review panels plod across the wastelands of borrowed time .
What 's to be done ( except wait for a natural disaster that ends all argument – and much else besides ) ?
First , through gritted teeth , say what wo n't work , what 's been tried already and failed .
More jaw and Gore from politicians can't cut it .
They have come to seem secondhand sources , merely parroting a frail scientific thesis .
That goes , alas , for journalists , too – and for pressure groups issuing lurid warnings or staging angry demos .
Those of us who are convinced , who believe in the necessity of action , have n't changed our minds .
But we 're not the point .
The audience that matters is out there , sleeping or drifting .
And rousing it will demand something different , not more of the same .
Yet more of the same is exactly what we seem to be getting .
More re-examinations of existing evidence , monitored by the people who failed to monitor it last time .
More supposedly transparent attempts to say precisely when Himalayan glaciers will melt .
More United Nations panels , flying lugubriously hither and yon in the cause of consensus .
More declarations signed by hundreds of scientists on behalf of a notional " scientific community " ( rather like letters to editors from umpteen economists urging cuts or no cuts ) .
None of it has a ring of renewed confidence .
And the plain fact is that we surely need a prophet , not yet another committee .
We need one passionate , persuasive scientist who can connect and convince – not because he preaches apocalypse in gory detail , but in simple , overwhelming terms .
We need to be taught to believe by a true believer in a world where belief is the fatal , missing ingredient .

Det finnes mange ulike aktører på markedet som tilbyr forbrukslån .
Nettopp forbrukslån er en lånevariant som har blitt veldig populær de seneste årene , og det er mange nordmenn som søker etter et slikt lån .
Fordelen er åpenlys ; lånet kan brukes til hva du måtte ønske , det er rett og slett ingen som legger seg opp i hva du skal bruke pengene til .
Ønsker du å bruke lånet til en ferie , nye klær , betale regninger eller noe helt annet , så er det du alene , eller du og din medsøker , som bestemmer det .
Men , vi vil selvsagt anbefale at du tenker deg om før du tar opp et forbrukslån som skal brukes til f.eks .
shopping .
De fleste bruker forbrukslånet som finansiering til prosjekter som er av en slik størrelse at det kan være vanskelig å spare opp til finansieringen av dem på egen hånd .
Ønsker du å bytte ut kjøkkenet eller pusse opp badet , så kan det fort koste en god slump med penger og da hjelper det å kunne finansiere denne utgiften med et forbrukslån .
Spesielt når det gjelder oppussing av boligen er det fornuftig å få gjennomført prosjekter og forbedringer som i siste ende vil gagne verdien på boligen .
På den måten får du igjen for den utgiften som et lån nødvendigvis er .
Ulike lånebeløp
Når du skal finne deg et forbrukslån , så har du mange aktører på markedet å velge blant .
Alt fra banker til finansieringsselskaper og låneformidlere .
Det kan derfor være vanskelig å finne det beste forbrukslån .
Veldig mange tilbyr de samme lånebeløpene
Det er ikke uvanlig at du kan låne opptil kr 500 000 , men du kan selvsagt også låne mye mindre enn det .
Mange tilbyr lån fra kr 10 000 og oppover .
De som driver med utlån , og spesielt er dette tilfelle for forbrukslån , er pålagt av staten å utvise ansvarlighet og du kan derfor ikke alltid være sikker på å få låne nøyaktig det beløpet du søker om .
Hvor mye du får lov til å låne avgjøres av flere ting , blant annet hvor høy inntekt du har og hvor mye du kan betale i renter og avdrag hver måned .
Alt dette ser banken på når de foretar en kredittvurdering av din totale økonomiske situasjon , og ved hjelp av vurderingen fastsetter de derfor en kreditscore .
Denne blir utregnet automatisk etter en rekke kriterier og er med på å avgjøre hvor mye du kan låne .
Lengste nedbetaling er på 15 år
Hvor lang tid du kan bruke på nedbetalingen varierer litt , men hos de fleste større aktører kan du som regel betale lånet tilbake over så mye som 15 år .
Husk på at jo lengre tid du bruker på nedbetalingen av lånet , desto dyrere blir lånet i renter og gebyrer .
Og nettopp renten er det stor forskjell på .
Den laveste nominelle renten er på rundt 7,9 % .
Men hvor mye du må betale i rente , avgjøres som allerede nevnt ut fra den kredittscoren du får .
Får du en høy score blir du formentlig tilbudt en lavere rente , da bankene anser det som mer sannsynlig at lånet blir betalt tilbake .
Vi har funnet frem til tre ulike banker som alle tilbyr gode betingelser som er fordelaktige for deg som kunde .

Update 16th April , 2013 .
hgroup has now been removed from the HTML5 specification .
We are working on an article to help guide authors on which markup patterns they should use instead .
Update 4th April , 2013 .
Please note that following this decision , hgroup will be removed from the HTML5 specification .
As such , we do n’t endorse using it on production sites .
One of the new elements defined in HTML 5 is < hgroup > , used for grouping titles with their associated subtitles .
But why do we need < hgroup > when we ’ve already got the < header > element ?
In this article , we ’ll do our best to answer that question .
What is the < hgroup > element ?
Here ’s what the spec says about < hgroup > :
The hgroup element is typically used to group a set of one or more h1 - h6 elements — to group , for example , a section title and an accompanying subtitle .
W3C Specification
So what does that mean ?
< hgroup > acts as a wrapper for two one or more related heading elements possibly contained within a < header > element .
It can only contain a group of < h1 > – < h6 > element (s ) , and it should be used for subtitles , alternative titles , and tag lines .
The easiest way to demonstrate proper use of < hgroup > is through some examples .
Thanks to Dr. Oli for letting us use his examples .
An article with one title
The title consists of a single < h1 > , so neither < hgroup > nor < header > is required :
< article > < h1 > Title goes here </h1 > < p > Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</ p> </article >
An article with a title and metadata
Here we ’re using < header > to group the title and associated metadata , so an < hgroup > is not required :
< article > < header > < h1 > Title goes here </ h1 > < p >< time datetime =
" 2010-03-20 " >20th March , 2010 </ time ></ p> </ header > < p > Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</ p> </article >
An article with a title and subtitle
An < hgroup > contains the title and subtitle of the article :
< article > < hgroup > < h1 > Title goes here </h1 > < h2 > Subtitle of article </ h2 > </ hgroup > < p > Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</ p> </article >
An article with a title , subtitle and metadata
An < hgroup > contains the title and subtitle of the article , and then a < header > contains the metadata and the < hgroup > :
< article > < header > < hgroup > < h1 > Title goes here </h1 > < h2 > Subtitle of article </ h2 > </ hgroup > < p >< time datetime =
" 2010-03-20 " >20th March , 2010 </ time ></ p> </ header > < p > Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</ p> </article >
Real world examples
On Alex Gibson ’s MiniApps , he uses < hgroup > to include a tag line after the main “ MiniApps ” heading .
( This is also what we ’ve done on this site if you view the source . )
Screenshot from Alex Gibson ’s MiniApps site
So why use < hgroup > ?
It ’s all about the document outline .
When grouping headings in an < hgroup > element , the outline algorithm will mask the lowest level all but the highest level heading in the group from the resulting document outline .
Using MiniApps as an example again , in his markup ( although this is simplified ) , Alex uses :
< header > < hgroup > < h1 >< a href= " / " >
Mini Apps</a></h1 > < h2 > Web applications for iPhone , Android & other mobile platforms </ h2 > </hgroup > </ header >
The < hgroup > contains both < h1 > and < h2 > elements , but the outliner only includes the < h1 > .
This is illustrated in the image below .
( Please ignore the “ untitled section ” as well .
This is caused by the nav element , and a change request has been submitted to address this . )
Document outline of miniapps.co.uk
We ’ll be covering document outlines in another article , so I wo n’t go into detail here .
You can test your own pages in the HTML 5 Outliner to ensure that you ’re using the heading elements within < hgroup > correctly .
Summary
In this article , we ’ve demonstrated how to use the < hgroup > element effectively .
To recap :
If you have a simple title with a single heading element ( < h1 > – < h6 > ) , you do not need an < hgroup > .
– ) , you do not need an .
If you have a title with subtitle (s ) or tag lines ( i.e. , more than one consecutive < h1 > – < h6 > ) , group them in an < hgroup > .
– ) , group them in an .
If you have a title with subtitle (s ) and other metadata associated with the section or article , place both the < hgroup > and the metadata within a single < header > element .
A two - week study of Alaska 's oil and gas tax structure has convinced some state senators that the Legislature needs to act fast to change the system or risk the plundering of state riches .
The cost of doing nothing is " colossal , " up to $ 2 billion in lost revenue a year under some scenarios , says Sen.
Bert Stedman , a Republican from Sitka who co-chairs the Senate Finance Committee .
He 's been holding hearings for two weeks on Alaska 's oil and gas tax system , and on Friday said he 's preparing legislation to settle the issue before the session ends in April .
Some , including Gov. Sean Parnell , do n't have the same sense of urgency .
But overall , Stedman 's concerns seem to be gaining traction in the Legislature .
According to models created by the state Revenue Department and consultants to the Legislature , the hit to the treasury comes when oil prices are high and natural gas prices are relatively low .
The state 's complicated tax formula links the two values -- " a substantial flaw , " according to Stedman .
Stedman says his committee will soon take up a bill to separate the oil and gas taxes , so that low gas prices do n't effectively drive down the taxable value of high - priced oil .
Sen .
Joe Paskvan is a Democrat from Fairbanks who sat in on the Senate Finance Committee hearings over the last two weeks at Stedman 's request .
" I believe now that the law as it currently exists puts Alaska at risk of being plundered , " Paskvan told reporters .
" Without changes before May 1 , 2010 , my belief is that essentially we have a Third World resource extraction model that will end up being a plunder of Alaska 's resources . "
That May 1 date is significant , the senators said .
Under state law , the tax structure in place then could be locked in for the first 10 years that natural gas flows if a big gas pipeline is ever built .
Alaska depends on oil revenue for nearly 90 percent of its general fund revenue , but production is declining .
COURTING PRODUCERS
Legislators have n't focused on the gas tax issue before now because without a mega - gas pipeline from the North Slope , there has n't been much Alaska gas to tax .
But this year two competing pipeline projects intend to seek commitments from producers for shipping natural gas , if and when a pipeline is ever built .
The period when companies trying to build and run a pipeline can secure those agreements for shipping deals is called " open season , " and it 's supposed to begin May 1 .
The state has agreed to put up to $ 500 million into a project being led by TransCanada Corp. , joined by Exxon Mobil .
A separate project , Denali , involves BP and Conoco Phillips .
Stedman said his proposed fast - track legislation does n't change the rates of oil and gas taxes or the amount of tax credits ; that can come later or through other bills already before the Legislature .
" This is a risk - control defensive measure that the state needs to take to protect the treasury , " the senator said .
Time will be pinched .
The Legislature shuts down much of next week while a big contingent of state legislators travels to Washington , D.C. , for an annual energy conference , and when they reconvene March 8 , the 90 - day session will be more than half over .
If legislators end the session April 18 without addressing the issue , Stedman said , " that would be disgusting . "
GETTING TRACTION
State Sen. Lesil McGuire , an Anchorage Republican who co-chairs the Senate Resources Committee , said she thinks Stedman 's concerns are valid .
She also wants any oil and gas tax legislation to be aired in her committee as well as Finance , though each stop can slow a bill down or kill it .
When the Legislature set up the tax system in 2007 , lawmakers were focused on oil , she said .
" Many of us do feel it was made clear on the record that we would come back and look at gas at a later date , " McGuire said .
Her counterpart in the House agreed .
" I think it 's something that has to be done .
And I think we always knew that , " said Rep. Craig Johnson , an Anchorage Republican who co-chairs the House Resources Committee .
Stedman 's idea to separate the resources for tax purposes seems right , but it 'll come down to details , Johnson said .
" How , I do n't know .
When , I do n't know . "
" We 'll take it seriously because we think there is an issue there , " said House Speaker Mike Chenault , a Republican from Nikiski who has listened to some of the Senate testimony .
" We 're going to have to find out what the fix is , and I do n't think it 's a simple fix . "
THE GOVERNOR'S VIEW
Parnell is pushing his own legislation to increase tax credits for oil exploration and expand tax credits to all drilling and well work .
He said he is asking the Legislature to take up his bills , which have n't yet had a hearing .
Parnell said he 's willing to listen but does n't believe the state is locked in to an unfavorable tax system if something does n't happen by May 1 .
If oil producers make commitments to ship natural gas , they 'll do so seeking changes in tax rates and long - term assurances of financial terms , the governor told reporters Friday .
" You do n't want to open up gas taxes now and then have to open them up again , " Parnell said .
The current combined oil - gas tax structure was intended to be an incentive to launch the long - dreamed - about gas pipeline , he said .
Separating the two could hurt the project .
" They are going to have to take into account whether that impacts the economics of a gas line because frankly , it very well could , " Parnell said .
The governor said the example of a $ 2 billion hit is based on a " mythological figure . "
Not exactly , Stedman said .
A legislative consultant analyzed what the state 's tax haul would have been in the 2008 budget year if there had been an operating gas pipeline .
The rate would have been $ 1.8 billion less under the combined system than if oil and gas were taxed separately , according to the analysis by London economist David Wood .
Tony Palmer , TransCanada vice president , said by phone Friday that producers have been upfront in their desire for tax changes , though none have yet made public what they will be seeking .
TransCanada expects to hold its open season courting customers May through July , he said .
BP Alaska ( Exploration ) Inc. is a potential shipper of gas in a new pipeline .
It 's too soon to assess the impact of Stedman 's proposal , spokesman Steve Rinehart said .
" Our base position remains that there is going to need to be stability and predictability in the fiscal terms for a gas line project to move forward , " Rinehart said .
That should happen , Stedman said .

While campaigning for the presidency , Barack Obama made it clear to the nation that education would be among his top three priorities if elected .
He is making good on that promise .
Unfortunately , it ’s starting off on the wrong path .
Announcing his revamping of the No Child Left Behind law , the president unveiled a policy that emphasizes mass firings of teachers , school closings and replacing public schools with privately run , and many times for - profit , charter schools .
The president made these announcements while giving his full support to the Rhode Island superintendent and school board that fired en masse 90 - plus high school teachers .
In choosing to taking this public stance , the White House is sending a bad signal to all school districts : punish the teachers for low - performing schools , rip up collective bargaining contracts ; do n’t worry , the federal government agrees .
It is an ominous signal for public education supporters , parents , teachers and students .
Some see it as a political move to appeal to conservatives and anti-union independents , but it will have grave consequences for unity and progress down the road .
Teachers were among Obama ’s biggest supporters , but in the White House political calculus , they must be seen as expendable .
The AFL - CIO issued a statement at its executive council meeting March 2 condemning the actions of the Central Falls , R.I. , superintendent .
It also said the AFL - CIO leadership was “ appalled ” by the president ’s and his Education secretary ’s “ condoning ” of the mass firings .
“ These comments are unacceptable , do not reflect the reality on the ground and completely ignore the teachers ’ significant commitment to working with others to transform this school , ” the AFL - CIO statement said .
“ The comments are particularly disappointing in light of the recent state report , which found that the high school ’s reading and writing proficiency have gone up 22 percent and 14 percent respectively over the past two years .
None of these facts is reflected in the comments from the Obama administration . ”
The fact is the punish - schools - and - teachers model is not effective education policy .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan , formerly Chicago Public Schools superintendent , practiced this “ turnaround ” model there , and look what it has done for Chicago schools and students .
The Civic Committee of The Commercial Club of Chicago , a supporter of Duncan , issued a report last year saying city schools have made little progress since 2003 , when Duncan took over !
Chicago parents , especially African American parents , have fiercely fought numerous school closings because of the destabilization effect it has on schoolchildren , families and communities .
Teachers , parents , administrators all agree with the president : public education MUST improve .
But the key word is “ improve , ” not demolish .
If crime rates go up , do you fire whole precincts of police officers ?
This administration emphasizes data as the basis for good policy .
Well , study after study show lower class sizes make a huge difference in educating children , just as the federal breakfast and lunch programs make a big difference in children ’s learning .
You ca n’t learn on an empty stomach .
And you ca n’t learn when there are 30 - 40 kids in the classroom , gym has been cut out , recess has been cut out , art , music and science have been cut out .
Public education is suffering death by 1,000 cuts , and 1,000 standardized tests as the only measure of learning .
Teacher mentoring , support and evaluation – a management responsibility – is perfunctory at best .
Most teachers report that “ professional development ” provided by school higher - ups ( via high - cost consultants ) is useless .
That ’s the reality of public schools today .
The ONLY national study on charter schools shows that 83 percent of them are equal to OR WORSE than nearby public schools .
We urge our readers to call Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and politely tell him it is unacceptable for the federal government to support the scapegoating of teachers .
His office number is ( 202 ) 401-3000 .
Let your senators and representatives , and the White House , know too .
And sign and circulate an online petition in support of the Central Falls , R.I. , teachers .
See http://centralfallskidsdeservebetter.com/petition.

Capsaicin causes the burning sensation in chilli peppers
Studying chilli peppers is helping scientists create a new type of painkiller which could stop pain at its source .
A team at the University of Texas says a substance similar to capsaicin , which makes chilli peppers hot , is found in the human body at sites of pain .
And blocking the production of this substance can stop chronic pain , the team found .
They report their findings in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
Capsaicin is the primary ingredient in hot chilli peppers which causes a burning sensation .
It does this by binding to receptors present on the cells inside the body .
Similarly , when the body is injured , it releases capsaicin - like substances - fatty acids called oxidized linoleic acid metabolites or OLAMs - and these , via receptors , cause pain , the researchers have found .
Blocking pain
Dr Kenneth Hargreaves , senior researcher at the Dental School at the University of Texas , and his team next set out to see if they could block these newly discovered pain pathways .
Lab work on mice showed that by knocking out a gene for the receptors , there was no sensitivity to capsaicin .
Armed with this knowledge they set about making drugs to do the same .
Dr Hargreaves said : " This is a major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of pain and how to more effectively treat it .
" We have discovered a family of endogenous capsaicin - like molecules that are naturally released during injury , and now we understand how to block these mechanisms with a new class of non-addictive therapies . "
Ultimately , he hopes the drugs will be able to treat different types of chronic pain , including that associated with cancer and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and fibromyalgia .
Federal Communications Commission watchers everywhere , gird thy loins .
However frenetic you thought it was in FCC - land back during the media ownership , Comcast P2P , or Sirius XM merger wars , forget it .
The Commission has just laid out the road map and schedule for implementing its National Broadband Plan , and it looks pretty relentless — crucial rulemakings lined up back to back through the rest of the year and into 2011 .
And to heck with that court decision invalidating the FCC 's sanctions against Comcast for BitTorrent throttling , proclaimed FCC Chair Julius Genachowski on Thursday .
" The court did not question the FCC ’s goals , " he declared .
" It merely invalidated one technical , legal mechanism for broadband policy chosen by prior Commissions . "
So full speed ahead .
Here 's the schedule .
Do n't blink and do n't sneeze .
Q2 : April to June
Any day now the FCC is expected make good on one of the key commitments of the NBP : new proposed rules for the CableCARD — that little digital card that was supposed to make it easy for consumers to use third - party set - top boxes to access cable TV .
Hardly anybody accesses them for said purpose at this point , but the agency sees the concept as crucial for getting consumers to migrate their video watching habits to all those yummy hybrid devices like the TiVo , Roku box , AppleTV , Xbox 360 , and PS3 .
So expect this proceeding to happen soon , plus a Notice of Inquiry on Smart Video Devices that will lead to an Order by the end of the year .
Next , get ready for a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on mobile roaming .
It 's unclear precisely what the FCC plans to tackle in this NPRM , but smaller wireless companies are peeved that they can't get roaming access to their bigger neighbors once they 've bought some spectrum .
They say it still takes time to build out a network after the purchase , and economists warn that the rule creates disincentives for smaller carriers to buy and develop license property .
Then there 's the dreaded D Block — that 10 MHz chunk of spectrum reserved for public safety use that failed to sell in the agency 's massive 700 MHz auction of 2008 .
The FCC will propose rules to try the sell - off again in early 2011 , this time with fewer requirements imposed on the commercial entity that would share the license with public safety agencies .
And Sirius XM fans will be paying close attention when the FCC releases its Order creating ( hopefully ) non-interference rules between the Wireless Communications Services and Satellite Digital Audio Radio services bands in the 2.3 GHz zone .
The Commission sees this move as a crucial first step towards freeing up the spectrum the wireless industry says it needs to satisfy the public 's lust for smartphones .
But Sirius insists that the non-interference solutions the agency has come up with so far wo n't work .
Add to this a proceeding on cybersecurity , broadband survivability , the spectrum holdings on Native American tribal lands , about seven other items , and you 've got a very busy Q2 for the FCC .
Q3 : July through September
Continuing the agency 's effort to find more spectrum for the wireless industry , sometime during this quarter the Commission will propose rules to " promote innovative use of broadcast TV spectrum while preserving free , over - the - air broadcasting . "
This is a polite way of saying that the FCC wants to figure out ways to convince TV station owners to relinquish a big portion of their licenses .
CTIA - the Wireless Association has proposed a plan that involves an extensive makeover of over - the - air TV .
We wo n't know until Q3 how much of that scheme the government wants to adopt .
Meanwhile , the FCC 's campaign to get unlicensed broadband or " white space " devices out the door should be topped and tailed during this quarter , with an Order setting up final rules and appointing a company to administer the databases designed to assure non-interference between broadcasters and white space broadband transmitters .
The FCC 's special access rules will also be reviewed during these months .
These are the conditions and rates under which businesses and smaller wireless companies buy wholesale line access from the big telcos — a huge issue for Sprint , T - Mobile , tw - telecom , Clearwire , cbeyond , and a boatload of other small - to medium - sized telcos .
Expect them to loudly make their case for less onerous prices .
Q4 : October to December
Perhaps the most important aspect of this final quarter will be the conclusion of the agency 's efforts to revamp its Universal Service Fund , which subsidizes low income phone service , rural carriers , and the computer needs of schools , libraries , and rural health care centers .
The plan is to move the USF from subsidizing phone service to funding broadband .
In Q2 the FCC will take on the centerpiece of this challenge , the USF 's " High Cost " Fund , proposing ways to get the transition started for carriers that receive high cost fund cash .
Then in Q3 the agency will propose rules for a Mobility Fund to help states that lag behind the country in 3G wireless access and suggest ways to cut red tape out of the FCC 's notoriously complicated E - Rate program , which subsidizes libraries and schools .
Finally , in Q4 , the FCC will launch rules for its Connect America Fund , designed to subsidize rural and low income area broadband services .
These are only a few of the proceedings , inquiries , workshops , and conferences the Commission has planned for the next nine months .
And none of these events deal with the issue that has drawn headlines over the last few days : how the agency will revamp its Open Internet ( net neutrality ) rules in light of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals rebuke .
That problem , however , will hover closely over all this as the FCC considers its options .

By group collaboration , we mean the ability of small groups to get things done , such as share files , track tasks and projects , make decisions and build repositories of shared knowledge .
By network organizing , we mean the ability of multiple groups to work together on projects in a democratic manner .
Crabgrass currently consists of a solid suite of group collaboration tools , such as private wikis , task lists , file repository , and decision making tools .
We are currently working on better social networking tools , blogs , and event calendars , as well as better support for collaboration and decision making among independent groups .
As Free Software , anyone is welcome to check out the code 0 xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass and follow the documentation , run their own site with it , and contribute improvements and changes to the source code .
Crabgrass is written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails framework .
While social movements have grown more adept at using the web to communicate publicly , we are still mostly using inadequate tools to communicate amongst ourselves .
Most groups rely heavily on email , lists , and wikis — but these tools are not suited for the complexity of relationships that activist organizations face in the real world .
There are many existing social networking websites out there .
However , these offerings are geared toward the needs of advertisers or informal social groups .
There are also many existing web services for group collaboration .
These sites are typically designed for small businesses and do not match the needs of movement organizations .
Most importantly , Crabgrass is software libre .
As such , it can be provided as a service by radical tech collectives such as riseup.net .
What Crabgrass Does¶
Crabgrass enables social change organizations to get things done , get the word out , collaborate and network .
To get things done , Crabgrass provides tools like task list management , meeting scheduling , asset management , wiki , and decision making .
When it is time to get the word out , Crabgrass allows groups to create a customized home page where a group can list their event calendar , blog postings , and other public content .
To help collaborate , Crabgrass allows users to rate content , add keywords to content , comment on content , annotate content , alert others to content you need their feedback on , and track participation and revisions .
Additionally , Crabgrass comes with many tools for democratic decision making .
Since no group is an island , Crabgrass allows groups to create networks with other independent groups .
These networks provide a place to work together on shared content and make decisions .
Alternately , you can share a single document if that is the extent of the cooperation ( in development ) .
All of these elements are implemented from a social networking perspective .
Events , for example , allow one to RSVP , see who is coming or watching , and send to your contact ’s calendar .
Share content with exactly the people and groups you want .
You can grant access to view , edit , or administer content .
All content is searchable using a super fast full text search engine .
Every page can have tags , attachments , and ratings .
You can choose to receive notification when a page is updated and you can send notices to people when you want to alert them to a change .
Types of content :
Personal Messages : email like messaging system
Discussions : public or private forums .
Wikis : revision history , locking , automatically view changes since your last visit .
Decision making tools : approval voting and ranked voting .
File management : upload images , audio , and documents .
Task lists
Privacy : every user and group will have control over what information they choose to reveal about themselves .
Security : the first install of crabgrass , hosted at we .riseup.net , is configured to only allow https connections and all data is stored in encrypted format .
Model organizational structure :
Groups : A group is the basic organizational unit of crabgrass .
A group has many people who are members of the group and is a place for those members to share content .
Committees : A committee is subgroup .
Every person in the parent group has access to all the content of the committee , but committee members do not have access to the group ’s content ( unless they happen to be members of both ) .
Committees are useful when a group has a working group or project that needs its own space , but everyone in the larger group should have access .
Committees can also be used to bring outside people in to work on a project but you do n’t want to give them access to all the parent group ’s content .
Councils : A council is committee with special powers .
Suppose you have a collective with full members and provisional members .
You can make the full members part of the council and this will reserve for them certain administrative functions .
Networks : when many groups federate together they can form a Network .
Networks are used for multiple groups to cooperate together on projects .
In the near future , we also hope to add :
Calendaring : group calendars , private calendars , public calendars , events , meeting scheduling , oh my !
Directory : a searchable and browsable directory of activist organizations .
Improved membership process : allow a group to be configured to allow for different types of ( democratic ) membership administration .
Who is creating crabgrass ?¶
Riseup Collective is an autonomous collective of volunteer activist which provides alternative communications infrastructure .
At last count , we had 20 thousand email users , 13 thousand lists , two million list subscribers , and 50 hosted servers .
What does the name mean ?¶
crabgrass is subversive : as the bane of suburban lawns everywhere , crabgrass is the ultimate in grassroots resistance .
crabgrass is diverse : there are 300 species of native to tropical and warm temperate regions .
crabgrass is native to North America , and in important source of food for many birds .
crabgrass is hard to kill : because of its networked nature , it is very difficult to pull out enough crabgrass roots to get rid of it .
it is resistant to many herbicides .

Crabgrass : una aplicación web ¶
Crabgrass es una aplicación web de software libre diseñada para la creación de redes sociales , la colaboración en grupo y la organización en red .
Nuestro objetivo es crear herramientas de comunicación que se adapten específicamente para satisfacer las necesidades de la organización popular desde abajo hacia arriba .
Con la creación de redes sociales , nos referimos a la capacidad de los usuarios para llegar a conocerse unos a otros a través de sus contribuciones en línea .
Por colaboración en grupo , nos referimos a la capacidad de pequeños grupos para realizar sus cosas , como compartir archivos , las tareas de seguimiento y proyectos , tomar decisiones y desarrollar repositorios de conocimiento compartido .
Por una red de organización , nos referimos a la capacidad de varios grupos a trabajar juntos en proyectos de una manera democrática .
Crabgrass actualmente se compone de un conjunto sólido de herramientas de colaboración en grupo , como wikis privados , listas de tareas , archivo de repositorios , y herramientas de toma de decisiones .
Actualmente estamos trabajando en mejorar las herramientas de redes sociales , blogs , y calendarios de eventos , así como un mejor soporte para la colaboración y la toma de decisiones entre los grupos independientes .
Al ser software libre , toda persona es bienvenida de obtener el código 0xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass y seguir las instrucciones para el desarrollo , correrlo en su propio sitio , y aportar mejoras y cambios al código fuente .
Crabgrass está escrito en Ruby utilizando el framework Ruby on Rails .
Mientras los movimientos sociales se han vuelto más expertos en utilizar la web para comunicar públicamente , la mayoría todavía usamos herramientas insuficientes para comunicarnos entre nosotros mismos .
La mayoría de los grupos dependen en gran medida del correo electrónico , listas , y wikis , pero esas herramientas no son adecuadas para la complejidad de las relaciones que las organizaciones de activistas se enfrentan en el mundo real .
Hay muchas webs de redes sociales existentes allá afuera .
Sin embargo , estas ofertas están dirigidas a las necesidades de grupos sociales informales .
Tambien hay muchos servicios web existentes para la colaboración en grupo .
Estos sitios son diseñados típicamente para pequeños negocios y no cuadran con las necesidades de los movimientos .
Lo más importante , Crabgrass es software libre .
Y como tal , puede ser un servicio usado por un colectivo techie radical como riseup.net .
Que hace Crabgrass ¶
Crabgrass permite a las organizaciones que trabajan por el cambio social realizar su trabajo , correr la voz , colaborar y crear red .
Para hacer las cosas , Crabgrass provee herramientas como la gestión de lista de tareas , programación de reuniones , gestión de actividades , wiki , y toma de decisiones .
Cuando es tiempo de hacer correr la voz , Crabgrass permite a los grupos crear una página de inicio personalizada donde un grupo puede incluir su calendario de eventos , blog de anuncios , y contenido público .
Para ayudar a colaborar , Crabgrass permite a las personas usuarias puntuar el contenido , agregar palabras claves al contenido , comentar el contenido , anotar el contenido , avisar a otras que necesitas su feedback en tu contenido , y hacer un seguimiento de la participación y revisiones .
Adicionalmente , Crabgrass tiene muchas herramientas para la realización de decisiones democráticas .
Puesto que ningún grupo es una isla , Crabgrass permite a los grupos crear redes con otros grupos independientes .
Estas redes proporcionan un lugar para trabajar junts en contenidos compartidos y realizar decisiones .
Alternativamente , puedes compartir un documento único si ese es el alcance de la cooperación ( en desarrollo ) .
Todos estos elementos están implementados desde la perspectiva de las redes sociales .
Eventos , por ejemplo , permiten hacer reservaciones , ver quién entra o esta viendo , y enviarlos a la agenda de tus contactos .
Compartir contenidos con las personas y grupos exactos que quieres .
Puedes conceder el acceso para ver , editar o administrar el contenido .
Todo el contenido se puede buscar usando un súper rápido motor de búsqueda de texto .
Cada página puede tener tags , archivos adjuntos , y valoraciones .
Puedes escoger recibir notificación cuando una página es actualizada y puedes enviar noticias a gente cuando quieres avisarles de algún cambio .
Tipos de contenido :
Mensajes personales : sistema de mensajería parecida al email
Discusiones : foros públicos o privados .
Wikis : historial de revisiones , de bloqueo , ver los cambios de forma automática desde su última visita .
Herramientas para realizar decisiones : votaciones de aprobación y ranking de votación .
Administración de archivos : cargar imágenes , audio , y documentos .
Listas de tareas
Privacidad : cada persona y grupo tendrá el control sobre la información que escoge revelar sobre sí misma .
Seguridad : la primera instalación de crabgrass , alojada en we .riseup.net , está configurada solo para permitir conexiones seguras ( sobre SSL ) y todos los datos son almacenados encriptados .
Estructura del modelo de organización :
Grupos :
Un grupo es la base organizacional de crabgrass .
Un grupo tiene muchas personas que son miembros del grupo y es el lugar de los miembros para compartir contenido .
Comites :
Un comité es un subgrupo .
Cada persona en el grupo matriz tiene acceso a todo el contenido del comité , pero los miembros del Comité no tienen acceso al contenido del grupo ( a menos que sea miembro de ambos ) .
Los comités son útiles cuando un grupo tiene un grupo de trabajo o proyecto que necesita su propio espacio , pero cada quién del grupo más amplio debe tener acceso .
Los comités pueden también ser usados para traer gente de fuera a trabajar en un proyecto pero al que no quieres darle acceso a todo el contenido del grupo matriz .
Consejos :
Un consejo es un comité con poderes especiales .
Suppose you have a collective with full members and provisional members .
You can make the full members part of the council and this will reserve for them certain administrative functions .
Redes : cuando muchos grupos se unene pueden formar una red .
Las redes son usadas por múltiplies grupos para una cooperación conjunta en proyectos .
En un futuro cercano , esperamos agregar :
Calendarios : calendario de grupos , calendarios privados , calendarios publicos , eventos , programación de reuniones , oh my !
Directorio : un directorio de búsqueda y navegable de organizaciones activistas .
Mejora de proceso de adhesión : permitir a un grupo ser configurado para permitir diferentes tipos de administración ( democrática ) de adhesiones .
El colectivo Riseup es un colectivo autónomo de voluntarios activistas que provee infraestructuras alternativas de comunicación .
En el último recuento , tenemos 20 mil usuarios de email , 13 mil listas , 2 millones de suscriptores de listas , y 50 servidores alojados .
¿ Cuál es el significado del nombre ? ¶
crabgrass es subversivo : por la perdida de los céspedes suburbanos en todas partes , crabgrass es la última base de resistencia .
crabgrass es diverso : hay 300 especies nativas desde regiones de clima templado a tropical y cálido .
crabgrass es nativo de norte america , y una importante fuente de alimento para muchas aves .
crabgrass es dificil de matar : debido a su carácter de red , es muy dificil sacar las raíces de pasto suficiente para deshacerse de él .
es resistente a muchos herbicidas .
Crabgrass : une application web ¶
Crabgrass est un logiciel libre web conçu pour les réseaux sociaux , le travail collaboratif et l’organisation de réseaux .
Notre but est de créer des outils de communication spécifiquement dédiés aux besoins de l’organisation depuis la base .
Par réseaux sociaux , nous entendons la capacité des utilisateurs d’établir des liens entre eux au travers de leurs contributions en ligne et de leurs présences .
Par travail collaboratif , nous entendons la capacité de petits groupes de faire les choses , comme partager des fichiers , suivre des tâches et des projets , prendre des décisions et construire des bases partagées de savoir .
Par organisation de réseaux , nous entendons la capacité de multiples groupes de travailler ensemble sur des projets dans un esprit démocratique .
Crabgrass consiste actuellement en une suite solide d’outils collaboratifs , comme des pages wiki privées , listes de tâches à faire , dépôts de fichiers et outils de prise de décision .
Nous travaillons actuellement à l’améliorer et ajouter des outils comme des blogs et des calendriers d’événements , l’aide à la collaboration et aux prises de décisions entre groupes indépendants .
En tant que Logiciel Libre , tout le monde est invité à vérifier le code 0xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass et utiliser la documentation de développement , faire tourner leur propre site avec , et apporter des améliorations et changements au code source .
Crabgrass est écrit en Ruby , utilisant le framework Ruby on Rails .
Tandis que les mouvements sociaux utilisent de plus en plus le web pour communiquer publiquement , nous utilisons , pour la plupart d’entre nous , des outils inadaptés pour la communication interne .
La plupart des groupe se reposent essentiellement sur les mails , listes de diffusion et wiki , mais ces outils ne sont pas dimensionnés pour la complexité des relations auxquelles les organisations militantes ont a faire face .
Il existe beaucoup de site de réseaux sociaux .
Cependant , ils sont orientés vers les besoins des annonceurs ou des groupes informels .
Il existe également beaucoup de services web pour le travail collaboratif .
Ces sites sont typiquement conçus pour de petites entreprises et ne correspondent pas aux besoin des organisations militantes .
Le plus important est que Crabgrass est un logiciel libre .
En tant que tel , il peut être fourni comme service par des collectifs radicaux comme riseup.net .
Ce que fait Crabgrass ¶
Crabgrass permet aux organisations de transformation social de faire les choses , passer le mot , collaborer et établir des réseaux .
Pour s’organiser , Crabgrass fournit des outils comme la gestion de liste de tâches à faire , planification de réunion , dépôt de fichier , wiki et outils d’aide à la décision .
Quand il est temps de passer le mot , Crabgrass permet aux groupe de créer une page d’accueil personnalisée où ils pourront afficher leur calendrier d’événements , billets de blog et autres contenus .
Pour faciliter la collaboration , Crabgrass permet aux utilisateurs d’évaluer du contenu , ajouter des étiquettes au contenu , le commenter , l’annoter , alerter autrui sur le besoin de contribution et de retour sur le contenu , et suivre les participations et modifications .
De plus , Crabgrass est fournit avec plusieurs outils pour des prises de décisions démocratiques .
Comme aucun groupe n’est insulaire , Crabgrass leur permet de créer des réseaux avec d’autres groupes indépendants .
Ces réseaux créent une place où travailler sur des contenus communs et prendre des décisions .
Alternativement , vous pouvez partager un simple document .
Tous ces éléments sont mis en place pour une perspective de réseau social .
Les événements , par exemple , permettent à quelqu ’un de lancer un appel , voir qui vient ou regarde , et l’envoyer sur l ’agenda de vos contacts .
Partager du contenu avec exactement les personnes et les groupes que vous désirez .
Vous pouvez donner accès de lecture , d’écriture ou d’administration du contenu .
Tout les contenus peuvent être trouvés via un moteur de recherche très rapide .
Toutes les pages peuvent avoir des étiquettes , des fichiers joints et notées .
Vous pouvez choisir de recevoir des alertes quand une page est mise à jour et vous pouvez envoyer des messages aux personnes que vous voulez prévenir d’une modification .
Types de contenu :
Messages personnels : système de messagerie proche du mail .
Discussions ; forums publics ou privés .
Wiki : historique des modifications , verrous , affichage automatique des modifications depuis votre dernière visite .
Outils d’aide à la décision : votes par approbation et votes par préférences .
Gestion de fichiers : télécharger des images , des fichiers audio et des documents .
Listes de tâches à faire
Vie privée : tous les groupes et utilisateurs contrôlent les informations qu’ils veulent publiciser .
Sécurité : la première installation de Crabgass , hébergée sur we.riseup.net , est configurée pour ne permettre que les connexions chiffrées ( https ) et toutes les données sont enregistrées dans un format chiffré .
Modèle organisationnel :
Groupes :
Un groupe est l’unité de base de la structure de Crabgrass .
Un groupe est composé de plusieurs personnes membre de ce groupe et est un endroit où elles peuvent partager du contenu .
Commissions :
Une commission est un sous - groupe .
Tous les membres du groupe parent ont accès à tout le contenu de la commission , mais les membres de la commission n’ont pas accès aux pages du groupe ( à moins qu’ils ne soient à la fois membres du groupe et de la commission ) .
Les commissions sont utiles quand un groupe a un groupe de travail ou un projet qui nécessite son propre espace , mais auquel tous les membres du groupe peuvent accéder .
Les commissions peuvent aussi permettre à des personnes extérieures au groupe de participer à un projet sans pour autant leur donner accès à tout le contenu du groupe .
Conseils :
Un conseil est une commission avec des pouvoirs spéciaux .
Supposons qu’un collectif ait des membres à part entière et des membres à titre provisoire .
Vous pouvez faire en sorte que les membres à part entière fasse partie du conseil et que ça leur réserverai quelques fonctions administratives .
Réseaux : quand de nombreux groupes se fédèrent , il peuvent former un Réseau .
Les Réseaux sont utilisés pour faire collaborer ensemble de multiples groupes sur des projets .
Dans un futur proche , nous espérons ajouter :
Calendriers : des calendriers de groupe , privés , publics , événements , planification de réunion , rien que ça !
Répertoire : un répertoire d’organisations militantes , pouvant être parcouru ou recherché .
Gestion améliorée des membres : Permettre à un groupe d’être paramétré pour différents modes d’administration ( démocratique ) des membres .
Qui crée Crabgrass ?¶
Le Collectif Riseup est un collectif autonome de bénévoles militants qui fournissent une infrastructure de communication alternative .
Selon le dernier recensement , nous avons 20000 comptes mail , 13000 listes de diffusion , 2 millions d’inscrits sur les listes et 50 serveurs hébergés .
Que signifie crabgrass ?¶
Crabgrass est subversif : comme le fléau envahissant des pelouses de banlieue , Crabgrass est le nec plus ultra de la résistance populaire .
( NDT : jeu de mot intraduisible entre “ crabgrass ” , une plante très résistante et s’étendant par rhizomes , et “ grassroot ” , la base , le peuple )

Elle pousse en Amérique du Nord et est une source importante de nourriture pour de nombreux oiseaux .
( _NDT : là encore un clin d’œil , car de nombreux militants de riseup avaient adopté des noms d’oiseaux comme surnom )

De plus , elle résiste à beaucoup d’herbicides .
( NDT : Le chiendent est sert de référence dans la langue Française pour quelque chose de dur et de résistant dont on ne peut se débarrasser : expressions associées : dur / résistant comme du chiendent )

Web - приложение Crabgrass
Crabgrass — свободно распространяемое web - приложение , разработанное для социальных сетей , совместной групповой работы и организации сетей .
Наша цель — создать инструменты коммуникации , которые отвечали бы потребностям низовых местных организаций .
Под « социальными сетями » мы понимаем возможность пользователей знакомиться друг с другом в процессе совместной работы и присутствия .
Под « совместной групповой работой » мы понимаем возможность небольших групп делать что - либо : например , распространять файлы , отслеживать выполнение заданий и проектов , приходить к совместному решению и создавать репозитории общих знаний .
Под « сетевой организацией » мы понимаем возможность для множества групп работать вместе над проектами демократическим образом .
Текущий стату с
Сейчас Crabgrass состоит из определённого набора инструментов совместной работы , таких , как личные wiki - страницы , списки задач , репозиторий файлов и инструменты принятия решений .
В настоящий момент мы работаем над улучшением инструментов социальных сетей , блогов , календарей событий , а также над улучшение поддержки совместной работы и процесса принятия решений независимыми группами .
Поскольку программное обеспечение свободно , каждый может увидеть исходный ко д 0xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass и , следуя документации , запустить собственный сайт с ним , внести улучшения и изменения в исходный код .
Crabgrass написан на язык е Ruby с использованием Ruby on Rails .
Почему Crabgrass ?
В то время как социальные движения привлекают всё больше участников с помощью публичных web - коммуникаций , мы всё ещё по большей части используем неадекватные инструменты для наших внутренних коммуникаций .
Большинство групп в основном полагаются на электронную почту , списки рассылок и wiki , но эти инструменты не в полной мере отвечают задачам , с которыми активист сталкивается в реальном мире .
Существует много сайтов социальных сетей .
Но все они направлены на обслуживание нужд рекламодателей или неформальных социальных групп .
Также есть много web - сервисов для совместной работы .
Обычно эти сайты созданы для мелкого бизнеса и не отвечают потребностям движений .
Очень важно , что Crabgrass является свободным программным обеспечением .
Таким образом , он может быть сервисом у любого радикального технологического коллектива вроде riseup.net .
Что Crabgrass делае т
Crabgrass позволяет организациям социальных изменений добиваться выполнения задач , обращаться публично , совместно работать и создавать сети .
Чтобы добиваться выполнения задач , Crabgrass предоставляет инструменты вроде управления списком задач , расписания встреч , управления активами , создания wiki и принятия решений .

Кроме всего прочего , Crabgrass снабжён множеством инструментов для принятия решений методом прямой демократии .
Поскольку ни одна из групп не изолирована , Crabgrass позволяет создавать сети с другими независимыми группами .
Эти сети создают пространство для совместной работы над общим контентом и принятия решений .
Кроме того , вы можете поделиться документом , если это и есть область кооперации ( в процессе разработки ) .
Все эти элементы возникли из перспективы развития социальных сетей .
« События » , например , позволяют отвечать на приглашения , видеть , кто приходит или просматривает , отправлять их в календарь ваших контактов .
Функции
Рапространять контент только с теми людьми и группами , с которыми вы хотите поделиться им .
Вы можете давать доступ для просмотра , редактирования или администрирования контента .
Весь контент может быть найдемн с помощью сверхбыстрой полнотекстовой поисковой машины .
Каждая страница может иметь тэги , вложения и рейтинги .
Вы можете настроить получение уведомление при обновлениях страницы и отправлять нотификации людям , когда вы хотите уведомить их об изменении .
Типы контента :
Личные сообщения : система обмена сообщениями , похожая на электронную почт у
Обсуждения : публичные или приватные форум ы
Wiki : история изменений , блокировка , автоматический просмотр изменений со времени прошлого посещени я
Инструменты принятия решений : рейтинговое голосование и одобрительное голосовани е
Управление файлами : загрузка изображений , аудио , документо в
Списки зада ч
Приватность : каждый пользователь и группа могут контролировать информацию , которая доступна о них
Безопасность : первая инсталляци я Crabgrassa на we.riseup.net настроена на поддержку только https - соединений и хранение всех данных только в зашифрованном виде .
Организационная структура модели :
Группы : группа является базовой организационной единицей crabgrassa .
Группа состоит из людей , участников группы , и является местом распространения контента между этими участниками .
Комитеты : Комитет — это подгруппа .
Каждый человек в родительской группе имеет доступ ко всему контенту комитета , но участники комитета не имеют доступа к контенту группы ( за исключением случаев , когда человек одновременно участвует и в группе , и в комитете ) .
Комитеты полезны , когда группа имеет рабочую группу или проект , который нуждается в собственном пространстве , но каждый участник большой группа должен иметь туда доступ .
Кроме того , комитеты могут быть полезны , когда вы хотите привлечь к работе людей со стороны , но не хотите давать им доступ ко всему контенту родительской группы .
Советы : Совет — это комитет со специальными полномочиями .
Предположим , у вас есть коллектив , состоящий из участников и кандидатов .
Вы можете сделать участников частью совета , что сохранит за ними определённые административные функции .
Сети : Когда много групп объединяются между собой на федеративных началах , они могут сформироват ь Сеть .
Сети используются для кооперации многих групп при работе над проектами .
В ближайшем будущем мы планируем добавить :
Поддержку календарей : групповые календари , личные календари , публичные календари , события , ОМГ !
Каталог : каталог активистских организаций с возможностью поиска и просмотр а
Улучшенная обработка членства : позволит группе быть настроенной на различные типы ( демократического ) управления членством .
Кто создаёт Crabgrass ?
Riseup Collective — автономный коллектив волонтёров , который обеспечивает альтернативную коммуникационную инфраструктуру .
По последним подсчётам у нас около 20 тысяч пользователей электронной почты , 13 тысяч списков рассылки , два миллиона подписчиков , 50 серверов на хостинге .
Что означает название ?
Crabgrass дословно переводится как « росичка » ( ползучий сорня к )
Росичка ведёт подрывную деятельность : повсеместно истребляя пригородные подстриженные лужайки , росичка является лидером в низовом сопротивлении .
Росичка разнообразна : существует более 300 видов в тропических и тёплых регионах .
Росичка родом из Северной Америки и является важным источником пищи для многих птиц .
Росичку сложно убить : из - за её сетевой натуры очень сложно вытащить достаточное количество корней , чтобы избавиться от неё .
Многие гербициды на неё не действуют .

Crabgrass ist eine Freie - Software - Webanwendung , die als Soziales Netzwerk der Zusammenarbeit von Gruppen und dem Organisieren von Netzwerken dient .
Unser Ziel ist es , ein Kommunikationsmittel zu schaffen , das perfekt auf die speziellen Bedürfnisse von Organisationen zugeschnitten ist , die sich basisdemokratisch organisieren .
Mit “ Soziales Netzwerk ” meinen wir die Möglichkeit für Benutzer , sich gegenseitig kennenzulernen , durch ihre Teilnahme und Online - Präsenz .
Mit Zusammenarbeit von Gruppen meinen wir die Möglichkeit für kleine Gruppen , Dinge erledigt zu bekommn .
Zum Beispiel den Austausch von Daten , den Überblick über Termine und Projekte zu behalten , Entscheidungen zu finden sowie Sammlungen von geteiltem Wissen zu schaffen .
Wenn wir vom Organisieren von Netzwerken reden , meinen wir die Möglichkeit , für viele einzelne Gruppen in basisdemokratischer Weise zusammen an Projekten zu arbeiten .
Crabgrass besteht im Moment aus einer soliden Sammlung von Werkzeugen für die Arbeit in der Gruppe , wie zum Beispiel private Wikis , Aufgabenlisten und Werkzeuge zur Entscheidungsfindung .
Zur Zeit arbeiten wir daran ein besseres Soziales Netzwerk zu entwickeln , sowie ein Kalendersystem als auch bessere Unterstützung für Zusammenarbeit und Entscheidungsfindung unter unabhängigen Gruppen .
Crabgrass ist Freie Software , jeder ist willkommen den Sourcecode zu prüfen 0xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass und der Entwicklung zu folgen ( Dokumentation ) , seine / ihre eigene Seite zu starten und etwas beizutragen .
Crabgrass ist mit dem Ruby on Rails Framework entwickelt .
Während soziale Bewegung immer mehr dazu übergehen , im Internet offen zu kommunizieren , verwenden viele hauptsächlich unpraktische Arten der Kommunikation untereinander .
Die meisten Gruppen verlassen sich hauptsächlich auf Mails , Listen und Wikis .
Aber diese Tools vernachlässigen die Komplexität die Organisationen von Aktivist_innen in der echten Welt .
Es gibt viele soziale Netzwerke da draußen .
Wie auch immer , diese Angebote werden angetrieben durch die Bedürfnisse von Werbern und informellen sozialen Gruppen .
Es gibt auch schon viele Angebote zur Zusammenarbeit von Gruppen .
Diese Seiten sind aber typischerweise für kleine Firmen zugeschnitten und passen nicht für die Bedürfnisse von Bewegungen .
Am wichtigsten ist , dass Crabgrass eine freie Software ist .
Als solche kann Crabgrass durch ein radikales Tech - Kollektiv , wie zum Beispiel riseup . net angeboten werden .
Was Crabgrass kann ¶
Crabgrass ermöglicht es Gruppen , Sachen zu organisieren , Informationen zu verbreiten , mit anderen zu arbeiten und sich zu vernetzen .
Um Sachen zu organisieren bietet Crabgrass Tools wie Aufgabenlisten , Pläne für Treffen , Aktivitätsmanagement , Wikis und Entscheidungsfindung .
Wenn es an der Zeit ist , Informationen zu verbreiten , ermöglicht es Crabgrass Gruppen , eigene Homepages zu erstellen , auf denen eine Gruppe einen Kalender , Blogs und anderen öffentlichen Content teilt .
Um zu helfen , zusammen zu arbeiten , ermöglicht es Crabgrass den Benutzer_innen , Content zu bewerten , Keywords hinzuzufügen , zu Kommentieren , andere auf Inhalte aufmerksam zu machen , zu denen man selbst Feedback braucht , und Teilnahme und Veränderungen nachzuverfolgen .
Zusätzlich ermöglicht es Crabgrass durch viele Tools , einen demokratischen Entscheidungsfindungsprozess zu starten .
Da keine Gruppe auf einer kleinen Insel existiert , ermöglicht es Crabgrass , sich mit anderen Gruppen zu vernetzen .
Diese Netzwerke bieten Platz , um zusammen an geteilten Inhalten zu arbeiten oder Entscheidungen zu treffen .
Alternativ kannst du ein einzelnes Dokument teilen , falls dies das Ergebnis der Zusammenarbeit wird ( in Entwicklung ) .
All diese Elemente werden aus der Perspektive eines Sozialen Netzwerks heraus implementiert .
Events zum Beispiel können RSVP ’d werden ; so kann jeder sehen , wer teilnimmt , und dieses Event an die Kontakte in deinem Kalender schicken .
Teile genau den I nhalt mit genau den Leuten und Gruppen , mit denen du willst .
Du kannst Zugriff zum Lesen , Editieren und Verwalten des Inhalts erlauben .
Der ganze I nhalt kann durch eine sehr schnelle und exakte Volltextsuche durchsucht werden .
Jede Seite kann Tags , Anhänge und Bewertungen haben .
Du kannst auswählen ob Du benachrichtigt werden möchtest , wenn eine Seite Updates bekommt , und du kannst den Leuten Notizen schicken , wenn du möchtest dass sie auf Updates aufmerksam werden sollen .
Arten von Inhalt :
Private Nachrichten : Email - ähnliches Kommunikationssystem
Diskussionen in öffentlichen oder privaten Foren
Wikis : Änderungsverlauf , Sperrung , Automatisches Anzeigen von Änderungen seit Deinem letzten Besuch
Entscheidungsfindung : Votes über Zustimmung oder Ranked Votes
Dateimanagement : Lade Bilder , Audiodateien oder Dokumente hoch .
Aufgabenlisten
Privatsphäre : Jede_r Nutzer und jede Gruppe hat volle Kontrolle über die Informationen die sie über sich preisgeben
Sicherheit : Die erste Installation von Crabgrass , gehostet auf we .riseup.net , ist so konfiguriert , dass nur Verbindungen über https akzeptiert werden .
Alle Daten werden auf verschlüsselten Festplatten gespeichert
Struktur des Organisationsmodells :
Gruppen : Eine Gruppe ist die unterste Organisationseinheit in Crabgrass .
Eine Gruppe besteht aus vielen einzelnen Nutzer_innen und ist deren Ort , um Inhalte zu teilen .
Arbeitsgruppen ( Komitees ) : Arbeitsgruppen sind Untergruppen .
Jede Person in der Muttergruppe hat Zugriff auf allen Inhalt im Komitee , aber Mitglieder des Komitees haben keinen vollen Zugriff auf den Inhalt der Muttergruppe ( außer sie sind Mitglied in dieser ) .
Komitees sind nützlich , wenn Gruppen einzelne Arbeitsgruppen haben oder Projekte die ihren eigenen Platz brauchen , zu denen aber alle aus der Gruppe Zugriff haben sollen .
Komitees können auch dazu dienen , Fremden es zu ermöglichen an Projekten mitzuarbeiten , ohne dass diese Zugriff auf alle Inhalte der Muttergruppe haben .
Councils : Ein Gremium ist ein Komitee mit speziellen Befugnissen .
Stell Dir vor du hast eine Organisation mit Vollmitgliedern und solchen die nur vorübergehend da sind .
Du kannst Vollmitglieder zu einem Mitglied eines Gremiums machen und ihnen so bestimmte administrative Funktionen und Befugnisse geben .
Netzwerke : Wenn Gruppen miteinander in Verbindung treten entsteht ein Netzwerk .
Netzwerke werden von mehreren Gruppen genutzt , die zusammen an Projekten arbeiten wollen .
In naher Zukunft hoffen wir , Euch zusätzlich folgende Funktionen anbieten können :
Kalender : Gruppenkalender , private Kalender , öffentliche Kalender , Events , Terminplaner , und so weiter
Verzeichnisse : ein durchsuchbares Verzeichnis , das es ermöglicht , mit Organisationen in Kontakt zu treten
Verbesserte Mitgliederverwaltung : Ermöglicht es eine Gruppe so zu konfigurieren , dass verschiedene Typen von ( demokratischer ) Mitgliederverwaltung möglich werden .
Das Riseup Kollektiv ist eine autonomes Kollektiv von freiwilligen Aktivist_innen , die eine alternative Kommunikationsinfrastruktur anbieten .
Zuletzt hatten wir 20.000 Email - Nutzer_innen , 13.000 Listen , 2.000.000 Teilnehmer_innen auf den Listen und 50 gehostete Server .
Was bedeutet der Name ?¶
Crabgrass ist subversiv :
Als der Hauptteil von Suburbanen Rasen überall auf der Welt , ist Crabgrass das ultimative Moment des Widerstands
Crabgrass ist verschiedenartig : Es gibt 300 Arten die von trockenen , zu tropischen und warmen Regionen vorkommen .
Es ist eine wichtige Nahrungsquelle für viele Vögel .
Crabgrass ist schwer zu töten : Dank seiner netzwerkartigen Struktur ist es sehr schwierig genug Crabgrasswurzeln auszureißen , um es loszuwerden .
Zudem ist es resistent gegen viele Pflanzengifte .

Crabgrass : uma aplicação web ¶
Crabgrass é uma aplicação web de software livre feita para a criação de redes sociais , para a colaboração em grupo e para a organização em rede .
Nosso objetivo é criar ferramentas de comunicação especificamente adaptadas para atender as necessidades da organização popular de base .
Por criação de redes sociais , nos referimos à habilidade dos usuários de conhecer uns aos outros por meio de suas presenças e contribuições online .
Com colaboração em grupo , falamos da habilidade de pequenos grupos de fazer coisas como compartilhar arquivos , acompanhar tarefas e projetos , tomar decisões e criar repositórios de conhecimento compartilhado .
Por organização em rede , nos referimos à habilidade de grupos diversos de trabalhar em projetos conjuntamente de forma democrática .
Crabgrass consiste atualmente de uma sólida coleção de ferramentas de colaboração em grupo , tais como wikis privadas , listas de tarefas , repositório de arquivos e ferramentas para tomada de decisão .
Estamos trabalhando , agora , em melhores ferramentas sociais , blogs e calendários de eventos , bem como em melhores suportes para colaboração e tomada de decisão entre grupos independentes .
Sendo Software Livre , qualquer pessoa é bem- vinda para ver o código 0xacab.org / riseuplabs / crabgrass e seguir o guia de desenvolvimento , manter seu próprio site com ele e contribuir com melhorias e mudanças ao código - fonte .
Crabgrass é escrito em Ruby , utilizando a plataforma Ruby on Rails .
Embora movimentos sociais tenham se tornado mais adeptos do uso da web para se comunicar publicamente , ainda estamos , na maior parte das vezes , usando ferramentas inadequadas para nos comunicarmos entre nós .
A maioria dos grupos depende fortemente de email , listas e wikis – mas essas ferramentas não são apropriadas para a complexidade de relações que organizações políticas encontram no mundo real .
Há muitos sites de rede social por aí .
No entanto , as opções existentes são voltadas para as necessidades das empresas anunciantes ou de grupos sociais informais .
Existem também muitos serviços na web para colaboração em grupo .
Esses sites são tipicamente projetados para pequenos negócios e não correspondem às necessidades de movimentos organizados .
Mais importante ainda , Crabgrass é software livre .
Como tal , pode ser fornecido como um serviço por coletivos radicais de tecnologia , como o riseup .
net .
O que o Crabgrass Faz¶
O Crabgrass permite que organizações voltadas para a mudança social sejam produtivas , falem com o mundo , colaborem e formem redes .
Para serem produtivas , o Crabgrass fornece ferramentas como gerenciamento de listas de tarefas , agendamento de encontros , gestão de recursos , wiki e suportes para tomada de decisão .
Quando é hora de falar com o mundo , o Crabgrass permite que grupos criem uma página customizada na qual podem listar calendário de eventos , postagens de blog e outros conteúdos públicos .
Para ajudá - los a colaborar , o Crabgrass permite que usuários avaliem , adicionem palavras - chaves , comentem e anotem conteúdos , que alertem outros usuários sobre conteúdos nos quais precisam de opinião e que acompanhem a participação e as revisões de conteúdos .
Além disso , o Crabgrass vem com muitas ferramentas para a tomada democrática de decisões .
Já que nenhum grupo é uma ilha , o Crabgrass permite que grupos criem redes com outros grupos independentes .
Essas redes garantem um lugar para o trabalho coletivo sobre conteúdos compartilhados e para a tomada de decisões .
Alternativamente , você pode compartilhar um único documento , caso este seja o alcance da cooperação ( em desenvolvimento ) .
Todos esses elementos são implementados a partir de uma perspectiva de rede social .
Eventos , por exemplo , permitem confirmar presença , ver quem vai participar ou assistir e fazer agendamentos no calendário de seus contatos .
Compartilhar conteúdo precisamente com as pessoas e grupos que você deseja .
Você pode permitir acesso de visualização , de edição ou de administração do conteúdo .
Todo o conteúdo pode ser pesquisado por um mecanismo de busca super rápido de todo o texto .
Toda página poder ter tags , anexos e avaliações .
Você pode optar por receber um aviso quando uma página for atualizada e pode enviar avisos a pessoas quando quiser alertá - las de alguma mudança .
Tipos de conteúdo :
Mensagens Pessoais : sistema de mensagens semelhante a email .
Discussões : fóruns públicos ou privados .
Wikis : histórico de revisões , proteção , visualização automática de mudanças desde a sua últia visita .
Ferramentas de tomada de decisão : votação por aprovação e votação preferencial .
Controle de arquivos : faça upload de imagens , de áudio e de documentos .
Listas de tarefas
Privacidade : cada usuário e cada grupo tem controle sobre que informações escolhem revelar sobre si mesmos .
Segurança : a primeira instalação de crabgrass , hospedada em we .riseup.net , está configurada para permitir apenas conexões https , e todos os dados são armazenados em um formato criptografado .
Estrutura organizacional :
Grupos :
Um grupo é a unidade de organização básica do crabgrass .
Um grupo contém muitas pessoas que fazem parte do grupo e é um local para que essas pessoas compartilhem conteúdo .
Comitês : Um comitê é um subgrupo .
Cada pessoa do grupo maior tem acesso a todo o conteúdo do comitê , mas quem faz parte do comitê não tem acesso ao conteúdo do grupo ( a não ser que faça parte de ambos ) .
Comitês são úteis quando um grupo tem um grupo de trabalho ou projeto que precisa de seu próprio espaço , ao qual , todavia , todas as pessoas que fazem parte do grupo maior devem ter acesso .
Comitês também podem ser usados para trazer pessoas de fora para trabalhar em um projeto , quando , contudo , você não deseja dar - lhes acesso a todo o conteúdo do grupo maior .
Conselhos :
Um conselho é um comitê com poderes especiais .
Suponha que você tem um coletivo com membros efetivos e membros provisórios .
Você pode tornar os membros efetivos parte do conselho , e isso reservará a eles certas funções administrativas .
Redes : quando muitos grupos federam - se eles podem formar uma rede .
Redes são utilizadas para que grupos diversos possam trabalhar juntos em projetos .
Em um futuro próximo , também esperamos adicionar :
Calendários : calendários de grupo , calendários privados , calendários públicos , eventos , agendamento de encontros , ufa !
Diretório : um diretório pesquisável e navegável de organizações militantes .
Processo de associação aperfeiçoado : permitir que um grupo seja configurado para ter diferentes tipos de administração ( democrática ) de membros .
Quem desenvolve o crabgrass ?¶
O Riseup Collective é um coletivo autônomo de ativistas voluntários que fornece infraestruturas de comunicação alternativas .
Na última contagem , tínhamos 20 mil usuários de email , 13 mil listas , 2 milhões de assinantes de listas e 50 servidores hospedados .
O que o nome significa ?¶
Super Troopers : US Soldiers to See Through Walls This Year
Seeing through walls is n’t just the shattered dream of every kid who ever coughed up a dollar for X - ray specs .
It ’s soon to be a very real superpower of US troops in war zones .
The US Army plans to ship hand - held detection devices to soldiers in Afghanistan sometime this year ; the devices use low - power ultra - wideband radio frequency to produce images of people or objects concealed behind walls or other obstacles .
Utilizing a wireless connection , the devices can send images back to home base for further analysis .
The sensors work by measuring how radio waves move through and around various materials .
They can not only see if there are people hiding inside buildings ; they can also tell soldiers if walls have any hidden compartments .
But even more importantly , they can help troops sniff out one of the biggest threats to their safety : concealed roadside bombs .
There are , of course , some limitations to the technology , such as the type of material being examined .
Just like those X - ray specs from your childhood , these hand - held scanners are pretty much useless against metal structures .
But giving soldiers the ability to see inside concrete or wood buildings – and even several feet underground – can help keep troops safe as well as help with search and rescue efforts in the event of a disaster .
Tim Burton 's 3D spectacle is only the latest in a long line of films inspired by Lewis Carroll 's creation .
The BFI has unveiled the very first one
Even in 1903 , it seems , Alice in Wonderland was an irresistible invitation to creators of movie special effects .
The BFI has put on YouTube what it reports to be the first - ever movie adaptation of Lewis Carroll 's story – a wildly episodic 10 - minute silent ( originally 12 minutes ; I suppose that might have helped ) in which one spectacular scene after another is introduced with authentically Victorian - looking titling .
The BFI holds the only known copy – found , it says , in the possession of a cinema manager in Hove , and badly water - damaged .
Despite being carefully restored , it reaches us through a blizzard of damaged emulsion .
But there is plenty to enjoy .
Even the scratchiness – along with the delicately shifting tints brought back by the restoration – mean that it evokes not only the Tenniel illustrations , its official inspiration , but also Carroll 's photography .
May Clark , production secretary to directors Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow , makes a satisfyingly matter - of - fact Alice , although her one clear attempt at emotion – a frustrated wipe of the eyes with her handkerchief during the shrinking - and - growing segment – suggests the deadpan may not have been wholly deliberate .
The Cheshire Cat is cool , too , even if he never quite fades back to just his smile , and there 's a startling version of baby - into - pig .
Enough spoilers .
What do you think ?
In a potentially controversial move , US military tech chiefs have decided to investigate the idea of using mobile nuclear reactors to provide power and synthetic jet fuel at forward bases overseas .
In a request for information issued yesterday , Pentagon scientists say they would like to hear proposals for " deployable nuclear reactor technologies for the generation of electrical power and military logistic fuels ( JP - 8 ) in forward land based and maritime military operations " .
JP - 8 is standard US forces jet fuel , regarded as relatively easy to synthesise from commonly available ingredients compared to the other main military fuel , diesel .
Boffins at the US Naval Research Laboratory have already developed processes by which it would be possible to make JP - 8 using carbon dioxide and hydrogen extracted from sea water .
The process would require a lot of energy , but in a US naval context this might not be a problem : American aircraft carriers have powerful nuclear reactors to drive their propulsion and catapults , which would have plenty of surplus grunt whenever full - speed launch operations were n't in progress .
This would be well worth doing , as the onboard supply of jet fuel is the main limiting factor on how long a nuclear carrier can keep operating its planes : the reactor 's uranium lasts for years .
At the moment , the naval boffins ' process produces large amounts of methane as a byproduct .
Methane is a potentially useful fuel , but probably not in a military context ; however , it could simply be dumped into the atmosphere , or more likely burned off in a flare stack for environmental * and safety reasons .
So the " maritime military operations " part of the plan is quite sensible .
But what about " forward land based " reactors ?
Well , from the point of view of a military supply officer , the idea could be an attractive one .
At the moment , a military base in Afghanistan is likely to be powered by generators running on diesel .
Its planes and helicopters will be burning through huge amounts of JP - 8 .
All this fuel has to be brought in by road convoys , along dangerous routes plagued by ambushes and bombings .
It would be great if instead of diesel generators , the base 's electricity came from a reactor that would n't need refuelling for years on end - probably not until after the war was over , in fact .
It would be even greater if the reactor could also top up the base 's supplies of JP - 8 for its thirsty choppers and planes .
The problem here , though , is one of getting hold of the necessary hydrogen and carbon feedstocks with which to synthesise the jet juice .
There 's no limitless supply of seawater here .
Hydrogen could still be obtained from river or lake water , by using reactor power to crack it using electrolysis .
Getting hold of the necessary carbon could be difficult , however , as huge - probably prohibitive - amounts of water would need to be processed to extract useful amounts of CO 2 .
The Pentagon RFI has this to say :
Technical approaches to fuel production should accommodate a broad range of hydrogen and carbon feedstocks ( water / seawater , biomass , waste materials , etc ) .
Concepts that involve carbon capture or sequestration should be well justified in terms of technical feasibility given known carbon concentrations in the proposed carrier stream .
It ’s not something widely mentioned .
However , get a few travelers gathered around a fire or in a circle at the hostel bar , and you ’ll start to hear it talked about : the surprising regularity at which travelers run into each other .
Often these reunions happen several times over the course of a trip , sometimes hundreds ( thousands ? ) of miles and countries apart .
It ’s always a surprise , though it should n’t be , and is usually a welcome occurrence .
It happens in internet cafes , hostel common rooms , and even at random on the city streets .
It seems to defy common sense – after all , the world is a big place , is n’t it ?
The truth is , we make the world we explore significantly smaller by following pre-established paths .
The most significant of which is what I ’ve come to call the Lonely Planet Trail ( LPT ) .
If you ’re like most20 - 30 somethings planning a backpacking / hosteling style trip you probably opted for a Lonely Planet guide book .
Why ?
Because frankly Fodor ’s , Rick Steves ‘ etc. have done an excellent job servicing their own niches but lack real value for the average backpacker .
Meanwhile Lonely Planet has targeted backpackers and done a great job developing a useful resource .
A resource which has become the go - to guide for backpackers the world over and holds a special spot in most backpacker ’s packs , right next to their socks and underwear .
It makes sense when you think about it – no matter how random or willing we are to go off the beaten path , we ’ll still take all the help we can get .
That help ( hostel information , things to see / do , even a map ) typically comes in the form of a blue book with big white text on it .
Which , comically enough , adds a certain level of standardization to our travel route .
The most entertaining part is , that it ’s almost inescapable .
I can be a bit of an Ox at times and it ’s not unusual for me to take off on a trip without doing a lot of research , having an itinerary or taking a guide book and yet , I ’ll still find myself on the Lonely Planet Trail .
Why ?
Because the recommendations I receive , tips and must sees are all driven , in large part , by Lonely Planet .
Going to Guatemala ?
What should you see ?
What should you do ?
Where should you stay ?
It ’s all there , just a few well worn pages away .
Ask ten backpackers and you ’ll probably find that 80 % of their responses are similar / nearly identical and not without good reason .
Lonely Planet does make very legitimate recommendations .
But , those recommendations are also something to be very mindful of when charting your trip .
There ’s a lot of stuff out there that did n’t make it into LP or that the author ’s might not have liked / missed .
Do n’t assume that if it ’s not in the book , it ’s not worth seeing .
Personally , I enjoy traveling along the LPT – in no small part because it ensures a more social experience .
It ’s not , however , ideal for those who are really looking to break free and engage with the local population .
People often complain about how little time they spent away from other travelers .
I ’d suggest that it ’s often because they mistake hostel travel for truly immersive travel – which is n’t always the same .
My biggest suggestion for people who find themselves traveling the LPT is to take a critical look at the suggestions before making decisions .
Is LP great for finding accommodation ?
Yes .
Is it good for finding local “ must see ” attractions ?
Usually .
Is it good for budget / authentic food recommendations ?
Definitely not .
Tour companies ?
Hit or miss .
At the end of the day , I think the thing to keep in mind is that once a company / venue is featured by Lonely Planet , they ’ve become the default go - to source for that service .
Which often results in a decrease in quality , increase in prices , and a decrease in availability .
As you chart the course for your next trip , make sure to take these factors into consideration .
Remember , your ultimate goal is to get what YOU want out of the trip and the best way to do that , is to examine even our most trusty travel tools with a skeptical eye .
Until next time , I ’ll be keeping an eye out for YOU on the Lonely Planet Trail .

A volcanic eruption has just begun under the Eyjafjallajökull glacier .
This has been verified by local authorities in neighbouring Hvolsvöllur .
Vísir reports that farms in the Fljótshlíð area and by Markarhlíð are already being evacuated .
Locals in the area have confirmed that they are viewing flames and a steady stream of lava from the glacier .
Eyjafjallajökull is an active central volcano .
There is reportedly no recorded history of catastrophic eruptions in the area .
The volcano last erupted 189 years ago and apparently caused a lot of ash fall in the area .
Although speculation on the subject is pretty much useless ( especially since your loving team of Grapevine reporters is n’t really comprised of geologists or anything , although we scored pretty well in the subject in high school ) , folks are saying that besides the ash fall the greatest danger lies in glacier bursts or runs stemming from all that hot hot heat melting the glacier .
There might be a bunch of water flooding the area pretty soon .
ANYWAY , this is all moot speculation .
What we know at the moment is that a volcanic eruption is indeed occurring under the Eyjafjallajökull glacier , and that lava is really , really hot .
More on this as it develops .
Hey , we might even be able to get you some pictures .
Stay tuned .

( AP ) -- Aker University Hospital is a dingy place to heal .
The floors are streaked and scratched .
A light layer of dust coats the blood pressure monitors .
A faint stench of urine and bleach wafts from a pile of soiled bedsheets dropped in a corner .
Look closer , however , at a microscopic level , and this place is pristine .
There is no sign of a dangerous and contagious staph infection that killed tens of thousands of patients in the most sophisticated hospitals of Europe , North America and Asia this year , soaring virtually unchecked .
The reason : Norwegians stopped taking so many drugs .
Twenty - five years ago , Norwegians were also losing their lives to this bacteria .
But Norway 's public health system fought back with an aggressive program that made it the most infection - free country in the world .
A key part of that program was cutting back severely on the use of antibiotics .
Now a spate of new studies from around the world prove that Norway 's model can be replicated with extraordinary success , and public health experts are saying these deaths - 19,000 in the U.S. each year alone , more than from AIDS - are unnecessary .
" It 's a very sad situation that in some places so many are dying from this , because we have shown here in Norway that Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) can be controlled , and with not too much effort , " said Jan Hendrik - Binder , Oslo 's MRSA medical adviser .
" But you have to take it seriously , you have to give it attention , and you must not give up . "
The World Health Organization says antibiotic resistance is one of the leading public health threats on the planet .
A six - month investigation by The Associated Press found overuse and misuse of medicines has led to mutations in once curable diseases like tuberculosis and malaria , making them harder and in some cases impossible to treat .
Now , in Norway 's simple solution , there 's a glimmer of hope .

Dr. John Birger
Haug shuffles down
Aker 's scuffed corridors , patting the pocket of his baggy white scrubs .
" My bible , " the infectious disease specialist says , pulling out a little red Antibiotic Guide that details this country 's impressive MRSA solution .
It 's what 's missing from this book - an array of antibiotics - that makes it so remarkable .
" There are times I must show these golden rules to our doctors and tell them they cannot prescribe something , but our patients do not suffer more and our nation , as a result , is mostly infection free , " he says .
Norway 's model is surprisingly straightforward .
- Norwegian doctors prescribe fewer antibiotics than any other country , so people do not have a chance to develop resistance to them .
- Patients with MRSA are isolated and medical staff who test positive stay at home .
- Doctors track each case of MRSA by its individual strain , interviewing patients about where they 've been and who they 've been with , testing anyone who has been in contact with them .
Haug unlocks the dispensary , a small room lined with boxes of pills , bottles of syrups and tubes of ointment .
What 's here ?
Medicines considered obsolete in many developed countries .
What 's not ?
Some of the newest , most expensive antibiotics , which are n't even registered for use in Norway , " because if we have them here , doctors will use them , " he says .
He points to an antibiotic .
" If I treated someone with an infection in Spain with this penicillin I would probably be thrown in jail , " he says , " and rightly so because it 's useless there . "
Norwegians are sanguine about their coughs and colds , toughing it out through low - grade infections .
" We do n't throw antibiotics at every person with a fever .
We tell them to hang on , wait and see , and we give them a Tylenol to feel better , " says Haug .
Convenience stores in downtown
Oslo are stocked with an amazing and colorful array - 42 different brands at one downtown 7 - Eleven - of soothing , but non-medicated , lozenges , sprays and tablets .
All workers are paid on days they , or their children , stay home sick .
And drug makers are n't allowed to advertise , reducing patient demands for prescription drugs .
In fact , most marketing here sends the opposite message : " Penicillin is not a cough medicine , " says the tissue packet on the desk of Norway 's MRSA control director , Dr. Petter Elstrom .
He recognizes his country is " unique in the world and best in the world " when it comes to MRSA .
Less than 1 percent of health care providers are positive carriers of MRSA staph .
But Elstrom worries about the bacteria slipping in through other countries .
Last year almost every diagnosed case in Norway came from someone who had been abroad .
" So far we 've managed to contain it , but if we lose this , it will be a huge problem , " he said .
" To be very depressing about it , we might in some years be in a situation where MRSA is so endemic that we have to stop doing advanced surgeries , things like organ transplants , if we can't prevent infections .
In the worst case scenario we are back to 1913 , before we had antibiotics . "

Forty years ago , a new spectrum of antibiotics enchanted public health officials , quickly quelling one infection after another .
In wealthier countries that could afford them , patients and providers came to depend on antibiotics .
Trouble was , the more antibiotics are consumed , the more resistant bacteria develop .
Norway responded swiftly to initial MRSA outbreaks in the 1980s by cutting antibiotic use .
Thus while they got ahead of the infection , the rest of the world fell behind .
In Norway , MRSA has accounted for less than 1 percent of staph infections for years .
That compares to 80 percent in Japan , the world leader in MRSA ; 44 percent in Israel ; and 38 percent in Greece .
In the U.S. , cases have soared and MRSA cost $ 6 billion last year .
Rates have gone up from 2 percent in 1974 to 63 percent in 2004 .
And in the United Kingdom , they rose from about 2 percent in the early 1990s to about 45 percent , although an aggressive control program is now starting to work .
About 1 percent of people in developed countries carry MRSA on their skin .
Usually harmless , the bacteria can be deadly when they enter a body , often through a scratch .
MRSA spreads rapidly in hospitals where sick people are more vulnerable , but there have been outbreaks in prisons , gyms , even on beaches .
When dormant , the bacteria are easily detected by a quick nasal swab and destroyed by antibiotics .
Dr. John Jernigan at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they incorporate some of Norway 's solutions in varying degrees , and his agency " requires hospitals to move the needle , to show improvement , and if they do n't show improvement they need to do more . "
And if they do n't ?
" Nobody is accountable to our recommendations , " he said , " but I assume hospitals and institutions are interested in doing the right thing . "
Dr. Barry Farr , a retired epidemiologist who watched a successful MRSA control program launched 30 years ago at the University of Virginia 's hospitals , blamed the CDC for clinging to past beliefs that hand washing is the best way to stop the spread of infections like MRSA .
He says it 's time to add screening and isolation methods to their controls .
The CDC needs to " eat a little crow and say , ' Yeah , it does work , ' " he said .
" There 's example after example .
We do n't need another study .
We need somebody to just do the right thing . "

But can Norway 's program really work elsewhere ?
The answer lies in the busy laboratory of an aging little public hospital about 100 miles outside of London .
It 's here that microbiologist Dr. Lynne Liebowitz got tired of seeing the stunningly low Nordic MRSA rates while facing her own burgeoning cases .
So she turned Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn into a petri dish , asking doctors to almost completely stop using two antibiotics known for provoking MRSA infections .
One month later , the results were in : MRSA rates were tumbling .
And they 've continued to plummet .
Five years ago , the hospital had 47 MRSA bloodstream infections .
This year they 've had one .
" I was shocked , shocked , " says Liebowitz , bouncing onto her toes and grinning as colleagues nearby drip blood onto slides and peer through microscopes in the hospital laboratory .
When word spread of her success , Liebowitz 's phone began to ring .
So far she has replicated her experiment at four other hospitals , all with the same dramatic results .
" It 's really very upsetting that some patients are dying from infections which could be prevented , " she says .
" It 's wrong . "
Around the world , various medical providers have also successfully adapted Norway 's program with encouraging results .
A medical center in Billings , Mont. , cut MRSA infections by 89 percent by increasing screening , isolating patients and making all staff - not just doctors - responsible for increasing hygiene .
In Japan , with its cutting - edge technology and modern hospitals , about 17,000 people die from MRSA every year .
Dr. Satoshi Hori , chief infection control doctor at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo , says doctors overprescribe antibiotics because they are given financial incentives to push drugs on patients .
Hori now limits antibiotics only to patients who really need them and screens and isolates high - risk patients .
So far his hospital has cut the number of MRSA cases by two - thirds .
In 2001 , the CDC approached a Veterans Affairs hospital in Pittsburgh about conducting a small test program .
It started in one unit , and within four years , the entire hospital was screening everyone who came through the door for MRSA .
The result : an 80 percent decrease in MRSA infections .
The program has now been expanded to all 153 VA hospitals , resulting in a 50 percent drop in MRSA bloodstream infections , said Dr. Robert Muder , chief of infectious diseases at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System .
" It 's kind of a no - brainer , " he said .
" You save people pain , you save people the work of taking care of them , you save money , you save lives and you can export what you learn to other hospital - acquired infections . "
Pittsburgh 's program has prompted all other major hospital - acquired infections to plummet as well , saving roughly $ 1 million a year .
" So , how do you pay for it ? " Muder asked .
" Well , we just do n't pay for MRSA infections , that 's all . "

Beth Reimer of Batavia , Ill. , became an advocate for MRSA precautions after her 5 - week - old daughter Madeline caught a cold that took a fatal turn .
One day her beautiful baby had the sniffles .
The next ?
" She was n't breathing .
She was limp , " the mother recalled .
" Something was terribly wrong . "
MRSA had invaded her little lungs .
The antibiotics were useless .
Maddie struggled to breathe , swallow , survive , for two weeks .
" For me to sit and watch Madeline pass away from such an aggressive form of something , to watch her fight for her little life - it was too much , " Reimer said .
Since Madeline 's death , Reimer has become outspoken about the need for better precautions , pushing for methods successfully used in Norway .
She 's stunned , she said , that anyone disputes the need for change .
" Why are they fighting for this not to take place ? " she said .

A rare image of a clouded leopard on the ground has been captured by a researcher in Indonesia who was trying to photograph slightly less unusual sun bears .
Wai -Ming
Wong is working on a doctorate at the University of Kent on how the bears ‑ which are regarded as less critically vulnerable than the leopards , but have received far less attention academically ‑ are surviving in human - dominated landscapes .
His field work is sponsored by Chester zoo , allowing him to spend months in the Sipurak forest , part of the Kercini Seblat national park , a Unesco world heritage site in Sumatra .
Over the last three months he has set up 21 camera traps over a 100sq km stretch of the forest , and as well as images of the small , mainly nocturnal bears he is sending Chester unexpected views of other extremely rare creatures , including Sumatran tigers , marble cats , and Malayan tapirs .
The clouded leopard is classified as " vulnerable to extinction " , threatened by hunting for its coat and for traditional medicine , and by the destruction of its native forest habitat across south - east Asia and parts of China .
Wai -Ming
Wong 's image is exceptionally unusual in showing the leopard on the ground in the wild .
The animals spend much of their life high in the trees , their large paws and long tails making them perfectly adapted to balance even on small branches , and flexible enough to run down trunks head first .
A number of zoos across Europe and the US are collaborating on clouded leopard research , conservation and captive breeding programmes .
Revenge of the Chinese chickens : Farmers throw trussed - up eagles into poultry pens to put them off hunting
Chinese farmers are trapping eagles and other birds of prey and throwing them into poultry pens so that the chickens can wreak their revenge on them .
The farmers say the trussed - up eagle is so frightened of poultry after the experience that they never return to hunt them .
Farmers have complained for years about eagles stealing their chickens but face fines or even jail if they kill the birds .
Hen pecked : A chicken exacts its revenge on a trussed - up eagle
So instead they have come up with the idea of catching but not killing them to avoid incurring any penalties .
They say after the trussed - up birds is freed it never returns - while the chickens also learn self defence against the birds of prey .
Farmer Xiao Wu of Huaxi Village at Lin’an said : ' Those eagles have eaten nearly 300 chickens over the past three months , and now I catch them with a trap and let the chickens get revenge .
' Free range chickens get the best price , but the chickens are always the target of the eagles .
I tried every other means to drive the eagles away , including scarecrows , bamboo sticks , even firecrackers .
' But they would always return .
Now when they see their colleagues on the ground being mobbed by chickens they stay away .
And the chickens are learning to be brave enough to drive away their attackers . '
The farmers bind the eagle ’s claws and wings and leave them on the ground as the chickens exact revenge .
Mr Wu said : ' We all know the eagle is a nationally protected species and we will not harm the captured bird other than teaching it to fear chickens .
I ca n’t release it any sooner , otherwise my chickens will all disappear . '

Nation 's soaring deficit calls for painful choices [ USA Today ]
For Father Rupert Frania it seemed the best way .
His parishioners in the Bavarian spa town of Bad Tölz had just learned a terrible secret .
It had been reported that one of their curates was a convicted paedophile , Peter Hullermann .
The curate who had officiated at the children 's mass .
The one who had been with their sons and daughters the year before at a campsite in the mountains over their medieval town .
Frania decided to tackle the issue from an angle .
In his sermon at the main mass last Sunday morning , he began with the parable of the prodigal son – and was stopped dead in mid-sentence .
" I cannot listen to that , " shouted a man who was soon to have been married by Hullerman .
" You just cannot dodge the issue any longer , " he continued as other parishioners broke into applause and some began shouting " shut your mouth " at their parish priest .
It was a raucously rebellious start to a week in which the disclosure of hundreds of cases of alleged clerical sex abuse in the Roman Catholic church 's European heartlands shook the allegiances of millions and forced their pastors to make unprecedented admissions of guilt and mortification .
In Armagh on St Patrick 's Day the primate of All Ireland , Sean Brady , told the congregation in his cathedral that the clergy should admit " the full truth of our sinfulness " .
Brady , who in 1975 was involved in the swearing to silence of two young victims of Ireland 's most notorious clerical paedophile , was one of scores of prelates bowing their heads in disgrace in the Netherlands , Austria , Germany and the German - speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy .
So far almost 700 new cases have come to light .
It was a week of unmitigated calamity for Benedict XVI , who became pope pledging to shore up Christianity in an increasingly secular Europe .
" It is such a big story because everything about it is extreme , " says the religious affairs author and journalist Clifford Longley .
" It is the worst crisis for the Vatican since the middle ages . "
Longley believes the Catholic church is embedded in European history like nothing else .
" It claims divine foundation .
The pope 's title of Vicar of Christ means he still claims to represent supernatural power .
It has been loved and hated , with passion and sometimes loathing .
It dominated the middle ages , launched the Crusades , triggered the Reformation ; the Enlightenment was a direct reaction against it . "
The topic of child sexual abuse provokes strong emotions , even more so when people learn of the steps taken to conceal it .
Nowhere has this veil of secrecy been lifted higher than in the Irish Republic , the focus of three reports since 1994 .
At the start of the millennium the Catholic church in England and Wales commissioned Lord Nolan to investigate priestly abuse .
It resulted in measures to improve child protection policies and reporting procedures , but did little or nothing to address or repair the damage of past abuse .
The 2007 Cumberlege commission reviewed the church response to the Nolan report , but only two of its 72 recommendations dealt specifically with historic cases .
This oversight is something support groups are all too aware of and there are demands for a UK inquiry .
Graham Wilmer , who runs the Lantern Project which has helped hundreds of sexual abuse victims since 2003 , said : " The psychological and emotional damage has affected them throughout their lives .
Until they made contact with us , they have had little if any help in dealing with the aftermath . "
Wilmer was sexually abused by a teacher at a Catholic school and spent years trying to bring his tormentor to justice .
He wants the British government to establish a truth and reconciliation commission to address the issue .
Longley says the scandal " brings into contrast the priest as man of God , symbol of purity and holiness and the sexual abuse of children as the ultimate betrayal of innocence , representing unspeakable evil .
And conspiracy in high places to hide the scandal .
No novelist could have invented such a plot . "
In spite of earning outright condemnation for its clumsy attempts to sweep matters under the carpet , the church will probably overcome these difficult times .
Unlike the Anglican Communion , which buckles under the weight of polarised opinion on homosexuality , the Catholic church always emerges , not entirely unscathed , from adversity .
Longley says the church survived nazism , fascism and communism and will outlast the EU , the UN , the US .
" Bad though this crisis is , it has survived much worse .
At the start of the 16th century the Vatican was little better than a shit - hole . "
The question remains why this situation should be judged so grave when the numbers involved are smaller than in the US , where a 2004 report found evidence in support of almost 7,000 allegations .
One possible answer is the cumulative effect of abuse in so many countries .
The crisis has spread from the US to Ireland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and now the German - speaking heart of Europe .
Not the least of the difficulties is financial .
The church has already had to find some $ 5 bn ( £ 3.3 bn ) in compensation and now faces the prospect of having to fund more compensation , settlements and legal fees at the same time as disgusted Catholics stop their contributions .
Giancarlo Galli , the Italian author of Finanza Bianca , a study of the Vatican 's finances , said : " There is nothing less transparent than the accounts of the church .
It is known that with all the troubles in the US , the church was very much looking north , across the Alps , and above all to Bavaria , for support . "
It has even been suggested that some of the cardinals who elected the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as pope cast their votes with one eye on the material benefits of having a German pontiff .
This is scarcely the first crisis involving what an Australian victims ' group , Broken Rites , has termed black - collar crime .
But never before has a scandal cast doubts on the judgment and authority of a pope .
So far the debate has focused on his role in the Peter Hullermann affair .
Hullermann was transferred to the Munich diocese when Ratzinger was archbishop , ostensibly for therapy .
Though known to be a paedophile , he was moved to a parish where he was convicted of abusing another child .
Christian Weisner , the spokesman for the lay movement , Wir sind Kirche , said that in Munich : " People are asking : ' What did [ Benedict ] know ?
What did he do ? ' "
Many Catholics in Bavaria and elsewhere were ready to accept the diocese 's version – that the decision to reassign Hullerman was made by Ratzinger 's deputy .
But Weisner added : " The pope is asking for transparency .
So he too should be transparent and ask his successor to open the archives for people to see exactly what happened . "
The issue of Benedict 's responsibility goes far beyond Munich to encompass his subsequent role as pope .
Weisner argues that this pope " learned more about clerical sex abuse than any other bishop or cardinal and has done more to fight it than any other cardinal or pope " .
But there is a sharp distinction between his attitude while a cardinal and his activities as pope that could yet leave an indelible stain on the reign of Benedict XVI .
In 2005 he was elected days after declaring that the time had come to sweep " the filth " from his church .
By then he had read – and was disgusted by – files on more than 3,000 clerical abuse cases that were channelled to his department by a decree issued four years earlier by John Paul II .
Most of the cases dealt with by the Vatican department in recent years resulted in the accused being removed , if not defrocked .
The problem for Benedict is that , as in many other theological respects , he changed his mind .
The US Vatican - watcher John Allen this week published in National Catholic Reporter an extract from the transcript of a conference in Spain that showed that , as late as November 2002 , Ratzinger dismissed the American abuse scandals as the result of a " planned campaign " in the media .
By 2002 the then cardinal had signed what critics claim was an incitement to the obstruction of justice .
A letter he circulated to bishops the previous year reminded them that internal church inquiries into certain serious offences were covered by what is known as papal secrecy , for which the penalty is excommunication .
" The question is whether Ratzinger 's past may trump Benedict 's present , " wrote Allen .
I was helping my friend search yesterday for a walk out song for his upcoming boxing match which takes places in a few weeks time .
After mulling over some slightly clichÃ©d suggestions we hit upon some real gems : the boss music from Streets of Rage , Bullet In The Head by Rage Against The Machine , but luckily we stumbled upon a track by The Killabits .
I have to admit I had n’t heard of them before , but their track Stray Bullet is absolutely filthy and instantly sounded like the kind of music we were searching for .
The Killabits are a Canadian duo who have produced an absolute monster of a dubstep track that is guaranteed to get more than a few dancefloors moving this summer .
Enjoy .

Early on , it seemed that Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the Federal Reserve , was willing at least in part to take the heat for the financial crisis .
He did n’t regulate banks more because he assumed bankers would act in their and their firm ’s best long - term interest and not just do what would provide them the best shot at an eight figure bonus that year .
My bad , said Greenspan .
We agreed that Greenspan the Maestro had royally violated the canine on financial regulation and included him on our list of who ’s to blame for the financial crisis .
But , it appears , Greenspan no longer wants to appear on lists like ours .
He has recently been backing away from taking credit for the financial crisis .
He recently wrote a Brookings paper blaming low capital requirements ( something not set by the Fed ) and not regulation or monetary policy for the financial crisis .
He also said he , too , warned people that a housing bubble might be forming .
( Krugman has a good takedown of that excuse . )
On Wednesday morning testifying in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Greenspan stepped up his do n’t blame me response to the financial crisis .
That appears to be Huff Po‘s reading of this the hearings as well .
Instead , he said lawmakers were to blame for pressuring the Fed to boost lending .
He said rating agencies were a leading cause of the financial crisis .
Financial executives failed to understand the risk of their mortgage positions .
And while he was blaming others Greenspan did n’t want us to forget those damn people in East Germany who wanted their freedom .
Shame on them .
It was the global proliferation of securitized U.S. subprime mortgages that was the immediate trigger of the current crisis .
But its roots reach back , as best I can judge , to 1989 , when the fall of the Berlin Wall exposed the economic ruin produced by the Soviet system .
Central planning , in one form or another , was discredited and widely displaced by competitive markets .
Yes , Greenspan said he made some mistakes .
He said about 30 % of the things he did while in government were mistakes , but what was included in that 30 % Greenspan did n’t really say .
And consumer protection was certainly not one of them .
Greenspan says he consistently voted for more consumer protections .
For me , the most anticipated portion of the hearing was “ The Thrilla of Non-Plain Vanilla Derivatives . ”
This was the long awaited rematch of the blond knockout Brooksley Born and the below the belt ( because of his now pronounced hunch ) brawler Alan the Eliminator ( of meaningful regulation that is ) .
If you do n’t know what I am talking about , check out this excellent episode of Frontline .
Here ’s the back story :
In the late 1990s , Born was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and warned that over the counter derivatives , which includes credit default swaps , posed a risk to US markets and economy .
She urged Congress to allow her to regulate the OTC derivatives market to eliminate the risk of some firm making wild bets and then having to be bailed out by Uncle Sam .
Nonetheless , a group of Washington insiders lead by Greenspan put the kibosh on any hope Born had on reigning in OTC derivatives .
Hello , AIG .
Fast forward to today .
Born is now one of the investigators on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and Greenspan stands as one of the accused causes .
Here ’s Born ’s right hook :
“ You appropriately argue that the role of regulation is preventative , ” she said .
“ But the Fed utterly failed to prevent the financial crisis .
The Fed and other banking regulators failed to prevent the housing bubble , they failed to prevent the predatory lending scandal , they failed to prevent our biggest banks and holding companies from engaging in activities that would bring them to the verge of collapse without massive taxpayer bailouts . ”
“ Did n’t the Federal Reserve fail to meet its mandates , fail to meet it responsibilities ? ”
Good stuff .
But Greenspan came prepared , and was able to bob and weave around most of Born ’s jabs .
He scoffed at her notion that his Ayn Rand views on the market influenced financial regulation .
He enforced the laws that were passed even if he would have written then differently .
But Born did land one blow .
Born brought up that Greenspan had led the effort to squash the regulation of OTC derivatives .
Had CDS been regulated Uncle Sam might not have had to shell out $ 180 billion bailing out AIG .
Greenspan countered that AIG ’s failure was that of its investment committee and not the CDS market .
Even if CDS were regulated , AIG could have used some other form of insurance product to allow others to place huge bets against mortgages .
Actually , no , Born said .
Other insurance contracts would have been regulated .
AIG would have put up capital to write that insurance , and since it clearly did n’t have the capital to back up those bets , they never would have been place .
Mortgage bond insurance would have been harder to get since AIG was pretty much the only game in town when it came to the really junky stuff .
Perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans would n’t have been written , and Greenspan and Born would have never had to have a rematch .
So Born won at least one round , if not the bout .
BONUS : Here ’s the Journal ’s take on the Greenspan hearing from the end of their live blog :

' It 's a lot of fun and when I fire the flames out the back it makes me feel just like James Bond , ' said Colin
The device might deter drivers who attempt to overtake him
' The flames are pretty big and up to 15ft long so you could definitely set fire to someone 's car if you wanted to . '
' The only problem is it can get rather hot if you are riding the moped and blast the flames when the wind is in the wrong direction . '
Colin initially tried fixing his road - rage weapon to a BMX bike and it worked so well he decided to try it on his moped .
Now he has even attached a lever to change the angle of the flames .
' It was quite tricky to make and the first version would n't fire the flames when the moped was moving , ' he said .
' My second attempt kept setting fire to itself , but my third version works really well and I 'm very pleased with it .'
But sadly Colin , who built the moped in his spare time in his back garden , will not legally be allowed to use it on the road .
' I 've been told that if I fire the flames while riding on the road it 's equivalent to using a firearm and I could be in a lot of trouble , ' he said .
' Unfortunately I wo n't be able to ride it into the centre of town but it's a lot of fun and I 'll use it off - road . '
Sitting before a backdrop that said “ We are together , ” newscasters introduced scenes of mourning from across the nation : rows of uniformed police officers clutching candles , disheveled quake survivors weeping in the rubble and hundreds of students in raincoats forming the words “ We love Yushu , ” the name of the county that was hit hardest by the quake .
The programming was the same on every channel .
On the Internet , people flooded bulletin boards with outpourings of emotion and expressions of solidarity with the stricken .
During a three - hour televised gala on Tuesday night , more than $ 307 million was donated by state - owned enterprises , army units and viewers .
A similar telethon for the Sichuan earthquake , by comparison , raised about $ 214 million .
Although the Qinghai death toll is far smaller than the 90,000 who died in Sichuan , the government ’s aggressive relief effort in Jiegu , the breathless coverage in the official media and the organized bereavement underscored the Communist Party ’s determination to rally the nation and transform the disaster into a showcase of the party ’s benevolence and resolve .
In recent days , Beijing has promised to spend $ 161 million on relief efforts , and more than 10,000 soldiers , police officers and emergency workers have made the arduous journey to the quake zone , which sits 13,000 feet above sea level .
Relief convoys were so thick earlier this week that they caused a 24 - hour jam on the only road that links Jiegu to the provincial capital 500 miles away .
Would - be volunteers have been ordered to stay away .
Given that most of the victims were ethnic Tibetans , the earthquake has also presented leaders of the party an opportunity to show its softer side to a citizenry that is sometimes at odds with the Han - dominated government in Beijing .
Newspaper headlines have emphasized ethnic unity in the face of tragedy .
Banners draped across military relief trucks declared , “ Whether Han or Tibetan , we are all one family . ”
Venezuela has an election for its national assembly in September , and the campaign has begun in earnest .
I am referring to the international campaign .
This is carried out largely through the international media , although some will spill over into the Venezuelan media .
It involves many public officials , especially in the US .
The goal will be to generate as much bad press as possible about Venezuela , to discredit the government , and to delegitimise the September elections – in case the opposition should choose to boycott , as they did in the last legislative elections , or refuse to recognise the results if they lose .
There 's no need for conspiracy , since the principal actors all know what to do .
Occasionally some will be off - message due to lack of co-ordination .
A fascinating example of this occurred last week when Senator John McCain tried to get General Doug Fraser of the US Southern Command to back his accusations that Venezuela supports terrorist activities .
Testifying before the Senate armed services committee on March 11 , General Fraser contradicted McCain :
" We have continued to watch very closely … We have not seen any connections specifically that I can verify that there has been a direct government - to - terrorist connection . "
Oops !
Apparently Fraser did n't get the memo that the Obama team , not just McCain , is in full campaign mode against Venezuela .
The next day , he issued a statement recanting his testimony :
" Assistant Secretary Valenzuela [ the state department 's top Latin America official ] and I spoke this morning on the topic of linkages between the government of Venezuela and the Farc .
There is zero daylight between our two positions and we are in complete agreement .
" There is indeed clear and documented historical and ongoing evidence of the linkages between the government of Venezuela and the Farc … we are in direct alignment with our partners at the state department and the intelligence community . "
Well it 's good to know that the United States still has civilian control over the military , at least in the western hemisphere .
On the other hand , it would be even better if the truth counted for anything in these Congressional hearings or in Washington foreign policy circles generally .
The general 's awkward and seemingly forced reversal went unnoticed by the media .
The " documented and historical and ongoing evidence " mentioned by General Fraser refers to material alleged to come from laptops and hard drives allegedly found by the Colombian military in a cross - border raid into Ecuador in 2008 .
Never mind that this is the same military that has been found to have killed hundreds of innocent teenagers and dressed them up in guerrilla clothing .
These laptops and hard drives will continue to be tapped for previously undisclosed " evidence " , which will then be deployed in the campaign against the Venezuelan government .
We will be asked to assume that the " captured documents " are authentic , and most of the media will do so .
US secretary of state Hillary Clinton 's attacks on Venezuela during her trip to South America were one of the opening salvos of this campaign .
Most of what will follow is predictable .
There will be hate - filled editorials in the major newspapers , led by the neocon editorial board of the Washington Post ( aka Fox on 15th Street ) .
Chávez will be accused of repressing the media , even though most of the Venezuelan media – as measured by audience – is still controlled by the opposition .
In fact , the media in Venezuela is still far more in opposition to the government than is our own media in the United States , or for that matter in most of the world .
But the international press will be trying to convey the image that Venezuela is Burma or North Korea .
In Washington DC , if I try to broadcast on an FM radio frequency without a legal broadcast licence , I will be shut down .
When this happens in Venezuela , it is reported as censorship .
No one here will bother to look at the legalities or the details , least of all the pundits and editorial writers , or even many of the reporters .
The Venezuelan economy was in recession in 2009 , but will likely begin to grow again this year .
The business press will ignore the economic growth and hype the inflation , as they have done for the past six years , when the country 's record economic growth cut the poverty rate by half and extreme poverty by 70 % ( which was also ignored ) .
Resolutions will be introduced into the US Congress condemning Venezuela for whatever .
The US government will continue to pour millions of dollars into Venezuela through USAid , and will refuse to disclose the recipients .
This is the non-covert part of their funding for the campaign inside Venezuela .
The only part of this story that is not predictable is what the ultimate result of the international campaign will be .
In Venezuela 's last legislative elections of 2005 , the opposition boycotted the national elections , with at least tacit support from the Bush administration .
In an attempt to delegitimise the government , they gave up winning probably at least 30 % of the legislature .
At the time , most of the media – and also the Organisation of American States – rejected the idea that the election was illegitimate simply because the opposition boycotted .
But that was under the Bush administration , which had lost some credibility on Venezuela due to its support for the 2002 coup , and for other reasons .
It could be different under an Obama administration .
That is why it is so ominous to see this administration mounting an unprovoked , transparently obvious campaign to delegitimise the Venezuelan government prior to a national election .
This looks like a signal to the opposition : " We will support you if you decide to return to an insurrectionary strategy , " either before or after the election .
The US state department is playing an ugly and dangerous game .

I know this is not a lua program .
But it is related to helping with writing lua programs .
The library is nice if you are reading large sets of replays , like over 10 k .
( sidenote : if there are lua programmers that can provide a lua example of the library , that would be great ) cget_variables_from_game is a relatively fast library for parsing replay files .
the library has one function and is used like this : and returns a list of winning moves , losing moves and all the joint information ( see example ) .
This program is useful for reading replays and gathering data on best moves , winning replays , etc .
There are three files included: cget_variables_from_game.so - shared c++ library for reading replaystoribash_reading_example.py - a python program demonstrating the librarytest_judo_replay.rpl - sample judo replay file
Texas houses roughly 160,000 inmates in more than 100 state prison units , a sprawling network of secure buildings from Edinburg to Dalhart that few outsiders see or understand .
Now you can explore them all .
The Tribune 's latest data application , one of our most ambitious , includes records and visualizations on each of these facilities and the inmates inside them , including names , crimes , sentences and more .
You do n't need to know an inmate 's name to learn from the data .
The app contains charts and graphs that break down the inmates by ethnicity , gender and age , among other variables .
Users can also see visualizations of the average sentence lengths statewide and in specific prisons .
One chart in the app , for instance , shows that the most common sentence length is from 10 to 20 years :
Inside the app are landing pages for each of the prisons that contain maps , satellite photos and details about the most common convictions and inmate population .
Select the Allred Unit near Wichita Falls , for example , and you 'll see that more than 3,600 inmates are housed there — and that the most common criminal conviction is burglary of a habitation .
Most of the inmates there are serving sentences of longer than 20 years ( more than 200 of which for murder ) .
You can then drill down into inmates ' personal pages and learn about their convictions , sentences , hometowns — even their height , weight and gender .
( Some of this information is available on the state 's prisoner locator , but the system is slow , complicated and often unreliable ) .
The oldest inmate , Corban Henry Wyatt , 91 , entered the prison system eight years ago on a sexual assault conviction .
Among the youngest is Alfonso Hernandez , 16 , who was convicted in 2008 of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced as an adult .
The app also contains landing pages for each crime type — more than 900 in all .
There you 'll see a list of inmates , sorted by the lengths of their terms .
They pages also include visualizations allowing users to see to see the average sentences given for each offense .

As I wrote Monday :
In other words , the correlation between falling home prices and rising defaults , on the one hand , with increasing rental demand and higher rental prices , on the other hand , does n’t hold in a really tough economy .
It thus appears that many of the people who used to own their homes , and no longer do , are doubling up with friends and family .
This is probably not their first choice of living arrangements , but they are doing so because they have no other choice economically .
So where have all these people gone who are no longer homeowners ?
It does not appear that they are moving into apartments or rental housing .
As the second graph shows ( also from Calculated Risk ) , the rental vacancy rate is now at 10.7 % .
While that is down from the record level of 11.1 % in the third quarter , it is up from 10.1 % a year ago , and the 7 - 8 % range that was normal for most of the 1990s …
A smaller percentage of Americans owned their own homes in the 4th quarter of 2009 than at any time since 2000 .
In the 4th quarter 67.2 % of Americans owned their own home , down from 67.6 % in the third quarter and two full percentage points below the peak set in the fourth quarter of 2004 .
Driving the change [ i.e. large numbers of rental vacancies and lower rents ] is the troubled employment market , which is closely tied to rentals .
With unemployment at 9.8 % — a 26 - year high — more would - be renters are doubling up or moving in with family and friends during periods of job loss .
Landlords have been particularly battered because unemployment has been higher among workers under 35 years old , who are more likely to rent .
Nationally , effective rents have fallen by 2.7 % over the past year , to around $ 972 .
Instead , they will move in with friends or family for some time .
In really bad times , people who are evicted from their houses will not rent .
Today , MSNBC adds some important details :
More than 1.2 million households [ have been ] lost to the recession , according to a report issued this week by the Mortgage Bankers Association that looked at data between 2005 and 2008 .
That number does n’t include information from 2009 , when job losses and foreclosures continued to rise .
So it ’s likely that the full impact of the 8.4 million jobs lost and nearly three million homes foreclosed on since the recession began has taken an even bigger toll on the number of American households .
“ Given the depth of the downturn in 2009 , and the ongoing weakness in the job market through the beginning of this year , this study gives no reason to expect that household formation has picked up at all , ” said Gary Painter , a professor at the University of Southern California who conducted the study .
The study also shed some light on what happens to the people in those “ lost ” households .
It ’s widely assumed that many who lose a home to foreclosure become renters .
But since the recession began , there has been a five - fold increase in “ overcrowding ” of remaining households — defined as more than one person per room , according to the study .
That doubling - up is happening as families who lose their homes move in with friends or family .
In other cases , younger people have delayed moving out on their own , instead staying with their parents until the economy improves .
Others who fail to find work after graduating from college move back home .
The decline in households is weighing on both the home buying and rental markets .
Since the number of home foreclosures began surging in 2007 , the national homeownership rate has been steadily falling .
But renters also have been forced to double up or move in with friends or family .
That ’s a major reason that the vacancy rate for U.S. apartments stood at 8 percent in the first quarter , the highest level since 1986 , according to a report this week from Reis , a real estate research firm .
***
Homeownership levels , meanwhile , continue to decline .
New foreclosures filings are running about 300,000 a month , according to RealtyTrac .
There are currently some 5 million homeowners that are 90 days or more past due on their mortgages , according to Fannie Mae chief economist Doug Duncan .
***
In some cases , the loss of a house to foreclosure is leaving families homeless , though there is little national data available on how many are affected .
A recent study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found family homelessness on the rise since the recession began , with the biggest increases in suburban and rural areas .
Other groups , like the National Alliance to End Homelessness , report that a rising number of older adults are without a permanent place to live .
“ The limited existing research tells a story of increasing homelessness among adults ages 50 and older , ” the group said in a recent report .
The formation of new households is n’t expected to pick up again until at least 2012 , according to the MBA study , even as the population continues to increase .
Between 2005 and 2008 , those 1.2 million households were lost even as the population grew by 3.4 million .
The Chicago Public School system is broke .
By now you know the score : pension promises cannot be met and union salaries and benefits are out of line with reality .
Combined with bloated administration costs , the system is bankrupt .
The Sun Times says the best hope is for teachers to accept a wage freeze .
Best Hope ?
Not so fast .
The contract is not up until 2012 , and knowing what we know about unions , the picture is set for massive teacher layoffs or a gut wrenching strike and legal battle if the CEO unilaterally imposes a wage freeze .
Please consider
No way around CPS teacher pay freeze .
Chicago Public Schools CEO
Ron Huberman on Thursday painted the grimmest financial picture the Chicago schools have ever seen .
The budget deficit could top $ 900 million , a hole so big that Huberman says he needs major concessions from teachers -- a move that could easily lead to a teachers ' strike if the unions refuse to play ball .
We 're not alerting parents to cause a panic or to bash beleaguered teachers .
We 're alerting parents now , when there 's still time , to try to resolve this crisis and avoid a strike .
The best hope is for the Chicago teachers to accept a wage freeze .
Huberman can't say that out loud .
On Thursday , he simply laid out the sorry facts of the deficit , saying concessions are one piece of a multi-part solution .
He 's courting the unions now , giving them a chance to pick their poison , hoping they 'll offer up cost - saving ideas .
It is nearly impossible to see a way out of this mess -- or a teachers ' strike -- without a wage freeze .
The Chicago Teachers Union contract locks in 4 percent raises through 2012 -- really about 5.5 percent with experience and higher degrees added in .
Eliminating that raise in 2011 saves $ 135 million .
Undoubtedly , the union will balk at a wage freeze .
Already , Union President Marilyn Stewart has rejected altering the union contract .
In turn , Huberman wo n't budge , arguing he has no cash to spare -- and he wo n't be lying .
CPS ' massive budget deficit , Huberman says , is driven by three biggies : a $ 138 million drop in tax revenue , $ 135 million in increased salary costs and , most significantly , a $ 280 million increase in its pension bill .
Ron Huberman is n't crying wolf .
It 's time for big concessions now -- rather than face massive disruption in the schools and an ugly and fruitless strike down the road .
Not Crying Wolf
Addendum :
I sat next to a public school teacher at a dinner party last night .
He was saying there is total " war " going on at his school right now because they are voting on whether to convert to a charter school .
He blatantly , casually said with no shame whatsoever that converting to charter would be better for the students , but he planned to vote against it because it was n't clear his benefits and salary would be protected .
He said this same thing is going on at several other public elementary and high schools in L.A .
History marks 1974 as the year Nixon left office , Patty Hearst was abducted by the SLA , and India tested its first atomic bomb .
Those of us in the know recognize 1974 as the year two geniuses , Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson , officially expanded their wargaming hobby to include the world 's first role playing game .
The very first edition of Dungeons & Dragons encompassed three cheaply - printed books with amateurish art and a rambling set of rules that assumed the reader was already a wargamer .
Despite all its flaws , this very early edition of Dungeons & Dragons is a wealth of silly artwork and weird rules , making it perfectly suited for the purposes of WTF , D&D !?

Last night Larry King hosted Sinead O'Connor and the Catholic League 's Bill Dohohue to discuss the Vatican 's lack of action on the global pedophilia scandal .
Openly gay former CNN anchor Thomas Roberts also appeared to talk about his own molestation by a Catholic priest .
Donohue : " Al Qaeda suspects are presumed innocent more than the Pope . "
In the third of the below clips , Donohue says he would " like to knock the teeth down the throat " of one of the accused priests .
" I am not going to sit here and see the Pope 's good name maligned . "
Sinead goes rogue during the interview , occasionally blowing off King 's pleas to stop talking and reading quotes from the Bible .

The portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is offered for leasing in the government ’s plan is limited to areas more than 125 miles offshore that are mostly in water depths of 6,000 feet or greater ( Figure 1 ) .
While the administration describes this as a development area , it is a high - risk , ultra deep - water wildcat province .
Sixty - two wells were drilled in shallower areas of the eastern Gulf before the drilling moratorium , and the only prospective area found so far is the shallow - water Destin Dome region off the Alabama coast where reserves are estimated to be 2.7 trillion cubic feet of gas ( equal to about 1.5 months of US natural gas consumption ) .
The geology of the eastern Gulf of Mexico is different from the traditional producing area of the central and western Gulf .
While it contains legitimate petroleum systems , it is a relatively high - cost , high - risk area .
In early April , the Obama Administration announced that it will expand offshore exploration and development to reduce dependence on foreign oil .
The plan that was announced is , in fact , more restrictive than what was already in place , and will have no near - or mid-term impact on our need to import oil .
It maintains the status quo by allowing leasing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and offshore Virginia , and by allowing drilling in certain areas offshore Northern Alaska , but it closes the Bristol Bay area offshore southern Alaska .
All areas in the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of California , Oregon and Washington remain closed .
The area of the Atlantic coast that is included in the government plan is offshore Virginia ( Figure 2 ) .
The Atlantic margin of the U.S. was drilled and evaluated before the area was closed to exploration in the 1980s , and the results were dismal .
More than 50 wells were drilled , and only a few wells in the Baltimore Canyon area off the coasts of New Jersey , Maryland and Virginia had any indications of petroleum .
A few wells tested showed that natural gas could be produced at rates that would probably be commercial onshore today , but not 100 miles offshore .
In frontier areas like the Atlantic Margin and Eastern Gulf of Mexico , big fields are commonly discovered early in the exploration cycle because industry identifies and drills the largest , most obvious features first .
The fact that approximately 50 largely unsuccessful wells have been drilled in each of these areas is discouraging .
The Atlantic Margin seems to be an area where any hydrocarbons that are found will be natural gas rather than crude oil , based on geochemical analysis to date .
While that is not a completely negative factor , further exploration there does little to change our dependence on foreign crude oil , and we currently have abundant supplies of onshore natural gas that can be found and developed at considerably lower cost .
On the positive side , the Atlantic Margin and eastern Gulf of Mexico are huge areas where important discoveries may have eluded early exploration efforts .
Neither of these regions has been evaluated using modern seismic methods that could yield a different view of its potential for producing natural gas or oil .
As someone who works in the exploration and production business , I am in favor of opening these areas and letting industry decide if they have merit .
At the same time , it is important to be objective .
Under the most favorable scenario , it will take many years to acquire and interpret the necessary seismic and geochemical surveys that precede drilling .
If discoveries are made , appraisal drilling , economic analysis , and development planning will require more time .
Infrastructure adds yet another layer of time and complexity .
Evaluation of large oil and gas projects worldwide commonly takes at least six years from discovery to first production .
High - risk , capital intensive oil and gas exploration cannot be expected to produce quick results .
Welcome aboard , says the new Doctor , shutting the door on the outside world .
It 's a cold , gusty day at Doctor Who HQ in Cardiff .
I 'd been hoping for the Tardis , but we make do with his trailer .
The heater is blowing out hot air , and photos and postcards are flapping on the wall .
There 's a picture of a cat , a mate doing a moony , good luck messages .
The trailer has become home for Matt Smith while he 's been filming his first Doctor Who series .
He already feels he 's done his share of time travelling .
Friends , strangers , future fans ask him what it 's going to be like when he's the Doctor , and to answer he has to do a double take – take a trip back to the future .
As far as he 's concerned he 's been busy Doctoring for the last seven months , but of course we 're yet to see the fruits of his labour .
The announcement that Smith was to take over from David Tennant as the Doctor was greeted by the nation with a huge collective question mark .
Matt Smith , who he ?
After all , names such as James Nesbitt and David Morrissey were said to be in the running .
There had also been hints that the BBC was preparing for the first black Doctor ( Paterson Joseph , who played Rodrick in the series ) or the first female ( former assistant Billie Piper ) .
It 's hardly surprising that the supposed shortlist was high profile .
Doctor
Who is the biggest time - travel series in the galaxy .
It 's the longest - running sci - fi show on television , sold to 54 countries , and more than three million Doctor Who DVDs have been sold .
Previous incumbents have included long - scarved legend Tom Baker and white - haired dandy Jon Pertwee .
To make matters worse for Smith , Tennant had just been voted the greatest ever Doctor .
Matt who ?
Today he 's wearing braces and a bow tie , which make his baby face even more incongruous .
After all , so many Doctors were middle - aged at least ( even a little wizened in the case of William Hartnell ) – and , so we thought , they should be if they were single - handedly going to save the world from Daleks , Reapers , Cybermen , the Slitheen , the Sycorax , the Abzorbaloff , the Master , the Adipose and the odd werewolf .
Smith looks a good decade off shaving , his complexion is worryingly white and he 's beansprout thin .
His quiff juts out from his high forehead like an overhanging cliff .
He 's got a touch of the rock - star - from - outer - space about him .
" This is my cat Timmy who 's no longer with us , " he says , giving a guided tour of his trailer walls .
" My mate Timmy .
I can't tell you , man , I luuuuurved that cat .
He got to 18 .
He had a really good innings , that 's why I was so attached to him .
He was called the godfather of the street because he was a bigggggg cat .
I 'm totally going to have a Mini Egg , if that 's all right . "
He digs into my packet and munches away .
" Ah , it 's like heaven in your mouth . "
Words cascade from him , tumbling over each other in the race from brain to mouth .
He 's bouncy and playful – the type of hyperactive puppy you find presenting children 's TV shows on Saturday mornings .
Yet at the same time there 's something about him that 's older than his years .
His vocabulary is a throwback to Enid Blyton 's lashings of ginger beer : the Ken Loach film Looking For Eric is a " belter " that " warms the cockles " , " gosh " is his favourite expletive , he does n't swear .
When David Tennant announced he was stepping down , Smith 's mum suggested he'd make a good Doctor .
Why ?
" Well , I used to have a really stripy scarf at university and people would say it's very Doctor Who ! "
Is that all ?
He ums and aahs , and says there might be something else .
" I guess I 've always hoped …
There 's something irreverent or wreckless or mad or brilliant .
Do n't we all hope that we could be the Doctor , somewhere ?
Is n't that what makes him great ? "
Actually , Smith did n't originally hope he could be the Doctor .
He hoped – rather , assumed – he would be a footballer .
He grew up in Northampton , went to a good local secondary which had formerly been a grammar school , did as much work as was necessary to see him through his exams , and played football .
Every day , every evening , he played .
He was good , too .
Signed on at youth level with Northampton Town , then Nottingham Forest and Leicester City .
His dad had been a decent centre - back , and his grandfather had played as a striker for Notts County .
There was only one thing he was ever going to be : a first - class centre - back .
Then , at 16 , he got a back injury .
For a year his father , who runs a plastics business , drove him from Northampton to Leicester every day for treatment .
Eventually , he returned to action .
But it was n't the same – the pace , confidence and hunger had gone .
Leicester City released him .
" I could have signed for a lower league club but it was a risk , and the last few games I did n't want to play , I dreaded it .
I 'd lost that desire , the urge , the enjoyment , all the things you need in life .
I mean , what 's the point in doing something you do n't enjoy ? "
He makes it sound like an easy decision now , but it was n't .
" I was talking to my dad about it the other day .
It 's the one time …
Yes , I was in a mess .
Football was everything .
You think it 's the one thing you do in your life , your whole focus … "
For a nanosecond he sounds almost downbeat .
" But it 's like anything … it 's not the disappointment , it 's how you react to it . "
And how did he react ?
" I went to do my A - levels and started doing drama .
I 'm totally going to have another Mini Egg , if that 's all right . "
His drama teacher , Mr Hardingham , nurtured Smith .
When he did n't turn up for rehearsal , he gave him a second chance .
" Like great teachers do , they change your life .
He got me forms for the National Youth Theatre .
And I did n't fill them in . "
Mr Hardingham persisted .
Eventually Smith did fill in the forms , won a place , went on to study drama and creative writing at the University of East Anglia and discovered that acting gave him a similar buzz to football .
" There are great disciplines from being a sportsman that you can transfer into being an artist .
The preparation , the sacrifice , the constant desire to improve . "
Smith looks at me .
He notices the sweat pouring from my face .
It 's boiling in the trailer .
" Oh God , I 'm so sorry , you should have said . "
He jumps up , turns the heat down , pops a Mini Egg into his mouth , sits down and looks out of the window .
He points to the neighbouring trailer that belongs to the Doctor 's new assistant , played by Karen Gillan .
" She 's very beautiful , mad as a box of cats . "
He stops .
" In a brilliant way …
We 're both pretty mad , I think , which is why it 's cool . "
Does he fancy her ?
" Me , Matt Smith , or the Doctor ? " The Doctor ?
" Well , you 'll have to see , wo n't you ? "
And Matt Smith ?
" Noooh ! " he protests .
" She 's my mate , Kaz , I just take the mick out of her every day . "
It 's not very gentlemanly to say you do n't fancy her , I say .
" No , listen , she 's a beautiful woman , you know , but we work together – that would be an error .
That would be an error ! "
Has he always been popular with girls ?
" I like to think so . "
Last year it was reported that he was going out with Brazilian singer Mayana Moura .
Are they still together ?
" No , no , no , no , " he says in a rush .
Smith is single again .
What is he looking for in the ideal woman ?
" Oh gosh !
Daisy Lowe is taken , so that 's out of the question .
Haha ! "
Who 's she ?
" She 's a pretty lady …
Oh , I do n't know .
Someone lovely with a good heart who enjoys the things I enjoy … who plays the guitar . "
He talks about how tough the work is , and the hours they have to put in .
" By the end , we 'll be filming from 11 pm till nine in the morning … then they need to shoot in the mornings because of the light .
D'you know what ?
It is exhausting .
We 've been shooting for seven and a half months now , and the line - learning is quite immense for the Doctor because he's in pretty much every scene , and he says the majority of stuff because his brain is the coolest and the biggest . "
After filming , he does a couple of hours a night of revision , learning his lines .
Is it worse than school ?
" No , because you 're the Doctor , so the payoff 's greater .
It 's not like triple maths with Mr Humzinger .
There 's not that much coffee breath . "
When he got the job , he had to keep it secret .
He 'd sit watching Doctor Who with his flatmate , desperate to tell him he was the new Time Lord and having to keep schtum .
" It was a complete nightmare . "
Eventually he told his father .
" He was rather flabbergasted .
When I told him , he laughed .
He was excited , elated and very proud . "
It 's such a strange time in his life .
A year ago , he was pretty much unknown – fans of the television series Party Animals , in which he played a parliamentary researcher , or those who had seen him at the Royal Court in That Face , playing the carer son of Lindsay Duncan 's alcoholic mother , might have been able to put a name to the face , but he hardly had a mass following .
At Christmas , he made his first ( and so far only ) appearance as the Doctor , when David Tennant regenerated into him .
Today , he can just about get away with walking around unbothered .
In a few weeks , he will be a star , one of the most recognisable actors in the country .
" There are n't many jobs that change the fabric of your life in the same way – where you go from being a working actor who is pretty anonymous , to being thrust into what is one of the most popular shows , if not the most popular , in Britain . "
Is he nervous ?
Look , he says , it 's his job , he 's taking it all in his stride .
Then he stops .
Of course he 's nervous .
" It 's unlike any job I 'll ever do because a ) there 's so much that comes with it , b ) there 's so much that is expected .
I 'd be lying if I said the first day I walked on the beach , where we filmed , and I saw the Tardis , and there were all these paparazzi there , and you 're going , what the hell is going on… ? "
In his rush to get the words out , he often forgets to finish sentences .
Has he sought the advice of former Doctors ?
He tells me he recently had lunch with Peter Davison , who told him simply to enjoy the ride .
He also had a word with David Tennant .
" I spoke briefly to David .
He was just very lovely and gave me encouragement , but I think you have to cleave it out yourself .
It 's your own journey . "
Surely it makes it that bit tougher when he 's following the most popular Doctor ever .
" Yeah , yeah .
I guess you 've got to approach it with your own take or spin .
No , spin is the wrong word .
Identity .
How can you not be aware of the rich heritage and legacy ?
Over Christmas it was everywhere .
It was the big thing , David leaving the show .
But it only intimidates you as much as you allow it to . "
I tell him about my 10 - year - old friend Joseph .
Joseph cried when Tennant left .
More to the point , he cried when he saw Smith for the first time .
I feel mean mentioning it , but perhaps it 's a measure of Smith 's task , to win over the fans .
He looks a little crestfallen .
Then there are the bloggers , complaining that , at 27 , he is too young , too much like an emo rock star , too pretty , too ugly , too everything .
" Thanks for reminding me . "
How can he put them at ease ?
" What is my retort to them ?
Thank you for your kind and considered comments … hehehehe .
Everybody 's entitled to an opinion .
But an emo ?
Maybe it 's my hair . "
Back to Joseph .
He wants to know how Smith is going to make the Doctor his own .
" He 's a little reckless .
He 'll walk into a room and have a million things to do .
And , as opposed to knowing exactly how to get out , he 'll take it up to the precipice : do n't know , do n't know , do n't know , and boom , there 's the idea .
And it 's a bit mad and reckless .
It 's very doof , doof , doof .
And he 's got a companion who I think is the hardest to handle .
And she 's quite mad .
But the Doctor 's quite mad as well .
So together … "
Is he going to be one of those melancholy doctors like Christopher Eccleston , weighed down by his traumatic history ?
" I think it 's impossible to escape that with the Doctor .
He 's lost so many people and devastated so much … bad or good , he 's brought whole empires down .
He 's seen a lot , and that 's part of his personality .
But that 's also what gives him such joy and effervescence . "
As he talks I notice a long scar running down his forehead .
Is it the result of a football injury ?
" No , I cracked that open as a kid at nursery , and had to have 24 stitches .
Can you see where it goes back ?
You can peel my hair back if you want . "
So I do , and tell him this is not the first actor I 've got intimate with – I once pulled a hair out of Daniel Day - Lewis 's ear .
He looks impressed .
" Really ?
He 's a genius .
I 'm having another Mini Egg .
What an actor !
That 's what we 're all aiming for .
To turn in bits and bobs like that ! "
Apart from the football blip , you sense Matt Smith is used to achieving the goals he sets himself .
At school , he decided he wanted to be head boy , and won the election .
" I was the outside choice .
I curried favour among friends .
I just wanted the mantle . "
Really ?
" Yeah , course , man .
I wanted to run things .
I wanted control .
It was the highest position , and I wanted the highest position .
Why not ?
Then you get to organise the ball and you get to say if you have a year book and every Tuesday you go out for a meeting for two hours and get out of triple maths .
There was a big hoo - ha with a mate called Dean , because he thought I was using underhand tactics to get votes . "
But get the votes he did .
Whereas previous head boys were straight - A students who had gone on to Cambridge University , Smith was not a swot .
But even when stressing his averageness , he ends up revealing more about his determination .
" I got an A , B and C. A in Drama .
B in Psychology . "
He bangs the table .
" I should have got an A , man .
Should have got an A .
That ticked me off ! "
At university he went on to get a very average degree .
He squirms when he mentions his 2:2 , but adds by way of explanation that he spent much of the last six months away from his course acting professionally .
Just to think , he says almost wistfully , he had once planned on doing a degree in politics at Sheffield .
Why did he want to study politics ?
" I just wanted to be intelligent , or seem intelligent , and go to a redbrick university and go , ' Oh yeah , I 'm doing politics ! '
I used to read Gore Vidal books and think I was cool . "
What would he rather be , a political thinker with a good degree or the Doctor ?
He looks at me as if I 'm absolutely bonkers .
" Come on ! " he shouts .
" Politics was a ridiculous idea .
I would have been rubbish .
It 's the Doctor ! "
• The new series of Doctor Who starts on BBC1 at Easter .
An intricate and incredibly geeky series of clues recently embedded in videogame Portal suggest that we have n't seen the last of renegade artificial intelligence GLaDOS and the game that made her famous .
It all started when Valve announced that it would be patching its 3 - year - old game .
Monday 's Portal patch notes included the cryptic message , " Changed radio transmission frequency to comply with federal and state spectrum management regulations . "
To quote comeradealexi , the Steam forum user who first commented on the achievement , " Huh ? "
Still , the first hint soon started a wild goose chase that had gamers flexing their geekiest muscles to uncover new information about the Portal universe .
This is n't the first time Valve has set up a viral ad campaign around Portal .
When the game launched in 2007 as part of The Orange Box , Valve created a special Aperture Science website where players could discover the back story of the fictional company and its morally challenged founder , Cave Johnson .
But Valve 's recent cryptic patch was more than just a simple tweak or a link to a new website .
An intricate system of clues and hidden messages , the Portal rabbit hole goes quite deep , giving gamers a sprawling interactive endeavor to whet their appetites for a probable sequel .
A newly added Portal achievement illuminated the first clues .
Dubbed " Transmission Received , " the achievement is awarded to players who find and listen to mysterious broadcasts on 26 radios placed throughout the game .
Players who carried the radios to the correct spot in every level discovered Morse code audio transmissions as well as loud radio squelches .
The decoded Morse code messages suggest that GLaDOS , the rogue AI from the first game , might be rebooting .
And the ear - busting noises discovered on some levels turned out to be slow scan radio transmissions – images embedded in an audio signal .
The images , many featuring the Aperture Science logo , held more clues , leading players to a dialup bulletin board system .
Those who cracked the BBS login and password and connected to the retro server discovered more clues – this time by way of ASCII data streams .
Also hidden on the bulletin board were a series of memos from Cave Johnson – the fictional founder of Aperture Science .
What does this all mean ?
Nobody except Valve knows for sure quite yet .
But one thing 's for sure – geeks once again have GLaDOS on their minds .
We 'll surely be hearing more from the evil computer very soon .
Until then , track the mystery as it unravels at the Steam forums .

FOR America 's Central Intelligence Agency , the glory days of its “ Darwin ” patrols in Iraq were short - lived .
Following the defeat of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , the American - led forces faced clever homemade bombs triggered with the remote controls used to open garage doors .
So CIA agents drove around transmitting garage - opening signals to blow up any bombmakers who happened to be nearby .
This “ survival of the fittest ” culling , which gave the scheme its nickname , quickly became less effective when the bombers came up with new and better detonators .
“ We had to keep going back to the drawing board , ” says a former senior CIA official .
And still the battle continues , with each new bombing advance met by a new countermeasure .
As insurgents and terrorists have improved their handiwork , improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) have become their most lethal weapons .
In Iraq , IEDs are responsible for two - thirds of coalition deaths .
In Afghanistan such attacks have roughly tripled in the past two years .
The bombmakers ' skills spread rapidly .
Thierry Vareilles , a retired colonel in the French army who led bomb - squad missions in a dozen countries , says as soon as one group has come up with “ hoax ” wiring designed to trick bomb - disposal experts , even distant groups soon start using the treacherous configurations .
International travel and the internet help distribute ideas and designs , and not just among groups that share the same ideology .
The right signal
After garage - door triggers , bombers switched to using mobile - phone components to trigger detonators — and from a greater distance .
Next , because mobile - phone signals can be randomly delayed or jammed , they turned to long - range cordless phones which do not pass through a telecoms network .
Some jamming equipment can scramble these signals , as well as those from mobile phones , but the best kit devours battery power and costs more than € 100,000 ( $ 140,000 ) .
Also , jamming sometimes wrecks a security force 's own communications , a predicament known as “ electronic fratricide ” .
Switching tactics again , the bombmakers reverted to simple triggers that avoid signals altogether .
Cheap light sensors can detonate a bomb in a dark room when a door is opened .
Colombian terrorists make bombs that detonate when a foot pushes down a concealed syringe that connects a battery - powered circuit .
As John Adams , a colonel working at America 's National Security Agency ( NSA ) , puts it : “ We 're always one step behind them . ”
Rudimentary “ contact ” detonators , using two wires or metal plates that are pushed together , are now common in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere .
American forces fitted some vehicles with extra wheels that protrude from the front ( explosions ahead of a vehicle are less destructive than underneath it ) .
But insurgents started placing contact triggers a few meters beyond the bomb .
Using powerful vehicle - mounted air blasters , soldiers can search for contact wires by blowing away leaves , sand and soil .
But it is not fail - safe .
BAE Systems , a British defence firm , is devising an alternative .
It uses a vehicle - mounted camera , object - recognition software and satellite positioning to create detailed 3 - D maps of roads , pinpointing features such as pot-holes .
When vehicles subsequently pass along the same road the system can spot any new features , such as a rubbish heap or anything else that might hide a bomb .
James Baker of BAE , who is working on the project , says defeating IEDs is now the operational priority for Britain 's defence ministry .
Many explosives are made of volatile compounds that readily release particles into the air .
Equipment that can sniff these vapours could help find bombs .
Lynntech , a company based in Texas , is working on a hand - held sniffer which is expected to cost about $ 20,000 when it is ready in about three years .
It uses a small spectrometer to bounce infrared light off particles in the sample .
By analysing the wavelengths of the reflected light it can identify specific chemicals .
The company plans to fit these sniffers on airborne drones , too .
At least this technology has some foundation in science .
A few years ago an east European company offered the American army a device that resembled a car antenna on a fancy handle .
“ The story went that somehow this rod and your body generated static electricity ” and the antenna would twitch if pointed toward explosives , says a colonel who tested equipment in Baghdad .
Once it became clear that this claim would be tested , the vendor was never heard of again .
Nevertheless , wands of this sort became widely used in Iraq and beyond .
According to one tally , the Iraqi government purchased more than 1,500 of them from one company at $ 16,500 - 60,000 each .
It has since emerged that explosives that killed more than 150 people in Baghdad on October 25th 2009 had probably been smuggled through a checkpoint equipped with these wands .
Britain recently banned exports of such devices and arrested a businessman who was selling them .
Discovering IEDs , however , is not enough ; they must then be neutralised .
Robots can move them and place explosives to blow them up .
But many robots are too big and heavy to be carried by soldiers on foot .
QinetiQ , a British firm which makes the widely used Talon robot ( pictured above ) , has a new lightweight back - packable version called Dragon Runner .
It costs more than $ 150,000 .
An alternative is to zap an IED with a laser .
The Laser Avenger , which is being developed by Boeing , is a vehicle - mounted system that can slowly heat explosive material from several hundred metres .
This can eventually cause a bomb to explode , but with less than half of its usual force .
An improvised explosive device
A simpler contraption has been crafted by the leader of a bomb squad in Cotabato City in the Philippines .
Francis Señoron , an army captain , has built “ IED disrupters ” out of small blasting caps and a water canister the size of a beer can .
When positioned close to a device and detonated remotely with a wire , the canister squirts water into the circuitry of the device to short it out .
Curious American officials have asked for more details , but Captain Señoron , who hopes to patent his innovation , is keeping it under wraps for now .
Better blast protection helps , too .
Mine - resistant ambush - protected vehicles ( MRAPs ) have V - shaped underbellies to deflect blasts outward .
In 2008 America spent more than $ 16 billion on MRAPs , according to Visiongain , a market - research firm based in London .
But some MRAPs weigh more than 30 tonnes , are unwieldy to drive and can damage roads .
A new generation of MRAPs is on its way .
These feature suspended seats to protect riders from shock waves below .
The Ocelot , an MRAP built by Force Protection of South Carolina , is made from lighter and stronger steel .
At only a quarter of the weight of some vehicles , it also has a new and more effective V - shaped hull and a removable “ crew pod ” that allows more of a bombed vehicle to be salvaged .
Kevlar airbags may eventually provide even better protection .
Survival Consultants International , a small Florida company , is using several layers of Kevlar and other tough materials to design external airbags that would inflate nanoseconds after a blast and absorb some of its force .
Yet as vehicles get tougher , the blasts get fiercer .
Already in Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan makeshift “ explosively formed projectiles ” — disks of copper or other metals that are shaped by a blast into a hurtling lump — can smash through some of the toughest armour .
American soldiers in Afghanistan remotely control a bomb - defusal robot
An endless war ?
Can technology really win the fight against IEDs ?
The bombmakers ' equipment may appear to be relatively crude , but it is cunning enough to stymie counter - IED systems , admits Wayne Shanks , a spokesman for NATO 's International Security Assistance Force in Kabul .
Yet Colonel Adams of the NSA sees something that could tip the balance in the army 's favour : predictive - analysis software .
Computers are good at determining how myriad variables might affect events .
Bombs , for example , are more likely to be planted in damp ground on dark moonless nights in areas where opposition is high .
Bombers tend to communicate frequently with certain clerics , drive slowly through potential attack zones and return home without having got out of their cars .
Separately these things mean little , but by combining data from hundreds of different sources , software can calculate how probable it is that IEDs have been placed and possibly the area where they are .
Richard Rowe , an American major general in Baghdad , says predictive software is already helping identify terrorists .
For example , he says , bombmakers could be spotted if they rent apartments near potential targets to bring apparently harmless IED ingredients past checkpoints , rather than completed bombs .
Capturing or killing bombers may , however , reduce attacks only briefly .
The reason for this , says Kenneth Comer , deputy director of intelligence at the Joint IED Defeat Organisation , an American defence agency , is that taking them out of circulation can actually strengthen terror networks by encouraging the remaining members to jostle for power and experiment with new and more lethal techniques .
Predictive analysis , he says , often appears to serve as an “ evolutionary algorithm ” that replaces the weak with others who may be even more capable .
If such “ survival of the fittest ” is really going on , then the technological leap - frogging in the IED war will sadly continue — and only a political settlement will end it .
Mike Chiappetta at MMA Fighting ( who also writes for UFC Magazine , " " the approved news of the UFC " " ) breaks down some of the problems with Strikeforce 's non-exclusive contracts and why the same wo n't happen to the UFC :
So Strikeforce is hardly the first organization to have a fighter hold out ; it 's just that the circumstances with non-exclusive deals tilt the leverage away from the organization and towards the fighter -- or at least a fighter with the clout of Emelianenko .
Strikeforce 's willingness to free certain fighters for possible paydays in non-U.S. promotions is an athlete - friendly gesture , but can now work against them .
Should negotiations get ugly ( and there 's nothing to suggest they 've yet devolved to that level ) Emelianenko can simply walk away -- or threaten to walk away -- to a promotion such as DREAM or Sengoku , or even to fight under his own M - 1 banner , as long as its overseas .
...
Keep in mind that Emelianenko's reps have a history of shall we say , hardball tactics .
In 2007 , he struck a deal with U.S. - based Sibling Sports that would result in a new promotion .
That organization -- ironically , to be called M - 1 Global -- spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees during contract negotiations .
After agreeing to a $ 1.5 million bonus for Emelianenko and $ 2 million per fight to him and his management team , according to sources , the new M - 1 company was in the process of planning its first show when Emelianenko 's management declared him a free agent , saying he'd never officially signed a contract .
They never ran a show .
In 2008 , Emelianenko and M - 1 signed a deal to have him compete in co-promotions with Affliction , but after just one fight with the promotion , his M - 1 team asked for and received a reworked extension that would pay Emelianenko $ 300,000 per fight while M - 1 would receive $ 1.2 million in fees for its services .
The really really intriguing thing here is this : nobody except the UFC has the money to outbid CBS / Showtime / Strikeforce for Fedor 's services .
DREAM has been held out as a possibility , and might serve Fedor for a placeholder fight against say Josh Barnett .
Long - term until they get a major network TV deal in Japan , DREAM just is n't that big a player .
Here 's my fantasy scenario based on the rumors I 'm hearing fifth hand --
Fedor and M - 1 are pulling their usual game of changing the deal in the middle .
They have to have other possibilities in order to justify risking killing Strikeforce .
The only realistic alternative for Fedor is the UFC .
His deal with M - 1 could possibly create an opening for Fedor to leave M - 1 and sign directly with the UFC , leaving Strikeforce holding a worthless contract with M - 1 and not Fedor .
The UFC 's recent deals in Dubai might allow them to set up a non-U.S. company that could sign with Fedor and still having him fighting for the UFC , on U.S. ppv but not on U.S. soil .
I 'm hearing that one of the international relationships Zuffa 's new middle eastern partners bring is with Russia .
The timing is right for Fedor to be able to get a tune - up fight in the UFC ( say Randy Couture or Cro-Cop ) before having to face Brock Lesnar , Shane Carwin , or Cain Velasquez .
It 's just speculation , but it sure would be cool if Dana White and company pulled it off .
As I 've said many times , if the UFC manages to sign Fedor while he 's still the undisputed # 1 heavyweight in the world , it means they hold the linear champ in every division of men's MMA .
It 's called Game Over .
But before we get our hopes up for a happy ending , let 's remember that Fedor and M - 1 Global are looking out for their own best interests , not the best interests of us , the fans .
Injera is not only a kind of breadits also an eating utensil .
In Ethiopia and Eritrea , this spongy , sour flatbread is used to scoop up meat and vegetable stews .
Injera also lines the tray on which the stews are served , soaking up their juices as the meal progresses .
When this edible tablecloth is eaten , the meal is officially over .
Injera is made with teff , a tiny , round grain that flourishes in the highlands of Ethiopia .
While teff is very nutritious , it contains practically no gluten .
This makes teff ill - suited for making raised bread , however injera still takes advantage of the special properties of yeast .
A short period of fermentation gives it an airy , bubbly texture , and also a slightly sour taste .
Injera Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants have modified their recipes after moving to the United States or Europe , depending on what grains are available to them .
The injera you find in many East African restaurants in the United States includes both teff and wheat flours .
Most injera made in Ethiopia and Eritrea , on the other hand , is made solely with teff .
Recipe Conversions CAUTION
Kids , please dont try this at home without the help of an adult .
Tip
Depending on where you live , teff flour can be difficult to come by .
Try a well - stocked health food store .
What Do I Need ?
Teff grain  1/4 cup teff flour
 3/4 cup all - purpose flour
 1 cup water
 a pinch of salt
 peanut or vegetable oil  a mixing bowl
 a nonstick pan or cast - iron skillet
Tip
If you have teff grain instead of flour , first grind it in a clean coffee grinder , or with a mortar and pestle .
If you have teff grain instead of flour , first grind it in a clean coffee grinder , or with a mortar and pestle .
What Do I Do ? 1 .
Put the teff flour in the bottom of a mixing bowl , and sift in the all - purpose flour .
2 . Slowly add the water , stirring to avoid lumps .
3 . Put the batter aside for a day or more ( up to three days ) to allow it to ferment .
In this time , your injera batter will start to bubble and acquire the slight tanginess for which it ’s known .
Note :
If you find that your injera batter does not ferment on its own , try adding a teaspoon of yeast .
4 . Stir in the salt .
5 . Heat a nonstick pan or lightly oiled cast - iron skillet until a water
drop dances on the surface .
Make sure the surface of the pan is smooth : Otherwise , your injera might fall apart when you try to remove it .
6 . Coat the pan with a thin layer of batter .
Injera should be thicker than a crêpe , but not as thick as a traditional pancake .
It will rise slightly when it heats .
7 . Cook until holes appear on the surface of the bread .
Once the surface is dry , remove the bread from the pan and let it cool .
Did You Know ?
Teff is extremely high in fiber , iron , and calcium .
Teff is extremely high in fiber , iron , and calcium .
Tip
Many Ethiopians in America use square - shaped , electric , nonstick pans .
These heat evenly and make it easy to remove the injera once it is cooked .
Did You Know ?
Teff is the smallest grain in the world .
It takes about 150 teff seeds to equal the weight of a kernel of wheat !
What s Going On ?
If you ve ever cooked pancakes , making injera might seem familiar .
In both cases , tiny bubbles form on top as the batter cooks .
Keeping an eye on these bubbles is a great way to see how close the pancake or injera is to being ready without peeking underneath .
These bubbles come from the carbon - dioxide produced by the leavenerusually baking powder or soda in the case of pancakes , wild yeast in the case of injera .
Neither batter contains much gluten .
Most pancake recipes tell you not to mix the batter too much :
If you do , gluten will develop , making them too chewy .
Teff , the grain used to make injera , contains very little gluten to begin with .
In both cases , the result is the same :
With no gummy substance to blow up ,  most of the carbon - dioxide from the leaveners rapidly escapes into the air , leaving the little popped bubbles that contribute to the distinctive textures of these breads .
What Else Can I Try ?
 You can experiment by adjusting the ratios of wheat and teff flours in your recipe , or by adding another type of flour altogether .
You can also let your batter ferment for more or less time , depending on how sour you like your injera to be .

To see for yourself how little gluten there is in teff , try kneading some teff flour into a ball of dough .
( You might also include teff flour in the gluten ball activity ) .
Youll get very different results than when you use wheat flour .

The March issue of Gregor.us Monthly , As The World Turns , has now been published .
In this report I mark the now completed process whereby the United States lost the ability to control the price of oil , via the power of its own demand .
The controlling factor now in global oil prices are the five billion people in the developing world .
They use less oil per capita and derive more utility from each barrel .
Which is a good thing , as the global supply of oil is now unable to make a sustained response to higher prices .
Of course , in the West , we have come up with all sorts of weak explanations to explain our loss .
The loss simply unfolded over the past decade , as global oil supply finally ran into geological constraints .
It ’s not because of speculation .
It ’s not because of price fixing .
And it ’s not because of any newfangled theory such as “ Peak Demand . ”
From my March newsletter :
Peak Demand theory paints a child - like portrait of a large and powerful kingdom happily choosing at its own convenience to transition away from oil , to renewable energy resources .
But no such smooth transition is in the offing , as we now understand .
For , here in 2010 in the aftermath of a burst credit bubble , the United States and the rest of the OECD are not on the threshold of an energy crisis but remain very much in the middle of one .
Front month oil , as we go to press , closed at $ 83.50 per barrel to finish out the first quarter , of 2010 .
Meanwhile , recent data on Housing , Employment , Wages , Savings , Foreclosures , Commercial Real Estate–and the European banking system–are hardly encouraging .
The same class of post - war analysts who failed to predict oil ’s entry into a new pricing era circa 2004 ( and who are still in denial ) have gone silent as expensive oil now unfolds over very weak Western economies .
The five billion people in the developing world know nothing about Peak Demand theory , or other such myths from oil - consultant hatcheries in America .
The price of oil does not move to the drumbeat of US demand , and will not wait for us to prepare , or “ get ready ” for higher prices .
Many still believe in some extra reservoir of oil supply that will come to our rescue .
I look at the chart , and wonder why .

Here lies John Locke , and in more ways than one .
In fact , in last night ’s Now the season has REALLY begun episode of Lost , ” The Substitute , ” we were given three different John Lockes .
( Maybe even four , if you believe my contention that Sawyer has become a surrogate Locke in the story .
More on that later . )
Officially , there was John Locke the Island adventurer , now a ripe , sun-bleached corpse buried six feet under on Boone Hill after Captain Frank Lapidus declared the impromptu graveside service ” the weirdest damn funeral ” he ’d ever been to .
There was ” John Locke , ” aka the Locke- ness Monster , the fearsome Island entity now wearing the Ben- murdered castaway ’s visage , who oozed sincerity as he / it / whatever downloaded oodles of noodle - expanding mythology … although can we really trust him / it / whatever ?
And there was Sideways John Locke , a tough and tender man , so superior to his dead Island doppelganger in many ways , save possibly one .
We met him as he fell flat on his face , yet another humiliation for a soul who seems to be destined to suffer a daily diet of humiliations no matter which ” island universe ” he happens to reside upon .
But this John Locke can laugh when the fates make fun of him .
This John Locke has the self - awareness and strength to grow and change .
And this John Locke is loved , and better , he knows it , and we were reminded last night how much we need that kind of love , both to flourish and survive .
Especially if you have to spend long days at work enduring the prickly interoffice machinations — severe coffee making retinue — of Benjamin Linus .
( Who would win in a sneer - off : Professor Snape or Professor Linus ?
Debate ! )
Fittingly , ” The Substitute ” came to us during Valentine ’s Day week , and it played like a love letter to Locke .
Allow me to give some love right back .
Terry O’Quinn is the man , and big hugs to him and everyone who made ” The Substitute ” the first truly great episode of the season , a moving mythapalooza that framed and galvanized the Island story line and proved that the Sideways storytelling device is capable of producing powerful , poignant yarns … even if we still have no freakin’ clue what the hell is going on over there in Otherworldland .
At the very least , it was totally better than last week ’s episode .
The Other(s ) World
A Serious Man , Part One : The Parable of the Parking Lot
” Can I share something with you ?
Because I too have had the feeling of losing track of Hashem , which is the problem here .
I too have forgotten how to see Him in the world .
And when that happens you think , well , if I ca n’t see Him , He is n’t there any more , He ’s gone .
But that ’s not the case .
You just need to remember how to see Him .
Am I right ?
I mean , the parking lot here .
Not much to see .
It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the Hebrew school window .
But if you imagine yourself a visitor , somebody who is n’t familiar with these autos and such , somebody still with a capacity for wonder , someone with a fresh perspective ?
you can see Hashem , you know , reaching into the world . ”
— Rabbi Scott , speaking to faith - challenged Larry about the existence of God / the divine ( aka Hashem ) , A Serious Man
Who was the late John Locke ?
Who was he really ?
” The Substitute ” offered at least three opinions on the matter .
One came from Sawyer , who drunkenly pissed on dead Locke ’s memory :
He remembered him as someone who was always scared even when he was pretending he was n’t .
( Personally , that sounds like a better description of ?
Sawyer himself .
And , I suspect , this monstrous , little boy - spooked UnLocke thing . )
Another interpretation came from his killer , Ben , who eulogized him with a speech that somehow mixed two unlikely sentiments : heartfelt appreciation and snarky glibness .
” John Locke was a believer , a man of faith , and a much better man than I will ever be , ” Ben said adding , ” And I ’m very sorry that I murdered him . ”
Classy , Ben .
And a classic Lost moment .
A third point of view on John Locke came via the Sideways , and I would sum up the assessment by using a line from last night ’s literary reference , John Steinbeck ’s Of Mice and Men : ” A guy goes nuts if he ai n’t got nobody . ”
Now , the Sideways story line did n’t actively portray its John Locke as destroyed by loneliness or abandonment .
On the contrary : Sideways John Locke had self - confidence , self - awareness , and a genuine self .
He also enjoyed the security of knowing he was loved by his soulmate , Helen .
But I wonder if that ’s part of the important point of these parallel world stories .
Lost is creating the means for us to see these too - familiar people with fresh eyes .
By presenting them as something profoundly different , as profoundly ” Other , ” the castaways are revealed anew , or perhaps even for the first time , by the comparison .
” The Substitute ” gave us one of the best cold opens of Lost ever .
We saw Sideways John Locke pulling into the driveway of a house on a street that resembled one we saw in Season 2 ’s ” Lockdown , ” when pre-wheelchair Locke was working as a house inspector and checking out a home in Irvine being purchased by Sayid ’s lady love , Nadia .
( Maybe Sideways Nadia is Sideways Locke ’s neighbor .
Might Sideways Sayid be on his way ? )
I loved the pensive look on Locke ’s face as he rode the lift down from his van .
Then the lift jammed , leaving Locke stuck .
He fiddled with controls , then tried rolling off the platform , hoping to stick the landing like an Olympic ski jumper .
Nope .
Locke dropped from his place in the sky and belly - flopped onto his lawn — a mundane suburban analog to one of his several mythic Island falls , none more monumental than his plummet from the heavens in the pilot episode .
Then , the insult to injury : the sprinkler system activated , dousing Locke in the face .
Lost ‘s perpetual Job figure responded by .. rending his hairshirt and cursing God ?
Nope .
He laughed .
This totally surprised me .
I expected an explosion of ” Do n’t tell me what I ca n’t do ! ” outrage .
But this John Locke is a man who can roll with the joke when the cosmos decides to treat him like a punchline .
NEXT : Locke ’s got love
My heart rejoiced when I saw Helen bound out the front door and rush to Locke ’s side and laugh with him as she helped him to his figurative feet .
I always liked their relationship , and I hated that Locke had squandered her love to chase after his bad dad ’s affection , and I must admit I watched last night ’s episode in a state of dread that this Locke was going to do something really stupid to scare this Helen away , too .
We were told nothing about how this Locke and Helen met .
But we were told they have an October wedding date , and given that it ’s late September in the Sideways world , I ’m predicting that their Big Day will serve as a key moment for the entire Sideways arc — perhaps the time and place when all the disparate story lines will converge .
Does Sideways Locke have a better relationship with his father than Island Locke had ?
It ’s possible .
When Helen suggested they elope after a frustrating phone call with a caterer , she pitched him on the idea of bringing Papa Locke along for the ride .
John did n’t respond to the mere mention of his existence by involuntarily punching her in the face , so I ’m guessing Sideways Anthony Cooper had nothing to do with crippling his son .
ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I’M THINKING ?
We know from season 1 that Boone Carlyle ’s mother , Sabrina Carlyle , owned a massively successful wedding business , and that Boone served as the company ’s chief operating officer .
Methinks the Carlyle family biz will play a role in solving Helen ’s catering crisis ?.
I know a fair number of women who think John Locke is all kinds of hot , so I ’m thinking they appreciated Locke ’s bath , warmly flirting with Helen over color swatches , and then getting smooched on his bald head .
Personally , I was more distracted by Locke ’s reaction to Helen ’s destiny talk .
He told his fiancé that he encountered a certain spinal surgeon at the airport named Jack Shephard who offered him a free consult .
Helen sparked to the story .
” What are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon ?!
Who knows ?
Maybe its destiny ? ”
Locke was clearly intrigued by the prospect , but he did n’t seem all that dazzled by Helen ’s semi-mystical mumbo jumbo .
He parroted the word back to her with a hint of incredulity .
He was n’t rude about ; I got the sense that part of being ” a sweet man ” to Helen involves not crapping on her worldview , not to mention her curious ” Peace and Karma ” shirts .
But this was a clearly a Locke who did n’t believe in higher power - directed fate like his dead Island world counterpart .
I thought it was interesting the way he described the walkabout later in the episode .
He called it ” an adventure ” about ” man versus nature . ”
By contrast , when Island Locke described the Walkabout in the classic season 1 episode of the same name , he called it ” a journey of spiritual renewal , where one derives strength from the earth and becomes inseparable from it . ”
Island Locke wanted to be feel connected to the world , to something bigger than himself ; Sideways Locke wanted to feel his own strength , to feel whole again — to feel like a man .
How to account for the discrepancies between the two Lockes ?
There were a couple moments when I wondered if Sideways Locke had learned a thing or two from the experiences of his Island doppelganger via ?
quantum entanglement ?
Psychic connection ?
Past - life memories ?
( ” When we ’re puzzled we have all the stories that have been handed down from people who had the same problems . ” — A Serious Man )
Still , this matter of cross-universe connection was hard to say this week .
For the third straight episode , the episode ’s lead character was given a conspicuous moment in the bathroom , looking long and hard in the mirror .
Where Jack saw an explicable ( continuity ) flaw on his skin and Kate watched herself flutter through the déjà vu blinky - blinkies , Locke struck a more conventional , contemplative pose , absent of any hint that he might be aware of his Island self .
Which makes sense , given that Island Locke is , like , dead .
But two simpler explanations for Locke ’s apparent agnosticism / atheism are ( 1 ) It might be too painful for him to consider divine possibilities ( If there really is a God or grand design to my life , why the hell did He / She / It cripple me ? ) ; or ( 2 ) this Locke is a product of different influences , none of which have produced a yearning for divine connection or eyes to see the divine in the world .
Might his life be richer if he were to allow himself to reconsider his spiritual perspective ?
Or might his life become worse ?
Processing ?
processing ?.
Like his Island alter - ego , Sideways Locke worked at a box company owned by Hurley .
The pictures in Locke ’s cubicle were interesting .
There was a photo of Locke ( with hair ) with his father , Anthony Cooper ; they looked to be hunting , as we saw them back in ” Deus Ex Macina . ”
There was also a photo of Locke with Helen in a tropical setting , presumably Hawaii .
The curious thing about both photos : Locke appeared to be standing .
When and how did Locke become dependent on a wheelchair for pedestrian perambulation ?
TBD .
Island Locke did n’t get thrown out of that eighth - floor window by Bad Dad leaving him below - the - belt paralyzed until after Helen dumped his father - fixated ass .
So it appears that Locke ’s loss of lower legs was a trauma that he and his soul mate experienced together .
NEXT : Locke ’s Hurley and Rose reunions
{C}
We were reintroduced to Locke ’s jerk boss , Randy .
He derisively called Locke ” colonel . ”
If that confused you , remember that Island Locke played a military strategy board game Axis and Allies during his lunch break with a friend / colleague ( not seen last night ) and liked to be called ” colonel . ”
In this world , Locke was supposed to have gone to Australia for a conference .
According to Randy , Locke blew it off to attempt his walkabout .
Oops .
And Randy fired him with ice cold terseness .
Locke ’s face : priceless .
Not just shock , but maybe ?
emasculation , too ?
That may sound heavy , but bear with me : I think it works with what followed .
We then got the very interesting scene in the parking lot .
Locke rolled to his car and found his wheelchair - equipped van inaccessible because a very large hummer had parked much too close .
Locke snapped .
This time , the insult to injury was too painful to not ignore .
He could have avoided the sitch had he parked in the handicapped stall , but as Locke would explain , he did n’t want to .
Locke then had an encounter with Hurley , who in the Otherverse is large and in charge and not at all the fatalistic scaredy - cat Island dude we met in season 1 .
Was it just me , or did you get a Jacobesque vibe from Hurley , all empathetic benevolence as he responded to his ex-employee ’s prickly anger with patience and grace and supreme knowingness and the hooked him up with a new job via his temp agency , another division of Hurley ’s financial empire ?
Watching this scene , I could n’t help but think about Helen ’s earlier line about destiny .
And I found myself flashing back to this scene later in the episode , when Helen challenged Locke ’s incredulity about miracles .
Was the Locke - Hurley crossing total coincidence , quantum synchronicity , or divinely orchestrated appointment ?
An elemental faith / reason debate worthy of old school Lost .
But I am reminded of the old adage that our world is chockablock with everyday miracles — they just do n’t look the way we expect them to .
What we expect is something like , say , miraculous healing for crippled legs after falling from the sky .
But a miracle could be other people , too — like meeting a guy who can give you a job after getting fired , and better than that , a guy who sets you upon your true destiny .
But we ’ll get to the school in a minute .
PS : Did you see what was in Locke ’s box of stuff in his lap ?
Was that a polar bear figurine in there ?
The Sideways scenes just rolled , one great scene after another .
The moments in the temp agency hit me emotionally .
It started funny - surreal , like a moment from a Coen brothers film , when Locke got processed by a decidedly quirky clerk who first tried to get into his mind and figure him out .
But Sideways Locke is not a man who wants or needs to be cracked open and explained .
But he did want a job , and he seemed to want something more than a good income from it , too .
He wanted a job that made him feel strong again — that made him feel like a man .
The posters on the wall bore slogans like ” Live your dream job ! ”
The subtext : Your self - worth , your very identity , is measured by your profession , by what you produce … .
And then Rose , beautiful Rose , the Island ’s woman of faith , walked in and blew that bulls — up .
Locke wanted a job as a construction site manager .
He wanted be in charge .
He wanted to build stuff .
He wanted be a serious man , taken seriously .
And Rose said : Really ?
Seriously ?
She said she ’d be happy to give him the job but he ’d only be back in her office looking for another job the next day .
Why ?
Yes , because the wheelchair thing was going to be a problem .
But after he pushed back on that , she told him about her cancer , a cancer that was killing her , and how she had to struggle to fight through her denial and embrace the brutal truth of her finitude — and how doing so had brought her peace .
She encouraged him to do the same — to find meaning not in what he can or ca n’t do , but in who he is , and who he loves .
That last part was hammered home by Helen when Locke finally came clean with her about his Australian walkabout — or rather , his aborted Australian walkabout .
Yep , he lied to Boone on the plane .
Like his Island counterpart , Sideways Locke was denied his outback adventure .
And like his Island counterpart , Sideways Locke raged in response : ” Do n’t tell me what I ca n ’t do ! ”
But this John Locke is capable of reflecting upon moments and realizing :
My god , I must have sounded like ?
a big douche !
Interesting that in an episode that saw the Locke- ness Monster spout Locke ’s famous catchphrase , Sideways Locke came to the same conclusion about his situation that Smokey articulated in the premiere .
They were right to deny me the walkabout , because it ’s true — there are things I simply ca n’t do .
He told Helen he was sick of daydreaming about life outside his chair , tired of imagining himself walking her down the aisle on their wedding day .
He wanted to move into the liberating grace of brutal truth about himself and move on with his life .
He asked Helen to do the same : ” I do n’t want you to spend your life waiting for miracles , Helen , because there is no such thing . ”
NEXT : Cave theories
Helen was more than prepared to join him on that journey , but on one condition :
She was n’t buying into his worldview .
” There are miracles , John , ” she said .
” And the only thing I was ever waiting for was you . ”
And then she kissed him .
The moment between them seemed to suggest that for all his maturity , humility and strength , John Locke could learn a thing or two by becoming a man of faith .
Their moment together reminded me of yet another exchange in A Serious Man :
Rabbi Scott :
You ca n’t cut yourself off from the mystical or you ’ll be - you ’ll remain - completely lost .
You have to see these things as expressions of God ’s will .
You do n’t have to like it , of course .
Larry :
The boss is n’t always right , but he ’s always the boss .
Rabbi Scott :
That ’s right !
Things are n’t so bad !
Look at the parking lot , Larry .
Just look at that parking lot .
For now , though , John Locke is a man of science .
Literally .
You caught that , right ?
He accepted a job as substitute teacher .
Subject : Biology .
First lesson : the human reproductive system .
It also looked like he was either teaching physical education or coaching basketball .
There were some deeply embedded ironies here .
FLASHBACK WHOOSH TO ?
the season 4 episode ” Cabin Fever , ” in which Teenage Locke was encouraged by a teacher to cultivate his natural talent for science by attending a summer camp run by Mittelos Biosciences , the Others ’ company that recruited miracle - grow fertility doc Juliet Burke to The Island .
But Locke did n’t want to hear that .
He wanted to drive fast cars and play sports .
When he was told his dreams were unrealistic , Young Locke bellowed , ” Do n’t tell me what I ca n ’t do ! ”
What a difference a ( Jughead - spawned ? ) parallel reality makes .
Here in the Sideways world , Locke is teaching science , teaching sports , and looking very much like a man who just found his niche .
Of course , there ’s still ample time for his born again life to go horribly wrong .
After all , he ’s now working with Benjamin Linus ?.
In the wake of the episode , we were left this to wonder about the Sideways story line :
Was this the life Island Locke was always supposed to have ?
That seemed to be the implication of the Locke- ness Monster ’s blockbuster allegation / revelation that Jacob had tampered with the lives and destinies of Locke and five other castaways , all in hopes of grooming one of them to replace him as protector his worthless little rock in the Pacific .
Which brings us to ?.
This Island Earth !
A Serious Man , Part Two : The Uncertainty Principal
” The Uncertainty Principle .
It proves we ca n’t ever really know … what ’s going on .
So it should n’t bother you , not being able to figure anything out –although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term . ”
— Physics professor Larry Gopnik to his students , A Serious Man
What a gift this episode must have been for Terry O’Quinn .
The Sideways story allowed him to play a complex human being shaded with nuance , while the Island world story line allowed him to play a deadly serious man , a force of nature superman , but not without his own complications and shadings .
I loved the little moments when Smokey incarnate took time to enjoy being flesh and blood and muscle — picking up the machete and feeling the strength in his arms , licking the booze off his fingers .
Behold !
The Superman John Locke always yearned to be !
But be he hero or be he totally bizarro ?
Still too soon to call , but last night left me leaning back toward bad guy .
I thought this was an interesting newsflash from Ilana : Smokey is losing his shapeshifting mojo .
By choosing Locke has his avatar , he ’s becoming stuck with it , and you really got the sense that this god - like entity was settling into his new skin , his new home .
But I also wondered what else Smokey might lose as he becomes more human .
Will he lose the ability to turn to smoke and snake and coil through the jungle ?
Too bad , because that effect was pretty damn neat .
But did you wonder as I did if perhaps some vestige of John Locke that got absorbed by Smokey along the way might be ” infecting ” him to ironically appropriate some Island parlance ?
I got that latter vibe from the moment when we heard Un - Locke bellow , ” Do n’t tell me what I ca n ’t do . ”
I was equally impressed by Josh Holloway last night , too .
It seemed to me that Sawyer has taken John Locke ’s place in the Lost narrative , albeit a warped variation of what Locke represented .
Enthralled by The Monster ’s ” raw power ” ( to borrow the title of The Stooges record Sawyer was listening to ) ; lured by the Monster ’s promise of answers and revelation ; given mission and purpose by the Monster —
Sawyer became a dark knight of faith , a sinister ” substitute ” for the deceased Locke .
Or so I think the show made it seem … .
The Fake Locke / Sawyer story line — in which the Monster led Sawyer to a remote cave which he promised would contain MUCHO MYTHOLOGICAL ILLUMINATION — echoed previous episodes of Lost .
I ’ll cite just two in particular .
( 1 ) ” The Brig , ” in which the real John Locke led Sawyer across the Island to the Black Rock for a bloody date with Anthony Cooper ; and ( 2 ) ” Every Man For Himself , ” in which Ben snowed Sawyer into thinking he ’d implanted a killer pacemaker in his chest , then hiked him up a hill to reveal he was no longer stuck on the Island , but actually trapped on another .
It was in that episode that Sawyer first told us about the book that he cited again last night , John Steinbeck ’s Of Mice and Men , though Ben trumped him with it .
Explaining why he was able to successfully manipulate Sawyer , Ben cited the book in his answer : ” We did all this because the only way to gain a con man ’s respect is to con him … .
Funny thing is , us telling you about the pacemaker was n’t what kept you in line .
It was when I threatened [ Kate . ]
You work so hard to make her think you do n’t care , that you do n’t need her , but , ? A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody .
It do n’t make no difference who the guy is , long as he ’s with you .
I tell you , I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick . ” ’
I remind you of this for two reasons : ( 1 ) Sawyer may have told Kate last week that he was meant to be alone — but he ’s not .
And in fact , by isolating himself and insulating himself as he tried to do in Dharmaville , Sawyer may have made himself vulnerable to Smokey ’s manipulations ; ( 2 ) I think it ’s very possible Locke- ness was pulling a con on Sawyer .
That cave he claimed belonged to Jacob ?
All those names and numbers that he said Jacob scrawled on the ceiling ?
All of that could have been planted and fabricated by Un - Locke to paint Jacob as Sawyer ’s newest Anthony Cooper -ish scapegoat for everything wrong in his life .
Then again , Smokey could have been telling the truth , too .
Either way , the effect was the same :
He had hooked and reeled in Sawyer .
We ’ll see what Un - Locke does with that .
NEXT : What ’s with scary ghost boys in the woods ?
We learned several things about Un - Locke in this episode .
For example :
UnLocke is old
He told Sawyer that he was a reader — but that Steinbeck ’s Of Mice and Men , published in 1937 , was after his time .
UnLocke used to be a man
” What I am is trapped , ” Fake Locke told Sawyer at one point when James grew frustrated and pulled a gun on the Monster .
( I was like , SHOOT HIM !
Just see what happens ! )
” I ’ve been trapped for so long I do n’t even remember what it feels like to be free .
Maybe you understand that .
But before I was trapped I was a man just like you .
I know what its like to feel joy to feel pain , anger , fear , to experience betrayal .
I know what it ’s like to lose someone you love … . ”
My gut is that hardcore Lost theorists will be pulling these lines apart , looking for clues they can research in hopes of ascertaining the Monster ’s true identity .
My guess is that we wo n’t find it in a book … but if we could , I ’m betting that Un - Locke is either …
Cain or Abel .
I ’ll explain why next week in my Doc Jensen column .
UnLocke and Richard have a special relationship
The Monster stated again that he wants to leave the Island and go home .
He told Richard that he wanted him to come along .
Richard adamantly refused .
More than that , Richard was pretty damn confused by almost everything FLocke was telling him , most importantly the whole concept of ” candidates , ” Jacob ’s picks for replacing him as Island protector ( again , provided we can trust Un - Locke ) .
I loved how the Monster was again explosively apoplectic on behalf of anyone kept in the dark by his rival .
” Jaocb did n’t tell you ?
He never said why ?
I never would have done that to you !
I never would have kept you in the dark !
I would have treated you with respect ! ”
Smokey appears to be anti-secrecy and pro-full disclosure ; he ’s the patron deity of frustrated Lost fans !
Later , when Alpert encountered Sawyer in the jungle alone , he implored Ford to stay away from FLocke .
He told him that Un - Locke would tell him nothing .
He told him he was going to kill him and everyone he loves .
He told him that the Monster was on a mission to ” search and destroy ” ( to use the specific Stooges song we heard ) , like , everything in its path … but before Alpert could expand , Un - Locke came back , Alpert had to flee .
My theory ?
Richard Alpert is Smokey ’s son .
Somehow .
I know !
Crazy !
Not sure how smoke monsters procreate , but they do , and they make little Richards .
That ’s where he gets the dark eyelashes .
UnLocke is haunted by a ghost
Smokey saw and was deeply ruffled by a vision of a sandy - haired boy with bloody hands wearing Others garb .
He was also deeply bothered by the fact that Sawyer could see him , too .
( If the boy is dead and appearing in spectral form , does that man that Sawyer has developed Hurley - like see dead people powers ? )
The boy later ventured close to Un - Locke , this time with no blood in his hands , and warned him that he could not kill him .
THEORY : The boy functions as a referee in the Jacob - Man In Black skirmish .
He got that honor because the boy represents the first person the Man In Black ever killed .
ADDENDUM : Allow me to acknowledge some thoughts flying around this kid .
I know some people are saying his eerie demeanor reminded them of Walt .
( A lot of people are wondering if Lost was deliberately trying to evoke Walt in the flash - sideways scene when Locke stopped a young black man and asked for directions at the school . )
I was more intrigued by his resemblance to both Jacob and Sawyer .
More on why I think this was intentional and important in a minute .
The Descent
Or in the words of The Stooges : Sawyer , your pretty face is going to hell !
Jacob ’s cave reminded me of that seaside cavern in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince where Voldemort had allegedly hidden an shard that contained a fragment of his soul , a horcrux .
And we got two ladders leading down to Jacob ’s cave ; starting from the top of the cliff , you descended to its termination halfway down the cliff face , then crossed over to the top of the other ladder and continued down .
The parallel ladders could be a symbol for Jacob ’s Ladder , which I invite you to investigate on your own this week , or it could be a metaphor for the show ’s parallel worlds cosmology .
Are we building a point to where characters will cross over from one timeline to the other ?
We shall see .
Question : Did you think Un - Locke rigged the ladder so Sawyer would fall ?
If so , do you think he was trying to kill Sawyer or save him to further draw him close ?
Question :
Did you find yourself wondering if I was going to spend 1000 words forging a connection between Jacob ’s cave and Plato ’s ” Allegory of The Cave , ” and how the castaways are like the prisoners of the cave , shackled to their ( mis ) perceptions of reality ?
Were you worried I was going to use it as a springboard to suggest that the supernatural , unchanging Island world is equivalent to the ideal world of Forms and that the Sideways world represents a corrupted , inferior realm made out of the pattern of the Forms — unless I ’m getting it backwards , and the Island world is the corrupted world and the Sideways world the ideal one ?
Well , you need n’t worry , because I ’m not going to be doing any of that !
But what I do intend to do is go through some of what we saw and learned inside Jacob ’s cave , PLUS venture a guess on the chances that Locke - ness was lying .
Because even though it felt like a yummy , filling download of mythology , I remain most uncertain .
( If you share that feeling , worry not : I have some news for you at the end of the column . )
The White and Black Rocks
What Smokey Said : Upon arriving in Jacob ’s cave , Un - Locke spotted two large stones , one white and one black , sitting on a scale .
He grabbed the white rock and threw it out into the sea .
Sawyer asked : Huh ?
Un - Locke replied , ” Inside joke . ”
Percentage Chance I Believe Smokey : 100 %
Or maybe 0 % , because I got the sense from Smokey ’s angry toss that this so - called ” inside joke ” was n’t all that funny for him .
My guess is — obviously — that the white rock represented Jacob , and that tossing that rock was symbolic of Fake Locke ’s ( apparent ) victory , and , perhaps , his rejection of the white / black categorization of his morality and his relationship with Jacob .
My guess is also that whenever and whatever was decided between Jacob and his nemesis — the nature of their conflict / game ; the roles they would play ; the rules they would play by — it was all hashed out and settled in the cave , and the deal was sealed with some ceremonial putting - rocks - on - a - scale thing .
NEXT : What ’s your number ?
The Castaways Were Brought To The Island For A Reason
What Smokey Said : Jacob had picked six castaways — Locke , Hurley , Sawyer , Sayid , Jack , Jin or Sun — and meddled with their lives and subverted their destinies and free will in order to corral them to The Island and groom one of them as his replacement as Island protector .
PCIBS : 91 %
What I did n’t believe , though , was this :
The Island Is Meaningless
What Smokey Said : When Sawyer asked why the Island would need protection , Locke snapped : ” From nothing , James .
That ’s the joke .
There ’s nothing to protect it from .
It ’s just a damn island ! ”
PCIBS : 0 % My rejoinders to Smokey would include the following : ( 1 ) The Temple ’s magic healing spring .
( 2 ) Frozen donkey wheel time travel magic .
( 3 ) That Ghost Kid. ( 4 ) Oh , and uh ?
freakin’ YOU , Smokey !
Bottom line :
The Island is totally special , and my guess is that whatever makes it special will prove to be Jacob ’s primary defense for playing god with castaway lives .
The Numbers
What Smokey Said : Lost fans , prepare to rethink your Valenzetti Equations .
With a dramatic reveal of the cave ’s ceiling , we learned that Jacob assigned each of his potential replacements a number .
He wrote their digits next to their last names on the ceiling of his cave with chalk .
Locke : 4 ; [ Hurley ] Reyes : 8 ; [ James ” Sawyer ” ]
Ford : 15 ; [ Sayid ] Jarrah : 16 ; [ Jack ]
Shephard : 23 ; [ Jin or Sun ? ]
Kwon : 42 .
Why ?
Un - Locke shrugged .
” Jacob had a thing for numbers , ” he said .
PCIBS : 49 %
It ’s not that I think Jacob does n’t have a thing for numbers —
I just think that Jacob has good reason for assigning numbers to his candidates , and more , that Un - Locke knows what that reason is and is n’t telling Sawyer .
DEBATE !
Where ’s Kate ?
Sawyer ’s Three Options
What Smokey Said : ( 1 ) Sawyer could do nothing , see how the drama plays out , and possibly get his name crossed off the list of candidates .
( 2 ) He could accept the job .
( 3 ) He could leave the Island with Smokey .
PCIBS : 100 % I actually believe he ’s 100 % truthful about the three options , although I ’m also 100 % sure he did n’t tell Sawyer everything he needed to know about each of those options for him to make the most informed choice .
Here ’s what I think Smokey omitted .
Option 1 : The reason why the names get crossed off when that candidate dies ?
It ’s probably because of Smokey ’s conspiratorial machinations .
Option 2 : If Sawyer took the job , Smokey would move heaven and hell to find some way to kill him .
Option 3 : Leaving the Island will obliterate the entire Island world reality , or delete from the history of the world the specific lifelines of the castaways that lave , PLUS the lifelines of anyone inextricably intertwined with those lifelines .
Whatever Smokey has up its butt , I think he has a ( quantum ) suicide wish .
Sawyer ’s Response To Smokey ’s Offer
What Was Said : ” So what do you say , James ? ” Smokey asked .
” Are you ready to go home ? ” Sawyer replied , ” Hell yes . ”
Possible Chance I Believe Sawyer : 0 % Because I believe as heartbroken and furious as Sawyer may be ?
he ai n’t betraying the castaways to this monster .
I think the minute Sawyer saw that ghost kid — that dead ringer for himself when he was a kid — and saw Un - Locke chase after him and then return without him , Sawyer made up his mind that this Fake Locke was one freakin’ scary creep and needed to be brought down .
Why did n’t Sawyer put a bullet in him when had a chance ?

Google 's CEO went to Abu Dhabi this week and preached .
He sermonized about Google 's exceptional virtue — its indifference to profit and supreme trustworthiness .
His speech should have been shocking .
Except that delusional self - righteousness is now routine at Google .
Eric Schmidt 's comments at the Abu Dhabi " media summit " certainly sound especially cocky even considering the Google CEO 's past haughty pronouncements .
Schmidt , Fortune reports , implied Google is more trustworthy than any government on the planet after he was was asked asked about the company 's worrisome stash of private data on its users , Schmidt :
" All this information that you have about us ...
Does that scare everyone in this room ? "
The questioner asked ...
" Would you prefer someone else ? " Schmidt shot back ...
" Is there a government that you would prefer to be in charge of this ? "
Schmidt also said Google has been known to curb its own creepy impulses :
" There are many , many things that Google could do , that we chose not to do ...
One day we had a conversation where we figured we could just try to predict the stock market .
And then we decided it was illegal .
So we stopped doing that . "
Fortune wonders if Schmidt 's comments are a sign of " a dangerous culture of self - righteousness . "
They are .
But the CEO 's remarks are just the latest in a series of prominent self - righteous statements from Googlers .
There have been plenty of similar cases just in the past couple of months alone .
It 's worth cataloging them , given Google 's deep relationship with its millions of users , and given that the Mountain View internet company does n't seem to be getting any more humble .
Delusion 1 : It 's not about the money
In Abu Dhabi , speaking to a diverse international audience , Schmidt said Google " sees itself really differently from other companies " because " we see ourselves as a company with a mission about information and not a mission about revenue or profits . "
Here 's what Schmidt said to a different crowd , of Wall Street analysts , in an October conference call : " We love cash . "
That 's the full sentence he uttered .
He had nothing to say on the call about Google 's noble information " mission .
Come on , St. Eric :
Google did not make $ 15 billion in profits over the past year on accident .
The company exists to make money for its investors and executives .
Period .
And that 's not something you 'd have to apologize for if you 'd drop the old saw about how Google is too virtuous to chase money and how it really just wants to make us all smarter .
Delusion 2 : Google 's wealth means Google " gets it "
Above is an extraordinary clip of Matt Cutts , a search engineer and defacto spokesman for Google .
Asked on the podcast This Week in Google to address the disturbing privacy lapses in Google Buzz , which exposed one user 's location to her abusive ex , and to address Schmidt 's ham - fisted response , Cutts says he believes in Schmidt 's handling of Buzz and " a lot of stuff " because Google 's stock price is no longer " very very low " and thus the CEO " absolutely does get it . "
It 's a truly bizarre moment , in which Cutts defends some horrendous management decisions based on Wall Street trades .
If the last two years have taught this country anything , it's that the connection between stock performance and executive competence is pitifully weak .
UPDATE : Cutts has responded on his blog .
Yet Cutts is hardly alone in revering Google 's financials .
Schmidt looked at Google 's unexpectedly strong third - quarter profits and said they made him " very optimistic now about the future , " gave him " the confidence to be optimistic about our future " and made him " very , very happy with Q3 . "
After a blowout fourth quarter Schmidt said " we are back in business full blast . "
But at Google financial gains have not been correlated with innovation .
The company still gleans nearly all its profits from its core , longstanding contextual advertising business ; its many many side projects and acquisitions add little to the bottom line .
So Google should n't get too excited to see its stock is up 77 percent the past year versus 59 percent for the S&P 500 , or to be accelerating its hiring while national unemployment is stuck at 10 percent .
Profits do not mean you 're connecting with users ' most pressing needs .
If that were the case then Microsoft , flush with revenue from its old - line Office and Windows businesses to this day , would have clobbered Google in Web search years ago .
Delusion 3 : Google must sacrifice user privacy to grow
Google wanted a big debut for Google Buzz , its attempt to copy the likes of Twitter and FriendFeed .
So it bypassed an established " beta " testing system and launched Buzz with no external trials .
It also built Buzz into GMail to get more users .
This ended up screwing users over on privacy ; Buzz was automatically sharing their lists of most - emailed friends with the world .
And yet Google 's contrition has been limited .
The company response boils down to , " well that 's unfortunate but it's also the way the world works now . "
Original Google Buzz product manager Jyri Engstrom repeated this view in the above This Week in Google clip , in which he states it was " brave " of Google to risk users ' trust for the benefit of Buzz , since it needs that trust so badly .
See the clip above .
He added :
What we 're going to have to come to terms with is this stuff happening more .
I honestly do n't think it 's a bad thing for people to be exposed to the issues this way .
So terrible privacy violations like sharing your location and work address with an abusive ex-husband and other unauthorized parties are the necessary costs of progress and not " a bad thing , " according to one of the key engineers behind Google Buzz .
In fact , they are learning experiences .
Engstrom said this , by the way , on the same podcast where the abusive ex-husband was discussed , so it 's not like he did n't grasp the full implications of what had happened .
But he was hardly alone in framing privacy abuse as inevitable and necessary .
In a later podcast , Cutts said that while Buzz perhaps needed more testing , rapid deployment allowed Google to get rapid feedback on Buzz and " iterate " quickly and " try out a lot of different things " ( see latter half of clip above ) .
Translation :
It 's very effective for Google to use the actual relationships of actual humans to test unproven social networking code .
And conveniently , Google does n't have to endure the sometimes painful cost of this testing !
Of course , there 's a more ethical alternative :
Use consenting beta testers like the " Trusted Testers " Google has already organized to test innovative social products , rather than rushing into something to get big fast .
Delusion 4 : Users are hungry for Google synergy
When Google launched Buzz , it thought people would by dying to see the product pop up all over the place : in Google GMail , Google Maps even Google search .
Google VP Vic Gundotra openly talked about using those properties to promote Buzz in an interview with Silicon Valley blogger and startup advisor Louis Gray .
See the short clip above .
But this sort of integration proved to be Buzz 's biggest weakness :
The combination of Buzz and Gmail cluttered up people 's inboxes and , quite controversially , made it possible for Buzz to compromise users ' privacy by combing their email logs .
Google should have known such deep integration would be a bad idea because , as we noted the day Buzz launched , the company experienced a very similar controversy when it hooked Google Reader up to GMail two years ago .
It seemed unfair and sleazy , not convenient , when Microsoft started using its operating system to promote its online services , streaming media technologies and Web browser .
Google is n't quite as suspect as Microsoft but , in the eyes of the public , it 's increasingly getting close .
Especially when it comes to search .
And the public will be increasingly hostile to Google product bundles that are more about promotion than functionality .
Delusion 5 : Google is a worker 's utopia
Google brags about finding , and keeping , " the world 's best engineers ; " it even avoids offering jobs to some top coders to avoid an over - concentration of awesome .
It takes pride in its notoriously lengthy and rigorous interview process , and in coddling workers once they clear it .
The company certainly gets tons of free press for the free food and massages .
But the system seems increasingly broken .
Management has flip - flopped on the perks for example ; Google honchos originally said posh benefits " save employees considerable time and improve their health and productivity ...
Expect us to add benefits rather than pare them down . "
Also , " these things [ benefits ] cost nothing . "
But come the next recession , Google was cutting way back and battling what executives described as presumptuous worker entitlement .
" The culture was misinterpreted , " Sergey Brin told a reporter .
" That grew up into everybody 's expectation ...
We decided to ... significantly cut down all the snacks . "
The hiring system , it turns out , was nearly rejecting Google 's best employees and riddled with bizarre or terrible questions .
And as for retention , some of Google 's most ambitious employees saw their work buried ; some complain until they quit .
Delusion 6 : The outraged users are confused
Whenever Google 's actions spark criticism , the first response of the self - regarding Google priesthood seems to be to insist the critics are simply bewildered at the company 's complicated brilliance .
For example , in December Schmidt made a rather chilling statement on CNBC about secrets ( which we were the first to highlight ) : " If you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place . "
The quote set off a firestorm of controversy .
Google rather absurdly argued that Schmidt had been misunderstood and taken out of context ; in a statement circulated at the time its flacks claimed Schmidt was " talking about the US Patriot Act . "
Sure he was — after he gave his little lecture about the villainy behind secrets .
There 's plenty of context in the video clip we ran , reproduced above .
Schmidt also absurdly claimed to be misunderstood over Google Buzz .
Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona a couple of weeks ago , Schmidt went so far as to falsely deny any privacy breach occurred with Buzz , saying in effect that users were hysterical :
" People thought that somehow we were publishing their email addresses and private information , which was not true [ it was ] ...
It was our fault that we did not communicate that fact very well , but the important thing is that no really bad stuff happens in the sense that nobody 's personal information was disclosed [ it was ] . "
Schmidt said this after a civil liberties group had already issued a warning about Buzz 's " serious problems " with " private information " and after Google 's own Todd Jackson had said Google was " very very sorry " for getting millions of users " rightfully upset . "
Schmidt was right that there 's a lot of confusion around Google .
Unfortunately for him , much of that confusion seems to originate in the company itself .
Hopefully the Todd Jacksons of the company will have a chance to educate their peers on the realities of life outside the Googleplex .
Eric Schmidt included .

An article on the Web site of The Times this afternoon describes the efforts of the Endangered Language Alliance at the City University of New York to track down New Yorkers who speak languages that are not only rare here but may be falling extinct in their homelands , too .
Which led us to wonder :
What are the least - spoken languages in New York ?
While no such census data is available at the city level , the census ’ American Community Survey has statewide figures .
The survey asks residents what languages other than English they speak at home .
These were the least common answers :
Pro-whaling officials have reacted angrily to news that a documentary about a gruesome annual dolphin cull in a remote Japanese fishing town has bagged an Academy Award .
The Cove , directed by photographer Louie Psihoyos , won Best Documentary Feature at the Oscars on Sunday after winning acclaim from around the world – except from Japan .
" That movie is so full of lies that it is an insult , " said Hideki Moronuki , a former spokesman with Japan 's Fisheries Agency who was interviewed by the documentary crew .
The movie claims that Mr Moronuki and thousands of others have been poisoned from eating dolphin meat containing high levels of mercury and later resigned from his post , both of which he denies .
Filmed secretly over several months in the whaling town of Taiji , the documentary used hidden cameras and microphones to depict the annual slaughter of about 2,000 dolphins , which are herded into a secluded cove and hacked to death .
The film - makers say the town is poisoning its citizens with the mercury - tainted meat and covering it up , a claim denied by its mayor Kazutaka Sangen .
" I think it is regrettable that the film presents as fact material that is not backed up by scientific proof , " he said yesterday in a faxed statement .

Sometimes it 's worthwhile to let a bit of time pass before beginning to assess a season like the one we just witnessed from the Flames .
The last few weeks left most of us fairly sour towards the team , players , coaches and management all included , so I wanted to let things settle before beginning my post - mortems .
With that spirit of equanimity in mind , it seems like a good occasion to have a closer look at what went on from the time Christopher Higgins joined the team until his ankle injury in Vancouver , because that brief episode always had the feeling , at least for me , of possibility .
The sense I had during Higgins ' short period of labour was that he was a useful player that was a touch snakebit .
When I reviewed a few numbers over at timeonice.com , I realized I might be , if anything , undervaluing the man a tad .
I 'll be the first to acknowledge the small sample size , but it never hurts to look at a few numbers , does it ?
First , here are Higgins ' EV numbers while in Calgary :
Shots +87 / - 47 , +40
Misses +33 / -30 , +3
Blocks +32 / - 33 , -1
Total Corsi Events +152 / - 110 , +42
Corsi % .580
On-ice SV % .894 , on-ice SH % 4.6 , PDO 94
Those sorts of possession numbers are superb , really .
Keeping in mind that PDO numbers will average out at 100 , there 's no way to look at what he did and describe it as anything but a ) excellent and b ) utterly bereft of good fortune .
Higgins ' personal SH % was 4.2 at EV , and he had more chances where he broke his stick with only an open net facing him ( at least two that I can recall ) than goals ( 1 ) .
Snakebit , indeed .
That sort of thing evens out over time , though , and the out - shooting stuff is pretty stellar .
Now , it 's hard to find past evidence that suggests Higgins was always this sort of possession killer .
In both Montreal and New York he was certainly a player that could battle good competition to a draw , but he did n't out - shoot to the level that he showed during his audition with Calgary .
So , it must have been playing with Langkow , right ?
Most of us think that number 22 is a pretty handy guy , Instant Chemistry ™ and all that jazz .
So ...
Daymond Langkow 's full - season on - ice events at EV read like this :
Shots +436 / -397 , +39
Misses +207 / - 176 , +31
Blocks +248/ -199 , + 49
Total Corsi Events +891/ - 772 , + 119
Corsi % .536
On-ice SV % .914 On-ice SH % 7.10 , PDO 98.5
Those are about what one might expect for a good player , with a bit of poor fortune on the shooting side , maybe .
How did he do with Chris Higgins riding shot - gun for 12 games , or about 1/7th of the season ?
Here are the numbers the two of them amassed when paired :
Shots +79 / - 40 , +39
Misses + 23 / - 25 , -2
Blocks +28/ - 27 , +1
Total Corsi Events +130/ - 92 , + 38
Corsi % .586
SV % .925 , SH % 3.8 , PDO 96.3
Daymond Langkow 's entire season 's Shots on Goal differential was accumulated while with Higgins .
A third of his Corsi +/- was gained during those 12 games .
That 's worthy of notice , especially when you consider that the two of them were n't exactly facing the Boogaards of the world .
Since I 'm always mindful of score effects , here are their combined numbers when the game was tied :
Shots +31 / - 17
Misses +9/ -6
Blocks +17 / - 15
Total Corsi Events +57 / - 38
Corsi % .596
SV % .944 , SH % 3.2 , PDO 97.6
They were n't being gifted with easy starting positions , either .
During that period , Higgins was on ice for 48 D zone faceoffs versus 47 O zone , so his ZoneStart was 49.5 % .
Langkow went 51 D / 48 O for 48.4 % .
The rest of the team reaped the rewards of that , with Iginla and Stajan starting in the offensive zone just over 56 % of the time , and the remainder of the team was over 60 % .
In summation , Higgins and Langkow played good comp , started in neutral or slightly negative ice , and moved the rock forward a ton , leaving their teammates in some fairly juicy starting positions .
The team 's underlying numbers during that period certainly benefited :
Shots +293 / - 242 , +51
Misses +124/ -99 , +25
Blocks +134 / - 117 , +17
Total Corsi Events +551/ - 458 , + 93
Corsi % . 546
SV % .934 , SH % , 6.8 , PDO 100.2
Again , the SOG differential caught my eye .
As noted above , Higgins / Langkow were +39 during this period , while the rest of the team , with significantly better starting position as a collective , were +12 .
Iginla , despite having a favourable set of starting points , was actually underwater ( +90 / - 95 ) in terms of SOG , and Stajan was barely above ( +90 / - 88 ) .
Yikes .
I 'll readily acknowledge that it would seem unlikely that Higgins and Langkow could sustain those sorts of out - shooting figures for a whole season , but I can't imagine that they 'd continue that terrible SH % either , and their collective PDO would suggest they were somewhat unfortunate if anything .
Given that Langkow 's full season numbers got a fairly good boost during this period , I do n't have a problem suggesting that Christopher Higgins was a major contributor to that line 's good work .
To put it another way , I do n't exactly think it was Ales Kotalik carrying the the two of them around like a mule .
My general sense is that the two of them , with a decent RW , could play good comp to at least a standstill , and likely win that sort of battle outright over a full season , with QComp and ZoneStart benefits trickling down to the other players on the team .
That sort of advantage can help turn an OK team into a very good one .
Whether the Flames have the interest or the financial wherewithal to resign Chris Higgins is another matter entirely , but if they did manage to retain his services at a reasonable price , my suspicion is they'd be rewarded with a useful player .
By drawing a line against expansion of Israeli housing units in Jerusalem , the Obama administration is confronting a policy that enjoys a strong consensus among Israelis : the effort to ensure that the city remains united and under their control .
The fight over who will control Jerusalem has always been one of the thorniest issues between Israelis and Palestinians , who both claim the city as their capital .
U.S. officials reacted with fury last week to a decision to build 1,600 housing units in an area of contested East Jerusalem , a move that threatened to derail American efforts to relaunch peace talks .
But focusing the debate on Jerusalem may actually prove to be of domestic political benefit for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Even many Israelis who otherwise oppose the government ’s settlement activity in the West Bank see nothing wrong with building homes for Jews in parts of Jerusalem that were seized during the 1967 Middle East War .
“ For Netanyahu , this is the best issue you could have given him , ” said Efraim Inbar , a political science professor at Bar - Ilan University , who said the prime minister could emerge politically stronger by refusing American pressure to limit or temporarily delay housing construction in East Jerusalem .
“ Jerusalem touches an important nerve for so many Jews that they would support the government , even in a confrontation with the U.S. , ” Inbar said .
“ Even if it causes damage , sometimes you have to draw a red line . ”
He said about 70 % of Israelis support a “ united Jerusalem ” under Israel ’s control , according to polls he has conducted .
“ Americans fell for the trap and the trap is Jerusalem , ” said Gershon Baskin , head of the left - leaning Israel - Palestine Center for Research and Information .
Despite the tension between the two allies , the U.S. effort to launch indirect peace talks appeared to be getting back on track Friday .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton cited unspecified signals from Israeli officials , and the Obama administration ’s Middle East peace envoy , George J. Mitchell , was preparing to return to the region .
American officials say that , in deciding to challenge Jerusalem construction , they were guided not by how the move might affect Israeli domestic politics but by the long - held U.S. government view that building in the disputed city prejudges the result of peace negotiations , antagonizes the Palestinians and undermines prospects for a settlement .
Privately , some U.S. officials question whether Israeli public support for construction in Jerusalem is as uniform as advocates contend .
They say polling on the question has been spotty .
Israel occupied East Jerusalem after the 1967 war and dramatically expanded Jerusalem ’s borders to include the Old City and villages and land formerly under Arab control .
Over the decades , Israel has built large housing projects on mostly empty tracts of that land , both inside the expanded city limits and beyond the outskirts .
The Ramat Shlomo project in northeastern Jerusalem is a cluster of several dozen apartment buildings that sprouted on empty land over the last decade , but with the high birthrates of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community living there , the subdivision now butts up against a Palestinian neighborhood .
Jewish families also have moved into traditionally Palestinian neighborhoods such as Silwan and Sheik Jarrah .
Typically , such families occupy a single house or apartment building , often guarded by Israeli police or private security , amid a sea of Palestinian residents .
Onthe Mount of Olives the lone Jewish home is easily identifiable by the billboard - sized Israeli flag flapping on the roof .
In 1980 , the Israeli government formally annexed the eastern portions of Jerusalem and declared the city , including the parts it captured in 1967 , as its capital .
The United States , the United Nations and most of the international community never recognized the moves .
Because some housing projects have grown so large , it is widely believed that many would remain part of Israel under a future peace deal , probably as part of a land exchange with Palestinians .
But until a deal is reached , Palestinians complain , the “ Judaization ” of East Jerusalem is unfair and accuse Netanyahu ’s right - wing coalition of accelerating such efforts at a time when there have been no peace talks .
“ This government is more aggressive than any other Israeli government , ” said Palestinian Authority spokesman Ghassan Khatib .
“ It is speeding up efforts to turn Jerusalem into a Jewish city by changing facts on the ground and restricting the presence of Palestinians in the city . ”
The Jewish population of East Jerusalem has grown from almost nothing before 1967 to 200,000 today .
The Palestinian population , which was about 66,000 in 1967 , is now about 270,000 .
Peace Now , an anti-settlement advocacy group , said in January that it “ is becoming clear that we are in the middle of a settlement blitz , ” citing the approval of several high - profile projects around Jerusalem , including 900 units in Gilo that were announced last fall .
Several thousand housing units -- as many as 50,000 , according to one Israeli newspaper report -- are in various stages of review in Israel ’s planning process .
Some have been stalled for years .
In recent months , more of those projects have been coming up for review , according to Hagit Ofran , spokeswoman for Peace Now .
“ Before , it seemed the authorities knew how to avoid the issue by simply not putting these things on the agenda , ” Ofran said .
“ Now suddenly all those plans are getting their permits . ”
That ’s partly because Jerusalem ’s ambitious new mayor , Nir Barkat , is pushing for increased development .
It also may be a side effect of Netanyahu ’s 10 - month settlement moratorium in the West Bank .
Under pressure from Washington to prove that he is serious about peace talks , Netanyahu agreed in November to temporarily limit housing projects in the West Bank .
But he insisted that construction in Jerusalem would continue .
Political analysts say Netanyahu now appears to be increasing home building in disputed areas of Jerusalem in an effort to appease his far - right political partners , who were angry that he agreed to the West Bank moratorium .
“ It ’s a way to show them that he ’s doing something for them , ” said Meron Benvenisti , an independent political analyst and former Jerusalem deputy mayor .
“ Jerusalem is always a good place to show how patriotic you are . ”
Yet Netanyahu is discovering that bringing Jerusalem to the forefront carries risks .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas this month urged Arab nations “ to rescue Jerusalemites before it ’s too late . ”
Violent skirmishes between Israeli police and Palestinian youths break out weekly in the Old City and around Jerusalem .
On Friday , Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank threw rocks at Israeli security forces in protests over the Jerusalem building plans and rumors that Muslim holy sites in the city were in danger .
When Birkat tried this month to unveil his latest plan , one that would demolish 22 Palestinian homes to make way for a Zionist - themed archaeological park , Netanyahu asked him to temporarily shelve the idea until the political climate cooled down .

Ikaros -- which aside from being a somewhat clumsy acronym is also an allusion to the Greek mythological character who flew too close to the sun -- marks the first time a space craft will enter deep space towed by solar sails , which provide a fuel - free means to explore the solar system provided the craft is near enough the sun to catch a particle powered breeze .
Several prototype space sails have been unfurled in orbit by various agencies including NASA , but as far as long - term propulsion is concerned the Ikaros mission is solar sailing 's coming out party .
The SA Forum Goons come from varied and interesting backgrounds , from professional chefs to doctors , fast food jockeys to lawyers , and software quality assurance testers to artists .
However , one particular goon stands out from the rest .
" Bigpeeler " has had the pleasure of working behind the scenes of one of the most bizarre jobs ever , the Public Zoo .
He 's been kind enough to share some of surreal stories he 's either witnessed , or been told by his senior keepers .
For today ’s Goldmine , we 're starting off with " Bigpeeler Gets It In The Ass From An Ostrich " and , " Herman The Elephant Stomps His Cock . "
Bigpeeler Gets It In The Ass From An Ostrich
Part of the duties of a zookeeper is that of " picking the yard " .
When you let the animals out into their respective yards everyday , they of course , are going to shit .
And over the course of 6 or 7 hours , they shit a lot .
So for most of the animals , especially the ones who could n't have direct contact with , you would go out and pick their yard first thing in the morning .
The zoo director frowned on the public having to look at a yard full of turds .
But some of the animals you could mingle with .
The ostriches were like this .
Trust me when I say they are about as stupid an animal as there ever was .
Hell , look at the size of their heads .
It 's as big as your fist and their brains are as big as your left nut .
A lot of times in the summer , we would just leave these over - grown chickens out all night .
In fact , these mongoloids a lot of times would do the work of picking the yard for us , because they are so fucking stupid that they would take a shit and turn around and eat it .
We would laugh our asses off watching them do this .
Their tail would go up in the air and this huge greenish - brown plop would come out .
Then they 'd turn around and look at it , then gobble it down .
You would see this softball - sized lump go down their long necks and they 'd just walk off .
Morons .
The ostriches were very popular with the public because they are so odd looking .
When they get excited , which is like every 2 minutes , they bend their neck back like an " s " , spread their wings and take off running in circles and figure - 8's .
They 'll do this for no apparent reason .
It 's like a synapse goes off in their brain and they just start running .
Must be all the shit they eat .
It 's hilarious to watch too , because when one does it , they all start doing it .
Within a minute you 'll have 10 ostriches running around , flapping their wings and wagging their necks back and forth .
It looks like a fire drill in a drag bar .
Well one day , me and my buddy Gary are out in the yard picking shit .
One of us would have a scoop shovel and a rake , and the other guy would pull a big plastic trash can on a two - wheel cart .
He would also sort of stand guard in the event one of the ostriches got too curious .
These retards loved to sneak up and start eating the shit out of the bucket and when they did , they ended up throwing it everywhere .
The only harm an ostrich can really do to you is attack you with their middle toe .
They kick forward and can open a persons belly up with one swipe .
Hey , it 's what they do .
But attacks like that are very rare with females and that 's all we had in this yard .
Anyway , Gary and I go out in the yard and start turd hunting .
We 're talking and picking , picking and talking .
It 's not hard work , just time consuming .
After a while , you do n't even think about the fact that you 're picking up turds .
In fact , sometimes we 'd just grab them with our hands and do fade - away jump shots into the shit bucket .
You know , you get bored so you improvise .
This totally grossed out the public who was always watching us .
" Ooooo ... they 're touching the doo - doo daddy !!! "
Fuck you kid .
Any - fucking - way , here we are this one day out in the yard .
Within minutes , the shit bucket is full .
Gary says , " Hey Peeler , wait here and I 'll go get another bucket . "
Cool .
He takes off and I just kind of stand there watching the birds and keeping an eye on the public .
Believe me , you deal with wild animals all day , but it 's the douche - bag public you 've gotta watch .
They are always trying to hop over the ropes into the yards , or trying to pet the animals or feed them their soda cups or some stupid shit like that .
Zookeppers hate the public .
Korea , US Agree to Delay Command Transfer .

Korea and the U.S. have agreed to delay Washingtons transfer of wartime operational command to Seoul that had been scheduled for April 2012 , said a high - ranking South Korean official yesterday .
The delay is likely to be announced at a strategic meeting of the foreign and defense ministers of the two countries as early as June in Seoul .
 The White House finished its review of Koreas request for the delay and decided to accept .
Under such an agreement , the two countries are discussing detailed follow - up measures ,  the official said , adding ,  I understand that unlike the White House , the U.S. Defense Department still opposes the delay . 
The official also said ,  The two countries reached an agreement in principle , but discussions are necessary on details such as whether the agreed implementation plan for the transfer should be replaced with a new plan or the agreed plan will be postponed , and if so , how long the agreed plan will take .
In addition , who will pay the additional costs of the delay should be also discussed .
Seoul and Washington are also reviewing announcing the delay at the bilateral foreign and defense ministers  meeting scheduled this year . 
Another Seoul official said ,  The strategic meeting will likely be held in Seoul .
The date , though not fixed , will be in June to mark the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War . 
The two countries reportedly agreed to the postponement considering factors such as South Koreas troop deployment to Afghanistan ; U.S. consideration for its ally ; Koreas participation in the U.S. missile defense system ; and instability on the Korean Peninsula stemming from the sinking of the Korean naval ship Cheonan .
The U.S. has also listened to public opinions in Korea on the postponement .
The Pentagon sent Abraham M. Denmark , a senior researcher at the U.S. progressive think tank Center for a New American Security , to Seoul in February .
Denmark held talks with the Korean presidential office , the Defense Ministry , lawmakers , retired generals and private experts on the matter .
Around the same time , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell said Washington is taking the matter seriously .
Enlarge By Frederick M. Brown , Getty Images Conan O'Brien has joined forces with TBS , where he 'll be the lead - in to Lopez Tonight starting in November .
APRIL TV CALENDAR APRIL TV CALENDAR WHAT'S ON TV TONIGHT ?
WHAT'S ON TV TONIGHT ?
Conan O'Brien is headed to cable .
In a surprise move , the comedian and , briefly , host of NBC's Tonight Show , is moving his late - night show to Turner 's TBS , where it will air Monday through Thursdays at 11 p.m. ET / PT starting in November .
George Lopez 's Lopez Tonight , which now airs in that slot , will shift to midnight .
' CONAN LIVE ' :
Tour kicks off tonight in Oregon TBS had proposed an offer to O'Brien , including ownership of his show , calling him " this unbelievable voice of a generational talent sitting out there , " says Steve Koonin , president of Turner Entertainment Networks .
But the talks began in earnest only on Wednesday , after Lopez blessed the arrangement and urged O'Brien to say yes .
O'Brien left NBC after the network announced plans to move Jay Leno into his 11:30 slot .
A five - year deal was signed late Friday at a price Koonin would describe only as " competitive . "
O'Brien , 46 , will remain in Los Angeles .
Fox was his expected future home , and executives had talked openly for months of their interest in hiring the comedian to expand into late night during the week , after several failures years ago .
But its local stations were reluctant to clear their lineups of lucrative syndicated reruns , making it unclear how widely a new Conan show on Fox would initially be seen .
Though prohibited by his $ 32.5 million NBC exit deal from appearing on television until September , O'Brien has stayed in the public spotlight , starting a widely followed Twitter feed and launching a multi-city stand - up tour , which begins tonight in Eugene , Ore .
" In three months I 've gone from network television to Twitter to performing live in theaters , and now I 'm headed back to basic cable , " the comedian said in a statement .
" My plan is working perfectly . "
The TBS deal allows O'Brien to return to late night but avoid head - to - head competition , at least in his first half - hour , with David Letterman and Jay Leno , whom he succeeded and was later replaced by at NBC .
Instead , O'Brien will compete for his core audience of younger male viewers with Comedy Central 's Daily Show With Jon Stewart and the Adult Swim channel , which is also owned by Turner .
TBS averages 1.7 million viewers in prime time , ranking seventh , but has established a clear brand as a comedy destination with reruns of Seinfeld , Family Guy , The Office and other shows .
Koonin calls the deal " transformative , " expects it will " bring a lot of new people to the network " and , he hopes , " top comedic talent " for other projects .
The show will be just like the one O'Brien has done at NBC since 1993 : " He told me , ' I have 3,000 examples of the show I want to do , ' " Koonin says .
The network began promoting its latest conquest Monday night with a spot using the now - familiar " I 'm with Coco " illustration , which changes to " Coco is with TBS . "
Brad Adgate , analyst at ad firm Horizon Media , says the move is " not as strange as you might think , " and highlights the appeal of cable over broadcast networks , which rely on local , often independently owned affiliates to air their programs .
" Lopez is doing serviceably in the time period with about 1 million viewers , but Conan could do more , " Adgate says .
( O' Brien averaged about 2.4 million on NBC . )
Yet " ratings expectations are n't going to be as high " as they might be on Fox , Adgate says .
" This , for him , is probably going to be less of a pressured situation .
It 's about as safe a bet as you can make for him . "

On the heels of an impressive workout at Florida 's pro day , league sources say that Tim Tebow is among those players who have been invited to New York for the April 22 - 24 NFL draft .
Tebow , who unveiled his new throwing motion for scouts , coaches and general managers in his workout , has accepted the invitation from the league , according to an official .
Two NFL personnel men told ESPN that Tebow 's workout on Wednesday boded well for the Gators quarterback , especially with those teams that were considering him as a high draft prospect .
The league did not release the entire list of players invited , though it is expected to include at least four quarterbacks -- Tebow , Oklahoma's Sam Bradford , Notre Dame 's Jimmy Clausen and Texas ' Colt McCoy .
The league traditionally invites players who are projected to go in the first round .
A league official said that even though Tebow could be a first - round selection , the new three - day draft format also motivated the NFL to double its invitation list from nine players in 2009 to 18 at next month 's draft .
The new draft format will conduct only the first round on April 22 , a Thursday night , and the second round on the next night .
The final four rounds will be conducted on Saturday .
Tebow threw dozens of passes to former teammates Riley Cooper , Aaron Hernandez and David Nelson during a 30 - minute workout .
Carolina Panthers coach John Fox , Cleveland Browns coach Eric Mangini , Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin , New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin and Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris were in attendance .
So were Jacksonville Jaguars general manager Gene Smith and Browns president Mike Holmgren .
About 3,000 fans showed up despite light rain .
They cheered loudly as Tebow walked onto Florida Field for the first time since his home finale in November and applauded every completion .
Chris Mortensen is a senior NFL analyst for ESPN .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Sugar may give you a temporary energy boost , but too much sugar exacts a toll on your health .
This is not breaking news .
So why did the American Heart Association issue a new scientific statement on " Dietary Sugars Intake and Cardiovascular Health ? "
Linda Van Horn is professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago .
She chairs the American Heart Association 's Nutrition Committee , and states , " We know that sugars contribute to obesity , which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes . "
Great concern over excessive sugar consumption and the " worldwide pandemic of obesity and cardiovascular disease , " led to the association 's issuance of a new statement .
Added sugars are an integral part of the American diet today .
We are on a sugar binge .
Sugar consumption is 22 to 30 teaspoons per person , per day .
Our hedonism packs on 350 to 480 worthless calories that we cannot afford .
The heart association 's new recommendations are 100 calories a day ( about 6 1/2 level teaspoons ) of added sugars for women and 150 calories ( 9+ level teaspoons ) for menAdded sugars include high fructose corn syrup , table sugar , honey , syrups , and all other sweeteners with calories .
High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) has been demonized as the villain of added sugars .
But HFCS and sugar are essentially the same when broken down in the body .
HFCS is about 50 % fructose and table sugar is 50 % fructose , so they are essentially the same in composition .
Suzanne P. Murphy , Ph.D. , R.D. , is a research professor at the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii , University of Hawaii .
She summarized the results of a conference held in March 2008 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Agricultural Research Service and the International Life Sciences Institute of North America .
" Considering the evidence presented by 22 researchers , " Dr. Murphy concluded , " ... [ HFCS ] and sucrose are similar .
One is not ' better or worse ' than the other . "
" Added sugars are added sugars , " adds Rachel Johnson , a professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont , who chaired the heart association 's new regulations .
University of California Davis found very different health results , though , in their participants when they compared glucose and fructose consumption .
For 12 weeks , thirty two overweight or obese people drank either a fructose - or glucose - sweetened beverage that made up 25 percent of their daily calories .
Both groups gained a similar amount of weight .
However , those drinking the fructose beverage had health problems that were not experienced by the other group - including :-
An increase in visceral fat ; the kind that lodges between tissues in organs -
Less sensitivity to insulin ; one of the first signs of diabetes - Increased fat production in the liver - Elevated LDL ( bad ) cholesterol -
Increased levels of triglycerides ; can increase heart attack riskMany experts believe that HFCS , particularly in soft drinks , is partly responsible for the obesity epidemic in America .
Another study by researchers at Children 's Hospital Boston , found that every additional 8 - ounce soft drink in a day increased school kids ' risks of being obese by 60 percent .
Another study at the University of Minnesota found that fructose " produced significantly higher [ blood ] levels " of triglycerides in men than did glucose .
A USDA study , published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition , found that fructose may alter the body 's balance of magnesium , leading to increased bone loss .
Regardless of the disparate conclusions surrounding HFCS , one thing seems certain : the typical American cannot continue to consume an extra 350 to 480 calories from added sugars and hope to protect their health .

The App Store censorship horse may have been beaten to death , but mainstream German media — whose iPhone applications have been censored by Apple because of its content — are not surrendering .
I 'm glad .
In fact , I hope they win this war .
The censorship problem is not only about the 5,000 titillating apps that fell down in flames after Apple 's latest puritanic raid .
Except for apps from well known slippery - when - wet publishing houses like Playboy , that raid closed the smutty graphic category entirely .
The censorship problem goes a lot deeper than that , and it has affected mainstream publications already .

Freedom of the Press
The polemic in Germany started when Apple took down Stern 's iPhone app without notice .
Stern — a very large weekly news magazine — published a gallery of erotic photos as part of its editorial content .
It was n't gratuitous :
It was just part of the material published in the magazine itself , integrated in their usual sections .
Advertisement
The entire app was taken down , according to the Spiegel , and publisher Gruner +
Jahr had to eliminate that content in order for the application to go up to the store again .
They learnt their lesson , since they have n't published any other material that may offend Apple 's " moral police " — as the German press calls it .
Advertisement
Then came Bild , a large daily newspaper printed by publishing powerhouse Axel Springer AG .
Bild also distributes its content through a dedicated iPhone application .
This app gives access to its sections from a central springboard .
Last December , they released a new mini-app called Bild - Girl , which shows a woman moaning and getting rid of her clothes every time you shake the iPhone with your free hand .
Apple did n't take that well and asked Bild to put a bikini on the girl .
Bild complied .
But now Apple also wants
Bild to censor the naked girl that comes in the PDF version of the printed newspaper , which is accessible from the Bild application too .
Apple is trying to force them into censoring their publication , even while the women are pre-emptively censored :
Their nipples are pixelated and unrecognizable in the iPhone - distributed PDF document .
Advertisement
That 's when the Bild editors went ballistic .
Advertisement
It Can Get Worse
I do n't blame them , because I 'm going fucking ballistic at this stage of the proceedings too .
How Apple can force Bild to change their editorial content ?
Or putting it another way :
If Gizmodo decides to release an iPhone application tomorrow , would Apple take it down whenever we publish a NSFW post that shows nipples ?
Advertisement
Probably they would , if they receive enough complaints .
( We receive some from time to time , so it 's not out of the question ) .
What about magazines , books , or comic books — like Watchmen and other adult graphic novels — that contain explicit sexual descriptions or graphics ?
Would those be censored too in the future , if enough people think it 's politically incorrect ?
What about other content ?
Like Bild Digital 's CEO Donata Hopfen says : " Today they censor nipples , tomorrow editorial content . "
The Association of German Magazine Publishers agree , and they have asked the International Federation of the Periodical Press to make a complaint to Apple .
I agree too :
This is just not about the nipples .
If Apple had established a firm set of rules about tits and pink beforehand , there would n't be any problem .
But this censorship is completely arbitrary and unexpected .
Advertisement
How ?
Imagine Gawker develops an iPod / iPad application , one that gives access to Gizmodo.com , Gawker.com and all its publications — except Fleshbot , for obvious reasons .
Now imagine that we get the scoop of the Next Big Thing from Steve Jobs , and decide to publish it in the app .
Would Apple send another letter threatening us to take down the app , perhaps ?
Would Apple have banned an hypothetical Gawker app when Gizmodo uncovered Steve Jobs ' health problems ?
Advertisement
I do n't think that 's a crazy thought .
In fact , knowing how things work , I think it 's entirely possible .
Advertisement
And it does n't have to be about Apple or tits .
There are plenty of applications that have been deemed blasphemous or offensive by Apple , and banned from publication .
Would publications showing a caricature of Prophet Mohamed be taken down as well ?
That would get Phil Schiller plenty of complaint letters .
Advertisement
I do n't really know what Apple may do in these cases .
And that 's the problem .
The fact is that they forced Stern and Bild to do change their editorial content decisions , and anyone or anything could be next .
Apple is a corporation and they can do whatever they want , after all .
In fact , that 's the argument of the people who defend these decisions :
It 's Apple 's prerogative to do whatever the hell they want with their store .
But knowing that the Apple iPhone - iPod - iPad triumvirate is the largest mobile application platform in the world — practically owning the category — could n't that be considered an abuse of quasi- monopoly power ?
I have no idea .
I will leave that question to the lawyers of the Association of German Magazine Publishers .
And the lawyers of the International Federation of the Periodical Press .

Click to viewAnd if indeed things get any worse , I hope the lawyers at the European Union , and hopefully some commission at the United States '
Senate will give us the answer .

Three men who showed up in full Nazi regalia to a hardcore punk show at an Old City bar Friday night were attacked by as many as 50 people on the streets after leaving the venue , according to witnesses and club management .
“ Even the simplest tasks , like having a shower or flushing the loo , become incredibly time - consuming .
Washing my clothes in a sink of cold water , using laundry liquid made by boiling some nuts on my stove , can take two hours .
Getting into a skip to look for stuff is harder than going to the shop to buy it .
And having to dig a compost lavatory is harder than flushing it away .
But I never got bored and I rarely felt lonely .
I ’d go for walks , cycle , make a fire .
I ’ve learned so much about food , about nature , about myself . ”
Authorities hid truth surrounding September 11 in the immediate aftermath of the attack , telling dying heroes “ the air is safe to breathe , ” so how on earth can asking what else they lied about be hurtful to the very victims the government stabbed in the back ?
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , March 12 , 2010
The $ 650 million dollar payout in the 9/11 toxic dust settlement serves as a stark reminder amidst an attempted establishment purge of any questions surrounding what happened on September 11 , that the government did indeed conspire to lie about 9/11 in the immediate aftermath of the attack .
“ Rescue and recovery workers who were exposed to a toxic brew of smoke and dust in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks have been awarded $ 650 million in a compensation deal struck in New York , ” reports the London Times .
“ Thousands of 9/11 heroes , including firefighters , police officers , construction experts and emergency workers , have filed lawsuits since 2003 but last night ’s agreement is expected to put an end to years of legal battles . ”
As 9/11 truth organizations have constantly emphasized as part of their efforts to aid 9/11 first responders , it was a government lie about 9/11 in the very days after the tragedy that set in motion an 8 and half year legal battle to obtain justice for the heroes of that fateful day .
Five days after the 9/11 attack , Christie Todd Whitman , then head of the Environmental Protection Agency , told reporters , “ The good news continues to be that air samples we have taken have all been at levels that cause no concern . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
However , the EPA ’s own Office of the Inspector General later revealed that this was an outright lie .
In August 2003 it was revealed that the government ordered the EPA to give the public misleading information , telling New Yorkers on September 12 it was safe to breathe when reliable information on air quality was not available and Asbestos levels were known to be three times higher than national standards .
“ Whitman ’s deliberate and misleading statements to the press , where she reassured the public that the air was safe to breathe around lower Manhattan and Brooklyn , and that there would be no health risk presented to those returning to those areas , shocks the conscience , ” Manhattan Federal Judge Deborah Batts wrote in February 2006 .
Further documents obtained by CBS news in September 2007 revealed that Lower Manhattan was reopened a few weeks following the attack even though the air was not safe .
The two devastating memos , written by the U.S. and local governments , show officials knew the toxic soup created at ground zero was a deadly health hazard .
Yet they sent workers into the pit and people back into their homes .
“ Not only did they know it was unsafe , they did n’t heed the words of more experienced people that worked for the city and EPA , ” said Joel Kupferman , with the group Environmental Justice Project .
EPA whistleblower , Dr. Cate Jenkins then wrote a letter to Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and other members of the New York congressional delegation blasting the EPA for hiding dangerous toxins from ground zero workers in the aftermath of 9/11 .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The letter claimed that EPA - funded research on the toxicity of breathable alkaline dust at the site “ falsified pH results ” to make the substance appear benign , when it was , in reality , corrosive enough to cause first responders and other workers in lower Manhattan to later lose pulmonary functions and , in some cases , to die .
According to the 2003 EPA Inspector General ’s investigation , Whitman conspired with the White House to lie about air quality at ground zero .
Internal documents show it was Condoleezza Rice ’s office that gave final approval to the infamous Environmental Protection Agency press releases days after 9/11 claiming the air around ground zero was “ safe to breathe , ” and that Whitman was merely following orders to mislead the public and ground zero workers .
Not only did the government deliberately lie about the aftermath of 9/11 and knowingly put the very heroes of the tragedy at risk , but they spent the next 8 and a half years attempting to cover up the fact while hundreds of ground zero first responders died agonizing deaths .
If the government was happy to take actions they knew full well would lead to the deaths and crippling illnesses of thousands of the finest and most upstanding Americans in the country , how the hell can we close our eyes to the possibility that they could have had any involvement whatsoever in the actual 9/11 attack itself ?
Now that it is public knowledge and proven that the government conspired to lie about the toxic dust , putting thousands of people ’s lives at risk , and leading to the deaths of hundreds , why on earth should we so readily believe any other aspect of what they told us in the days and weeks after the tragic event ?
9/11 truth organizations like We Are Change have been instrumental in aiding the thousands of ground zero heroes who were lied to and abandoned by their own government , and have spent years running charity and fundraising events in support of 9/11 first responders .
And how did the media and the establishment react ?
By demonizing 9/11 truthers as dangerous extremists and terrorists .
While the establishment continues to attack and smear the mere act of questioning the official 9/11 story as hateful and upsetting to the victims of 9/11 , the government has , since the day of the attack , stuck a knife in the back of those very victims and twisted it for the last 8 and a half years .
Today ’s ruling serves as a stark reminder that challenging the official 9/11 story and demanding a new investigation is not only necessary for the country , it ’s imperative in order to achieve justice for those who were killed on 9/11 and the heroes who paid with their lives trying to save others – people who were cruelly disregarded by a government that had resolved to lie about the immediate aftermath of the attack .

Detroit Fire Department ladder truck was hit by an Amtrak train in Detroit while responding to another accident on Monday , March 1
The case against the four people involved in the running of Pirate Bay is heading back to court at the end of September .
The appeals trial is tentatively scheduled to start on Sep 28 . , the Svea Court of Appeals said on Wednesday .
It has been almost a year since Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundstr ö m were found guilty of being accessories to crimes against copyright law , and each sentenced to one year in prison .
The court also ordered them to pay around 30 million Swedish kronor ( US $ 4.2 million ) in damages .
All four subsequently appealed the verdict .
Nine days have been scheduled for the trial , the last one being Oct. 15 .
The dates are preliminary , and can be changed if the defendants or the prosecution have any objections .
On Thursday , Sunde 's lawyer told the court that Sunde is unable to attend , according to Svea Court of Appeals judge Ulrika Ihrfelt .
The Svea Court of Appeals will now have to decide if Sunde 's reasons for not being able to attend are legitimate , according to Ihrfelt .
However , that can't be done until allegations of bias against Ihrfelt and her colleague , Judge Kristina Boutz , have been resolved by the Supreme Court , Ihrfelt said .
The appeals trial was postponed last year because of the same accusations .
Riding on the coattails of the original verdict , the Pirate Party was able to get 7.1 percent of the votes in the Swedish election for the European Parliament .

An unborn child in the womb .
Liberals believe that the unborn child has no right to life .
Abortion is the induced termination of a pregnancy , [ 1 ] often causing fetal pain .
Abortion has two victims : the unborn child , and the mother who can never forget the loss she caused .
Breast cancer rates increase by more than six times for women who have abortion , according to a recent study .
[ 2 ]
Additional victims of abortion include after - born children , who have a higher rate of premature birth and birth defects due to the harm caused by a prior abortion .
Abortion is a billion - dollar industry in the United States .
Although Planned Parenthood likes to claim abortion accounts for just 3 % of its services , according to its 2007 - 08 budget , it received $ 1.038 billion of revenue , and half to two - thirds relates to its abortion services .
( See Planned Parenthood 's Budget ) Dr. George Tiller " estimated that he performed 250 to 300 late - term abortions in 2003 , each costing an average of $ 6,000 . " [ 3 ]
It is estimated there have been over 59.8 million abortions in the United States since 1973 . [ 4 ]
Right to choose is no solace , because doing something so wrong will have devastating consequences .
A right to privacy would not permit the taking of life when that life is inconvenient , whether in the privacy of one 's own home or own body .
Saying one can't criticize a woman 's choice to murder her children is like saying one can't criticize the president without being the president .
[ 5 ]
Rape or life of the mother are extremely rare circumstances accounting for less than 1 % of all abortions , with little bearing on the broader " abortion on demand " issue , particularly since all legislation the Pro-Life movement has been putting out recently has included exceptions for them , and many states had laws allowing abortion for such cases before Roe v. Wade - abortion was legalized for other reasons .
( See Arguments On Abortion )
Ultimately , this debate is about when a fetus becomes a human being worthy of all applicable rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness under the Declaration of Independence , for once it is we should not take its life lightly .
And when it comes to that , 18,150 abortions occur after the 21st week of pregnancy [ 6 ] - the earliest point children can be born prematurely and live . [ 7 ]
An additional 45,980 abortions occur in the 16th - 20th weeks of pregnancy . [ 6 ]
These are 60 thousand abortions each year that are clearly murder , since the child is at or near the same stage of pregnancy as children born prematurely via C - Section .
Furthermore , substantial fetal development occurs within the first 12 weeks ( 1st trimester ) of pregnancy , including brain wave activity at 6 weeks , complete body sensitivity at 10 weeks , and all facial expressions ( including smiling ) at 11 weeks .
[ 8 ]
By not erring on the side of caution when potentially infringing on the inalienable right to life given by our Creator , the Pro-Choice movement has brought the blood of countless children on their hands , and on our nation's .
( See When Does Life Begin ? )
A growing body of evidence increasingly suggests that abortion is linked to Breast Cancer , later premature births , and other health concerns .
Millions of women who had an abortion later suffer psychologically or physically from it , and support groups exist to help . [ 9 ]
Many victims of abortion find healing by speaking out against , and discouraging , similar harm to other mothers and their children . [ 10 ]
" Abortion does n't solve your problems , it only creates different ones , " warned a full - page ad by women who had abortions . [ 11 ]
Abortion always ends the life of the unborn child , typically by dismemberment .
Abortion increases the risk of breast cancer , future premature birth , mental illness , and other long - term health problems for the mother , as detailed below .
( See Health Concerns )
One of NARAL 's founders , Bernard Nathanson , acknowledged that NARAL in the early days of the Pro-Choice movement simply fabricated statistics on back - alley abortions ; inflating the actual numbers ten - fold to get abortion legalized .
Rather than making abortion rare , the annual number of abortions has increased 1500 % since Roe v. Wade . [ 12 ] ( See History ) Gallup polling in 2012 reveals that just 24 % of Americans support abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy , [ 13 ] even though abortion is allowed in all 9 months . [ 14 ]
Just 25 % believe abortion should be legal under all circumstances , and an additional 13 % believe it should be legal under most circumstances .
Most Americans believe abortion should usually be illegal save in rare cases .
[ 13 ] ( See Public Opinion )
Abortion in Poland declined by 99 % after communism was overthrown ( and abortion abolished [ 15 ] ) , and women 's health has dramatically improved there due to fewer abortions . [ 16 ]

As of 2012 , it is estimated there has been over 59.8 million babies murdered by abortion since the Supreme Court handed down its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision .
After reaching 25 percent from a high of over 1.6 million in the year 1990 , the number of abortions performed annually in the U.S. has leveled off at about 1.2 million infants murdered by abortion a year , based on data from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) and the Alan Guttmacher Institute ( AGI ) .
By 2016 , the number of yearly abortions in America dropped to a historic low of less than 1,000,000 . [ 17 ]

37 % of women killing babies by abortion were Protestant , ( include those who identified as “ Christian ” but who did not specify a denomination ) while 28 % were Catholic , and 20 % identified themselves as born - again , evangelical , charismatic or fundamentalist ( in 2000 , some 13 % of abortion patients aged 18 and older identified as born - again or evangelical before the question was reworded slightly for the 2008 survey ) , while 27 % gave no religious affiliation , increasing from 22 % in 2000 .
( Protestants were under - represented among those committing abortion in proportion to the total number of Protestants nationwide , and the relative abortion rate for this group was lower than the rate for all women . ) [ 21 ]
Although 66 % of women having abortions had some type of health insurance , 57 % paid for their abortion out of pocket .
Among women with private health insurance , 63 % paid out of pocket . [ 21 ]
Arguments On Abortion
See also : Abortion arguments
The following are some common Pro-Choice arguments on abortion , and problems with the reasoning .
Right to Choose
The obvious question not being confronted is what choice is at stake ?
The choice to kill another human being to bypass the consequences and responsibilities that should accompany the choice to create another life ; in essence the choice to murder one 's own children so sex can be engaged in freely without responsibility or consequence . [ 22 ]
Sometimes women die from abortion . [ 23 ]
Since abortion is deliberate and thought about in advance , it is comparable to a premeditated killing . [ 24 ]
Rare Circumstances : Life of Mother and Rape
BBC News has an article called " Abortion in self - defence " arguing that abortion should be allowed in cases where the mother 's life and health are at risk , and that this is justifiable self - defense .
However , BBC News acknowledges that abortion is NOT justified for the following reasons :
“ " But supposing the mother is not in physical danger , what then ?
There are a number of cases where some people argue that a woman should have the right to an abortion , such as : damage to mental health , damage to family , damage to career prospects , damage to financial prospects , damage to plans for her life .
The self - defence argument for abortion seems to fail here , because although a threat to life can be a defence to a charge of killing someone , none of the above would be an adequate defence in a case of homicide , nor would they be regarded as reasons that justified euthanasia .
But if we do n't regard the foetus as a person with a right to live , or if we regard it as a being that does n't have a full right to life , then these cases of self - defence may be arguable . "
- BBC News . [ 25 ] ”
However , ( A ) danger to life of the mother , like rape , is a very rare circumstance that accounts for less than 1 % of all abortions , ( B ) all major legislation put out by the Right to Life movement over the past decade has included exceptions allowing abortions for rape and life of the mother ( e.g. Mexico City Policy Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act , etc. ) and ( C ) at least 13 states had legislation allowing abortion for rape or life of the mother BEFORE Roe v. Wade - abortion was legalized for other reasons .
The bottom line is that apart from such extremely rare circumstances , BBC News acknowledges that " The self - defence argument for abortion seems to fail here , because although a threat to life can be a defence to a charge of killing someone , none of the above would be an adequate defence in a case of homicide , nor would they be regarded as reasons that justified euthanasia . " [ 25 ]
Choosing to kill another person , in other words , is unjustifiable unless the mother 's life is in danger or , debatably , if rape occurred .
In fact , those who bring up cases like rape and life of the mother are doing so because , deep inside , they themselves know that choosing to murder another human being is justifiable only under such extreme circumstances , and NOT for abortion on demand .
The only way to justify abortion apart from such circumstances is , as BBC News says , " if we do n't regard the foetus as a person with a right to live , or if we regard it as a being that does n't have a full right to life " .
[ 25 ]
You see , this is not about the right to choose at all , and such a slogan distracts from the real issue - the real issue is whether the fetus is a human being deserving of a full right to life .
Because if it is a human being worthy of the right to life , then there is no excuse for " choosing to kill " via abortion on demand .
Right to One's Body
The Pro-Choice movement likes to say that women should have a right to their bodies .
However , such a right should logically not allow one to harm others with that body , including physical assault , murder , rape , or theft , and therefore , this is not an absolute right , but a privilege that is not intended to exceed another 's unalienable rights , including the right to life .
As Hugh V. McLachlan of Glasgow Caledonian University pointed out in 1997 , there is no entitlement to one 's body and " we have rights duties , liabilities , restrictions and disadvantages as well as rights concerning our own bodies . "
“ " Consider the assumption at issue in the abstract : ' That particular X is your X and , therefore , you are entitled to do what you want with it ' .
As a matter of pure logic , the claim is an absurdity .
What if ' X ' stands for a Thompson Machine Gun ?
Should we say : ' That is your machine gun and , therefore , you can do whatever you like with it ? '
On the contrary , although there might be some things which you and only you can of right do to and with the gun , if that particular machine gun is your machine gun then it is incumbent upon you in particular to ensure that certain things are not done with it .
Is the situation any different when ' X ' pertains to one 's body or to parts of it ?
I do not think so . "
- Hugh V. McLachlan , Glasgow Caledonian University . [ 27 ] ”
As McLachlan continues to point out , this emphasis on rights neglects the other side of the coin , responsibilities or duties .
He gives on pg. 177 the example of an insurance policy , and how using one 's body to commit suicide can invalidate such a contract . [ 27 ]
Logically , creating another human life should likewise bring responsibly for actions toward that life - how is the decision to create another human life of lesser importance than the decision to sign an insurance contract ?
Why should one be able to kill a separate person to void the sexual decision to bring about another life , yet not be able to kill oneself without voiding an insurance contract ?
“ " Certainly a woman has a right to control her own body , but the unborn entity , though for a time living inside her body , is not part of her body .
Hence , abortion is not justified , since no one 's right to personal autonomy is so strong that it permits the arbitrary execution of others . "
- Francis J. Beckwith , Christian Research Journal . [ 28 ] ”
Right to Privacy
Ultimately , the real question is whether the fetus in question is another human being to be accorded unalienable rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness under the Declaration of Independence , for if so , no right to one 's body should give power to infringe on its unalienable right to life .
Your right to your body does not include the right , in other words , to kill others using that body to avoid the responsibilities and consequences of a sexual decision to create another life .
That is what in the real world is called " murder " and it is reprehensible .
Therefore , the real question is at what point a fetus becomes a human being .
To get abortion legalized , the Pro-Choice movement had to argue that women should have a " right to privacy " . [ 29 ]
However , logically , if the fetus is a human being and thus murder would be committed , privacy is no excuse for such murder .
Logically , killing someone in the privacy of one 's own home should no more be an excuse for murder than killing them in the privacy of one 's body .
Furthermore , as Judge Henry J. Friendly pointed out in the nation 's first major abortion case , Hall v. Lefkowitz , abortion is actually a complete violation of privacy when you look at it , requiring intervention in a woman 's most private areas by a physician and variety of medical personnel .
“ A holding that the privacy of sexual intercourse is protected against governmental intrusion scarcely carries as a corollary that when this has resulted in conception , government may not forbid destruction of the fetus .
The type of abortion the plaintiffs particularly wish to protect against governmental sanction is the antithesis of privacy .
The woman consents to intervention in the uterus by a physician , with the usual retinue of assistants , nurses , and other paramedical personnel , indeed the condition calling for such intervention may very likely have been established by clinical tests ...
Yet , even if we were to take plaintiffs ’ legal position that the legislature cannot constitutionally interfere with a woman ’s right to do as she will with her own body so long as no harm is done to others , the argument does not support the conclusion plaintiffs would have us draw from it .
For we cannot say the New York legislature lacked a rational basis for considering that abortion causes such harm .
Even if we should put aside the interests of the father , negligible indeed in the many cases when he has abandoned the prospective mother but not in all , the legislature could permissibly consider the fetus itself to deserve protection . [ 30 ] ”
Women Choose , Not Men
The Pro-Choice movement likes to say men and fathers should have no say in the abortion debate , only women .
However , as Thomas J. Lucente Jr. points out , this is similar to saying one can't criticize the President unless one is the President .
“ " The pro-abortion crowd will argue that because I am a man , I should not be allowed to have an opinion on abortion , unless , of course , I support the mass murder of 50 million babies in the last 39 years .
That 's akin to saying I can't criticize the president unless I have been the president . "
- Thomas J. Lucente Jr. [ 5 ] ”
“ " Either you can subscribe to the American creed which says that God endowed us with our rights , or you can subscribe to the abortion creed which says that those rights are the consequences of our mother 's will . "
- Alan Keyes , speech at Southern Methodist University , Feb. 24 , 1997 . [ 32 ] ”
“ " ... abortion is to our time what slavery was to the 19th Century , and if anyone of conscience went anywhere in the 19th Century and did not confront the American people with the evil of slavery , then they were not doing what statesmanship required ...
Well , it 's a part of her body utterly dependent on her body , not viable apart from her body .
She has , therefore , absolute power over this being , and given that absolute power she has the absolute right to dispose of it according to her will .
We do n't recognize what that 's saying ?
What that 's saying is that power makes for right .
Might makes for right .
If I have you in my power , I may dispose of you and your life according to my will .
And if that argument is now accepted , and we have embraced it as a fundamental principle of law , then we have rejected the right principle .
For if our right , our most basic and conditional right , the right to life itself comes to us not from God but from our mother 's choice , then there is no human right that transcends in its claim , human choice and human power .
Abortion is the paradigm , the ultimate paradigm of despotism , tyranny , oppression , slavery , holocaust . "
- Alan Keyes , speech in San Francisco , March 3 , 2003 . [ 33 ] ”
When Does Life Begin ?
As Alan Keyes has pointed out , the Pro-Choice movement essentially is arguing for the baby 's rights to be dependent on the mother 's desire for it , making women slave - owners , essentially - this is very different from the Declaration of Independence which says the Creator gives us our unalienable rights , rather than them being dependent upon other people .
Ultimately , every American has a responsibility to stand up for the rights of other Americans when they are being murdered - regardless of gender .
And to say a mother should be able to murder her children whenever she feels like it , apart from the father 's opinions , is simply wrong .

When does life begin ?
Logically , one ought to be erring on the side of caution when potentially infringing on another person 's inalienable right to life , rather than seeing how close we can come to committing murder without doing so .
Abortion in the U.S. is legal in all 9 months ( 36 weeks ) of pregnancy . [ 14 ]
Premature Birth
Even though children can be born as early as 21 weeks after pregnancy [ 7 ] the Guttmacher Institute , Planned Parenthood 's research arm , reports that 1.5 % of the 1.21 million abortions in the United States occur after the 21st week of pregnancy . [ 6 ]
Therefore , 18,150 abortions occur each year after the earliest point that children can be born prematurely and live .
An additional 3.8 % occur 16 –20 weeks after pregnancy , an additional 45,980 abortions each year that are most certainly murder given proximity to time of premature birth . [ 6 ]
Why is a baby considered human outside the womb , yet nothing more than a fetus to be aborted at or near the same point in pregnancy if still inside the womb ?
And what will abortionists argue ?
That this is " only " 50 - 60 thousand innocent lives being taken each year ?
Fetal Development
“ " Modern biology instructs that the genetic code that will dictate the entire future of the fetus is formed as early as the ___ day after conception ; the fetus is thus something more than inert matter .
The rules of property and of tort have come increasingly to recognize its rights . "
- Judge Henry Friendly , Hall v. Lefkowitz .[ 30 ] ”
According to Brian Clowes , Ph.D , [ 8 ] as cited by the Pro-Life Action League , [ 34 ] fetal development occurs as follows after conception :
2 weeks :
First completed brain cells appear .
3 weeks :
Heart begins beating , eyes form ; brain , spinal column , and nervous system virtually complete .
4 weeks : Muscle development , arm and leg buds visible , neocortical cells appear , blood flows in baby 's veins separate from mother 's blood .
5 weeks : Pituitary gland forms , mouth , ears , and nose take shape .
6 weeks : Brain waves can be detected .
7 weeks : Cartilage skeleton completely formed , umbilical cord complete , brain coordinates voluntary muscle movement and involuntary organ movement , lips sensitive to touch .
8 weeks :
Based on nervous system development , a fetus can likely feel pain , teeth present , all organs present save lungs , taste buds and fingerprints forming , responds to tapping on amniotic sac .
9 weeks : Fingernails form , can bend its fingers around an object and suck its thumb .
10 weeks :
All parts of body sensitive to touch ; can swallow , squint , frown , and pucker brow .
11 weeks : Breathing amniotic fluid and does so until birth , urination , all facial expressions ( including smiling ) possible , taste buds complete .
12 weeks :
Can kick , turn over , make a fist , hiccup , cry , open its mouth , press its lips together , and practice breathing .
13 weeks :
All senses are present , including vocal chords .
20 weeks :
Can be surprised by loud external noises .
23 weeks : A fetus demonstrates REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ) .
4 months : Can grasp , swim , and turn somersaults .
6 months : Hair growth on head and eyebrows , eyelashes form .
7 months : A fetus ' hands can support its entire weight .
8 months : Fetus weighs more than 4 lbs. , all body systems present .
9 months :
After this point , the fetus gains a half lb. each week and 41 of the 45 total generations of cell replication have already taken place .
Given this , it is small wonder that 76 % of Americans in 2011 disapprove of abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
( See Public Polling )
Objectively and logically speaking , based on a large amount of evidence , abortion is a form of murder [ 35 ] as well as child sacrifice . [ 36 ]
Health Concerns

Mental Health Risks From Abortion
A comprehensive review of literature , published in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that " there is a significant increase in mental health problems after abortion . " [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
Abortion and Breast Cancer
The vast majority of scientific studies have shown that abortion causes an increase in breast cancer , including 16 out of 17 statistically significant studies . [ 39 ]
" A new study coming from researchers in Sri Lanka finds women who had abortions ... [ had a ] 3.42 [ increased risk ] ... compared with those who kept their baby .
...
The Sri Lankan study is the fourth epidemiological study in fourteen months to report an abortion - breast cancer link , including studies from the U.S. , China and Turkey . " [ 40 ]
LifeNews also reported in 2009 that a National Cancer Institute researcher admitted there was a link between abortion and breast cancer . [ 41 ]
Studies showing that abortion increases breast cancer predate the political controversy . [ 42 ]
A study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center published in 2009 confirmed a 40 % increase in risk in breast cancer from abortion . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
Yet the abortion industry conceals this increased risk , just as the tobacco industry concealed its cancer risk for decades . [ 45 ]
Walk for Life rally
A new study on breast cancer in Turkey published in April 2009 in the peer - reviewed World Journal of Surgical Oncology found , through a surveying process , that induced abortion was a statistically significant cause of breast cancer risk .
The study concludes , “ Our findings suggest that age and induced abortion were found to be significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk … . ” [ 46 ]
Specifically , the study found that Turkish women who received one or more induced abortions had a 66 % higher risk of breast cancer than women who never had an abortion . [ 47 ] [ 48 ]
Dr. Janet Daling , who considers herself supportive of a right to perform abortions , brought the abortion - breast cancer link into the mainstream with her federally funded research on the topic .
Her report , released in 1994 , found a 50 % increase in breast cancer risk due to induced abortion . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
She said , " I have three sisters with breast cancer and I resent people messing with the scientific data to further their own agenda , be they pro-choice or pro-life .
I would have loved to have found no association between breast cancer and abortion , but our research is rock solid and our data is accurate . " [ 51 ]
Similarly , an early study published in Japan in 1957 showed that women who have abortions have a much higher risk of breast cancer than those who decide to keep their baby . [ 52 ]
In a peer - reviewed medical journal , Karen Malec observed that : [ 39 ]
Thirty - eight epidemiological studies exploring an independent link [ between abortion and ] breast cancer have been published .
Twenty - nine report risk elevations .
Thirteen out of 15 American studies found risk elevations .
Seventeen studies are statistically significant , 16 of which report increased risk .
Dr. Angela Lanfranchi , M.D. , F.A.C.S. , a specialist in breast cancer an a clinical assistant professor of surgery at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School , has explained the physiology and epidemiology of the abortion - breast cancer link .
She made the following observation : [ 53 ]
This past August in Minneapolis , Patrick Carroll , director of the Pension and Population Research Institute of London , presented a paper to the largest gathering of statisticians in North America .
He showed that abortion was the best predictor of breast cancer in Britain .
Breast cancer is the only cancer in Britain which has its highest incidence and mortality rate among the upper rather than lower social classes .
Abortion before a full term pregnancy and late pregnancy were the best explanations for this incidence .
He also found that there had been a 70 % increase risk of breast cancer between 1971 and 2002 and that for women between 50 and 54 years of age incidence was highly correlated with abortion .
Demographic evidence of abortion causing breast cancer includes the following .
Breast cancer rates are far lower in Western countries that prohibited abortion than in those that promoted it .
Ireland , which virtually bans abortion , reportedly has a lifetime rate of breast cancer of only 1 in 13 , nearly half the rate of 1 in 7.5 in the United States . [ 54 ]
The rate of breast cancer increases steadily as one travels from Ireland , where abortion is illegal , to Northern Ireland , where abortion is legal but rare , to England , where abortion is common . [ 55 ]
In Romania , abortion was illegal under two decades of rule by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu , and the country enjoyed one of the lowest breast cancer rates in the entire world during that time , far lower than comparable Western countries .
Romania 's breast cancer rate was an astounding one - sixth the rate of the United States . [ 56 ]
But after the execution of Ceausescu on Christmas Day , 1989 , Romania has taken the opposite approach , embracing abortion to the point that Romania now has one of the highest abortion rates in the world . [ 57 ]
One Romanian observer decried , " The liberalization of abortions in Romania in 1990 , the significant increase of the number of abortions at relatively short intervals , determined a rise in the incidence of breast and uterine cervix cancer in my country . " [ 58 ]
Studies on rats , which are an accepted method for identifying causes of cancer in humans , further confirm that abortion does indeed increase the risk of breast cancer .
As Dr. Joel Brind observed , " Researchers also widely admit to the biological plausibility of abortion as an independent cause of breast cancer , through the estrogen - mediated stimulation of breast growth in the absence of differentiation .
This was demonstrated experimentally in rats in the landmark experiments of Russo and Russo . " [ 59 ]
Additional scientific information on the abortion - breast cancer link is available at BCPInstitute.org .
An expert ( Dr. Lynn Rosenberg ) hired to defend abortion felt compelled to admit , under cross-examination , that a woman increases her risk for breast cancer by having an abortion compared to carrying her pregnancy to childbirth : [ 60 ]
Question by the attorney : ' So in other words , a woman who finds herself pregnant at age 15 will have a higher breast cancer risk if she chooses to abort that pregnancy , than if she carries the pregnancy to term , [ is that ] correct ? '
Dr. Lynn Rosenberg : ' Probably , yes . '
Question : ' Looking at that another way , let 's compare two women .
Let 's say both got pregnant at age 15 -- one terminates the pregnancy , but the other carries the pregnancy to term .
And both women go on to get married and have two kids , say , at age 30 and age 35 .
Is the risk of breast cancer higher for the woman who had an abortion at age 15 or the woman who had a baby at age 15 , all other things being equal ?'
Dr. Lynn Rosenberg : ' It 's probably higher for the one who had an abortion at age 15 . '
Despite the overwhelming evidence — and inescapable logic — for abortion increasing breast cancer , promoters of abortion cite flawed articles in an attempt to deny the link .
The flaws in these articles are exposed in the Harvard abortion study and " Legal Implications of a Link Between Abortion and Breast Cancer " by Andrew Schlafly in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons . [ 61 ]
As Dr. Lanfranchi has explained : [ 62 ]
Well - documented breast physiology accounts for the fact that oral contraceptives and abortion are risk factors for breast cancer .
There is an effort to suppress this information by federal agencies and those in academic medicine .
Without this information , women cannot make a fully informed choice about their method of fertility control or about whether to maintain an unplanned pregnancy .
Medical ethics demands that they be informed .
Pro-choice should include informed choice . [ 63 ]
Yet efforts continue to suppress awareness that abortion increases breast cancer .
Pro-life scientists were almost entirely barred from the National Cancer Institute 's " study " of the link , and its resulting statements were fatally flawed as explained in National Cancer Institute on Abortion .
Just as organizations denied or failed to disclose the connection between smoking and lung cancer , many organizations aligned with liberal politicians deny the correlation between abortion and breast cancer despite numerous studies published in peer reviewed journals indicating a likely connection .
The Smellie 's double crochet abortion tool was used to grab and forcibly remove the fetus from the womb .
Abortion Causes Future Harm with Premature Births
" At least 49 studies have demonstrated a statistically significant increase in premature births ( PB ) or low birth weight ( LBW ) risk in women with prior induced abortions ( IAs ) . " [ 64 ]
Premature birth tragically causes brain damage , and an array of other severe , lifelong injuries ranging from Cerebral Palsy to blindness , or even death , and few mothers would knowingly increase the risk of that happening .
" There are at least seventeen ( 17 ) studies that have found that previous induced abortions increase preterm birth risk ” and thereby increase debilitating Cerebral Palsy in children . " [ 65 ]
In 2008 , the generally pro-abortion British medical journal , The Lancet , admitted that a procedure often used in abortion increase the risk of premature birth : [ 66 ]
" For example , greater public and professional awareness of evidence that repeated uterine instrumentation -- eg , uterine curettage or endometrial biopsy -- is associated with increased risk of subsequent preterm birth might over time influence decision - making about the procedure . "
Researchers Rooney and Calhoun observed : [ 66 ]
Large studies have reported a doubling of [ early premature birth ] EPB risk from two prior IAs .
Women who had four or more IAs experienced , on average , nine times the risk of [ extremely early premature births ] XPB , an increase of 800 percent .
These results suggest that women contemplating IA should be informed of this potential risk to subsequent pregnancies , and that physicians should be aware of the potential liability and possible need for intensified prenatal care .
Demographic evidence of how abortion increases premature birth includes the following :
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) : " [ T ] he abortion rate for black women has been approximately three times as high as that for white women ( range : 2.6-- 3.1 ) since 1991 " [ 67 ]
as high as that for white women ( range : 2.6-- 3.1 ) since 1991 " Science Daily 's report on a study by the Washington University School of Medicine : " African - American women are three times more likely to deliver babies three to 17 weeks prematurely than Caucasian wome n " [ 68 ]
In 2002 an article entitled " Preterm Birth : A Continuing Challenge " noted that premature births are abnormally high in the United States , citing a study that observed that a previous abortion is a " risk factor for both infertility and preterm birth . " [ 69 ]
The rate of premature birth is elevated by the same amount as the abortion rate , as expected if abortion increases the risk of premature birth .
Other Health Risks from Abortion
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that : [ 70 ]
“ " While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon , it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained .
See Brief for Sandra Cano et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 05-380 , pp 22 - 24 .
Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow . " ”
A study published in the Southern Medical Journal observed that there are higher death rates associated with women who have abortion , and that these higher death rates persist over time and across socioeconomic boundaries .
In England , the " Royal College of Psychiatrists says women should not be allowed to have an abortion until they are counselled on the possible risk to their mental health . "
The medical royal college warned that women who have abortions may be at risk of mental health problems . [ 72 ]
A New Zealand study found that abortion in young women may be associated with increased risks of mental health problems . [ 73 ]
The researcher in this study , who was not pro-life , was shaken by the study and had to go to four journals before he could find one who would publish it . [ 74 ]
The study concludes with the following statement :
“ These findings are inconsistent with the current consensus on the psychological effects of abortion .
In particular , in its 2005 statement on abortion , the American Psychological Association concluded that “ well - designed studies of psychological responses following abortion have consistently shown that risk of psychological harm is low ... the percentage of women who experience clinically relevant distress is small and appears to be no greater than in general samples of women of reproductive age ” ( American Psychological Association , 2005 ) .
This relatively strong conclusion about the absence of harm from abortion was based on a relatively small number of studies which had one or more of the following limitations : a ) absence of comprehensive assessment of mental disorders ; b) lack of comparison groups ; and c ) limited statistical controls .
Furthermore , the statement appears to disregard the findings of a number of studies that had claimed to show negative effects for abortion ( Cougle et al. , 2003 ; Gissler et al. , 1996 ; Reardon & Cougle , 2002 ) . [ 74 ] ”
Professor David Fergusson , lead author of the New Zealand study stated :
“ It borders on scandalous that one of the most common surgical procedures performed on young women is so poorly researched and evaluated .
If this were Prozac or Vioxx , reports of associated harm would be taken much more seriously with more careful research and monitoring procedures . " [ 75 ] ”
Another study published in the OB / GYN Survey detailed long - term physical and psychological health consequences of induced abortions . [ 76 ]
Suicide rates among women who had abortions are six times higher than women who gave birth in the prior year .
Overall , deaths from suicide , homicide and accidents were 248 % higher after an abortion , as found by a 13 - year study in Finland of its entire population . [ 77 ]
In the United States , only one state ( Missouri ) requires that the abortionist have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion . [ 78 ]
In the other 49 states , an abortion patient can and often is left without prompt medical care by the treating physician .
One of the largest abortion providers in the United States , the Metropolitan Medical Associates of New Jersey , was shut down in 2007 by state health officials after one of its botched abortions left a 20 - year - old woman in a coma for more than four weeks .
She " became severely ill following the abortion and was transferred to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center where she needed blood transfusions and had her uterus removed .
She also suffered a stroke due to the serious blood loss and had one of her lungs collapse . "
The State of New Jersey had shut down the same facility in 1993 also . [ 79 ]

History
Please also see : History of abortion
Abortion was an extremely harsh punishment in the Old Testament , imposed against those who have " rebelled against " God :
" Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb . "
( Hosea 9:16 )
" Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up . "
( Hosea 13:16 )
" Then Menahem smote Tiphsah , and all that were therein , and the coasts thereof from Tirzah : because they opened not to him , therefore he smote it ; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up . "
( 2 Kings 15:16 )
The father of medicine , Hippocrates , expressly prohibited abortion in his ethical Oath long before Christianity .
The Journal of Medical Ethics article declared concerning the atheist and sadist Marquis de Sade :
“ In 1795 the Marquis de Sade published his La Philosophic dans le boudoir , in which he proposed the use of induced abortion for social reasons and as a means of population control .
It is from this time that medical and social acceptance of abortion can be dated , although previously the subject had not been discussed in public in modern times .
It is suggested that it was largely due to de Sade 's writing that induced abortion received the impetus which resulted in its subsequent spread in western society . [ 82 ] ”
Population control is based on pseudoscience and ill founded economic assumptions . [ 83 ]
Adolf Hitler and Abortion
For more information see : Abortion and Adolf Hitler
“ In view of the large families of the Slav native population , it could only suit us if girls and women there had as many abortions as possible .
We are not interested in seeing the non-German population multiply …
We must use every means to instill in the population the idea that it is harmful to have several children , the expenses that they cause and the dangerous effect on woman 's health …
It will be necessary to open special institutions for abortions and doctors must be able to help out there in case there is any question of this being a breach of their professional ethics . [ 84 ] ”
‎ In 1942 Adolf Hitler declared :
After World War II , the War Crimes Tribunal indicted ten Nazi leaders for " encouraging and compelling abortion , " which the tribunal considered a " crime against humanity . " [ 85 ]
Hall v. Lefkowitz
Hall v. Lefkowitz was a court case on November 4 , 1969 [ 86 ] during which Roy Lucas , an assistant professor at the University of Alabama Law School , and his self - founded James Madison Constitutional Law Institute , sued to challenge New York 's abortion laws .
A three - judge court presided which included famous judge Henry Friendly .
Friendly wrote a draft opinion in the spring of 1970 declaring government had right to regulate abortion and protect a fetus , contrary to the later Roe v. Wade ruling .
However , shortly thereafter the New York legislature amended state abortion law to allow abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy , and Hall 's case was dismissed as unnecessary . [ 30 ]
Read some of Friendly 's arguments made years before Roe v. Wade .
NARAL's Lies About Back - Alley Abortions
Bernard Nathanson , one of NARAL 's co-founders , described how he and the organization fabricated abortion statistics and used slogans to sway the public during the early days of Roe v. Wade .
“ I remember laughing when we made those slogans up .
We were looking for some sexy , catchy slogans to capture public opinion .
They were very cynical slogans then , just as all of these slogans today are very , very cynical .
We persuaded the media that the cause of permissive abortion was a liberal , enlightened , sophisticated one .
Knowing that if a true poll were taken , we would be soundly defeated , we simply fabricated the results of fictional polls .
We announced to the media that we had taken polls and that 60 percent of Americans were in favor of permissive abortion .
We aroused enough sympathy to sell our program of permissive abortion by fabricating the number of illegal abortions done annually in the U.S.
The actual figure was approaching 100,000 , but the figure we gave to the media repeatedly was 1,000,000 .
Repeating the big lie often enough convinces the public .
The number of women dying from illegal abortions was around 200 - 250 annually .
The figure we constantly fed to the media was 10,000 .
These false figures took root in the consciousness of Americans , convincing many that we needed to crack the abortion law .
Another myth we fed to the public through the media was that legalizing abortion would only mean that the abortions taking place illegally would then be done legally .
In fact , of course , abortion is now being used as a primary method of birth control in the U.S. and the annual number of abortions has increased by 1,500 percent since legalization . [ 12 ] ”
Roe v. Wade
Prior to 1973 abortion was illegal in most of the United States , though a few states ( such as Hawaii and New York ) allowed it with restrictions . [ 87 ]
The U.S. Supreme Court 's 1973 Roe v. Wade [ 88 ] decision ruled that abortions are lawful under the U.S. Constitution up to the point at which the fetus becomes able to survive outside the womb , and an accompanying decision issued the same day captioned Doe v. Bolton essentially legalized abortion in the unlimited discretion of the abortionist at any time during pregnancy , up to and including birth .
Conservatives immediately criticized these decisions as examples of Judicial Activism .
Ironically , Norma McCorvey , also known as " Jane Roe , " only sought an abortion for herself .
She did not wish for her personal battle to result in a nationwide " legalization " of the procedure .
The only reason the case bore her name was because of her pro-abortion feminist lawyer , Sarah Weddington , who sought to have Texas ' abortion ban overturned . [ 89 ]
Even more importantly , Roe became pro-life and sought to have the Supreme Court 's decision overturned .
Present Day
In 2008 , worldwide there were approximately 115,000 abortions done per day . [ 90 ]
In 2008 , approximately 83 % of all abortions were performed in developing countries and 17 % occurred in developed countries . [ 90 ]
From 2006 to 2015 , the number of abortions in the U.S. fell 24 % to 638,169 , still a very large number . [ 91 ]
States may regulate abortion , such as requiring a 24 - hour waiting period and parental consent for minors .
Abortion clinics often fail to comply with the health standards of surgical facilities , and States can require compliance ( but often do not , resulting in discomfort and harm to the victims of abortion ) .
Many abortionists lack hospital admitting privileges at nearby facilities , so women having complications must go on their own to emergency rooms to see physicians unfamiliar with what actually happened .
For any other operation the cost of treating complications is included in the cost of the operation , but for abortions the abortion clinics take their money and typically do not pay for the care of complications .
The more pro-abortion the State regulations are , the larger the number of abortion clinics it will have .
Arizona , though a pro-life State , has a regulatory system that results in twelve abortion clinics operating within its borders .
In contrast , Mississippi has only one abortion clinic , and Missouri has only two .
Abortion and Eugenics
See also : Abortion and eugenics
Abortion and eugenics are often very strongly related .
Abortion is commonly used to kill those babies who happen to suffer from Down Syndrome [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and other physical and mental issues , to remove said physical and mental issues from the human race .
Eugenics is essentially the unethical removal of those with physical and mental issues to " purify " the human race .
Iceland has very pro-abortion policies and nearly 100 % of babies with Down Syndrome are aborted . [ 95 ]
According to Dr. Peter McParland , an obstetrician from the National Maternity Hospital , and Anne Trainer : [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
“ ' In Britain , 90 % of babies with Down ’s Syndrome are aborted before birth .
In Iceland , every single baby , 100 % of all those diagnosed with Down ’s Syndrome , are aborted .
There has n’t been a baby with Down ’s Syndrome born in Iceland in the past five years . '
Denmark is following suit , and is expected to be “ Down ’s Syndrome - free ” by 2030 and these cold and chilling statistics show us exactly where legal abortion is leading the rest of Europe . ”
Reasons Given For Abortions
Primary reasons women reported for undergoing abortions
See also : Reasons given for abortion
The Alan Guttmacher Institute , which is not a conservative or pro-life organization , conducted a poll of more than 1,200 patients undergoing induced abortions at 11 large - scale abortion facilities in the United States .
The women were asked to identify reasons for seeking abortions , and identify the primary motivation .
An additional 38 women at four sites were interviewed in - depth . [ 98 ]
The poll omitted any reference to whether the women were able to see an ultrasound of their unborn children before choosing to have an abortion .
For the vast majority of women who have abortion , the reason is a lack of knowledge about the unborn child as displayed by an ultrasound .
Because a large part of their campaign funds are bankrolled by the abortion industry , liberals are frequent opponents to laws making available ultrasound treatment for patients not certain of the decision .
Some physicians have been reported intimidating and pressuring patients to continue with an abortion after the patient has had a change of heart , either on the operating table or before surgery .
One doctor , who was also employed as a spokesman for a prominent liberal pro-abortion think tank , reportedly forced a patient to undergo the procedure in order to fill a quota on insurance claims .
Among reasons provided to the women as part of the poll , the two most common selections were " Having a baby would dramatically change my life " ( 74 % ) and " I can't afford a baby now " ( 73 % ) . [ 98 ]
Concerns about their own health were mentioned by only 13 % of the women , while only 12 % mentioned concerns about the baby 's health , though only 3 % and 4 % respectively gave those as their primary reason for seeking abortion . [ 98 ]
Interestingly , only 14 % indicated " husband or partner wants me to have an abortion " as a reason , down from 24 % in a previous survey in 1987 . [ 98 ]
This contrasts with research on women post- abortion , among whom 64 % reported feeling pressured by others to abort , and may indicate pressure to abort comes not so much from husbands now as other relationships . [ 99 ]
What is often ignored in studies of why women submit to abortions is an ambivalence by some in early pregnancy .
Such ambivalence typically resolves when the mother becomes more aware of her unborn child , as displayed by an ultrasound .
[ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ]
Less than one percent of all abortions are due to rape .
Abortion does not liberate women .
It liberates men from the responsibilities of raising children , as well as responsibility for their sexual behavior , including emotional and financial support .
Here is a comparison .
The founding feminists Susan B. Anthony and Liz Stanton were pro-life .
The radical feminists ( feminazis ) believe that pregnant women are inferior to non-pregnant women .
The biggest financial contributor to abortion rights is the Playboy Foundation , which is supportive of the philosophy of uncommitted , anonymous sex without consequences ; women are reduced to the status of a consumer item which , if “ broken ” by pregnancy , can be “ fixed ” by abortion .
A large majority of women who got an abortion said that they did so because they felt pressured by others .
This is why before abortion became legal in the US , women who got an abortion did not receive jail time , but instead , get treated as a second victim while the abortionist gets punished .
Instead of legalizing abortion in cases of rape , overturn the 1977 US Supreme Court case of Coker v. Georgia , in which the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for rapists as a violation of the eighth amendment .
Disability does not do anything to take away happiness .
Eugenics is a waste of lives and delays the research needed to treat disabilities .
We need to help the disabled live independent lives .
There eventually be a cure for them as technology advances .
In July 2013 , scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester have learned to shut down the extra chromosome that causes Down 's syndrome . [ 103 ]
Public Opinion
See also : Views on abortion
Public polling , as seen below ( sourced from Gallup [ 13 ] ) , reveals that Americans are increasingly calling themselves Pro-Life ( 50 % ) and continue to say abortion should be legal only in a few circumstances ( 59 % ) such as rape ( 75 % ) and life of the mother ( 83 % ) .
Legal or Illegal
According to Gallup 's most recent poll ( May 3 – 6 , 2012 ) , 20 % of Americans believe abortion should always be illegal , and 39 % believe it should be legal only in a few circumstances , a combined 59 % that believe it should always or usually be illegal .
25 % believe abortion should always be legal , and 13 % believe that it should be legal in most circumstances , a combined 38 % that believe it should always or usually be legal .
4 % hold no opinion .
The percentage of Americans which believe abortion should always or usually be illegal has varied from a low of 51 % ( Sept. 6 - 7 , 1994 , and Sept. 22 - 24 , 1995 ) to a high of 62 % ( May 2 –5 , 2005 ) .
Gallup has polled the question 33 times since it began asking in 1994 . [ 104 ]
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice
Currently , 50 % of Americans describe themselves as Pro-Life , 41 % describe themselves as Pro-Choice , and 4 % as Mixed / Neither , as of the most recent poll ( May 3 – 6 , 2012 ) .
The percentage of Americans describing themselves as Pro-Life has varied from a low of 33 % ( Sept. 3 - 6 , 1995 ) to a high of 51 % ( May 7 – 10 , 2009 ) .
Gallup has polled the question 41 times since it began asking in 1995 . [ 13 ]
By Trimester
Gallup has asked the following question four times from 2003 - 2011 : " Thinking more generally , do you think abortion should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the following stages of pregnancy .
How about -- [ RANDOM ORDER ] ? " [ 13 ]

Optionline provides consultants that connects individuals to nearby pregnancy centers that offer the following services : free pregnancy tests and pregnancy information ; Information about the risks of abortion and the morning after pill ; medical services , including STD tests ; early ultrasounds and pregnancy confirmation .
In addition , some of these centers provide information regarding free housing to women who are facing housing concerns . [ 105 ]
The primary alternative to abortion is adoption .
Liberty Godparent Foundation is a Christian organization focused on improving the lives of unwed pregnant teens , babies and adoptive families by providing two alternatives , The Liberty Godparent Maternity Home and Family Life Services Adoption Agency . [ 106 ]
Catholic Social Services provides adoption assistance to people of all beliefs in addition to supporting families in need .
Planned Parenthood 's Budget
See also : Planned Parenthood 's budget
Planned Parenthood likes to claim that abortion accounts for just 3 % of its services .
[ 107 ]
However , an examination of its finances reveals that much if not most of its income relates to abortion .
[ 108 ]
According to Planned Parenthood 's 2007 - 08 budget , it received $ 1.038 billion of revenue from the following sources : [ 109 ]
Revenue
( millions ) % Health Center Income $ 374.7 36.1 % Govt. Grants & Services $ 349.6 33.7 % Contributions & Requests $ 244.9 23.6 % Other Operating Revenue $ 68.9 6.6 % Total Revenue $ 1,038.1 100.0 %
Planned Parenthood 's reported $ 374.7 million of revenue from " Health Center Income " .
Given that it reported performing 305,130 abortions , [ 110 ] at an average cost of $ 450 ( which lines up with statistics from the National Abortion Federation [ 111 ] ) , approximately $ 137.4 million of that $ 374.7 million Health Center Income came directly from performing abortions per analysis by Live Action . [ 112 ]
Since much of its money comes from Government Grants and Services or Contributions and Requests ( $ 595.5 million ) likely related to abortion , in addition to this $ 137.4 million of direct abortion revenue , it appears probable that as much as half to two - thirds of Planned Parenthood 's revenue relates to abortion .
Targeted Demographics

Women in China
Forced abortion caused by China 's One - Child Policy leads to deaths of mothers , [ 113 ] as well as " gendercide " . [ 114 ]
Because men tend to be higher wage earners , many families choose to abort their female children , opting instead for males .
[ 115 ]
Photos in 2012 of these forced abortions led to national outrage and calls to end China 's One - Child Policy . [ 116 ]
The sex - selective abortion policy has led to a huge gender disparity in China , 122.66 boys for every girl born , the highest ratio in the entire Asia Specific region , [ 117 ] and resulted in 32 million single males .
[ 118 ]
Logically this is a driving force behind human trafficking , prostitution , and the female slave trade which occurs near China . [ 119 ]
Minority Communities
" Each day 1,786 African American children are aborted . "
According to the U.S. Census of 2006 , African Americans are at 1.96 birth rate which is beneath the replacement level of 2.1. [ 121 ]
At the continued rate , racism by abortion will decimate the black population of the U.S .
According to writer George Grant , the author of Killing Angel :
" During the 1980s when Planned Parenthood shifted its focus from community - based clinics to school - based clinics , it again targeted inner-city minority neighborhoods ...
Of the more than 100 school - based clinics that have opened nationwide in the last decade [ 1980s ] , none has been at substantially all - white schools .... None has been at suburban middle - class schools .
All have been at black , minority or ethnic schools . ” [ 122 ]
Planned Parenthood itself reported that its abortions on minorities in 1991 were 42.7 % of its total abortions . [ 123 ]
However , during that time period , minorities comprised only 19.7 % of the U.S. population . [ 123 ]
According to Cybercast News Service : " An analysis by the Cybercast News Service compared the location of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics with population data from the U.S. Census in 2000 .
The results appear to bolster the charge that the organization targets black communities . " [ 120 ]
According to the Open Journal of Preventive Medicine in June 2016 , abortion was the cause of death of 61 % of Black Americans . [ 124 ]
Political Support of Abortion
See also : Abortion and politics
The most powerful political action committee ( PAC ) is EMILY 's List . [ 125 ] EMILY 's List contributes money to Democratic candidates who support abortion - on - demand , including forced taxpayer funding of abortion .
EMILY 's
List candidates also oppose regulations such as :
Providing health information to abortion patients ;
Requiring that the abortionist have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital in case there is a complication ; and
Providing parental notification if the patient is a teenager .
Due to the influence of the abortion industry and EMILY 's List , nearly every Democratic presidential candidate and senatorial candidate supports abortion - on - demand .
" EMILY 's List , the nation 's largest political action committee , continues to be the dominant financial resource for Democratic candidates , " its above - referenced website declares .
There is no comparably funded organization opposing abortion , because there are no monetary rewards to defending human life .
Instead , candidates and supporters who oppose abortion are motivated by religious and ethical principles .
Pro-Life Democrats
See also : DFLA #2009 - 2010 Obamacare Influence
While most Democrats support abortion , a growing number have been affiliating with Democrats For Life of America , also known as Pro-Life Democrats .
ObamaCare in 2009 - 2010 would have passed rapidly if not for their influence , since Democrats had a Supermajority allowing them to pass anything without a single Republican vote .
However , 40 Pro-Life Democrats , led by Congressman Bart Stupak signed a letter refusing to let ObamaCare pass without reforms on the abortion issue , and fought the bill from June 2009 to March 2010 , in an attempt to add the Stupak Amendment to the bill ( which was added to the House bill but removed in the Senate despite attempts by Sen. Ben Nelson to add it there as well ) .
Politics and Demographics

The Birkbeck College , University of London professor Eric Kaufman wrote in his 2010 book Shall the Righteous Inherit the Earth ?
concerning America :
“ High evangelical fertility rates more than compensated for losses to liberal Protestant sects during the twentieth century .
In recent decades , white secularism has surged , but Latino and Asian religious immigration has taken up the slack , keeping secularism at bay .
Across denominations , the fertility advantage of religious fundamentalists of all colours is significant and growing .
After 2020 , their demographic weight will begin to tip the balance in the culture wars towards the conservative side , ramping up pressure on hot - button issues such as abortion .
By the end of the century , three quarters of America may be pro-life .
Their activism will leap over the borders of the ' Redeemer Nation ' to evangelize the world .
Already , the rise of the World Congress of Families has launched a global religious right , its arms stretching across the bloody lines of the War on Terror to embrace the entire Abrahamic family . [ 126 ] ”
Ultrasound images
About 80 % of women who see an ultrasound of their fetus ( unborn child ) decide not to abort . [ 127 ]

A blue - ribbon panel of scientists said Tuesday that the high - volume water main breaks that bedeviled Los Angeles last summer and fall were caused in part by the city ’s restrictions on lawn watering , and their findings could force the city to remake its strict water conservation policy .
The city last June limited the use of lawn sprinklers to Mondays and Thursdays , and those restrictions have proved highly successful .
Officials said Tuesday that in February , Los Angeles had its lowest recorded water use in 31 years .
But the water conservation policy was too much for the city ’s aging network of cast - iron pipes , causing fluctuations in water pressure that strained them to the bursting point , the panel ’s long - awaited report found .
Its conclusions appear to put to rest other theories about the cause of the mystery , including increased seismic activity .
According to the report , on days when watering was allowed , water pressure in the pipes dropped .
On days when watering was n’t allowed , pressure increased and “ accelerated the metal fatigue failures of aged and corroded cast - iron pipes , ” the report said .
The result was a series of major water main breaks that flooded streets and damaged property , starting weeks after the water restrictions took effect .
From July through September 2009 , the city recorded 101 major breaks , compared to 42 in 2008 and 49 in 2007 , the report said .
The scientists suggested the city rework its conservation plan .
One alternative would be to require homes with even - numbered addresses to conserve on even - numbered days and homes with odd - numbered addresses to conserve on odd - numbered days , the team said .
That , they said , would help even up pressure .
“ The bottom line is , you want to create a more even usage of water pressure so you do n’t have a sudden drop of water pressure at a given time of the day , ” said Jean - Pierre Bardet , chairman of USC ’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , who headed the team .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council requested the panel ’s probe after last summer ’s spectacular blowouts .
A spokesman for the Department of Water and Power said his agency was studying the panel ’s report .
A DWP spokesman said scientists at the utility “ have not yet analyzed Dr. Bardet ’s findings but look forward to doing so . ”
Joe Ramallo said the agency ’s own investigation found that water rationing might have been a factor but determined that a more likely cause was corroded , aging cast - iron pipes .
Councilman Paul Koretz said that in the report ’s wake , he wants the council to immediately halt the current conservation program and develop an alternative plan .
“ It was such a well - intentioned program , ” he said .
“ But I think intuitively , once somebody raised the idea , it made perfect sense ; you have brittle pipes and you have dramatically increasing and decreasing water pressure . ”
Officials began noticing an increase in water main breaks in late summer .
Then on Sept. 5 , a 5 - foot - wide trunk line underneath Coldwater Canyon Avenue in Studio City exploded , sending a 10 - foot gusher of water and mud into the air .
Homes and businesses were flooded .
The street , a major thoroughfare connecting the San Fernando Valley and the Westside , was closed for a week .
Less than 72 hours later , another main burst in Valley Village , creating a sinkhole that swallowed half a firetruck that responded to the call .
Firefighters crawled out the window to reach safety .
So far , the city has been hit with 108 legal claims regarding the Coldwater Canyon pipe breaks , 41 of them from homeowners , officials said Tuesday .
Of the latter number , 25 claims have been paid , two were denied , three have pending offers and 11 are awaiting more documents , said Assistant City Atty .
Joseph Brajevich .
The financial terms of those settlements were not immediately available .
The Times in September reported that some experts were speculating that water rationing had played a role in the water main breaks .
But at the time , other experts were skeptical , questioning why water restrictions in L.A. would cause ruptures when other cities with similar rules , including Long Beach , were not experiencing the same problems .
Bardet ’s team was assigned to study last summer ’s “ blowouts , ” the term used by the utility to describe pipe breaks that undermine the street and require the replacement of at least 100 square feet of pavement .
Ninety percent of the blowouts occurred in the brittle cast - iron pipes that are among the oldest in the DWP ’s network , which extends over 7,200 miles .
In addition to the water conservation findings , the panel said the city ’s water pipes required work .
The scientists called for a more efficient pipe - replacement plan and an improved pipe - inspection program .
Councilwoman Jan Perry said that given the findings , it is up to city officials to show why changes in the conservation rules should not occur immediately .
“ We certainly do n’t want to go through another summer like the one we had last year , ” she said .

Ms Hurst described her son as confident and outgoing Mothers who breastfeed older children face " cultural " opposition despite no evidence that the practice is harmful , a leading parents ' charity has said .
The comments came after a mother from South Yorkshire defended her decision to continue breastfeeding her five - year - old son Jonathan .
Amanda Hurst , from Barnsley , said she had originally intended to stop at six months but carrying on " became a natural thing " .
National Childbirth Trust ( NCT ) breastfeeding counsellor Heather Welford said : " There is no evidence that breastfeeding children at any age is in any way harmful to the mother or child , either psychologically or physically .
" In our 21st century European culture it is very unusual , but it 's not unusual historically or in other countries .
" Sometimes you will get psychologists talking about it and saying it may be detrimental , but I do n't think they 're aware of all the facts .
I know I 'm doing the right thing and I 'm a firm believer in children making their own choices
Amanda Hurst , mother " You even get some healthcare professionals who will advise women to stop breastfeeding after six months , telling them there 's no goodness left in the milk .
" That 's not right , the milk remains as healthy . "
Ms Hurst said her son was confident and outgoing and had chosen to continue feeding .
" I know I 'm doing the right thing and I 'm a firm believer in children making their own choices , " she said .
' Natural thing '
She told the BBC that until recently nobody had been aware that she was still breastfeeding Jonathan as he had decided to stop doing it in public when he was three years old .
" We just never stopped , " Ms Hurst said .
" Once I gave birth to Jonathan and I started breastfeeding , I thought we 'll just get to six months and then I thought we 'll go to a year and then it never stopped .
" And here I am five years on .
It became a natural thing .
" I 'm a firm believer that Jonathan should choose his own path in life , " she said .
Ms Hurst said breastfeeding Jonathan would stop when he lost the ability to suckle as his milk teeth fell out .
She added : " I know I 'm doing the right thing and I 'm a firm believer in children having their own choices and in doing what 's right for you and your family and I made those choices for my family . "
Ms Welford said : " That mother is fairly typical of women who are breastfeeding children at older ages .
" She does n't do it very often and it 's something that will fade away of its own accord .
" Women do not set out when they have a baby and say ' I am going to breastfeed until my child is five years old ' , it just sort of happens . "

F.E.A.R. 3 Announced , Horror Director John Carpenter Drafted for Cinematics
F.E.A.R.'s silent protagonist Point Man will return as the star , though his brother Paxton Fettel will also be playable in the shooter 's " divergent co-op " mode , where each have " distinctly different abilities affecting their own play as well as the experience of their co-op partner . "
The Thing and Escape from New York director John Carpenter has been brought onboard to provide " his expertise in crafting the in - game cinematics " while 30 Days of Night writer Steve Niles has co-written the script with Day 1 .
" After working closely with Monolith , Day 1 is honored to bring the next iteration of the F.E.A.R. franchise to gamers with key elements of the past games yet providing fresh combat and horror experiences in F.E.A.R. 3 , " said Day 1 founder Denny Thorley in the announcement .
" Players can look forward to new features such as divergent co-op , an evolved cover system , and more scares in F.E.A.R. 3 . "
F.E.A.R. 3-- thankfully not F.3.A.R.-- is due out on PC , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this fall .
On first read , this article from the Brussels Journal seems ominous :
http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4154
The Lisbon Treaty , with its incorporation of most European countries into a vast superstate , is another chapter in the push by globalist elites to homogenise the entire world .
The ‘ Asian Union ’ which Kevin Rudd has been trumpeting represents another step on the same path .
Although it ’s still a long way off ( Asian countries , being more varied in political and economic structure , are harder to integrate than European ones ) it is still definitely on the cards .
So too is an African Union , a North American Union etc .
Eventually , all these continental ‘ unions ’ will be ‘ harmonised ’ into a truly global state .
At least if the corporate elites are allowed to have their way …
National - Anarchists , like all sane people , view these developments with horror and contempt .
Aside from the destruction of the world ’s cultures and folkways that globalism represents , it is also a surefire recipe for tyranny .
A world state could only be controlled by means of outright despotism .
If we want to avoid a future like that , then we must fight now .
The good news is that the system ’s own overreach is already starting to work against it .
In Europe , for instance , there is a clear development towards regionalism .
People are rediscovering their ancestral cultures like never before , including regional cultures that existed long before the rise of the centralised nation state .
In Belgium itself ( where the EU capital Brussels is located ) , there are signs that the artificially - created country could soon break down into its component regions of Flanders and Wallonia .
The regionalist movement is still small , largely manifested in pagan spiritual circles , in neo -folk and black metal music , and in certain growing political movements ( such as National - Anarchism ) .
But the regionalist tendency will doubtless continue to thrive as the EU sinks its bureaucratic tentacles further into people ’s private lives and cultural spheres .
May a thousand flowers bloom …
US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , signed a landmark nuclear arms treaty in the Czech capital , Prague on Thursday .
The treaty commits the former Cold War enemies to each reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 - 30 % lower than the previous ceiling .
Here is a breakdown of their respective arsenals .

Arizona lawmakers on Tuesday passed one of the toughest pieces of immigration - enforcement legislation in the country , which would make it a violation of state law to be in the U.S. without proper documentation .
It would also grant police the power to stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being illegal .
The bill ...
When it comes to education trends , as California goes , so goes the nation .
Which is all the more reason to be concerned about the latest effort in California to dumb down standards .
The University of California 's Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools ( BOARS ) has launched another salvo in its long - running war against the SAT , the test used by many colleges and universities to assess academic achievement among high school seniors .
This is only the latest in a series of moves by BOARS against the SAT , but this one may be a stalking horse to eliminate standardized tests in general , especially if they conflict with the goal of promoting racial and ethnic diversity .
BOARS has already eliminated a requirement that University of California applicants take at least two subject - matter tests in addition to the SAT Reasoning Test .
Now BOARS is taking aim at the SAT directly .
What makes the action more suspicious is that BOARS ' own report notes that the SAT- R was developed specifically in response to testing principles it promulgated and that the new test " adds significant gains in predictive power of first year grades at UC . "
Nonetheless , BOARS is now recommending that students forgo the SAT in favor of the less - popular ACT .
Both tests have been accepted for more than 30 years and do a good job of predicting first - year grades .
So why is BOARS now signaling preference for one test over another ?
After reading the report , it 's hard to come away without feeling that the real target is standardized testing in general .
As numerous studies and the raw data on test scores have shown , performance on standardized tests varies not just between individuals but also between different racial and ethnic groups .
In general , black and Latino students perform less well as a group than do white and Asian students .
Since BOARS is committed to boosting the number of black and Latino students admitted to the UC system , standardized tests that do not produce politically correct results are a problem .
It 's not too far - fetched to wonder whether BOARS ' effort to discourage students from taking the SAT may be the first step in getting rid of standardized tests altogether .
But getting rid of standardized tests is not the way to solve the problem of underperforming black and Latino students .
Standardized tests , whether they be the SAT or state tests taken to assess elementary and secondary school performance required by the No Child Left Behind Act , merely document the skills gap that exists between whites and Asians on the one hand and blacks and Latinos on the other .
The answer is n't fixing the tests to produce more even results between racial groups but improving the skills of those students who lag behind .
In 1996 , voters in California did away with racial preferences in college admissions to state schools by enacting Proposition 209 .
Since then , many administrators in the UC system have tried to figure out a backdoor way to boost admissions of blacks and Latinos to the university 's flagship schools , UC Berkley and UCLA .
What they 've failed to notice is that black and Latino enrollment system - wide is up over the levels when racial preferences were common .
The students now enrolled under more race - neutral standards are doing just fine , graduating in higher percentages than they were when racial preferences admitted many students to campuses where they could n't compete with their peers because their grades and test scores were substantially lower .
Eliminating standardized tests or dumbing down their contents does n't help anyone .
It simply sweeps evidence of academic disparities under the rug , where they can't be dealt with .
If California really wants to improve education for all its students , it will work to keep high standards in place and encourage students to test what they have learned .
California students prefer the SAT to other standardized tests , judging by the numbers who take this test now .
BOARS ' job should be to encourage students to make their own choices about which test they prefer , not to pick one test over another -- but most of all not to discourage the use of standardized tests altogether in the hopes of promoting greater diversity .
So far , the use of controlled nuclear fusion has been beyond the technical capabilities of humans .
However , this team of international scientists has produced computer models that indicate nuclear fusion is possible with a fuel source of hydrogen ( H ) / boron - 11 ( B ) and high - tech laser systems recently developed .
They say that nuclear fusion is possible and some day could produce clean , sustainable electricity from nuclear power sources without radioactivity .
It might become more possible to achieve and come about quicker using the process that they suggest .
The scientists behind this research and important announcement are : '¢ Australian scientist Heinrich Hora ( Department of Theoretical Physics , University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia ) ; '¢ American scientist George H. Miley ( Department of Nuclear , Plasma and Radiological Engineering , University of Illinois , Urbana , Illinois , U.S.A. ) ; '¢ Iranian scientists M. Ghoranneviss , B. Malekynia , and N. Azizi ( all from Plasma Physics Research Centre , Science and Research Branch , I. A. University , Tehran - Poonak , Iran ) and ;'¢ Chinese scientist Xian - Tu. He ( Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics , Beijing , China ) Currently , we are only able to produce electricity from one general type of nuclear power process : nuclear fission , where a nuclear reaction occurs in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts .
The splitting of the nucleus produces large amounts of energy , but also produces a lot of radioactivity in the form of nuclear waste materials .
An example of a nuclear power plant that uses fission to produce electricity is the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station , in Luzerne County , Pennsylvania , United States .
This nuclear power station uses nuclear fission reactions to power electric utility reactors that heat water to produce steam , which then generates electricity .
In addition to land - based nuclear power stations , many submarines and ships use nuclear fission propulsion systems .
Spacecraft have also been sent to deep space with the use of nuclear fission .
Page two continues with more on nuclear fusion and , specifically , with this revised approach to controlling fusion .
However , if we had our choice , scientists and engineers would much rather use nuclear fusion to generate electricity .
Nuclear fusion involves a nuclear reaction in which multiple like - charged atomic nuclei join together ( rather than splitting apart , as in fission ) to form a heavier nucleus .
Such a nuclear process does not produce very much radioactivity ( when compared to fission , which produces a lot ) and it has the potential to be much safer and cleaner than nuclear fission .
These scientists have published a paper , first appearing online on March 23 , 2010 , in the journal Energy and Environmental Science ( Energy Environ .
Sci. , 2010 , DOI : 10.1039/b904609g ) that summarizes their computer modeling work on using nuclear fusion with the use of ultra - high power lasers .
The paper is entitled ' Fusion energy without radioactivity : laser ignition of solid hydrogen - boron ( 11 ) fuel .' They propose that ultra -high power lasers could produce power levels that ''¦ are about 1000 times the power of all the power stations in the USA .'
[ Paper ]
The scientists involved with the study state that the process avoids ' any radioactive radiation above the level of burning coal .'
[ Paper ]
And , they say that the production of such an enormous amount of energy brings about the possibility of developing inertial confinement fusion systems .
Inertial confinement fusion ( ICF ) systems use nuclear fusion reactors to heat and ( often times in the past ) compress an energy source , usually fuel pellets consisting of deuterium and tritium .
Page three continues with more on their paper .
The abstract to their paper states , ' This [ research ] opens the way to new approaches for inertial confinement fusions ( ICF ) that in turn can drastically reduce the laser input energy needed to achieve practical ICF power . ' It goes on to explain , ' The specific approach discussed here involves inducing a fusion burn wave by laser - driven impact of a relatively large block of plasma on the outside of a solid density fusion target . ' And , ' This new method is specifically selected to enable the extremely attractive , but demanding , neutron - free proton - B - 11 fusion that potentially can lead to the long sought goal of an ultra clean fusion power plant .
' The March 24 , 2010 RSC Publishing article ' Nuclear power without radioactivity ' states that , ' Conventionally , the fusion process occurs with deuterium and tritium as fuel .
The fuel is spherically compressed - meaning compression occurs from all directions - with laser irradiation to 1000 times its solid state density .
This ignites the fuel , producing helium atoms , energy and neutrons which cause radiation . ' Compression of fuel takes a lot of energy , which is why other fuels have not been used in the past .
However , these scientists suggest that fusion is possible with another type of fuel '” and compression of the fuel is not needed .
They state in their abstract that , ' Fusion is also possible with hydrogen and boron - 11 , and this could produce cleaner energy as it does not release neutrons .'
( Actually : ( almost ) no neutrons are produced , so ( almost ) no radioactivity results . )
Page four continues with more quotes from the abstract .
In the past , the use of hydrogen and boron - 11 required much more energy in order to initiate the nuclear fusion reaction .
Consequently , this type of fuel has remained less popular with scientists as a power source for nuclear fusion .
That may change in the future because new laser technologies have been recently developed that make hydrogen / boron - 11 more attractive to nuclear scientists .
And both hydrogen and boron - 11 are abundantly found in and around the Earth .
Consequently , this team of scientists , lead by Dr. Hora , from University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia , used computer models to show that new laser technologies have the potential ability to produce ''¦ short but high energy pulses '¦ to ignite hydrogen / boron - 11 fuel using side - on ignition . '
[ RSC Publishing ]
The high - energy pulses could then theoretically be used to crate a ' plasma block ' that produces a ' high - density ion beam . '
And , this ion beam ignites the fuel without it having to be compressed ( which takes a lot of energy ) .
Their paper states , ' This remarkable approach is made possible by using laser pulses of picosecond ( ps ) duration and several petawatt ( PW ) power to burn hydrogen - boron 11 ( H - 11B ) fusion fuels . ' And , ' This fuel uses plentiful light hydrogen ( H ) and the boron isotope 11 ( H - 11B , or alternately termed p - 11B ) reaction which yields energetic charged particles without generating neutrons . '( Remember , neutrons produced means radioactivity is produced , and we do n't want that to occur . )
Compression is n't used because , as the authors explain , ' The usual laser compression developed for burning deuterium - tritium ( DT ) fuel cannot be used for H - 11B because densities of 100 000 times the solid are needed . ' Rather than using fuel compression , the scientists are proposing another technique : side - on ignition .
Page five concludes :
Is this new process something that we can develop tomorrow , or does it have a ways to go ?
The scientists talk about this " side - on ignition " process further in their abstract .
They state , 'Instead , the alternative laser fusion scheme of side - on ignition with uncompressed fuel is proposed to enable ignition of the H - 11B fuel along with PW laser interactions . "
Specifically , " This approach employs a recently discovered laser - plasma interaction technique that uses very high contrast ratio laser pulses ( i.e. pulses nearly free from pre-pulses ) .
Plasma blocks of modest temperature are generated causing highly directed ion current densities above 1010 A cmâˆ ’2 .
This new ignition process is termed ' side - on block ignition ' ' ....'
Dr. Hora explains , '' It was a surprise when we used hydrogen - boron instead of deuterium - tritium .
It was not 100 000 times more difficult , it was only ten times .'
[ RSC Publication ]
This result indicates that using hydrogen - boron - 11 , instead of deuterium - tritium , along with newly developed laser technologies , could be a much better way to eventually produce controlled nuclear fusion .
Within the RSC Publishing article , U.S. nuclear fusion expert Steve Haan , who is with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , in California , is quoted to have said , ''¦ there 's a fair amount of work to do before this technology is at hand . '
The article concludes with the following statement about using this fusion technology tomorrow or even the day after .
It states , ' Hora agrees that much more work is needed to fully understand this radical new approach .
Its achievement will depend on continued advances in laser optics , target physics and power conversion technology . '
On March 15 , 2010 , the mysterious organization called WikiLeaks posted a 2008 analysis of itself from the US Army Counterintelligence Center .
Readers will note that according to the preamble of the document , " Unauthorized Disclosure Subject to Criminal Sanctions . "
This is the seventh and last in a series of articles discussing legal aspects of Internet expression .
On March 15 , 2010 , the mysterious organization called WikiLeaks posted a 2008 analysis of itself from the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Center .
Readers will note that according to the preamble of the document , " Unauthorized Disclosure Subject to Criminal Sanctions . "
The Executive Summary briefly describes the mission of WikiLeaks :
The stated intent of the Wikileaks.org Web site is to expose unethical practices , illegal behavior and wrongdoing within corrupt corporations and oppressive regimes in Asia , the former Soviet bloc , Sub -Saharan Africa and the Middle East .
To do so , the developers of the Wikileaks.org
Web site want to provide a secure forum to where leakers , contributors or whistleblowers from any country can anonymously post or send documentation and other information that exposes corruption or wrongdoing by governments or corporations .
The developers believe that the disclosure of sensitive or classified information involving a foreign government or corporation will eventually result in the increased accountability of a democratic , oppressive or corrupt the government to its citizens .
The report expresses concern that " intentional or unintentional leaking and posting of US Army sensitive or classified information to Wikileaks.org could result in increased threats to DoD personnel , equipment , facilities , or installations . "
The report very properly identifies the site as a potential route for disinformation ( DISINFO ) campaigns and psychological operations ( PSYOP ) .
But it ends with suggestions for destroying the group running the Web site by aggressive investigation and prosecution : " The identification , exposure , or termination of employment of or legal actions against current or former insiders , leakers , or whistleblowers could damage or destroy this center of gravity and deter others from using Wikileaks.org to make such information public . "
Are all governments opposed to electronic whistleblowing ?
The lawmakers of Iceland are n't negative at all : indeed , they are agitating for laws to protect online freedom of speech , as Mark Tran of the Guardian newspaper in England writes in a February 2010 article .
Opposition Members of Parliament ( MP ) are drafting the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative which aims to " task the government with finding ways to strengthen freedom of expression around the world and in Iceland , as well as providing strong protections for sources and whistleblowers .
To this end the legal environment should be explored in such a way that the goals can be defined , and changes to law or new law proposals can be prepared .
The legal environments of other countries should be considered , with the purpose of assembling the best laws to make Iceland a leader of freedoms of expression and information .
We also feel it is high time to establish the first Icelandic international prize : The Icelandic Freedom of Expression Award . "
In another development , Google posted an entry on its corporate blog on March 11 , 2010 entitled , " Recognizing courage , securing online freedom . "
The announcement began as follows :
More than ever , governments around the world are threatening online free expression .
Forty countries have taken measures to limit this freedom , up from only a handful a few years ago .
Google and YouTube services are or have been blocked in 25 of those nations .
On Thursday night in Paris , we took an important step to highlight this crucial issue by sponsoring the first Netizen Prize ( or more elegantly , " Le Prix de Net Citoyen " ) awarded by the Paris - based advocacy group Reporters Without Borders .
And on Friday , March 12 , we 'll be helping highlight the fight for Internet freedom by marking the group 's World Day Against Cyber Censorship on YouTube .
Fittingly , Reporters Without Borders chose to give the first Netizen Prize to the Iranian creators of the Web site Change for Equality , first established in 2006 to fight for changes in laws in Tehran that discriminate against women .
That site has since become a well - known source of information on women 's rights in Iran , documenting arrests of women activists and becoming a rallying point for opponents of the regime .
The fight for freedom on the Internet and for Internet freedom are intertwined .

The people , united , will never be defeated .
Perception of second language speech is easier when it is spoken in the accent of the listener and not in the ' original ' accent of that language , shows a new study from the University of Haifa .
The study was published in the Journal of Psycholinguistic Research .
Many adult schools teaching second languages insist on exposing their students to the languages in their ' original ' accents .
However , this new study , carried out by Dr. Raphiq Ibrahim and Dr. Mark Leikin of the University of Haifa 's Edmond J. Safra Brain Research Center for the Study of Learning Disabilities , Prof. Zohar Eviatar of the Department of Psychology and Prof. Shimon Sapir of the Department of Learning Disabilities , found that this system is not necessarily the best and certainly not the most expeditious .
The present study set out to reveal the level of phonological information that the adult learner requires in order to identify words in a second language that had been learned at a later age , and whether the level of phonological information that they require varies when the words are pronounced in different accents .
The researchers recorded four Hebrew sentences in which the last word was a noun pronounced in a different accent : Hebrew , Arabic , Russian and English .
These sentences were electronically encoded on a computer system and applied to the " gating " paradigm , in which participants are exposed to increasing amounts of a speech stimulus ( 40 milliseconds ) , and at each ' gate ' , are asked to identify the stimulus .
This procedure allows the identification of the point at which a word is recognized .
The sentences were played to 60 participants aged 18 - 26 ; 20 of the participants were native Hebrew speakers ; 20 were new adult immigrants to Israel from the Former Soviet Union who had learned Hebrew only after moving to Israel ; 20 were Israeli Arabic speakers who began learning Hebrew at age 7 - 8 .
The findings show that there is no difference in the amount of phonological information that the native Hebrew speakers need in order to decipher the words , regardless of accent .
With the Russian and Arabic speakers , on the other hand , less phonological information was needed in order to recognize the Hebrew word when it was pronounced in the accent of their native language than when they heard it in the accent of another language .
" This research lays emphasis on the importance of continuing investigation into the cognitive perspectives of accent in order to gain a better understanding of how we learn languages other than our native tongue .
In Israel and in other countries where the population is made up of many different language groups , this understanding holds great significance , " the researchers conclude .
Something strange has been happening over at Adaptive Materials , a fuel cell developer based in Ann Arbor , MI .
During the past few months , as everybody talks about how to get things moving forward in Southeast Michigan , Adaptive has been , well , actually moving forward .
A contract worth a few million from the Department of Defense here , an award worth another few million from the Air Force there , and more money to develop a product for the recreational vehicle market .
And then there ’s the company ’s recent resume - gathering blitz , hiring nine new engineers .
That ’s news in these parts ( the company received an amazing 7,100 resumes for those nine plum jobs ) .
So , I decided to find out what kind of magic is going on over at Adaptive Materials .
I talked to Michelle Crumm , co-founder and chief business officer , and found out that there is no magic happening there at all .
The success is the result of a decade of old - fashioned hard work and building of relationships .
Crumm also tells me that Adaptive just might be a victim of its own success now .
The company made a decision 10 years ago not to seek angel or venture capital funding .
She did not think it was right to use what she calls OPM ( Other People ’s Money ) to fund a “ wild and crazy idea . ”
A decade later , it ’s no longer a wild and crazy idea .
It ’s a business getting ready to move from manufacturing a few hundred units to thousands .
And the company could really use some non-government funding at this point .
Trouble is , they ’re just not wild and crazy enough to attract VC - style investors .
I ’ll let Crumm explain what she means in her own words .
Here ’s an edited transcript of my recent talk with Crumm .
Below is Part 1 .
We ’ll run Part 2 later in the week .
Xconomy : First , let ’s talk about your company , then we can broaden the conversation a little bit .
Can you tell me the “ elevator pitch ” version of what your company does ?
Michelle Crumm : Adaptive Materials started 10 years ago , and we ’ve been focused on solid oxide fuel cells development .
So , we ’re an alternative energy development company .
Our focus is portable power .
In our early stage , we were primarily focused on military portable power for soldiers .
Early successes in those programs , in the early 2000s , led us to getting to other power ranges — enough to power robots and airplanes .
So we provide [ products ] to “ eyes - in - the - sky . ”
They get more power when they ’re flying unmanned aerial vehicles and longer duration capabilities when they have robots in the field .
So , to protect them from IEDs [ Improvised Explosive Devices ] , they can send robots out .
About 12 hours is our most recent demonstration .
So , about 10X longer mission for a robot in the field than a battery .
X : Is that being used in the field now ?
MC : We have a small number of units out in different locations throughout the world for unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles .
X : From what I ’ve heard , there ’s more of an emphasis on small , portable robotics in Afghanistan because of the mountainous terrain .
MC : Exactly .
That ’s been significant , just the change between the two wars .

When I was an undergraduate at Boston College in the 1970s , one of the weekly underground newspapers that catered to the 250,000 college students in the Boston metropolitan area featured a page length ad by the left - wing graduate economic students of the Boston chapter of URPE ( Union of Radical Political Economists ) .
The ad appealed to the college students of Boston to withdraw all the cash from their checking and saving accounts the following Friday as a protest against the Vietnam War .
Being an economics major and neophyte Austrian , I realized that such an action would cause severe difficulties for the banks , because they only held ( at the time ) about 13 cents of every dollar of demand deposits and 3 cents of every dollar of saving deposits in the form of cash .
The rest of the deposits were lent out for longer or shorter periods of time despite the fact that the banks had contractually obligated themselves to redeem the entire amount on demand .
There was much discussion of such an action on the BC and other Boston campuses during the week leading up to the planned mass action .
Of course , when Friday rolled around the event fizzled , because students were too busy partying ( Thursday being the unofficial start of the weekend ) .
But the idea was a brilliant one .
Murray Rothbard never tired of pointing out that in a free society plain citizens could bring inflationary fractional reserve banks to heel through a deliberate and concerted campaign to get people to withdraw their deposits in cash .
“ Antibank Leagues , ” as he called them , would be formed by those “ who know the truth about the real insolvency of the banking system ” to “ urge bank runs . ”
The bank runs or their very threat would “ be able to stop and reverse monetary expansion . ”
What Has Government Done to Our Money pp. 47 -48 .
Now we have the first stirrings of the formation of such a league in the Move Your Money campaign .
This modest but growing movement is urging people to move their money from big banks to small community banks and credit unions .
Establishment media such as Time , Newsweek , The Nation , Salon and CBS News have already taken note of the campaign .
The organizers are urging people to lobby their friends , organizations , and municpal governments to move their money and to use online social networks to propagate the idea .
The organizers of the Move Your Money campaign of course are superficially focused on the fact that big banks and financial institutions were at the eye of the recent financial storm .
They do not understand that it is the entire system of fractional reserve banking , which has been cartelized , regulated and bailed out by the Federal Reserve System for nearly a century , that is mainly at fault for the financial meltdown .
Still , the idea underlying Move Your Money is a sound one that needs to be expanded to include mass deposit withdrawal from all banks .
Depositors have more power over banks than customers have over normal businesses in a market economy .
The reason is that banks are permitted by law today to hold only about ten percent of demand deposits and zero percent of so - called “ saving ” deposits in reserve , even though they are contractually obligated to redeem these deposits in cash whenever the depositor requests .
( In fact , very little of even its “ cash ” reserves is held in actual cash in a bank ’s vault and ATMs ; most of its reserves has only a virtual existence as a digital credit entry on the bank ’s reserve deposit account recorded in the computers of its regional Federal Reserve Bank ) .
Thus the banking system would not be able to withstand a concerted campaign to withdraw cash and the Fed would have to shut down the banking system ( including ATMs ) to sort things out .
It would take months , if not longer , before the Fed could print up and deliver sufficient quantities of cash to the banks to meet all of their depositors ’ demands in full .
In the meantime cash withdrawals might be limited to small quantities biweekly or monthly as occurred in Argentina during the last meltdown of the peso in 2000 - 2001
So the weapon to thwart inflation and deficit spending and by extension socialized health care and imperialist wars is at last partially unsheathed and in the grasp of American citizens .
Let us wish the Move Your Money campaign success and nudge its economic knowledge and political ideology in the right direction .

Santiago , Chile ( CNN ) --
Aid poured in for Chile from home and overseas , with a local television station hoping to raise $ 27 million by Saturday and the United Nations pledging funds toward recovery efforts after a massive earthquake .
" Chile Helps Chile , " a telethon that started Friday , runs until Saturday night , according to TV Chile 's Web site .
The site includes phone numbers and and e-mails for making donations in nearly 20 countries outside the South American nation .
Hundreds of people died when the 8.8 - magnitude earthquake struck Chile last Saturday .
The world 's fifth - strongest earthquake since 1900 resulted in a tsunami that toppled buildings , particularly in the Maule region along the coast .
It 's still unclear exactly how many people died .
Army divers have been searching the waters near the city of Constitucion for the bodies of as many as 400 tourists who were camping on an island during a summer festival .
" There were horrible screams .
People calling out for us to go and rescue them .
They were crying for help .
But there was nothing we could do , " local fisherman Agustin Diaz said .
Full coverage of Chile 's earthquake
United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon on Friday pledged up to $ 10 million to support relief and recovery efforts during a two - day visit , where he met with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet .
" I am visiting this city with a deep sadness , " Ban told reporters Saturday while in Concepcion .
" Standing before this destruction , I can feel for your loss , your struggle .
" At the same time I am very grateful , very moved by such a strong determination , " he added .
" The leaders , the people on the ground , they are all united . "
Ban also announced Friday a team effort between U.N. agencies and the Chilean government to determine the priority areas for funds , with emphasis on health , shelters , education and water .
The secretary - general plans to bring the matter in front of the United Nations on his return .
Chileans proud to help out their own
The Chilean government has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities , dialysis centers , generators , saltwater purifying systems , mobile bridges and field kitchens .
Chile endured two more strong aftershocks Friday -- the first a 6.0 - magnitude earthquake and the other 6.6 .
They were the latest in scores of aftershocks that have hit in the past week .
Friday 's aftershocks did not cause any known injuries or damage and no tsunami warnings were issued .
A six -member U.S. Agency for International Development disaster response team has been sent to Chile to assist with relief effort , said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley .
Shocking scenes hours after quake
The United States has sent 71 satellite phones , plastic sheeting and two mobile water treatment units , the State Department said .
Six more water treatment units are to arrive within a week .
A field hospital and two C - 130 aircraft to assist with moving supplies around the country have also been deployed .
The United States has also sent $ 1 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to aid their efforts .
Chile has announced three days of national mourning beginning Sunday .
Every house has been authorized to hang the national flag in memory of those who perished .

The death toll was revised downward Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of dead in the Maule region .
To limit confusion , Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans whose bodies had been identified by Thursday evening .
The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims .
" It takes months sometimes to compile the information , because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene , " Rosende said .
Despite the disaster , the Chilean Davis Cup tennis team will open competition Saturday in Coquimbo , Chile , against Israel .
Team officials and players said they would be playing in honor of quake victims .
" It will be difficult , but we will do our best for our country , " said player Fernando Gonzalez .

What is this ?
This is a roller coaster simulation of the last 35 years of the Vancouver Real Estate market .
The actual graph you ’re riding is the inflation adjusted value of a house in Vancouver BC based on data collected by Royal LePage and calculated by the UBC Centre for Urban Economics and Real Estate .
Some of the peaks and troughs have been rounded to keep the train from flying off the tracks , but other than that slight modification it is a precise scale model of the red line on this graph .
Because this is a coaster simulation gravity makes the downturns go by quickly .
I suspect they may not have felt that fast to people who owed more on homes than they were worth and had to sell for financial , health or family reasons .
There ’s been a lot of talk in the media lately about a Canadian Housing Bubble , the bubbliest market of them all being right here on the west coast .
There are many people whose livelihoods depend on real estate sales that will tell you that it ’s different here and that we wo n’t see a US - style housing market crash .
Perhaps we got that out of our system in the early 80’s , but before you place a large bet on that possibility you may want to do some additional research .
Housing bubbles hurt families and damage the economy .
Here are a few high - res stills of the coaster environment :
Newt Gingrich , the former Speaker of the House , is a reader — and something of a postmodern interpreter — of the works of Albert Camus and George Orwell .
A few days before President Obama ’s big health - care “ summit , ” Gingrich addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference .
He cited Camus ’s “ The Plague , ” summarizing its message with Jack Nicholsonian authoritativeness : “ The authorities ca n’t stand the truth . ”
His discussion of Orwell was more narrowly targeted .
The message of “ 1984 , ” he explained , is
that centralized planning inherently leads to dictatorship , which is why having a secular socialist machine try to impose government - run health care in this country is such a significant step away from freedom and away from liberty , and towards a government - dominated society .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Orwell ’s position on the House and Senate health - care bills is unknown , but , like Camus , he was a lifelong democratic socialist ( he was a member of the Independent Labour Party , which regarded regular Labourites as wishy - washy ) and , as such , a big fan of government - run health care .
Confusion about who is and who is not a socialist and what is and what is not socialism was endemic at C - PAC , as the conference ’s participants affectionately call it .
“ The hope and change the Democrats had in mind was nothing more than a retread of the failed and discredited socialist policies that have been the enemy of freedom for centuries all over the world , ” Senator Jim DeMint , of South Carolina , said , adding , in a reference to the President , “ Just because you are good on TV does n’t mean you can sell socialism to freedom - loving Americans . ”
Representative Steve King , of Iowa , listed the enemy within : “ They are liberals , they are progressives , they are Che Guevarians , they are Castroites , they are socialists . ”
Then he mentioned a few more key segments of the Democratic coalition , including , besides Trotskyites , Maoists , Stalinists , and Leninists , “ Gramsci - ites — ring anybody ’s bell ? ”
Strictly speaking , that should be Gramscians , followers of Antonio Gramsci , the Italian Communist Party leader of the nineteen - twenties .
Ding - dong !
To be fair , C - PAC is a gathering of the tribe — “ our Woodstock , ” one speaker called it — so a certain amount of nude dancing in the rhetorical mud is mandatory .
Outside the conservative confab ’s comfy confines , the Party ’s pols were more restrained during the days leading up to the marathon conversation that Obama convened last Thursday .
But they made it fairly clear that they were in no mood to be “ bipartisan ” or in any way make themselves complicit in something that could be construed as an accomplishment ( let alone a victory ) for Obama and the Democrats .
“ You know , ” John Boehner , the House Republican leader , said on Wednesday , “ we ’ve asked the President all year to scrap this big government - takeover bill and let ’s start with a clean sheet of paper . ”
On Thursday , any lingering doubts were removed .
By way of describing their demand , Republican speakers used the words “ scrap , ” “ start over , ” and “ clean sheet of paper ” twenty times .
In other words : unconditional surrender .
“ Perhaps more people would give heed unto the word of the Lord if the Lord had a funny blog . ”

The summit consisted of seven and a half hours of jabber divided among thirty - eight members of Congress and three Administration officials , every one of whom had to have at least one turn .
Therefore , as anyone who watched it all ( or as much of it as attending to bodily needs and psychic balance allowed ) can attest , it was stupefying — as stupefying , perhaps , as the twenty - seven - hundred - page health - care bill itself , a foot - high copy of which the Republicans brought along as a prop .
Yet , like that bill , its individual components were frequently worth the trouble .
The discussion produced no compromises — it was a debate , not a negotiation — but it was clarifying .
The Democrats made it clear that they intend to cover the uninsured before another lifetime or two elapses ; the Republicans made it equally clear that they do not .
“ We just ca n’t afford this , ” Eric Cantor , the House Republican whip , said , adding dismissively , “ In a perfect world , everyone would have everything they want . ”
But , even when the two sides seemed to agree on a particular goal , the similarities were irreconcilable , so to speak .
For example , both sides say that they favor making it impossible for people with “ preëexisting conditions ” to be refused insurance .
Obviously , this ca n’t be done by simply ordering insurance companies to accept such people .
Too many of the young and healthy , knowing that they could n’t be refused , would wait to buy insurance until they got sick ; the ranks of the insured would grow thinner and sicker , and premiums would balloon .
Without the universal or near - universal coverage that Democrats support , just telling insurance companies that they must accept everyone becomes another way of distributing health care by ability to pay .
We have enough of that already .
Segregating the sick into “ high - risk pools ” — the oxymoronic Republican solution — has generally flopped in states where it has been tried .
A similar logic holds for allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines , another point of nominal bipartisan agreement .
Without the sort of standards that Democrats want and Republicans do n’t , those among the young , the healthy , and the poor who bought insurance at all would choose the cheapest , skimpiest policies from companies in the least regulated states , leaving people who need the kind of insurance many of us are lucky enough to have in shrinking pools with increasingly unaffordable premiums — the “ race to the bottom ” that the Democrats kept talking about .
In his opening remarks at the summit , Senator Lamar Alexander , of Tennessee , borrowing a favorite gibe from Mitch McConnell , the Senate Minority Leader , said that if the Democrats decline to abandon their attempt at comprehensive reform “ the only thing bipartisan will be the opposition to the bill . ”
In one sense , Alexander was right : all the supporters of health - care reform in Congress are Democrats , while the opposition consists of both Republicans and Democrats .
The Republicans have become — monolithically , on this is - sue and many others — the party of the right .
The Democrats are the party of the center - left .
The congressional center , in other words , consists entirely of Democrats , many of whom hold seats that once belonged to liberal Republicans , a breed that conservatives of both parties have hunted to extinction .
But in another sense Alexander was wrong : the Democrats ’ bill more closely resembles Richard Nixon ’s health - care proposal — the one that Ted Kennedy went to his grave regretting he had n’t embraced — than it does Bill Clinton ’s , to say nothing of Harry Truman’s .
Nor are all its Republican features archeological .
“ Our bill contains over a hundred and forty - seven distinct Republican amendments , ” Senator Tom Harkin , of Iowa , reminded his summit colleagues .
The health - care reform bill — which , despite everything , is still alive — is an ambitious piece of legislation , however modest it may be by the measure of the rest of the developed world .
Ideologically and substantively , it is centrist .
It has Republicans , and Republicanism , in its family tree .
For better or for worse , it ’s already bipartisan .
Gramsci would not be pleased . ♦

Virtualisation has already proven its worth in delivering cost savings through server consolidation and better use of resources .
Greater use of the technology across server infrastructures , in other areas of the IT stack , and at the desktop is widely anticipated .
The uptake of Software - as - a- Service applications such as salesforce.com , and the success of IT service outsourcing demonstrate how centralised remote computing approaches can also provide more efficient ways to deliver technology resources to users , helping cloud computing to gain greater buy - in from corporate decision - makers .
Why should security professionals be concerned ?
According to research from Gartner , around 16 % of all servers within enterprise IT environments are now virtualised , and the firm expects this to increase to around 50 % by 2012 .
The market leader in this space , VMware , now has over 150,000 customers .
Microsoft 's virtualisation product Hyper - V is effectively free with the latest version of Windows Server , encouraging take - up of the technology and making it more accessible to the smaller business .
With any technology that is growing in importance to enterprises of all sizes , it is expected that malware writers will attempt to attack the virtualised environments , either to hijack workloads or steal critical data .
An example of how virtualisation is being considered alongside security is the Payment Card Industry 's Data Security Standard , where a Special Interest Group has been set up to discuss the role of virtualisation within retailers ’ networks , as well as how this has an impact on protecting credit and debit card payment data .
There are three main attack targets on a virtualised environment :
The virtual machine workload , which will consist of an OS , applications and data , similar to a traditional server workload ;
The hypervisor itself ;
The management APIs that are used to control the virtual machines and integrate with other IT management products .
For the security team , the biggest issue facing them is often not being involved in the implementation of virtualisation in the first place .
As this technology has often started life in test and QA environments , it has not been part of security 's remit .
As the use of virtualisation spreads into more production environments , security has to be a core concern .
This includes evaluating business continuity aspects , as the proportion of workloads affected by an outage or virus attack will be much higher in a consolidated environment .
The first consideration is that traditional security skills are being applied to the virtualisation environment .
This can be more difficult , as virtual machines can move around the IT estate as business demands and workload priorities evolve .
The emphasis has to be on planning and awareness of the possibilities that this shifting environment represents .
Keeping the virtual and physical network traffic separated through use of VLANs is the first step , followed by implementing intrusion prevention and firewall systems that can monitor and inspect traffic between the virtual machine host servers .
For organisations that are looking at desktop virtualisation , rolling out anti-virus within the guest machines is still a necessary step , even though virtualising the session makes any patching or virus clean - up much easier and faster .
The next consideration is how virtualisation can potentially improve security planning and execution .
As virtual machines are isolated environments , it makes it easier to run multi-tenant environments where separation is required , even on the same hardware .
This is particularly useful for managed service providers , where virtualisation allows them to host more customers on the same amount of physical kit .
New approaches to security in a virtualised environment
Hardened virtual appliances , which are purpose - built virtual machines for a specific task , are also becoming more popular with organisations , as they can help the security function to benefit from the same results around virtualisation as the rest of the business .
A research report from IDC in December 2009 stated that virtual security appliance budget allocations will continue to grow over the next year to 18 months , as the total cost of ownership results are better than using separate point software products or dedicated hardware .
The other area where new approaches to security are being considered is the cloud .
Cloud computing can mean different things to different people , but the most common definition is using the internet to deliver a reliable service to users , where the amount of that service can be scaled up or down depending on demand .
This flexibility , coupled with a ' pay - as - you - go ' billing model , makes it attractive to organisations where capital expenditure is heavily reduced or where it is hard to get budget sign off .
The potential for cloud computing is huge , as it can make IT service delivery more efficient and cost - effective .
However the cloud faces several major hurdles , the biggest of which is around security .
As data will be moving out of the company 's direct control , security and privacy concerns are significant , especially in those industries where regulations on data retention and ownership are in place .
Establishing the cloud as a trustworthy platform for the business will be an ongoing concern , no matter how attractive the potential savings .
The biggest issue to remember is that all the data involved is yours .
Even though it may be residing on another company ’s storage , it is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that it remains secure .
Due diligence on the cloud provider and continually asking questions about how your partner or potential provider keeps their network secure is essential .
Visiting the data centre personally can be another step in building trust .
If moving completely into the cloud does not suit the business , then taking a trusted partner that can manage the systems on your premises remotely can be a suitable ‘ halfway house ’ that can deliver the cost benefits of full cloud , while retaining some control .
Software - as - a- Service providers have already made some headway in demonstrating how trust and security around data can be gained .
As this process continues to gather steam , security providers are also looking at how the cloud can make procedures more efficient .
Examples of where cloud - based services can be effective include email archiving and web security , as the value for the organisation is in managing the process efficiently , rather than hosting the products or service on - site .
As organisations roll out further virtualised infrastructures or move their workloads into private and / or public cloud environments , the security team has to be involved in establishing best practices around these shifts in strategy .
What virtualisation and cloud can provide to the business in tandem with security is more efficient management and automation of non-critical IT functions .
In an age where IT resources are more stretched than ever before and the pressure is on to deliver better results on static budgets , this represents a significant opportunity to deliver the results that businesses need in order to remain competitive .
As these technologies move into production , the right security planning can ensure that the use of virtualisation or cloud computing actually deliver the promised benefits .

New information says violent drug cartel shoot - outs in Mexico have killed nearly 23,000 people since 2006 , and tourism is tanking .
The government ’s response ?
It ’s thinking of banning Twitter and Facebook , because criminals are using it to communicate and avoid military raids .
In the government ’s defense , the cartels are using Twitter not only for communication with each other , but for intimidating the public .
As Time reports :
Recently in the bloody border town of Reynosa , people associated with one cartel used tweets to terrorize Reynosa by posting messages that created panic among residents and halted normal activities as the threats circulated online .
One such message read , “ The largest scheduled shootout in the history of Reynosa will be tomorrow or Sunday , send this message to people you trust that tomorrow a convoy of 60 trucks full of cartel hitmen from the Michoacan Family together with members of the Gulf Cartel are coming to take the city and take everyone out alive or dead ! ”
Schools and shops closed that day .
To complicate matters further , in an attempt to stop cartel members from using cell phones for illegal business , the Mexican government has required all of its 83.5 million cell phone users to register their accounts or face losing service .
Only 71 % of the accounts were registered when the deadline passed earlier this week , but the government said it would extend the deadline further so as not to disconnect users .
While the government ’s concern with cartel communication is understandable , Twitter and cell phones are survival tools for civilians .
In Reynosa , just across the border from McAllen , Texas , locals used Twitter ( especially hashtags ) to tell fellow residents which streets were currently most dangerous or ask for safety advice .
“ We use Twitter to protect ourselves as citizens , ” a 17 - year - old Reynosa resident , who asked to remain anonymous , told CNN .
“ The governor tells us it ’s our psychosis , but at night the city is empty .
The authorities here practically do n’t exist . ”
The government ’s absence in towns plagued by cartel violence has become painfully clear , as evidenced by a recently leaked video that shows a massacre in the Mexican mountain town of Creel .
In the video , government security forces stand around while cartel gunmen take over Creel , killing eight people in the process .
Since January 2010 , cartel violence has killed 3,365 people .
A local priest said that any sizable security forces did n’t arrive in town until hours after the murders , and then they just looked around and left .
Some have speculated that the police did nothing because they could n’t : they were outnumbered , and the narcotraficantes had superior firepower and bullet - proof vehicles .
But with murders increasing ( just yesterday , a policeman was shot and a woman and her eight - year - old daughter were killed in Acapulco ) , standing around is n’t an option .
McDonnell withdraws from wind energy coalition
Gov. Bob McDonnell said this week that he recently withdrew his support from the Governors '
Wind Energy Coalition after the group sent out a letter expressing support for a national renewable electricity standard with his name without his permission .
" They sent out a letter with my name on it that I did n't approve , never saw .
That 's the problem , '' McDonnell said .
" Secondly , the contents of the letter said that all the governors that were signatories were supportive of a mandatory ( renewable energy standard ) that I am not .
So that 's the problem . "
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met Atlantic Coast governors in February to talk about wind energy and McDonnell joined his wind energy consortium .
" I really want to pursue wind energy , '' McDonnell said .
" I think it 's a great option for us here in Virginia .
We have some of the highest quality winds anywhere in the country .
Virginia Beach is supportive of it .
This is a tremendous opportunity for us to have -- when you get the infrastructure paid -- a no-cost source of energy but it 's going to take a lot of regulatory work to get it done .
I 'm 100 percent behind quickly exploring the possibility of getting a wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach . "
As the United States searches for ways to lessen its dependency on foreign oil , wind energy is getting a second look in states such as Virginia that had not embraced it .
McDonnell said he supports a voluntary -- not mandatory -- renewable energy standard .
" What I do n't want is one , people sending out letters without my approval that say I 'm supporting something that I 'm not so that 's the problem , '' he said .
" They very apologetic .
They know they did it . "
Read the letter
Even the most accomplished , brilliant screenplays are , by definition , unfinished works , as they require a director ’s vision to be made whole .
Consequently , what you are writing is a written document first , which , God willing , will find its way into the hands of enthusiastic P.W.M.s ( People With Money ) .
You , as the screenwriter , must find a way not only to tell a story , but also to present that story in an engaging narrative style from page one .
1. COMMAND THE READ .
You must develop your voice and attitude as off - screen narrator to lead your reader by the hand through the entire script .
Without mentioning the camera or using any other cinematographic language , find a way to “ direct ” your movie on the page .
Your goal is to make your incomplete movie a complete , satisfying read .
Excise all unnecessary verbiage ; save your purple prose for that novel you keep meaning to write .
Brevity is the soul of wit — and the art and craft of screenwriting ; keep it lean and mean .
Film is a visual medium , so a good rule of thumb for screenwriters is :
If an audience ca n’t see it or hear it , do n’t write it .
Remember , you ’re catering to readers ( producers , development executives , agents , managers ) who take home piles of scripts every weekend .
Once you have their eyes on page 1 , do n’t lose them with a dull , flat , predictable style .
Yes , the story must absolutely rivet them .
But so must the manner in which you tell the story .
Never underestimate the value of the entertaining read .
If they get bored , it ’s your fault , not theirs .
2. DEFY THE FORMULA .
By now , everybody has read all the screenwriting books and knows just what to expect in terms of “ inciting incidents , ” “ plot points , ” “ midpoints ” and all that structural jazz .
As a result , screenplays have become formulaic , structurally predictable and mechanical .
You might say , “ Your plot points are showing . ”
Structure needs to be seamless , invisible .
You need to defy your readers ’ expectations of What Happens Next , both plot - wise and structure - wise .
What this means is , your plot points must unfold in new and surprising ways .
Readers crave neatness , symmetry , the tying up of loose ends .
Never give them what they want .
Guide your readers through your plot by constantly dangling a carrot in front of their faces .
Each scene must present unfinished business that cries out to be completed — but is n’t .
End your scenes on discordant notes , so your reader is compelled to turn the page and read the scene after it , and the scene after that .
Readers yearn for resolution , order .
Life is about compromise , mystery , wonder , constant change .
If you give your readers tidy , ordered structure , they ’ll be disappointed because it wo n’t feel organic .
Life is messy and unpredictable .
You must structure your stories to create the feeling that virtually anything could happen next .
Your readers will not be comfortable with this approach — which is exactly your intent .
When we feel too comfortable , we get restless and bored .
We want to be surprised and even shocked by movies , or we may as well stay at home in our Barcaloungers and be remote control zombies .
How do you keep your story structurally surprising ?
By focusing on your characters ’ relationships to structure .
Your “ plot points ” emerge as crises for your characters because they force your characters to change , and while each crisis presented in your screenplay should be surprising , your characters ’ unique and very specific approach to crisis management is what keeps your reader hooked — not the crisis itself .
3. DIG AS DEEPLY INTO YOUR CHARACTERS AS POSSIBLE , THEN GO DEEPER .
Shallow people are boring and do n’t deserve to have movies written about them .
You ’ll need to do a character autopsy .
Really roll up your sleeves and get in touch with what makes your characters tick at their core .
Ask yourself :
– Does my protagonist ’s character contain a CORE CONTRADICTION ?
Indelibly memorable , iconic characters are always flawed , walking paradoxes .
Scarlett O’Hara is both tough and vulnerable , staunchly independent and needy .
Hannibal Lecter is both destructive and instructive , monster and mentor .
The Woody Allen archetype is both nerdy schlub and sexual dynamo , whip - smart and self - destructively neurotic .
Indiana Jones is both brave adventurer and bowtied academic who ’s afraid of snakes .
It ’s these kinds of contradictions that magnetically draw us in .
Enigmatic characters are puzzles that need to be solved along with the central mystery of the plot ( another essential ingredient to a successful screenplay ) .
– How are my characters DESPERATE ?
Character desperation is a double - edged sword .
That is , your characters ( like most human beings ) are terrified of change .
They ’d rather live their lives of quiet desperation than make a change .
No matter how unfulfilled , most people would rather live the illusion of “ happiness ” than pursue their dreams .
No matter how miserable , most people are desperate to keep things As They Are .
On the other hand , your characters also are desperate to rid themselves of their guilt , wounds , clutter , rigidity , fears .
Both diametrically opposed forms of Desperation must ( and will ) come to the forefront in the course of your screenplay .
This will generate inner turmoil that will provide your characters with more than just one level of conflict in any given scene .
Ah , drama .
– How are my characters ingenious RISK TAKERS ?
Desperation will ( hopefully ) lead your characters to find an active way out of a crisis .
It requires them to become proactive — which is good .
Better yet , be sure to limit their choices .
These limited choices stem only partially from the external circumstances ; an equally important component to your characters ’ limited choices is mandated by who they are .
As in life , there are often an infinite number of choices that can be made at any given time — but it ’s who we are that dictates which of those choices are available to us .
Character backstory has everything to do with who , what , when , where and why your characters do everything , plot - wise .
If you ca n’t credibly justify how to get your character to , say , plot point two — do n’t force it !
Ask yourself how your unique , specific character ’s ingenuity might organically unfold to lead him to your plot point .
Do n’t lead your characters around by the plot .
Rather , have your plot unfold in a way that ’s tailor - made to your characters .
When you know your characters inside and out , you probably wo n’t be so confounded by all the choices you have to make as a writer .
You ’ll know where you want to take them , but due to their uniqueness , you ’ll only be able to get them there in a way that ’s unique and specific to them .
– How do my characters find EMOTIONAL RELEASE ?
In Depth of Character terms , “ release ” is about healing , which occurs via the release of the “ old self ” ( that was desperately afraid to change ) and the emergence of the New Self .
When this New Self emerges , your characters have learned to accept the external circumstances of their lives because they ’ve learned to accept themselves .
This is the escape from all the clutter and uncertainty of the illusion that had given rise to the old , desperate self .
Incidentally , this so - called “ New Self ” was there all along , but hidden under a self - imposed cloud of illusions and clutter .
Blinded by fear .
The New Self that emerges is by no means perfect or fearless , but is definitely stronger and ( finally ) able to see the world more clearly — for better or worse .
Often this will give rise to a whole new perspective on life , or , perhaps , simply a new appreciation of the old perspective .
4. TAKE THE TIME TO LET THE DETAILS ACCUMULATE .
Find ways to crystallize behavior so it ’s succinct , visual , specific .
The best exposition , a ) does n’t read like exposition ; b ) is economical .
The better you know your characters , the fewer pages it will take you to convey them to your reader .
It ’s in the small details .
Expressing these details on the page is n’t about quantity ; it ’s about choosing which details to show that will most efficiently get your readers under a character ’s skin .
Once your readers understand what makes your characters tick on a deep , existential level , they may just follow them anywhere .
They ’ll be hooked .
Putting government documents and data online is a great step towards making our government process more transparent to the people it serves , but in many ways simply making the material available is like serving someone dinner by giving them a pond full of fish .
The pond is huge and the poor dinner guest does n’t have any tools .
Worse , they ’re only looking for one particular bass , and every time someone sends them to where they last saw the fish it ’s long gone .
The recent healthcare bill was more than 1,000 pages long .
The budget can often be half again that big .
Commenting on these types of documents as they are currently implemented is extremely challenging .
Pointing a finger at that big pond and telling someone that you swear you saw a fish is n’t very effective .
It ’s even worse when someone swears they saw a fish that is n’t really there and it is effective because no one is willing to refute them .
No one has time to wade around themselves and so they take it on faith .
The recent “ killing grandma ” scare is an excellent example .
Citations , first , are a way of pointing at the fish .
A simple paragraph level of granularity for references should be enough .
This promotes ease of implementation and use and provides a tight enough zoom to bring someone right to the material being discussed .
The next problem is that fish move .
If you ’re trying to point out a moving fish , and show it to someone later , you need to have a photograph with a timestamp .
That line in the budget about forcing our children to manufacture chemical weapons might have moved to page three the next day , or a wily senator may have changed the wording and put it under a different heading .
Proper citability requires an archived snapshot of the online material that maintains the integrity of any reference links .
Lastly , for someone to believe you about this fish , you need to have a way of pointing out where you saw it at the specified time .
They ’ll want to know it was the same pond .
Making it possible to create timestamped permalinks at a paragraph level of granularity would be a huge leap forward in increasing government transparency through its online documents .
The same principles apply when producing citable government data .
When recovery.org decided to display visual representations of the data coming in about recovery money around the nation , it quickly became clear that some amount of data was erroneous .
When the errors were reported and the data was later modified , there was n’t any way to go back and compare the two versions to see what changes had taken place .
A blogger , reporter , statistician or scientist should be able to run a query against any specific collection of government data , as it was published , for a given version or moment in time .
WHAT WE’RE DOING
The nonprofit , nonpartisan League of Technical Voters has proposed a simple , easy to build and implement citability solution .
Open source software development is underway and a wide range of government institutions are already on board .

One of my first stops every morning is Economist Robin Hanson 's blog Overcoming Bias .
In Hanson 's own words , the subject matter is " ... honesty , signaling , disagreement , forecasting , and the far future . "
Hanson 's depth of posting is impressive -- he discusses psychology , philosophy , economics , bias , fallacy , markets , science and the human condition .
One of his posts from last year has stuck with me for awhile now as it applies to most things we discuss on a daily basis .
The post , " Who Will Fight Group Think " , does not discuss hockey , but it has an over - reaching message that applies to most of the subjects written about here and elsewhere throughout the Oilogosphere .
Hanson quotes Nickolas Wade from TierneyLab discussing Groupthink :
Conformity and group - think are attitudes of particular danger in science , an endeavor that is inherently revolutionary because progress often depends on overturning established wisdom …
Vic Ferrari has talked about Roger Neilson 's impact on coaching and the game in general .
Neilson was an innovator that turned the game on it's ear by tracking all of that stuff that was going on between goals and penalties .
While some , like the dashing Gabriel Desjardins of Behind The Net Hockey , argue that " hockey teams , by and large , do know what they are doing " ( I have my doubts ) , hockey fans , on the other hand , are generally a clueless lot , especially when it comes to the inner- workings of the game .
Most fans do n't have access to the video libraries that NHL teams do , and even the fans that have DVR technology do n't use it .
Fans , by and large , rely on what they see , and make snap decisions based on short bursts of data .
From the time that decision is made , a fan will see what they expect to see , that is , they begin to notice the events and data that confirm the observations that led to their conclusion .
They begin to seek new information to confirm their pre-existing bias , subconsciously ignoring the entire data set , especially the pieces that disagree with their conclusion .
In psychology and cognitive science , this is known as confirmation bias .
In the world of sports fans , confirmation biases abound .
It 's impossible for individual fans to record , catalog , process , analyze and interpret the results of hundreds of independent events occurring constantly throughout a game , but it 's much easier to pick out those events and sequences of events that support their conclusions .
Any hockey fan that has sat silently shaking their head while the crowd piles on an undeserving player recognizes this immediately .
It 's a powerful psychological force , especially in a setting like sports .
Fans can confirm their biases for themselves and immediately fall back on thousands , sometimes hundreds of thousands of fellow fans to confirm what they already know .
This is the very foundation of groupthink :
Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that can occur in groups of people .
Rather than critically evaluating information , the group members begin to form quick opinions that match the group consensus .
Because it 's impossible to critically evaluate those hundreds of independent events , fans end up rallying together in support of or against the lowest common denominator in observational terms .
And this is why statistics and the analysis of those statistics is crucial .
Statistics , at the lowest level , are simply a vast collection of events .
Even though the fans ' understanding and analysis of the game continues to grow ( thanks to people like Vic , Gabe , JLikens and Tyler ) , there remains a vast majority of fans , people who know better and simple - minded folks that wallow in ignorance , sometimes willfully .
Roger Neilson realized the observational shortcomings of hockey and moved to correct it .
Twenty years later we 're beginning to advance the fan understanding of the game in the same way , and the biggest obstruction to the effort is groupthink .
However , as Hanson notes , it 's not enough to simply tell the group that they are wrong :
But after 37 years , the group think idea is pretty well known .
The problem is that simply knowing that the group might be wrong is very different from knowing where in particular they are wrong .
The " where in particular they are wrong " part is what leads to such concise breakdowns in the math and such detailed analysis of players , games and situations .
Why was Rob Schremp a bust ?
Tyler found the answer in the math .
Last year , even though Shawn Horcoff was being slagged on by the fans , he remained highly - effective .
What was behind that ?
Vic found it in the math .
There seems to be a common complaint among those that rail against statistics as a primary tool of analysis in hockey - that statistics can be used to reach any conclusion and that the stats are being manipulated .
However , it 's quite the contrary .
With each of these posts , the author , be it JLikens , Tyler , Jonathan Willis , Vic , Scott or myself , explains the methodology he used to do his analysis and is open to debate and questions at any time .
Contrast that with the opposing argument : " it is so because I saw it , and my observations are correct . "
In the world of logic , that 's called Begging The Question .
There is no way to prove it is so , there is no way to test the hypothesis , the argument is based solely on the confirmation bias of the person making the point .
Which is more scientifically valuable ?
Which is more valuable to advancing the understanding of the game ?
Which is more predictive ?
One other groupthink complaint towards the " statheads " is that they " hide behind the math " and " band together " in a form of their own groupthink .
Someone that uses the math of hockey to set make a point or write an article is n't hiding behind anything , because from above , their methodologies are out in the open for public consumption .
And if " banding together " were true , then how do you explain something like the public opinion of Dustin Penner ?
I did n't set out to prove the microstats guys wrong when I penned the Amicus Brief In Support Of Dustin Penner , I wrote it because I was hearing through the media and reading on the internet from even the " mathheads " like RiversQ , Tyler , Vic and Jonathan what a terrible player he was , which contradicted everything my eye was seeing .
I argued the point at Lowetide 's place for a long time before giving up .
The groupthink was too strong .
So I started digging through the underlying stats and found that he was a microstat star , and that he was , in fact , an extremely valuable player .
Nine months later and among that group , the opinion on Penner is still split .
Hanson also notes another problem in fighting groupthink :
Far more people like to complain about groupthink when they think their contrarian ideas neglected ,
I had this complaint about Penner and overcame the bias by doing the work behind the counterargument .
David Staples at The Cult Of Hockey has been railing against Corsi 's usefulness for quite some time , and while I disagree with him , and the math , in many different forms , has thus far agreed that he 's barking up the wrong tree , Corsi is the strongest indicator of possession , zone time and winning .
But David attempts to do the work behind his argument rather than railing against the groupthink argument , and I give him credit for that - it 's more than most people are willing to do .
What we do here , what JLikens does at Objective NHL , what Tyler does at MC79hockey , what Vic and Rivers do at Irreverent Oil Fans , what the Contrarian Goaltender does at Brodeur Is A Fraud is n't new .
Roger Neilson was doing the same thing twenty years ago and Kevin Constantine was doing it ten years ago .
What these people do is attempt to bring a deeper understanding to the game we all love .
Unlike a methodology that diminishes or outright ignores the value of statistics in establishing a point of view on a player , team or game , a methodology that values statistical analysis creates a point of view more open to being molded or challenged based on logical arguments from an established set of data .
The " saw - him - good " crowd makes these judgments in the same way , but without tracking the information on which they base their opinions .
Sometimes ( even most times ) these observations will be correct , but when a mistake is made , there is almost no way for an outside observer to effectively challenge what someone has seen with his own eyes , especially since , most times , he 's not open to having that opinion truly challenged .
When worse comes to worse , the fall - back becomes an individual data - set that no one can challenge instead of the group data - set that helps members in the discussion to become - at least a little bit - more objective .
Statisticians make mistakes like anyone else , but when you have the numbers and an established methodology staring you in the face it 's a lot easier to correct them .
An account and analysis of the rise of communalism , multiculturalism and the creation of the British " Muslim community " under New Labour .
In 1997 New Labour came to power with the promise of sweeping away the last vestiges of the old British establishment , with all the class ridden and racist attitudes it had entailed , and create a new diverse , meritocratic and multicultural Britain .
Exemplifying the emergence of this new multicultural Britain , the very same year saw , with the active encouragement of New Labour politicians , the formation the Muslim Council of Britain ( MCB ) , which clamed to represent the two million strong ' British muslim community ' .
However , five years later the honeymoon between New Labour and the ' British muslim community ' seemed to be over .
As ten of thousands of muslims mobilized to join the national anti-war demonstrations in the months before the invasion of Iraq , the ' British muslim community ' appeared as a cohesive political force opposed to New Labour 's foreign policy .
Buoyed by the huge up swell of popular opposition to the war , the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) , together with their leftist allies within the Stop the War Coalition , saw the opportunity of breaking into the big time of bourgeois politics on the back of this wave of anti-Tony Blair feeling .
To this end Respect was set up in 2004 as a broad electoral alliance that sought to harness the popular opposition to the war and transform it into an opposition to New Labour as a whole .
Yet vital to the success of this project , particularly as the anti-war movement began to subside , was the need to bring the ' British muslim community ' on board .
So as not to put muslims off , the SWP insisted that Respect eschew left - wing ' shibboleths ' such as women 's and gay rights .
They went to the mosques and echoed the arguments of the more radical political Islamicists by claiming that Bush 's ' Global War on Terror ' was in fact a war on muslims - both abroad , with the attack on muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan , but also at home with the succession of anti-terrorist legislation - that should be opposed by all muslims as ' muslims ' .
And like the more radical political Islamicists they denounced New Labour as being Islamophobic and racist .
Yet for all their efforts to pander to muslim sensitivities , Respect failed to win over the ' British muslim community ' , which remained wedded to New Labour .
As we shall argue in this article , this attempt to bring the ' British muslim community ' was doomed to fail since it was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the ' British muslim community ' is and the nature of its connection to New Labour .
In Part 1 we shall consider how the politics and ideology of New Labour both emerged out of and transmuted the ideas and politics of the counter - culture and New Left of the 1960s and 1970s .
In particular we shall show how anti-racism became transformed into the ideology and practice of communitarianism and multi-culturalism .
In Part 2 we shall turn to consider how the ' British muslim community ' emerged as a formal and abstract ' community ' out of the various concrete Asian communities across Britain .
In Part 3 , we shall examine the relations between New Labour and both the ' British muslim community and the various Asian communities that it seeks to represent .
And we shall see why although the government 's support for the ' global war on terror ' placed a strain on these relationships , it did not break them .
The ascendancy of New Labour in 1997 saw the culmination of a remaking of the establishment that had already been taking place for several years before .
The establishment now consists of significant numbers of people who came to politics around 1968 , when radical social change was in the air .
This class of 1968 now runs Britain .
In a sense , the political world has been turned upside down .
The class of ' 68 come from a broader cross section of society than their old establishment forebears .
The social conditions of the post - war period - in particular social mobility and the expansion of both university education and the white collar service sector - have meant that some of the New Labour ruling class went to grammar schools and some even grew up on council estates - for example Jack Straw , David Blunkett , Alan Johnson , and Hazel Blears .
The emergence of this new , upwardly mobile establishment has been accompanied by a new consensus around the nature of ' society ' and ' politics ' .
This new consensus is at least in part explicable in terms of the political and social experience of this class of ' 68 .
The consensus is over such issues as multiculturalism and makes sense of New Labour 's relation to ' the muslim community ' .
Bourgeois society is the negation of community , for in bourgeois society people do not relate to each other directly ( whether in terms of authority , equality or whatever ) but through commodities .
Local ' communities ' are simply people who by accident share the same living space .
Yet long after the decline of traditional community relations in Britain , the concept of ' community ' is important in the new establishment consensus , and is bandied about such that it seems to refer to just about any category of people , whether they actually know each other and relate to each other in some way or not .
Hence it is a commonplace now in bourgeois discourse to refer to the ' black community ' , the ' gay community ' and so on .
But this is not just talk .
There is , as the right have bemoaned , an orthodoxy in the establishment around the moral and material status of these ' communities ' .
The rights and interests of the different ' communities ' are given various forms of support through financial and legal relationships with the state .
' Equal opportunities ' , for example , has been expanded and consolidated to become a structural part of every organization and a powerful arm of government in its own right .
And there is always a need for structures to ensure fairness since there are always ( members of ) ' groups ' who might be discriminated against .
While ' positive discrimination ' is still not explicitly sanctioned , the police , for example , actively welcome applications from gay , female , vertically challenged , differently abled , ' ethnic ' and other supposed representatives of ' minority ' groups .
The rights of different ' communities ' and categories of people are so taken for granted they are barely commented on nowadays , except by the more unreconstructed and nostalgic mouthpieces of the rabid right .
Yet what we are referring to here is a massive cultural change that has taken place , from a relatively narrow national culture of conformity to one where ' diversity ' is seen as a virtue by the establishment .
Forty years ago , for example , who would have believed that Sussex Police would encourage their officers to attend the ostentatious Brighton Gay Pride parade - not in order to police it but to celebrate their identity as gay police officers !
The police , like other organs of the state , recognize that they operate more efficiently if in their demographic profile they reflect the society that they operate on - i.e. , a society constituted essentially of different given ' communities ' and interest groups .
Multiculturalism - the recognition of the essential worth and nature of pre-given ' cultural difference ' - is a key plank of the consensus around the virtue of diversity .
Multiculturalism has a long history .
But , under New Labour , for the first time in the UK it has become embodied in state policy and practice .
The idea has been central to New Labour 's contribution to the creation of a politicized ' muslim community ' .
Multiculturalism not only assumes that there are different given cultures ( with given or essential natures and interests ) embodied in different communities , in practice it operates on the assumption that such ' communities ' have a relatively solid internal structure , with recognized leaders etc. who the state can deal with .
As we shall see , this is n't always the case .
Yet , more than some other ethnic minority groups in the UK , traditional muslim families and their wider social networks do resemble a ' community ' with a structure .
There is no equivalent New Labour relation with ' the black community ' ( or , at least , it is not at all the same ) as there is with the ' muslim community ' and its political organs .
As indicated , these new establishment principles and policies - of society as constituted of different ' communities ' and of multiculturalism - in part can be traced back to the experiences of the class of ' 68 .
In part at least , therefore , the New Labour establishment is a descendent of the New Left .
Critics of this ' continuity ' thesis might rightly point out that there is a glaring and obvious discontinuity between the two - that while the New Left was anti-American ( not least over the Vietnam war ) New Labour is notoriously ' shoulder to shoulder ' with the United States , and severe on those within the Party who have been critical of American policy , who are branded unrealistic , naïve , immature etc .
Yet alongside such a break from the past , there are also clear and obvious continuities .
For New Labour , every minor policy initiative and change within existing strategy and direction is described as ' radical ' , echoing the language and aspirations of those involved in the events of ' 68 .
What is interesting is the way that the co-existence of these two sorts of tendency within the new establishment has led to a crisis for New Labour .
The relativism inherent in the new establishment values of multiculturalism and diversity , inherited from the radical days of 1968 , conflicts with the new establishment 's equally strong commitment to universalism - in the form of its war in Iraq , which was justified on the basis of democracy .
As we shall see , one manifestation of this crisis is that , with the war , multiculturalism has lately come under attack from liberals as well as the right , due to the threat of ' home grown terrorism ' ( i.e. some members of ethnic minorities violently opposed to the ' British way of life ' ) .
To understand how the radical and revolutionary impulses of 1968 could be the basis of establishment policies and practices today that consolidate and build upon the counter - revolutionary right - wing offensive of the 1980s , we need to step back and look more closely at the different meanings that could be found in the events of this earlier time .
The explosion of events was on the one hand a re-emergence of visceral class struggle , in terms of attacks on the cops , state , businesses , employers , war and numerous government institutions .
But the form and participants of the struggles also opened the way for seeing 1968 as a historical turning point for the class struggle as such .
Was the proletariat expressing itself differently but the same in essence ?
Or did 1968 in fact mark the end of ' class politics ' - the struggles of different groups of people , often outside the traditional forms and structures of the labour movement , signifying that society was now fundamentally structured according to quite different social strata and entities ?
To understand how and why New Labour has followed one strand of the New Left in taking the latter position , we must understanding the nature and origins of the New Left itself .
The roots of the New Left go back before 1968 , and are based on disillusion within the Old Left .
First , the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 represented a massive blow to the idea of ' actually existing socialism ' in the East .
How could Stalinist Eastern Europe be ' progressive ' if it sent tanks sent in to crush workers ' councils ?
To these former supporters of the Soviet Union were added those who were increasingly critical of its oppressive practices at home .
Beyond the Soviet Union , the other bulwark of the old left was the gradual progress of social democracy in Western Europe .
In the UK , after the second world war , the post - war settlement heightened expectations of what was possible through parliamentary means .
The Labour government was elected , and there were immediate plans to nationalize aspects of the economy and basic infrastructure .
The National Health Service was established ; there was an extensive programme of social ( council ) housing , and the welfare state was developed to support those who could n't work .
Yet all these high hopes were soon dashed with the defeat of the Labour Party in the 1951 general election .
Thirteen years of Conservative rule followed .
While the relative consensus between the parties served to consolidate most of the social democratic gains , there was no further progress .
The left were on the outside again ( most notably in this period in the form of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ) .
The subsequent re-election of the Labour Party in 1964 , promised much but delivered less than its predecessor .
Tony Crosland , by no means a left winger of any description , made plans to nationalize some of the leading companies in the country !
But in fact , rather than further progressive change through social democracy , the Labour government made a number of compromises - most notably perhaps their adoption of Polaris nuclear missiles .
After these disappointments , then , the period around 1968 was a massive inspiration .
The prospect of real , radical social change was discernable in the various events around the world : the Chinese cultural revolution ( 1966 ) , the near revolution in France , May 1968 , the anti-war and civil rights riots and protests in the USA , and the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia were just the most well known examples .
While there were industrial actions by workers as workers , the subjects of many of the strikes , occupations , street confrontations , and campaigns were not workers qua workers but organized students and others not of the old left at all , and were n't constrained by the traditions of the workers ' movement .
In fact , the involvement of many young people fresh and new to politics led some to interpret the events as a ' clash of generations ' .
If the New Left was the product negatively of the failures of social democracy and Stalinism , positively it was the political expression of this resurgence and reinvention of the mass impulse towards social change by a new generation of activists .
But if the tumultuous events of 1968 , particularly those in Paris , showed that the most radical social change was a real possibility , the nature of this social change , the identity of those who would carry it out , and - importantly - the reasons why it failed were subject to a variety of interpretations .
The New Left was not an homogenous or unified movement or perspective coming out of 1968 , but is rather a plethora of currents , movements , and trends across the left and libertarian spectrum that arose from that time .
On the one hand , the New Left expresses the resurgence of class struggle and hence of tendencies which emphasized class analysis in various forms .
The Chinese cultural revolution had already raised the profile of Maoism as an alternative socialism to Stalinism ; and a number of non-Stalinist Marxist groups were involved in the events of 1968 .
There was at the time and subsequently a re-engagement with the ideas of Marx .
Older revolutionary traditions that had until then been eclipsed by the duopoly of Stalinism and social democratic reformism were re-energized .
Versions of Trotskyism flourished , for example .
The Situationist International and those who followed them famously drew upon the ideas of council communists , such as Pannekoek ; left communism and the ideas of Bordiga too had a revival ( e.g. the International Communist Current ) .
On the other hand , some New Left tendencies stressed the ' cultural ' aspects of the events of 1968 .
In these accounts , struggle and hence revolution was no longer about economic scarcity and the old class - based politics but about oppression and hence liberation of various forms .
Social change was linked to lifestyle and personal politics ; and the agents of change were the ' new social movements ' of such groups as women , blacks , gays , youth , squatters , anti-nuclear and ecological campaigners and so on .
These cross-class cleavages became the basis for the ' identity politics ' of the 1970s and 80s , fragmenting the New Left .
As we shortly see in more detail , ten years later there was an economic downturn and a right - wing backlash .
In this context , the hopes of many of the New Left still bore the stamp of that time of radical change but became more modest in practice .
Many of the same people who condemned the unprincipled compromises of social democracy , and argued that change could only come from outside the establishment , now looked to the inside for change .
With the reality of revolution apparently fading into the distance , the only possibility of any kind of social transformation now seemed to be through much more gradualist reformist means for the foreseeable future .
Many of the 1968 - inspired New Left therefore now entered the Labour Party for ' the long march through the institutions ' to a better society .
This turn from outside to inside the institutions was made possible by changes that had been taking place in British society since the last war , which had affected many of the class of ' 68 .
Before describing these changes , however , we need to remain with the events of 1968 .
As we shall see , the celebration of group diversity and difference was not only inspired by the autonomous struggles of different groups but was also prompted by a defence against a last - ditch attack by the Conservative old right in its efforts to hold on to a notion of supposed homogenous Britishness .
On April 20th 1968 , barely two weeks before the revolutionary events were to break out on the other side of the English Channel , Enoch Powell , the then shadow secretary of state for defence , delivered his notorious ' rivers of blood ' speech to the Birmingham Conservative Association .
Powell argued that the numbers of immigrants from both the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent over the previous two decades had become far too large to be assimilated in to the British way of life .
As a result , as they settled in Britain and had children , the immigrant populations were establishing their own separate and alien cultures in many of Britain 's major towns and cities that would inevitably come into conflict with the culture of the indigenous White population .
On the basis of lurid anecdotes drawn from his white constituents , Powell warned , that unless concerted measures were immediately taken to repatriate immigrants , serious racial conflict would sooner or later become inescapable .
Enoch Powell , like most of the Conservative Party , had previously welcomed the large scale immigrations from both the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent as a means of dealing with the acute labour shortages , and the consequent strengthening of the trade union bargaining position , that had arisen during the long post - war economic upswing .
Indeed , as Minister of Health between 1960 - 63 , Powell had actively promoted the policy of recruiting workers to fill unskilled jobs in the NHS from the West Indies .
However , over the winter of 1968 , culminating with his ' rivers of blood ' speech , it became clear that Enoch Powell had made a decisive about - turn with regard to the issue of immigration .
Powell , had not been the first Tory politician to break ranks with the then existing official Conservative policy on immigration in order to play the ' race card ' .
In 1964 , much to the embarrassment of Conservative Central Office , the Conservative Party in Smethwick constituency in Birmingham , had waged a vehemently racist anti-immigration local election campaign to win control of the local council - one of the few electoral gains made at a time when there was a nation wide swing to the Labour Party .
However , Powell 's speech was particularly significant because he was a prominent front bench politician for the Conservative Party , and one of the party 's few recognized intellectuals .
But what is more , with his old fogey image and the frequent allusions to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome which littered his speeches , Enoch Powell seemed to many to epitomize the persistence of the old British establishment and the Victorian order and values that served to uphold it .
Indeed , for liberals , modernizers and progressives , Powell was a reminder , amidst the hopes raised by the election of a Labour government after years of Conservative rule , that Britain remained a ' class - ridden ' society , in which social rank was strictly demarcated by accent , dress and mannerisms , formed through an elitist and class based educational system .
Powell 's ' rivers of blood ' speech underlined the fact that the Victorian order , and the insular , reactionary and racist attitudes it engendered , was still very much alive .
The British establishment , and the Victorian order which upheld it , had emerged in the late nineteenth century as a result of the alliance , and gradual fusion , between the newly emergent industrial bourgeoisie and the declining ruling landed aristocracy .
After the tumultuous social change and intense class conflicts of the early decades of the century , which had been brought about by industrial revolution and rapid urbanization , both the industrial bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy had been united by the aim of consolidating the existing social order and their position within it , particularly in the face of an increasingly militant and organized working class .
During the early years of Queen Victoria 's reign , the industrial bourgeoisie had been permitted to run the new industrial cities while the landed aristocracy continued to rule the countryside and govern national affairs .
However , with the agricultural depression of the 1870s and 1880s and the consequent decline in land rents , the economic independence of the landed aristocracy was steadily undermined .
The political and social position of the ruling establishment became increasingly dependent on the transfusion of wealth and economic power of the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie .
Successful businessmen , who wished to consolidate their gains by obtaining influence in the corridors of power and by enhancing their social status , were increasingly able to gain admittance to the institutions and social networks that together constituted the ruling establishment .
They were encouraged to buy country estates , to go hunting and grouse shooting ; to invite the titled to lend prestige and authority by sitting on the boards of their companies ; to marry their daughters into aristocratic families and to send their sons to public school to be educated in the classics alongside the sons of the upper class .
In such ways sections of the bourgeoisie could be slowly assimilated into the establishment and what remained of the old landed aristocracy could secure their privileges and social position as part of the governing class .
This gradual assimilation of the bourgeoisie into the ruling established order necessarily entailed the maintenance , and indeed a reassertion of distinctions of social rank .
Yet while Victorian Britain remained a sharply ' class ' divided society it became increasingly ideologically united behind the supposed common allegiance to ' Queen , Country and Empire ' .
The rapid growth of the British Empire in the final three decades of the nineteenth century had important economic advantages that served to underpin the emerging Victorian order .
Firstly , the Empire had to be run .
It provided expanding secure and well remunerated posts both in the army and the civil service for the sons of the landed aristocracy .
For the capitalist , the Empire provided protected markets for the commodities they produced , privileged access to raw materials and cheap labour , and an outlet for banking and finance .
At the same time easy profits that could be made from the Empire allowed British capitalists to make timely material concessions to the working class that served to mitigate class conflict at home .
However , just as important as these economic advantages in cementing together the sharply ' class ' divided late Victorian society , particularly as far as the working class was concerned , was the inherently racist ideology of Empire .
Britain was seen as taking up the torch of Western civilization that dated back to the ancient world of Greece and Rome .
The British Empire , like that of Rome , brought the benefits of civilization to the world , but on a far greater scale .
Yet while the spread of the British Empire could be justified in terms of bringing the benefits of Western civilization to the ' primitive ' peoples of Africa , Asia and elsewhere , this was insufficient to justify continued British rule .
After all if these ' primitive ' peoples were civilized by the British Empire why could they not then eventually rule themselves .
The answer to this was racialism , that is that the non-white races were biologically inferior and were therefore inherently incapable of ruling themselves in a civilized manner .
The British therefore , it was concluded , had a right , and indeed a duty , to rule .
By the end of the century , like elsewhere in Europe , the racist theories of racialism and eugenics had become pervasive to the point of being common sense in Britain , with even socialist intellectuals accepting them .
The social and political changes following the first world war , particularly the continued growth of organized labour , combined with the decline of Britain 's economic hegemony , which culminated in the dismemberment of the British Empire , undermined the basis of the old Victorian order .
By the end of the second world war large sections of the old establishment had come to accept , with varying degrees of enthusiasm , that if the British working class was not ' to go Communist ' , and if British industry was to compete with that of Europe and the USA , then Britain had to be modernized .
By the 1950s , all but the most diehard right - wing Tories came to accept , in the face of national liberation movements and pressure from the USA , that Britain 's former colonies would sooner or later have to be granted independence .
While in domestic affairs it was accepted that the social distinctions and class privileges of the old Victorian order had to be dismantled .
The only issue was the pace of change .
One of the central planks upon which this post - war consensus was built was the post - hoc justification of the second world war as a war that had united Britain , with its long established democratic traditions , against Nazi and fascist totalitarianism .
With the revelations of the Nazi holocaust , eugenics and racialist theories , which as we have mentioned were once so pervasive in both ruling class circles and amongst intellectuals , were now thoroughly discredited .
Indeed , suggestion of racism was now to become a taboo in ' polite society ' .
The myth that Britain had been united in a war against the Nazis and their fascist and racist ideology served the British left well in its efforts to build a national consensus around social democratic reforms .
It could be argued that the great sacrifices made by the nation , particularly by the working class , had to be rewarded by a fairer more progressive Britain .
However , it was a convenient myth for many on the right since it covered up the widespread anti-Semitism and pro-Nazi sympathies amongst the British ruling establishment during the 1930s - ranging from members of the Royal Family down to proprietors of national newspapers such as the Daily Mail .
For many on the left , in ' daring to speak out ' in his ' rivers of blood ' speech , Enoch Powell had betrayed the persistent covert racism of large parts of the British establishment .
However , while this may have been the case , for Powell the old establishment , having already betrayed the Empire for its own short - term advantages , was now standing by while Britain 's thousand - year - old culture and traditions were about to be overwhelmed and destroyed .
Indeed , Powell had little but disdain for many of those who now made up the establishment who were prepared to sacrifice ancient traditions and principles for the sake of preserving their privileges a little bit longer and who failed to live up to his romanticized view of the old Victorian order .
In making his ' rivers of blood ' speech Enoch Powell was clearly aiming to make his appeal , not to the right wing of the establishment but directly to the 'lower orders .
Indeed ,
The speech was full of anecdotes expressing the fears of the Tory working class and lower middle class that their exalted position in the world was under threat and that now that the Empire was gone the tables would be turned and ' the black man will have the whip hand ' .
Powell 's speech certainty resonated amongst large sections of the working and lower middle classes .
Not only was Enoch Powell inundated with messages of support but at the time his speech was widely credited with contributing to the Labour Party 's subsequent unexpected defeat in the 1970 general election .
For the new left , Enoch Powell 's ' rivers of blood ' speech and its aftermath was a defining episode in terms of both the issue of racism and in its relation to the old left .
Indeed , it was to play an important part in the subsequent development of the new left 's ideas concerning multiculturalism .
Following his speech Enoch Powell was widely denounced by nearly all mainstream politicians .
Even the Sunday Times denounced Powell for ' racialism ' and he was promptly dismissed from the shadow cabinet .
Yet in response to the subsequent popularity of Enoch Powell 's speech , as had happened previously when the issue of immigration raised its head , within months a new immigration law was passed aimed at curbing the right of entry for immigrants from the New Commonwealth - that is from those parts of the former British Empire whose populations were predominantly black or Asian .
The question that arose was why liberals and social democrats in government and parliament had so easily capitulated to the demands of Powell and his racist right wing populism .
Was it because these well meaning liberals and social democrats were simply weak kneed ?
Or was it because they were implicitly racist themselves to some unacknowledged degree ?
It is probably true that many of those at the time , who both rallied to his support or vehemently opposed him , saw Enoch Powell as defending the old - style racialism .
However , Enoch Powell was careful to avoid arguing that ' coloureds ' were biologically inferior and thus unable to be fully integrated into civilized British society .
What prevented the integration of black and Asian immigrants into British society was their alien culture .
Thus there was nothing to stop blacks and Asians from adopting the British way of life as individuals , but as groups asserting their own distinct culture they could not .
As such the difference between Powell and the mainstream proponents of assimilation was simply a question of numbers .
That is , how many blacks and Asian immigrants could Britain absorb .
Indeed , to the extent the liberal policy of assimilation assumed that it was appropriate for immigrants to adopt British culture , it was just as racist as Powell - it was part and parcel of the new style racism based not on biology but on culture .
This rise to the notion of multiculturalism , with its insistence on the equality of cultures , we will see was to emerge over the following four decades as the new dominant consensus .
The positive response to the ' rivers of blood ' speech served to highlight the endemic racism and social conservatism of significant sections of the British working class .
For many in the new left this served to strengthen their rejection of the old left 's faith in the working class as the primary agent for social change and underlined the need to look for new agents of social change , which were being constituted by the new social movements , such as the young , women , blacks or the oppressed people of the Third World .
For others in the new left this endemic racism and social conservatism in the working class was the result of the labourist ideology embedded in the institutions and leadership of the traditional British labour movement .
Often invoking Lenin , it was argued that from its very inception in the mid-nineteenth century the reformist British labour movement had been dominated by a ' labour aristocracy ' whose relative privileged position was dependent on the super - exploitation of oppressed peoples of the British Empire .
As a result there had been a long history of complicity on the part of the British Labour movement with imperialism , and a failure to combat the racism it engendered within the working class .
From this it was concluded that the British labour movement had to be radically reshaped or a new more revolutionary one built out of the militancy of the rank and file .
Either way , for both the ' new new left ' and the ' old new left ' , the widespread conclusion was a rejection of the Labour Party and its reformist politics for much of the 1970s .
But by the end of the 1970s the political climate had begun to change as the dark clouds of reaction began to draw in .
The 1970s were a period of economic uncertainty and increasing political polarization .
Amidst soaring inflation and rising unemployment , the revolutionary hopes raised by ' 68 , and sustained through to the miners ' victory in 1974 , had by the late 1970s been overtaken by fears of a right - wing backlash and a ' return to the ' 30s ' .
Deepening economic crisis , and with it the hastening of Britain 's long term economic decline , coupled with cuts in public spending on housing and public services were all serving to accentuate racist sentiments , particularly amongst the economically insecure lower middle classes and less well off sections of the working class .
Blacks and Asians were easy scapegoats and faced not only persistent discrimination by employers and police harassment but also frequent racist abuse and mounting physical attacks by racist gangs .
On the back of this rise in overt racism , fuelled by lurid tales in the tabloids , came the rise of the National Front .
The National Front had been founded in 1967 as a means to unite the various fragments of the old British Union of Fascists and other tiny fringe far right - wing groups .
At that time it had been easily dismissed as merely a collection of harmless nutters .
Ten years later the National Front was threatening to become a serious political force .
It was beginning to make significant gains in local elections and had become bold enough to attempt to seize control over the streets by holding sizeable marches through immigrant areas .
Fears grew on the left that sooner or later the British ruling class would abandon its post - war anti-fascist ideology and turn to the National Front to find a solution to the deepening economic and political crisis facing Britain .
Undoubtedly the National Front was able to tap into the racist currents that were still widespread within British society , and which had been brought to the surface by the deepening economic and political crisis of the 1970s .
However , at the same time , longer term ideological and cultural changes , which had been developing since at least the end of the second world war , meant that there were far stronger anti-racist currents that could be mobilized .
Victory in two world wars had certainly served to bolster British nationalism ; but in both these wars Britain was seen as championing democracy , firstly against the Kaiser 's authoritarian militarism and then against Hitler 's Nazi Germany .
Consequently , even for people with right - wing opinions , any affinity with Nazism , and its anti-Semitic white supremacism , was widely seen as being unpatriotic - quite unBritish in fact .
This was always a formidable barrier for the acceptance of the National Front as the party of British nationalism .
Furthermore , although the world wars had served to inflate a sense of British superiority this was soon to be punctured .
In 1956 Britain was humiliated at the hands of the Americans when , in the face of US opposition , the British and French governments were obliged to call off their combined invasion of Egypt to re-capture the Suez Canal that had been nationalized by Nasser .
The humiliations of 1956 , combined with the final demise of the British Empire by the early 1960s , brought a general recognition of Britain 's diminished position in the world .
Of course , it was precisely this realization that Great Britain was no longer as great as it once was - along with the belief that this was due to the failings of the British ruling elites - that had served to fuel the popular support for both Enoch Powell and subsequently the National Front .
However , for many , particularly amongst the younger generations of the time , the notion of ' making Britain great again ' was simply a hopeless nostalgia for a by - gone age .
After all , what had been so great about Britain apart from its ability to conquer half the world ?
This acceptance of Britain 's decline in the world , and with it a rejection of British chauvinism , brought with it an increasing acceptance of other cultures .
Indeed , for the generation born after the second world war , embracing other cultures offered a means of escape from the conservative and insular confines of British culture , whose drabness had been accentuated by the post - war austerity of the 1950s .
As a consequence , central to the British counter - culture of the 1960s was a trans - culturalism , which sought a cross fertilization of cultures - from India to that of black America .
As a result , when the children of the wave of immigrants from the West Indies of the 1950s and '60s came of age and began to assert their culture this was not seen by most young whites as a threat , as Enoch Powell had foretold , but as an exciting opportunity .
Ska , reggae and ganga became a common point of reference to both young whites and blacks .
Hence when social tensions erupted into full - scale riots in the late 1970s and early 1980s these were not race riots , as Powell had predicted , but anti-racist and anti-fascist riots .
In the riots that followed the Notting Hill Carnivals in the mid-1970s , in the Lewisham and Southall riots of 1977 and in the country wide riots of July 1981 , young blacks , whites and indeed Asians joined together to fight the racist actions of the police and to stop the National Front .
In 1977 the Anti-Nazi League ( ANL ) was formed as a broad front to oppose the political advance of the National Front .
In drawing in everyone from Anarchists and Trotskyists through Labour Party members to liberals and even a few Tories , the ANL served to bring together the New and old left in a common fight against racism and fascism .
With the slogan the ' National Front is a Nazi Front ' and by tapping into the anti-racism of the counter - culture with its ' rock against racism ' campaign the ANL succeeded in halting the electoral advance of the National Front .
This , combined with the physical defeat of the National Front 's attempt to dominate the streets , meant that by the end of the 1970s the threat posed by the National Front was receding .
However , although the advance of the National Front was halted , Thatcher won the 1979 election by landslide - an electoral success in part due to her willingness to ' play the race card ' .
Echoing Powell 's ' river of blood ' speech , Thatcher had expressed the fear of Britain being ' swamped ' by immigrants .
Indeed , by echoing Powell , Thatcher was able to take the wind out of the National Front 's sails and make the Conservative Party the representative of those who feared further immigration .
In the face of the new Thatcher government many on the new left now flocked into the Labour Party .
The new left now began its long march through the institutions ending up as new labour as we shall now relate .
The class of ' 68 were born into a world where the old Victorian social order that Powell was seen to represent was already dying .
As we have argued , while some of the ideas of the new establishment find their origins in the events of 1968 , the class of 1968 were only able to become the new establishment - to move from the outside of New Left social movements to roles within the institutions - due to by changes that had been taking place in British society since the last war .
In particular , changes in social mobility altered the class position of many .
Their changed class positions are themselves part of the explanation of the new establishment consensus over the ' muslim community ' .
We now turn to briefly outline these changes in social mobility that allowed a generation with quite different social background than their forebears to emerge as the UK 's most influential leading politicians , civil servants , intellectuals and entrepreneurs .
The post war settlement is the key to understanding the enhanced social mobility that took place after the war .
One of the features of the settlement was a huge university building programme , which made it possible for many working class and lower middle families to send their offspring to university or polytechnic for the first time .
Further and higher education were no longer in effect the privilege of the toff class .
This massive expansion of higher education was matched by growth in the public sector more generally - the lower end of the civil service , local authority services , and the national health service all expanded .
Thus those graduating from university now found new management , white collar and other higher - status places waiting for them .
The growth of higher education made bourgeois society in the UK much more meritocratic and rational , as more people were appointed on the basis of formal qualifications regardless of family background .
The growth of middle class jobs in effect meant that a whole swathe of working class people became middle class in one generation .
The first people to make this transition were the post war baby - boomers , those people born in the 1940s and 50s .
These same people who would become young adults around 1968 .
They therefore made up a large part of the New Left that grew from the events of this time .
When the prospect of revolution receded , it was these same people who then pursued more modest objectives .
They often did this through the ranks of the Labour Party , or through reformist and ' single issue ' campaigns and pressure groups , or through liberal institutions , or local government .
By the 1980s , many of the new middle class New Left class of ' 68 found that the their earlier modest strategy choices now took the form of appealing career ladders .
New opportunities opened up to them in the developing creative industries ( media , advertising ) , in higher education , and in the civil service .
In this context , their working class origins became increasingly forgotten , and the class analysis that had once been as relevant the exciting new perspectives of the late 1960s now seemed to have little applicability to their lifestyles , aspirations , identities and social circles , and their politics .
After all , it seemed to them , the working class were often the problem itself not part of the solution at all .
It was the old - fashioned , conformist working class where sexist attitudes , homophobic opinions and racist expressions were found to still exist unabashed .
Indeed , these kind of points were not peripheral but central to the new political consensus that was emerging in the new middle class and their allies in the old establishment .
For example , political correctness - the imperative to use language that does not offend different groups - could be seen as the natural extension of one of the key innovations of the New Left ( i.e. the recognition of the autonomous potential of various different groups ) .
Thus social change could indeed be achieved , and the remaining barriers to equality and freedom for all the different groups of people making up society , could be overcome .
All that was needed then was for these new middle classes to be in positions of power , on the inside .
Hence for example the unarguable attack on the dominance of ' white middle - aged ( middle class ) men ' , with their assumed oppressive attitudes , was first made in the Labour Party - through the argument for black and female candidate short - lists .
This attack on the monoculturalism of the old elite was then pressed through allied groups such as the National Council of Civil Liberties ( now Liberty ) and other liberal charities , think - tanks , intellectuals and lobbying groups .
The attack was understood as a rallying call for the positive contribution that minority groups could make , for the essential value and worth of these groups , who had been excluded for no other reason than the prejudice of tradition .
It was a call for a more rational and fair society .
The strategy flourished in the Labour Party 's local government strongholds .
The clearest and most developed expression was in the Greater London Council ( GLC ) .
' Red ' Ken Livingstone oversaw the appointment of numerous highly paid professionals to look after special interest groups such as blacks , gays , women , gay women , black gays etc. etc .
But the creation of jobs for the representatives of these ' communities ' and interest groups was significant in forming careers that took ' radical ' people from the outside and put them on the path to the establishment .
Any number of community activists , who had originally organized independently , got vast amounts of funding from the GLC , which eventually took them from the outside to a career path on the inside .
The careerization of radical feminists is an obvious case in point .
Throughout the 1980s , the Conservatives were still in power nationally , so the New Left attacked the old establishment from the outside .
The GLC and other labour strongholds saw themselves and were seen as anti-establishment .
This was true , in the sense that the campaigning groups and individuals that Labour councils such as the GLC supported were critical of the status quo : they campaigned around such issues as police racism , for example .
Yet , the old establishment was also under attack from the inside .
Prime minister Margaret
Thatcher was herself not from the upper middle class but had come to power through forging an alliance between the old establishment and the new , an alliance which in fact served to undermine the old establishment .
Thatcher and her ministers promoted old - fashioned establishment values such as the traditional family and gender roles , nationalism , and racism .
But she also sacked a number of the old school tie brigade and promoted into her cabinet new middle class and former working class grammar school boys like Norman Tebbit , Kenneth Clarke , and John Major .
In effect , with the support of some of the old establishment in an alliance of old and new right , Thatcher pursued neo-liberal policies on the freedom of money capital .
Sweeping away all barriers to the movement of money - capital meant destroying some of the traditions , customs and rules of the old establishment .
The most explosive expression of this was the opening up of the City and British banks to just anyone with money ( including foreigners ) - the ' Big bang ' or ' Wimbledonization ' of the City .
This liberalization went hand in hand with with decimation of manufacturing ( with its entrenched management and well as labour practices ) and the retirement of old school tie mandarins such as ' Sir Humphrey ' in the changing civil service .
The changes Thatcher 's government introduced therefore served to complete the formalization and rationalization of the bourgeois revolution .
Merit and profit were finally dislodging the stupifying influence of tradition in almost every area of society .
The continued pursuit of nationalism , however , with its ethnocentrism and irrational loyalty to the traditions of the nation state came into conflict with this free market ' revolution ' , most obviously in the Conservatives ' contradictions over Europe .
As we shall see , New Labour 's pursuit of the war in Iraq and its ' modernization ' of society has embodied a similar contradiction .
As early as the 1950s American sociologists had begun to argue that with the relative decline of American manufacturing industry , and the consequent growing economic importance of ' the service sector ' , America was becoming a ' post - industrial society ' .
In the early 1970s , drawing on such ideas , historians of art and , in particular architecture , began to argue that this economic and sociological transition was being reflected in a cultural shift away from the ' modernism ' associated with the industrialization of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , to ' post - modernist ' forms of art and architecture
By the late 1970s , these ideas were broadened , and given much greater philosophical depth , with their merger with the various strands of post - structuralist philosophy emanating from France .
The various and often mutually inconsistent theories and notions that resulted , which came to be known under the rather broad rubric of post - modernism , swept across the faculties of the social sciences and the humanities of Britain 's universities in the 1980s .
The ideas of post - modernism , and more particularly post - structuralism , had a strong appeal to the rising generation of academics who had benefited from the large - scale expansion of higher education in the 1960s and that , as a consequence , had been drawn from a much broader section of society than any previous generation of academics .
First of all , for those who had been radicalized by their involvement in the new left and the counter - culture , but who had now given up all hope that there would be any immediate revolutionary change in society - and had consequently ' sold out ' and embarked on an academic career - post - modernism offered a means to preserve their sense of being radical and critical .
Indeed , post - modernism often drew on many of the political and cultural themes of the counter - culture and the new left and , what is more seemed to give them a more radical theoretical and philosophical basis .
As a result , post - modernism could appear to many young academics at the time as being , at least theoretically , far more radical than the rather ' outdated ' nineteenth century ideas of revolutionary Anarchism or Marxism that they had once adopted in their student days .
Secondly , post - modernism provided this new generation of academics with rather devastating weapons with which to storm to the old elitist , white and male - dominated bastions that still remained within academia , as well as the means to carve out a niche for themselves in the newly expanded world of higher education .
Post - modernism provided the distinctive subject matter for a whole new range of academic departments ; such as cultural studies , media studies , women 's studies , black studies and so forth .
At the same time , in the older existing academic disciplines , such English literature and sociology , post - modernism provided a radical new alternative that could undercut the established orthodox theories .
One of the first university departments that post - modernism colonized was that of English literature .
English literature , particularly at Oxford and Cambridge , was traditionally regarded as something of a backwater .
A subject deemed suitable for the small number of women students that in less enlightened times had managed to reach the level of a university education .
For a time in the 1980s , English departments , particularly the one at Cambridge , became the cutting edge of the Post - Modernist offensive .
The notion , dating back to Mathew Arnold in the late nineteenth century , that the role of the universities was to defend the elitist ' high culture ' , defined by a cannon of great literary works , from the barbarism and philistinism of mass popular culture was ruthlessly attacked .
The class walls between high , middle and low brow culture had to be torn down , while the voices of those that had been long suppressed and excluded from the white , male - dominated great cannon , had to be heard and recognized .
Thus the artwork of the Beano and the lyrics of Bob Dylan could be considered just as worthy of academic study as the paintings of the ' Grand Masters ' or the poems of Keats .
The writings in English of women , as well as the Black and Asian writers of the former colonies had to be considered as just as much a part of English Literature as the predominantly white male writers recognized by the great literary cannon .
However , the Post - Modernist offensive did not remain confined to undermining what was after all the rather conservative and Victorian notion that the essence of Western civilization , and indeed its superiority , was embodied in its high art and literature .
In much of the social sciences the established schools of thought , whether liberal , conservative , or even Marxist , all sought to emulate to a greater or lesser extent the empirical methods and reasoning of the natural sciences .
The radical challenge of post - modernism was to attack empricism foundationalism of the social sciences by undercutting its very roots .
The Post - Modernists set about attacking the underlying notion that the history , and , with this , the superiority of Western civilization and culture was defined by the progress of reason , which , with the scientific revolution of the seventeenth and eighteenth century Enlightenment , had thrown off the shackles of superstition and religious dogma so as to find its highest expression in science and technology .
For the shock troops of post - modernism this notion of the progress of reason and science was merely the conceit of a ' euro - centric meta- narrative ' .
It was not simply that the there was no such thing as empirical facts independent of the theory that was to be verified or falsified by them ; but that there was no such thing as an objective truth that could be known by reason .
Both the solidity of the knowable ' object ' and the ' rational subject ' , the twin pillars of the epistemology of science and indeed the Enlightenment , were ' deconstructed ' and ' de - centred ' .
There was , it was declared , nothing knowable beyond ' discourse ' or the ' text ' - there was only the free interplay of signifieds and signifiers , which ultimately only referred to themselves and their differences .
Science , it was asserted , was no more than a narrative , which , as such , had no more claim to a superior or privileged status than any other narrative , including those it had claimed to have overcome , such as magic or religious dogma of other , allegedly less advanced , cultures .
History and progress , and hence the very claim that Western civilization was in some way more advanced than other societies and cultures , was merely a fiction .
As such , history as known by Hegel , Marx and other Enlightenment figures , was merely a ' grand narrative ' .
There was no such thing as history , only a multitude of stories ; and hence there was no such thing as historical progress ( hence it was meaningless to talk of something being progressive or reactionary ) .
By the end of the 1980s post - modernism had reached it apogee .
The university departments that were most susceptible to post - modernism had by then already become colonized .
The notion of ' post - modernism ' , and a vague understanding of the ideas associated with it , had now become a part of the common knowledge of the ' educated classes ' beyond the walls of the lecture theatre .
' Post - modernism continued to have an appeal to the social milieus associated with Britain 's rapidly expanding cultural , media and advertising industries .
However , for those of the post - 68 generation who were on the verge of taking senior positions in the management of British capital and state , the intellectual nihilism of post - modernism , while retaining a certain fascination for some , was of little practical use in running the everyday reality of capitalism .
With the self - indulgent obscurantism of much of its writings , its glaring logical incoherence , together with the startling ignorance of the natural sciences it claimed to critique and the injudicious remarks concerning world affairs of its more vulgar proponents - most notoriously Baudrillard 's insistence that the Gulf War did not happen - only served to open post - modernism up to ridicule and hasten its decline .
By the early 1990s post - modernism was becoming distinctly passé .
With the collapse of the USSR , and the consequent neo-liberal triumphalism , it became fashionable once again for intellectuals to speak of ' progress ' , ' modernization ' and the ' end of history ' .
Nevertheless , despite its decline , post - modernism was to have two distinct , if at times contradictory , legacies for the new ruling ideology that was to find its clearest political expression in the then emerging New Labour ' project ' .
First and foremost , post - modernism was to bequeath a strong predisposition towards cultural relativism within this emerging ruling ideology .
As such post - modernism was to provide the intellectual basis for the relativist multicultural consensus , which insisted on the difference and incommensurability between cultures , that , as we shall see , was to influence much of New Labour 's thinking on social policy .
Secondly , post - modernism , for all its supposed ultra-radicalism , paved the way for the acceptance of neo-liberalism and market fundamentalism , which was to be the defining element of the New Labour project .
The pseudo - radicalism of post - modernism was always readily apparent as soon as its principal proponents were lured out of the comfort of their academic preoccupations to address some concrete political issue , when , almost invariably , they would reveal themselves to be either middle of the road liberals or conservatives .
But this was not due to the proponents of post - modernism falling short of their theory , but was inherent in post - modernist theory itself .
In denying the ' modernist ' and enlightenment appeals to reason , history and reality , post - modernism denied any actual possibility for systematic total social transformation .
Post - Modernists either had to be content , like Foucault , with the fragmentary reformism of everyday life ; or else , like Baudrillard , to an inherently conservative acceptance of the inevitability and inescapability of what simply is .
Such resigned acceptance easily slipped into a celebration of the freedom and individualistic hedonism of the market .
After all , it could be argued for example that by playing with the ever shifting semiotics of differing commodities , the free market allows the consumer to constantly redefine their image , and hence roles and identities through what they buy .
As a consequence , the well paid post - modernist academic could easily conclude that shopping could be a subversive activity .
At least as far as the educated and upwardly mobile ' class of 68 ' were concerned , it could be said that post - modernism did more to bring about the acceptance of neo-liberalism than any of its chief advocates , such as Hayek or Freidman , could have dreamed of doing through their explicit polemics and propaganda .
But , of course , there was a certain irony in all this in that post - modernism ended up contributing to the resurrection of the most pervasive of all ' meta - narratives ' of the nineteenth century - that of classical economic liberalism : in which history is told as the progressive freeing of the market and the individual from state interference .
Indeed , as we shall see in Part III , the latent contradiction between the post - modernist legacy of relativism underpinning New Labour 's multi-culturalism , and the universalism of its acceptance of neo-liberalism , was to come to the fore following the attack on the Twin Towers and the subsequent invasion of Iraq .
But the question we must now ask is how did post - modernism , which after all was merely an intellectual fashion which could have well remained entrenched within the realms of academia , help give rise to the New Labour Project ?
As we have mentioned , the catalyst that hastened the demise of post - modernism and the rise of New Labour was the decline and fall of the USSR .
The decline of the USSR and its eventual collapse brought to a head a longstanding conflict between traditionalists and modernizers in the communist parties of Western Europe .
This conflict in many ways prefigured the similar struggle in the Labour Party in the early 1990s .
Indeed , as we shall now see , many of the ideas that were to become central to the New Labour project were developed by the modernizers of the old Communist Party of Great Britain ( CPGB ) .
Unlike its sister parties in France and Italy , the old CPGB had always remained a relatively small party .
However , despite its size , the CPGB had from its inception exerted a considerable influence over the British labour movement .
Right up until the late 1970s , the CPGB had maintained a highly organized presence within both the leadership and the rank and file of the trade unions .
What is more , from the 1930s onwards the CPGB had been an important centre of attraction for left - wing intellectuals , whose ideas held significant sway over what was otherwise an atheoretical and pragmatic British labour movement .
With the industrial militancy of the early 1970s , many of the more ' realistic ' elements of the British new left had been drawn to the CPGB .
For those reacting against the utopianism and disorganization of the movements of ' post - 68 ' , the CPGB offered a highly disciplined organization that had deep roots within what could be seen as an increasingly militant working class .
Of course , the CPGB was still very much of the old left : it remained very much a Stalinist party , while its aging militants were often socially conservative and were slavishly committed to an unquestioning defence of the USSR .
Yet , in contrast to the response to the invasion of Hungary in 1956 where the Party had simply closed ranks against all internal and external critics of the USSR , the trauma caused in the CPGB by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 now seemed to open up the possibility for radical reform of the Party .
In their efforts to modernize the Party , new left intellectuals in and around the CPGB in the late 1970s began to import the ' third way ' politics and theories of Euro - communism , which were at the time emerging in France and Italy .
In attempting to find a ' third road ' that could combine the democratic pluralism of liberal European capitalism with socialism , the advocates of Euro - communism required the old Communist parties to jettison both their last remaining revolutionary pretensions and their commitment to establishing a monolithic dictatorship of the proletariat .
At the same time , the tired old dogmas and politics based on a rigid economic determinism , it was argued , had to be replaced by the far more subtle theories of social change that stressed the importance of culture - one of the principal source of such ideas being Antonio Gramsci .
Compared with France and Italy , the task of the British Euro - communist modernizers was perhaps far easier .
The CPGB had long since abandoned any hope of displacing the Labour Party as the mass party of the working class and had instead adopted the role of guiding the Labour Party along the ' parliamentary road to socialism ' .
Indeed , by the early 1980s the modernizers were already able outmanoeuvre their Stalinist opponents to capture key positions in the CPGB , and had taken control of what was to become the Party 's influential monthly journal - Marxism Today .
In becoming what was to be known as the house journal of ' yuppie socialism ' , Marxism Today did much to popularize , particularly amongst the rising post - 68 generation of Labour politicians , the culturalist theories of both post - modernism and the neo-Gramscianism put forward by Stuart Hall and his fellow academics at the Centre for Cultural Studies at Birmingham University .
At the same time Marxism Today also popularized the complementary theories of post -Fordism , which despite the post - structuralist anti-foundationalism of the post - modernist purists , could be seen to provide an updated and Marxist economic basis for both the culturalist theories of post - modernism and neo -Gramscianism .
Drawing on the theories of the French regulation school it was argued that the post - war boom of the 1950s and 1960s had been based on a Fordist regime of accumulation in which the mass production of standardized commodities had been balanced with their mass consumption through the implementation by the state of Keynesian policies of demand management .
In the 1970s this regime of accumulation had gone into crisis , which had prompted a fundamental restructuring of capitalism .
For the theorists of post - Fordism this restructuring had already given rise to the beginnings of a new regime of accumulation based on flexible and specialized production , which allowed commodities to be customized to meet the tastes of relatively small groups of consumers .
The emergence of this post - Fordist regime of accumulation underlay the shift away from the mass politics and mass culture that had been recognized by post - modernist writers .
This shift to post - Fordism meant that the old style of mass politics , which had underpinned old - style socialism and social democracy , was now out of date .
It was argued that with her appeal to individual aspirations and advancement , Thatcher had already recognized this economic and cultural shift .
What the ' left ' needed to do was to abandon its old ways of thinking and take a leaf out of Thatcher 's book .
The ' left ' had to appeal , not to collective class interests but to individuals as aspiring consumers .
Just as Thatcher had built a Gramscian style ' hegemonic project ' that had mobilized the cultural shift towards individualism and consumerism to shift Britain to the right , the ' Left ' had to mobilize these very same tendencies to build a ' hegemonic project ' that would push Britain in a more ' progressive ' direction .
Following the fall of the USSR the modernizers of the CPGB succeeded in liquidating the Party , and promptly joined the mission to modernize the Labour Party .
Several of the leading figures that had been associated with the now defunct Marxism Today became key advisors to the then still small cabal of modernizers that were coalescing around what was to become known as the New Labour project .
These advisors not only contributed ideological ammunition to win arguments , but also their long experience of bureaucratic manoeuvring was to prove invaluable in capturing the controlling heights of the Labour Party .
Of course , the New Labour project , as a practical ruling ideology , was the result of a convergence of various and often mutually inconsistent ideas and theories .
However , the ideas that had been promoted and popularized by Marxism Today played a vital part in distinguishing New Labour from both the social democratic politics of ' old Labour ' and Thatcherism .
Combined with the fashionable theories of globalization , which claimed that the old social democratic and Keynesian policies that sought to manage national economies were no longer feasible , post - Fordism lent an air of inevitability to Thatcher 's neo-liberal economic reforms .
The social democratic political beliefs of old Labour were seen as arising from the now out - dated corporate and class politics of Fordism .
As a consequence , it was argued that the Labour Party could no longer appeal to the class loyalty of those who ' worked by hand and brain ' since the working class no longer identified themselves as producers but as individualistic consumers .
There was therefore no alternative but to abandon efforts to appeal to collective solidarity and instead embrace the politics of ' individual choice ' .
From a very early stage in her rule Stuart Hall had pointed out that Thatcher was not merely an old - style reactionary Tory .
Her right - wing populism , which sought to promote ' a property owning democracy ' and ' a popular capitalism ' through the sell - off of council housing to council tenants and nationalized industries to the general public rather than to the financial institutions of the City , was in stark contrast to the elitism of the old Tory right - wing .
Indeed ,
Thatcher had not only succeeded in breaking up the old social democratic post - war consensus but in doing so had also hastened the demise of the old establishment and the last remnants of the old Victorian order that had upheld it .
Hence , perhaps rather ironically , it was Thatcher that to have inaugurated what Gramsci might have seen as a top down ' passive revolution ' that had served to modernize the British state and capitalism .
Nevertheless , although the New Labour ideologues were prepared to admit with hindsight that Thatcher 's neo-liberal economic reforms were on the side of history , and hence in some sense ' progressive ' , there were key aspects of Thatcher 's right - wing populism that were could only be considered reactionary .
Her willingness in echoing the new racism of Enoch Powell in expressing fears that Britain would be ' swamped ' by immigrants in the 1979 election campaign ; her vehement militaristic British chauvinism displayed in her commitment to buying the hugely expensive Trident nuclear weapon system and her accompanying Cold War rhetoric ; and her insistence on defending ' traditional family values ' , had all been essential to Thatcher 's electoral appeal - particularly amongst lower middle class and working class voters born before the second world war .
As New Labour made clear right from the outset , following Tony Blair 's election as leader of the Labour Party in 1994 , there would be no return to the old social democratic policies of ' old Labour ' ; there would be no re-nationalization of the industries and public utilities privatized under the Tories , there would be no redistribution of wealth through high progressive taxation and there would be no repeal of the Tories ' anti-trade union laws .
New Labour made it clear it was committed to continuing the neo-liberal policies of the Thatcher and Major governments .
However , within the limits of the post - Thatcher settlement New Labour promized to set different priorities to alleviate and rectify the worst aspects of Thatcher 's legacy .
After more than two decades of stringent curbs on public spending , New Labour promized increased investment in health and education , ' a New Deal to help the unemployed back in to work ' , higher welfare benefits targeted at the ' deserving poor ' such as pensioners and ' poor hard - working families ' and larger regeneration budgets for ' deprived areas ' .
These promises , coupled with the subsequent introduction of the minimum wage , offered some hope and relief to Labour 's traditional supporters , particularly those in the old industrial cities of the North that had suffered the most from the defeats of organized labour by Thatcher and who had borne the brunt of her class vindictiveness .
However , the extent of these promises , and the degree to which they could be implemented in New Labour 's first term of office , was severely circumscribed by the over - riding concern to restore government finances without reversing the tax cuts imposed by the previous Tory administrations .
In order to make an appreciable difference , what little money that could be found from juggling the government 's spending priorities had to be concentrated through targeting particular groups and areas .
Hence , in accepting the post - Thatcher settlement , the scope of the economic and material differences New Labour could offer were highly restricted .
Instead , New Labour 's broad appeal , which was to be central to its landslide victory in the 1997 election , was based on the promise to promote a ' new Britain ' that would be inclusive , diverse and multicultural .
The New Labour government would be in stark contrast to the narrow - minded social conservativism promoted by the previous Tory governments .
Whereas both Major and Thatcher had repeatedly deplored the changes in culture and sexual mores that had gathered pace since the ' permissive sixties ' , the New labour government would embrace such changes and actively promote the equality of women and gays as well as religious and ethnic minorities and accept non-conventional families .
Under New Labour , Britain would no longer look back to its imperialist past and define itself in terms of its military prowess ; it would define itself in terms of its cultural dynamism exemplified by the then current trends of Britpop and Britart of ' cool Britannia ' .
Having been repelled by the increasingly desperate attempts by Conservative leaders to rally its aging core supporters by moralistic speeches and policy initiatives ; such as Peter Lilley 's vilification of single mothers , ' section 28 ' of the 1988 Local Government Act , which banned local authorities from ' promoting ' homosexuality , and John Major 's much derided ' Back to Basics ' sloganeering , for large sections of the electorate , particularly those belonging to those generations which had come of age since the 1960s , New Labour 's ' New Britain ' had a broad cross-class appeal .
Yet New Labour 's culturalism did not simply have a broad appeal to the electorate ; more importantly it also appealed to key sections of the bourgeoisie .
Of course , in the boardrooms of Britain 's major companies Thatcherism had been seen as vital in restoring the fortunes of British capitalism .
But once the restructuring of British capitalism had been achieved the need for the Conservative Party to appease the xenophobia and euro - scepticism of its increasingly restless supporters had become more and more tiresome .
Now that it had embraced neo-liberalism , New Labour offered a welcome change .
This was perhaps no more true than for the banks and financial institutions of the City of London .
As one of the principal bastions of the old establishment the City of London had traditionally been the natural enemy of the Labour Party .
However , New Labour was particularly in tune with the new meritocratic and cosmopolitan City of London that had emerged since the ' big bang ' .
As a centre for global finance capital , the new City of London had little time for conservative and imperialistic attitudes that had typified the old City .
The new City exhibited a bourgeois multiculturalism : all cultures had to be given equal respect so long as they did not interfere with profit - making and the free movement of capital around the globe ( i.e. they were just variegated forms of bourgeois culture ) .
Indeed , as the City of London 's emergence as the leading world centre outside the Middle East for ' Sharia compliant finance ' necessary for the recycling of billions of petro- dollars has shown , cultural differences could be highly profitable for Labour 's new friends in the city .
[ this is a point that perhaps needs expanding on later on ]
As we have seen , the largely French - inspired theories of neo-Gramscianism , Post - Fordism and indeed post - modernism , particularly as interpreted and popularized by Marxism Today , by changing the intellectual climate in and around the Labour Party , provided the bridge between new leftism and New Labour .
However , for New Labour 's key architects , the more immediate intellectual influences , which were to give rise to the practical politics and policies which were to define New Labour , came from across the Atlantic .
Gordon Brown and Tony Blair drew inspiration for their ' Third Way ' from the apparent success of the policies then currently being implemented by Bill Clinton in the USA .
In doing so they necessarily adopted much of the closely associated theories of functional sociology and communitarianism that underpinned and justified them .
Hence , with Bill Clinton acting as the intermediary , Amitai Etzioni , the leading American theorist of communitarianism , was invited to give seminars to Labour Party policy makers in London .
At the same time , Anthony Giddens , who had played a central role in reviving the functionalist sociology of Talcott Parsons in the 1980s , was commissioned to write the primer for New Labour 's ' Third Way ' .
Functional sociology had developed in the 1950s as an ideological defence of the post - war settlement in America .
As such it had upheld the principles of a pluralistic liberal democracy based a predominantly free market capitalist economy against not only what was seen as the totalitarian socialism of the USSR , but also British style social democracy .
But , at the same time , it had to both justify and prescribe the limits of the increased role of the state that had come about as result of the ' big government ' policies that had followed Roosevelt 's New Deal of the 1930s .
As a consequence , a central theme of functional sociology , and subsequently Communitarianism , was the problem that neither the liberal democratic state nor a market capitalist economy were sufficient in themselves in ensuring the social reproduction of capitalist society .
Although it was presumed to be the most efficient economic system , the market capitalist economy necessarily fragmented society into competing groups and individuals , all pursuing their own narrow , often divergent , self - interests .
As a consequence , the capitalist economy necessarily gave rise to individual and group conflicts that were dysfunctional to the reproduction of society as a whole .
Of course , it was also presumed that the liberal democratic state provided the most rational means to overcome these conflicts .
It could provide a legal framework , which could limit the dysfunctional actions of economic agents , and it could act as a neutral arbitrator in resolving conflicts of interests .
Furthermore , it was also accepted that the state might intervene to address market failures , to ensure the provision of public goods and services that would not otherwise be provided by the private sector and to alleviate poverty and economic distress that might undermine public order .
But the problem was that by itself there was no guarantee that a liberal democratic state would actually act in these ways to resolve dysfunctional conflict and ensure the orderly reproduction of society .
Indeed , if the pluralistic democratic political system simply reflected the conflicting interests of the economy then economic conflicts would simply be mirrored in the state .
The state would then be captured and run by the politically most powerful sectional interests .
The state may then exacerbate social conflicts and ultimately undermine the liberal democratic state itself .
After all , the state could only act as an arbiter to the extent that it was perceived as being in some sense neutral .
Furthermore , the rule of law in a liberal democracy depended on a degree of consent of those governed .
The more the law was seen as being biased towards one group or class the more it would have to be imposed by authoritarian and repressive means .
Alternatively the state could rise above particular interests and impose what it saw as the general interests on the groups and interests of society as whole .
But what was to prevent the state , or more specifically the state bureaucracy , from emerging as a particular interest like any other , and thereby end up imposing its particular interests as the ' general interest ' ?
Either way it seemed that a liberal democratic capitalism was doomed to either disintegrate into the disorder of competing interests due the centrifugal forces of the economy or else would end up with a totalitarian or authoritarian state .
A liberal democratic free market capitalism would therefore seem to be unsustainable if not impossible .
However , for functionalist sociologists this was evidently not the case ; liberal democratic free market capitalism was certainly alive and well in the USA if not elsewhere .
What was it about actual liberal capitalist societies that ensured their orderly reproduction ?
As we have seen , for the functionalist sociologists although the liberal democratic state and the free market capitalist economy were considered as providing the most rational and efficient means to achieving given political and economic ends , they did not determine these ends , nor could they ensure that such ends were congruent with each other .
The question then was how were these ends determined and reconciled .
The functionalist sociologists ' answer was that liberal capitalist society necessarily gave rise to a distinct cultural sphere in which the amoral and asocial economic agents constituted by the competitive market were educated and socialized to become ethical citizens .
As such , the ends pursued by groups and individuals were not merely those of narrow hedonistic self - interest but had a broader moral and social dimension .
Furthermore , in interacting through this cultural sphere as ethical citizens , a general consensus could emerge that could reconcile particular interests through the emergence of a generally accepted idea of what was the ' common good ' and ' public interest ' , which could then serve to define what should be the ends and purposes of state policy .
For the theorists of communitarianism the most important basis of this cultural sphere was the ' community ' .
Communities were constituted by the nexus of voluntary social relations between individuals that extended beyond the family , and as such were distinct from social relations mediated by the market and the state .
The existence of communities became evident in the form of voluntary bodies , charitable institutions and in religious groups that actively bound their members together in the pursuit of ethical and moral ends .
Both the theorists of functional sociology and communitarianism could trace their origins back to the late nineteenth century .
Whereas Talcott Parson 's claimed his functional sociology was rooted in the classical sociology of Weber and Durkheim , communitarian theorists have traced their ideas back to the British philosopher , Thomas Hill Green .
Green 's philosophy had been an attempt to go beyond what he saw as the limitations of utilitarianism that had underpinned classical economic and political liberalism of the early nineteenth century .
In doing so he came to reject the long tradition of British empiricism and instead looked to the classical German philosophy of both Kant and Hegel .
By the end of the nineteenth century Green 's philosophical works had gained considerable influence amongst British intellectuals and provided one of the central foundations for the ideas of New Liberalism that was to guide the policies of Liberal Party at the turn of the century .
Both the classical sociology of Weber and Durkheim , and the philosophy of Green can be seen as part of the broader re-orientation of bourgeois social theory that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century in response to ' the social question ' and the problem of defending the existing order posed by the rise of organized labour .
Of course , the problem of ensuring the orderly reproduction of capitalism , particularly in relation to the working class , had long been an issue for bourgeois social theorists .
Adam Smith , writing a hundred years before , had warned of the dangers that could arise from the mind - numbing effects of factory production and the material deprivation caused by the drive to force wages down to a bare subsistence level .
Smith feared that these consequences of capitalist accumulation might threaten social cohesion through both the material and moral degradation of the working classes .
The possible breakdown of the social reproduction of the working class because of material and moral deprivation was to be a recurrent concern for classical political economists and other bourgeois theorists right down to the mid-nineteenth century .
However , with the advance of organized labour from the middle of the nineteenth century , the main concern 0f bourgeois theorists became less that the material deprivation of the working class would lead to family break down , rising crime and the spread of disease .
Instead the main concern of the bourgeoisie was that the growing strength of an organized working class would ultimately lead to revolution and the expropriation of private property .
The response to this threat had been to make timely political and economic concessions that aimed to integrate the organized working class within bourgeois society both collectively and individually .
This had led to the radical re-orientation and re-organization of bourgeois social theory in order to provide the theoretical framework to understand and guide such reforms .
New Liberalism had sought to both forestall the advance of the labour movement through social reforms and , at the same time harness its power in the fight against the old establishment and the continued power of landed property .
However , following the first world war , the Liberal Party , and with it New Liberalism , was overtaken and sidelined by the electoral success of the Labour Party and the statist politics of social democracy .
As a consequence , Green , and his neo-Hegelian philosophy , was soon forgotten .
In Britain social democracy became established with the post - war settlement ; which saw the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state , extensive public ownership of the economy and a commitment to full employment .
Social democracy served to integrate the working class within British capital and the British state by representing it as a class - for - itself , via the organizational forms of the Labour Party and the trade union movement .
Yet at the same time as representing the working class as a class - for - itself - that is as a class that was both conscious of itself as a class , and sufficiently organized to advance its own interest as a class - social democracy served to preserve the working class as a class - in - itself - that is a mere aggregate of individualized workers and consumers .
If social democracy was to advance the collective interests of labour and wring concessions out of the bourgeoisie it had to be able to mobilize the working class to take political and industrial action .
However , at the
same time , to the extent that such concessions were ultimately dependent on the continued accumulation of capital , social democracy had to contain working class militancy within acceptable limits - it had to demobilize the working class .
This contradiction within social democracy , together with the changing technical class composition brought about by the decline of British manufacturing - came to the fore in the crisis and capitalist restructuring of the 1970s and 1980s .
The very success of entrenching social democratic reforms in the post - war era had served to undermine the ability of both the Party and the trade union movement to both mobilize and demobilize the working class as a class .
Social democracy had become hollowed out , making it vulnerable both to the working class offensive that threatened to go beyond the limits of capital , and to the subsequent bourgeois counter - offensive , which was to begin in earnest under premiership of Thatcher .
Thatcher was able to turn back the advance of social democracy through a two - pronged attack .
Firstly , she broke the collective strength of organized labour through mass unemployment , a battery of anti-strike laws and ultimately through police repression .
In doing so she sought to make it clear that any attempts by the working class to advance their interests through collective action and class solidarity was futile .
At the same time , Thatcher sought to integrate the working class directly as individualized workers and consumers through her policies and ideology of ' popular capitalism ' .
While collective action and solidarity may be futile , there would be plenty of opportunities for working class individuals and their families to advance themselves .
However , although growing economic prosperity following the restructuring of capital in the 1980s had allowed large sections of the aspiring working class to be integrated directly within bourgeois society , Thatcher 's neo-liberal policies had marginalized and ' excluded ' significant sections of the working class , which in American terms threatened to become an ' underclass ' .
Thatcher may have defeated the ' enemy within ' of organized labour but in doing so she had left a legacy of mass unemployment , family breakdown and growing levels of crime in many of Britain 's declining inner cities .
The ' social question ' was no longer the problem of organized labour but once again the problem of ' social cohesion ' and ' social inclusion ' .
Communitarian social theory was adopted by New Labour as the theoretical framework to address this ' problem of the working class ' .
Indeed , with the emergence of the new conservatism of David Cameron , the arguments of communitarianism have become an essential part of the ruling political consensus and ideology .
As Cameron puts it : if Thatcher mended the broken economy now the problem is to mend the broken society .
Communitarian theorists argued that the establishment of the welfare state , combined with the hedonistic individualism promoted by both the spread of the 1960's counter - culture and the neo-liberalism of the 1980s , had undermined the sense of community and social responsibility that were essential in holding society together .
In a diverse multi-cultural society , in which the standard traditional family was in irrevocable decline , the appeals to national unity and a return to family values put forward by the right were no longer sufficient to ensure social cohesion .
Yet calls for the extension of rights and entitlements and for the redistribution of wealth to deal with the ' social problem ' were also out of date .
For the communitarians , rights and entitlements had to be balanced with social obligations and duties .
At the same time the state had to take a more extensive and proactive role in fostering communities .
For many of those in the post - 68 generation who were now reaching senior positions within the management of the state and capital , these arguments had a certain resonance .
First of all , the communitarian idea of ' community ' was certainly reminiscent of the notion of ' gemeinschaft ' - as a social form based on direct and unalienated human relations - that had gained a wide currency in the new left in the '60s and ' 70s , and which had been used as the basis of the criticism of the alienated social forms of the commodity and the state .
Secondly , the communitarian stress on the plurality of communities was in accord with the emerging consensus around multi-culturalism and contrasted with both the narrow and outdated monoculturalism and individualism of Thatcher and Powell .
Thirdly , the communitarians ' rejection of the libertarianism of ' 60s counter - culture and their stress on social duties no doubt chimed for many in the post - 68 generation , who were now middle - aged with their own family responsibilities .
Finally , for those in New Labour , who were now taking over the running of the state , communitarianism offered a new role for state intervention in society now that ' globalization ' had supposedly ruled out effective state intervention in the economy .
Although communitarianism may claim to be class neutral in theory , this is certainly not the case in the ideology and practice of New Labour .
For the bourgeoisie and the middle classes attempts to promote social responsibility and a sense of community have been based merely on exhortation and incentives .
The middle classes have been urged to be ethical consumers and recycle their rubbish , while companies have been encouraged to adopt policies of corporate responsibility and engage with their ' community ' .
But ' community engagement ' usually means increased ' networking ' with national and local politicians and government administrators that has been necessary to prepare the way for public - private partnerships , private finance initiatives and other forms of privatization of public services , which have required a breakdown of the old divisions between the public and private sector .
In contrast , New Labour 's attempts to inculcate a sense of social responsibility in the ' problem ' sections of the working class have taken on a far more coercive aspect .
Pseudo - contracts have been imposed on the unemployed , parents and those in council or social housing .
Failure to comply with what New Labour deems as adequate socially acceptable behaviour can lead to benefit cuts or even eviction .
Furthermore , in order to promote a sense of community , particularly in ' problem neighbourhoods ' , by curbing anti-social behaviour , neighbours have been encouraged to grass each other up to the authorities over the most minor of nuances .
Instead of intervening as a last resort to arbitrate in neighbourly disputes , the authorities take sides .
With the consequent issuing of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders ( ASBOs ) quite draconian restrictions can be placed on individuals alleged to be guilty of anti-social behaviour , often merely on the basis of hearsay evidence and with little immediate opportunity to contest the case made out against them .
In short , ' community ' has become a vacuous term in New Labour speak .
On the one hand it has merely served as a cover for privatization .
On the other hand it has been used to justify the increasingly intrusive policing of sections of the working class .
Indeed , rather ironically , communitarianism in practice has served to pre-empt any emergence of any sense of community and social solidarity that might be in any way in opposition to the state and capital .
The fundamental problem of communitarian theory is that the problem of the decline of Community is not a simple result of social policy .
It is a problem resulting from capital itself .
The advance of capital into every facet of life necessarily leads to the destruction of direct human relations and their replacement by the alienated forms of the commodity and the state .
Capital and human community do not simply exist side by side but are in antagonistic relation to each other .
Thus , in promoting the advance of capital 's rule through their neoliberal policies New Labour serves to undermine and hollows out the communities that they claim to wish to promote .
Indeed , in their efforts to promote and ' engage with the community ' , state agencies have had to invent quite abstract and empty ' communities .
Hence , for example , everyone living in a certain area is deemed to constitute ' the local community ' , everyone who is gay constitutes ' the gay community ' , anyone who happens to be disabled is part of ' the disabled community ' and so forth even if the members of these communities have no connection with each other than within the heads of state administrators .
This is not to say that communities in some sense do not exist in Britain .
However , the strongest communities are the vestiges of those traditional and pre-capitalist forms of community that have been transplanted from the Indian sub - continent as a result of successive waves of immigration since the 1950s .
As we shall see in Part II , it is these Asian communities that were seized upon and vigorously promoted by New Labour politicians , not only for ideological reasons but for practical political purposes .
These communities , with their traditional social conservativism , not only serve to exemplify New Labour 's idea of ' community ' but also , through their communalist politics , served to provide a vital electoral base for New Labour .
Until about 20 years ago there was no such thing as a ' British muslim community ' .
In this part of the article we will see how the ' British muslim community ' emerged out of the socio-political development which also brought about the rise of New Labour : the retreat of class struggle both internationally and in the UK , the related retreat of social democracy which sought to represent the working class , and the increase of social mobility as a result of the post - war settlement .
An important question is how the ' British muslim community ' was created from the existing muslim communities in Britain , and why this development did not lead to other national identifications such as , for example , a ' British Black community ' .
In order to answer this question , we will first consider the creation and characters of the concrete communities of immigrants in Britain , their differences and the specificity of south Asian muslim communities .
Next we will see how two historical factors ( the application of the so - called ' multiculturalist ' strategies in the UK and the rise of political Islam ) contributed to the formation of the present concept of ' British muslim community ' and the creation of a body which represents it .
In particular , we will see how the same social and historical context promoted , on the one hand , the ascendance of a highly politicized Asian middle class , able to constitute a representative body for an abstractly defined ' muslim community ' at a national level .
Yet , on the other hand , this same social and historical context tended to increasingly divide the concrete Asian communities .
We will also see that these two aspects of the ' British muslim community ' , its concrete division and abstract unity , were necessary and opposite and reflected a dynamic of mutual support and power antagonisms between the petit bourgeoisie within the muslim communities and the ascendant middle class .
In this section we will consider the context created by the retreat of class struggle and the establishment of the socio-political strategy of ' multiculturalism ' .
This strategy was first pioneered in the 1980s by new left Labour in the Great London Council ( GLC ) and other councils with a large presence of black / Asian populations as a response to the anti racist riots which had threatened the political stability of Britain - and was later developed at a national level under the New Labour government .
We will look at the relation between the ideology behind the multiculturalist strategy ( which we have introduced in the previous part ) and its concrete nature as a specific class alliance .
We will also see how this strategy aimed at dividing the working class along ethnic lines and encouraged , as a consequence , increasing divisions within the concrete Asian communities .
The largest waves of immigration came to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s , and were mainly from the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent , major parts of the British empire .
In the '50s the government , started a campaign of recruitment of manpower from the West Indies in order to fill the demand for labour of the post - war boom .
Young men mostly from Jamaica and Barbados were used to fill labour demands for menial work in the public sector ( National Health Service , British National Rail , bus services etc. ) .
Also , following the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , thousands of Indians and Pakistanis ( including people from the area which would become Bangladesh ) emigrated to Britain .
People from south Asia tended to find jobs in factories in industrialized areas of England , some of them , who had capital to invest , opened corner shops or ran post offices .
Following the Indo - Pakistani war of 1971 a new wave of Pakistani and Bangladeshi people arrived and settled in Britain .
Until the Commonwealth Immigrants
Act of 1962 all Commonwealth citizens were be able to come to Britain without any restrictions .
However , from the 1960s through the 1970s British legislation increasingly limited immigration , while however facilitating the arrival of spouses and close relatives through so - called ' family reunification schemes ' .
These family reunification schemes were historically fundamental for the creation of immigrants ' communities in Britain .
Immigrants from same areas tended to cluster together in areas where rents were cheaper , people spoke the same language or , when it was the case , they already
I ’ve thought a lot about having children over the years .
Not so much whether I wanted to have them , but why people in general want to have them .
More specifically , I ’ve been trying to determine whether or not it ’s becoming immoral to do so .
Everyone knows that once a good parent has a child they become rather selfless .
We often hear things like , “ It changes everything ” , or , “ … all you care about is the baby . ” , etc .
That ’s fair enough and quite admirable , but what about before you had the child ?
What are the modern reasons for having kids in the first place ?
I have some rather unflattering ideas on how most people answer that question .
Everyone Else Was Doing It
Typical groupthink .
Chris and Julie had a child and it was just precious .
It seemed to make them happy .
Maybe we should do that too ?
It Just Happened , and I ’m Glad It Did
Typical adolescent mentality .
I was n’t really planning on this , but I can definitely see the attraction now that I ’m committed .
I guess I ’ll just go with it and embrace parenthood .
It ’s not like I have much of a choice at this point , and I was probably going to do it later anyway .
It ’s What You ’re Supposed to Do
Typical mature conservative .
Grow up , go to college , get a job , get married , have kids .
Natural .
Basic .
Timeless .
That ’s what we ’ve been doing for thousands of years .
It ’s what we ’re supposed to do .
Ok , so if I ’m arguing that these are not good reasons ( although the “ nature ” argument is the best of them ) , then what are good reasons for having a child ?
That ’s my problem — I do n’t really see any .
Not in today ’s world anyway .
I see excellent reasons for being a good parent once you have a child , but not for bringing a new life into the world in the first place .
I ’m toying with the idea that having children in a world where there are children awaiting adoption ( and where overpopulation is a real issue ) ultimately reduces to selfishness .
I think the reason people become parents comes down to one thing : desire .
People want kids .
They want their own kids .
That ’s perfectly understandable , of course , as we are programmed to want things that help us survive as a species .
But that does n’t make it right .
We have plenty of other desires given to us by our biology that we control for the benefit of society .
Perhaps the desire to procreate is simply one to be added to that list .
It ’s a strange thing to contemplate , but the real reason we seek to bring children into the world is for our own benefit .
Children bring us joy .
They ’re there to take care of us when we age .
Children are selfish expressions all the way up until they are born .
At that point we become mostly selfless , but we ca n’t use our selflessness after they are born to justify the selfish act of bringing them into the world .
In earlier times we needed to reproduce in order to keep ourselves alive .
We have plenty of people now .
Some believe that they ’re providing a service to humanity .
They feel their belief system needs to be expanded , and that creating a few offspring is the best way to make it happen .
Aside from the highly self - important slant of that approach , i.e .
I ’m going to help better the world with my seed , it does n’t seem very efficient .
So what are good reasons for logical and compassionate people , living in today ’s world , to have children ? :

Let 's say you want your computer fixed or your software explained .
You can shell out big bucks to the Geek Squad , or you can ask — but you can't hire — a typical teenager , or even a preteen .
Their experience with computers and the online world is vastly superior to that of most people over the age of 30 .
From the point of view of online technology , it is the young who rule .
And yet they are professionally powerless : they are forbidden by law from earning wages from their expertise .
Might these folks have something to offer the workplace ?
And might the young benefit from a bit of early work experience , too ?
Perhaps — but we 'll never know , thanks to antiquated federal , state , and local laws that make it a crime to hire a kid .
Pop culture accepts these laws as a normal part of national life , a means to forestall a Dickensian nightmare of sweat shops and the capitalist exploitation of children .
It 's time we rid ourselves of images of children tied to rug looms in the developing world .
The kids I 'm talking about are one of the most courted of all consumer sectors .
Society wants them to consume , but law forbids them to produce .
You might be surprised to know that the laws against " child labor " do not date from the 18th century .
Indeed , the national law against child labor did n't pass until the Great Depression — in 1938 , with the Fair Labor Standards Act .
It was the same law that gave us a minimum wage and defined what constitutes full - time and part - time work .
It was a handy way to raise wages and lower the unemployment rate : simply define whole sectors of the potential workforce as unemployable .
By the time this legislation passed , however , it was mostly a symbol , a classic case of Washington chasing a trend in order to take credit for it .
Youth labor was expected in the 17th and 18th centuries — even welcome , since remunerative work opportunities were newly present .
But as prosperity grew with the advance of commerce , more kids left the workforce .
By 1930 , only 6.4 percent of kids between the ages of 10 and 15 were actually employed , and 3 out of 4 of those were in agriculture .
In wealthier , urban , industrialized areas , child labor was largely gone , as more and more kids were being schooled .
Cultural factors were important here , but the most important consideration was economic .
More developed economies permit parents to " purchase " their children 's education out of the family 's surplus income — if only by foregoing what would otherwise be their earnings .
The law itself , then , forestalled no nightmare , nor did it impose one .
In those days , there was rising confidence that education was the key to saving the youth of America .
Stay in school , get a degree or two , and you would be fixed up for life .
Of course , that was before academic standards slipped further and further , and schools themselves began to function as a national child - sitting service .
Today , we are far more likely to recognize the contribution that disciplined work makes to the formation of character .
And yet we are stuck with these laws , which are incredibly complicated once you factor in all state and local variations .
Kids under the age of 16 are forbidden to earn income in remunerative employment outside a family business .
If dad is a blacksmith , you can learn to pound iron with the best of 'em .
But if dad works for a law firm , you are out of luck .
From the outset , federal law made exceptions for kid movie stars and performers .
Why ?
It probably has something to do with how Shirley Temple led box - office receipts from 1934 –1938 .
She was one of the highest earning stars of the period .
If you are 14 or 15 , you can ask your public school for a waiver and work a limited number of hours when school is not in session .
And if you are in private school or home school , you must go ask your local Social Service Agency — not exactly the most welcoming bunch .
The public school itself is also permitted to run work programs .
This point about approved labor is an interesting one , if you think about it .
The government does n't seem to mind so much if a kid spends all nonschool hours away from the home , family , and church , but it forbids them from engaging in private - sector work during the time when they would otherwise be in public schools drinking from the well of civic culture .
The legal exemption is also made for delivering newspapers , as if bicycles rather than cars were still the norm for this activity .
Here is another strange exemption : " youth working at home in the making of wreaths composed of natural holly , pine , cedar , or other evergreens ( including the harvesting of the evergreens ) . "
Perhaps the wreath lobby was more powerful during the Great Depression than in our own time ?
Oh , and there is one final exemption , as incredible as this may be : federal law allows states to allow kids to work for a state or local government at any age , and there are no hourly restrictions .
Virginia , for example , allows this .
The exceptions cut against the dominant theory of the laws that it is somehow evil to " commodify " the labor of kids .
If it is wonderful to be a child movie star , congressional page , or home - based wreath maker , why it is wrong to be a teenage software fixer , a grocery bagger , or ice - cream scooper ?
It makes no sense .
Once you get past the exceptions , the bottom line is clear : full - time work in the private sector , for hours of their own choosing , is permitted only to those " children " who are 18 and older — by which time a child has already passed the age when he can be influenced toward a solid work ethic .
What is lost in the bargain ?
Kids no longer have the choice to work for money .
Parents who believe that their children would benefit from the experience are at a loss .
Consumers who would today benefit from our teens ' technological knowhow have no commercial way to do so .
They have been forcibly excluded from the matrix of exchange .
There is a social - cultural point , too .
Employers will tell you that most kids coming out of college are radically unprepared for a regular job .
It 's not so much that they lack skills or that they can't be trained ; it 's that they do n't understand what it means to serve others in a workplace setting .
They resent being told what to do , tend not to follow through , and work by the clock instead of the task .
In other words , they are not socialized into how the labor market works .
Indeed , if we perceive a culture of sloth , irresponsibility , and entitlement among today 's young , perhaps we ought to look here for a contributing factor .
The law is rarely questioned today .
But it is a fact that child - labor laws did n't come about easily .
It took more than a hundred years of wrangling .
The first advocates of keeping kids out of factories were women 's labor unions , who did n't appreciate the low - wage competition .
And true to form , labor unions have been reliable exclusionists ever since .
Opposition did not consist of mining companies looking for cheap labor , but rather parents and clergy alarmed that a law against child labor would be a blow against freedom .
They predicted that it would amount to the nationalization of children , which is to say that the government rather than the parents or the child would emerge as the final authority and locus of decision - making .
To give you a flavor of the opposition , consider this funny " Beatitude " read by Congressman Fritz G. Lanham of Texas on the US House floor in 1924 , as a point of opposition to a child - labor ban then being considered :
Consider the Federal agent in the field ; he toils not , nor does he spin ; and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his populous household was not arrayed with powers like one of these .
Children , obey your agents from Washington , for this is right .
Honor thy father and thy mother , for the Government has created them but a little lower than the Federal agent .
Love , honor , and disobey them .
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , tell it to thy father and mother and let them do it .
Six days shalt thou do all thy rest , and on the seventh day thy parents shall rest with thee .
Go to the bureau officer , thou sluggard ; consider his ways and be idle .
Toil , thou farmer 's wife ; thou shalt have no servant in thy house , nor let thy children help thee .
And all thy children shall be taught of the Federal agent , and great shall be the peace of thy children .
Thy children shall rise up and call the Federal agent blessed .
In every way , the opponents were right .
Child - labor laws were and are a blow against the freedom to work and a boost in government authority over the family .
The political class thinks nothing of legislating on behalf of " the children , " as if they are the first owners of all kids .
Child - labor laws were the first big step in this direction , and the rest follows .
If the state can dictate to parents and kids the terms under which teens can be paid , there is essentially nothing they cannot control .
There is no sense in arguing about the details of the law .
The critical question concerns the locus of decision - making : family or state ?
Private markets or the public sector ?
In so many ways , child - labor laws are an anachronism .
There is no sense of speaking of exploitation as if this were the early years of the industrial revolution .
Kids as young as 10 can surely contribute their labors in some tasks in ways that would help them come to grips with the relationship between work and reward .
They will better learn to respect private forms of social authority outside the home .
They will come to understand that some things are expected of them in life .
And after they finish college and enter the workforce , it wo n't come as such a shock the first time they are asked to do something that may not be their first choice .
We know the glorious lessons that are imparted from productive work .
What lesson do we impart with child - labor laws ?
We establish early on who is in charge : not individuals , not parents , but the state .
We tell the youth that they are better off being mall rats than fruitful workers .
We tell them that they have nothing to offer society until they are 18 or so .
We convey the impression that work is a form of exploitation from which they must be protected .
We drive a huge social wedge between parents and children and lead kids to believe that they have nothing to learn from their parents ' experience .
We rob them of what might otherwise be the most valuable early experiences of their young adulthood .
In the end , the most compelling case for getting rid of child - labor laws comes down to one central issue : the freedom to make a choice .
Those who think young teens should do nothing but languish in classrooms in the day and play Wii at night will be no worse off .
But those who see that remunerative work is great experience for everyone will cheer to see this antique regulation toppled .
Maybe then the kids of America can put their computer skills to use doing more than playing World of Warcraft .
Led Zeppelin guitar legend , Jimmy Page , today launched the Royal Mail ’s much awaited New Year stamp collection featuring ten of the most iconic album covers of the last 40 years .
The cover of Led Zeppelin ’s 32 million - selling album , IV , which Page helped create , is one of ten celebrated designs featured in the ‘ Classic Album Covers ’ collection .
Each depicts a famous album cover with a disc coming out of the sleeve and appearing ‘ outside ’ the stamp .
Other memorable covers which have been immortalised in the range include the racing greyhounds of Blur ’s Parklife , the astonishing statues of Pink Floyd ’s Division Bell and the bent chromed pipe which graces the cover of Mike Oldfield ’s seminal 70s album , Tubular Bells .
Celebrating the work of the album sleeve rather than of the music itself , the new stamp collection features the photography of Pennie Smith ( The Clash ’s London Calling ) , a cake baked by the then unknown Delia Smith ( Rolling Stones ’ Let it bleed ) and a painting of an anonymous faggot - bearing man which is said to have been found by Led Zeppelin ’s Robert Plant in a Reading junk shop ( IV ) .
Despite massive sales of the album worldwide , nobody knows the name of the man in the painting , nor the artist who painted him .
The full list is below .
Royal Mail carried out extensive research to agree the final ten , trawling through thousands of albums in the process .
The new stamp collection goes on sale on Thursday 7th January 2010 .
THE ALBUM COVERS
Rolling Stones / Let It Bleed ( 1969 )
Designed by Robert Brownjohn , the sleeve sculpture was based on the initial album title of ‘ Automatic Changer ’ with the added cake created by the then unknown Delia Smith .
Led Zeppelin /’IV ’ ( 1971 )
The band ’s fourth album had no mention of their name on the cover .
The painting of the faggot - bearing old man was , it is said , found by singer Robert Plant in a Reading junk shop .
For the cover it was nailed to a demolished house in Dudley .
David Bowie / The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars ( 1972 )
Heddon Street in London ’s West End is the scene for the painting .
Photographer Brian Ward helped to conceptualise Bowie ’s notion of the alien pop star and the sleeve was designed by George Underwood with artwork by Terry Pastor .
Mike Oldfield / Tubular Bells ( 1973 )
Designer and photographer Trevor Key brought Oldfield ’s conception to life , of bent chrome metal piping cut out and overplayed on a photo of sea breaking on the south coast .
The Clash / London Calling ( 1979 )
The third album from the band features Pennie Smith ’s iconic shot of bassist Paul Simonon , considered one of the greatest rock photos of all time .
Ray Lowry designed the artwork , paying homage to Elvis Presley ’s debut album .
New Order / Power , Corruption and Lies ( 1983 )
Peter Saville ’s design juxtaposed French impressionist Henri Fantin - Latour ’s painting with a colour - coded strip .
Primal Scream / Screamadelica ( 1991 )
Paul Cannell became the in -house artist for the Heavenly and Creation record labels .
For Creation he created this iconic image for Primal Scream ’s album .
Pink Floyd / The Division Bell ( 1994 )
Pink Floyd ’ final studio album featured gigantic metal heads in long - time collaborator Storm Thorgerson ’s design .
The heads were drawn by Keith Breedon , sculpted by John Robertson and stood over nine - feet tall .
Positioned in a field in Cambridgeshire , they were photographed over a two week period .
Blur / Parklife ( 1994 )
Blur ’s third album distilled the essence of London , and the racing greyhounds were captured by photographer Bob Thomas , and the sleeve designed by Chris Thomson and Rob O'Connor of London design firm Stylorouge .
Blur is an EMI artist .
Coldplay / A Rush of Blood to the Head ( 2002 )
Chris Martin of Coldplay saw this arresting image in Dazed and Confused magazine , and wanted it for the album cover .
It is the work of Norwegian photographer Solve Sundsbo , and the result of medical imaging technology .
Coldplay is an EMI artist .
Crikey readers weigh in on asylum seekers and the population debate .
Why are people migrating to Australia and is immigration the best way to grow our population ?
Asylum seekers :
James Burke writes : Re . “ Government has lost control of the asylum seeker debate — but can the Coalition profit from it ? ” ( yesterday , item 3 ) .
Much of the current population “ debate ” draws its heat from one astonishingly dumb attempt at spin by Kevin Rudd = his declaration that he was in favour of a “ Big Australia ” .
This vapid utterance not only showed contempt for those sensibly worried about the effects of massive , rapid and apparently endless population rise — whose concerns have been voiced by Bob Brown , Dick Smith , and Kev ’s own comrade Kelvin Thomson — it also handed the xenophobes a club with which to belt the government every time the issue arises
The main drivers of recent excessive immigration were the “ skilled ” migrant and international “ student ” rorts brought in by the Howard government , designed to drive up property prices and provide Australia ’s lazy and rapacious bosses with cheap , malleable labour .
( All the while distracting the yobs by exploiting their irrational hatred of marine refugees . )
Those who claim there are vast and inevitable forces driving “ labour shortages ” ignore the massive increase in so - called “ service ” industries over recent years .
Twenty years ago there simply was n’t a need for mobile dog grooming services , organic juice bars , adjunct human resources ( creatives and innovators ) technicians * and 24 - hour McCafes .
A cynic might suggest there still is n’t .
Labour shortages are mostly artificial , created by our seeming inability to resist consumption at all times and places .
It ’s to the government ’s credit that they ’ve moved to stop the rorts , but had they been quicker to shake off the melodious mantras of the business lobbies , and cannier about publicising what they were doing , they could have saved themselves a lot of grief .
By the way , could the overpopulation boosters please develop a consistent argument ?
Is a stable population headed towards the dread fate of moribund Japan , or towards ever higher interest rates ?
It ca n’t be both , surely .
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

Alan Kennedy writes :
As the opposition cooks up a very ugly brew of xenophobia , racism and ignorance with its boat people / migration debate let ’s get one thing clear .
Being “ tougher ” means killing asylum seekers whether by neglect or by direct action of our naval personnel .
Tony Abbott says he will turn them back How ?
He ca n’t just say , “ off you go you ’re not wanted here ” .
So the navy will have to tow the boats out of Australian waters or fire on them to make them turn back .
If , as usually happens , the boat is scuttled or it falls apart under tow and people end up in the water what are the Navy ’s orders then ?
If we are to believe Tony Abbott , the orders will be leave them in the water to drown .
He will be cheered on the ignoramuses of talk back radio and their loyal band of followers .
But it ’s time for Tony and the original Sutherland Shire Bogan Scott Morrison to own up and admit that turning back means murdering the asylum seekers .
Of course it wo n’t be them getting blood on their hands .
It will be the young men and women of our Defence Force asked to do this .
Perhaps to spare them this horrible task Tony , Scott and their gibbering mates in the media could run asylum seeker hunting parties .
Hadley could advertise them on his radio station .
Make a change from following the Kangaroos on a tour of England .
Finally let ’s remember , there have been just 30,000 people arrive by boat in the past 30 years .
It ’s pathetic that this issue can still get the traction it does .
Les Heimann writes : Re. Yesterday ’s editorial .
I for one am grateful to Crikey for running a number of pieces covering many angles involving the entire migration debate .
Population is a strategic matter for this country — probably the most important issue we face .
In plain speak — Australia needs to sort out just what sort of country and life style it wants including what population it wants to aim at and how to go about achieving the whole thing without wrecking ourselves in the process .
Xavier Herbert , in his book Poor Fellow My Country ( excellent as a door stopper ) used the expression “ Australia Felix ” .
He saw Australia definitely as part of Asia and its future people as “ light brown ” .
We are too much concerned with sameness — we fear the invading horde and too many politicians play on the demons within us — just as too many politicians have n’t the guts to lead us away from divisiveness .
Individually one must sincerely hope , perhaps expect , that cheap and popular positioning over so called illegal immigrants stops and is replaced by rational debate and a genuine airing of all the issues .
People migrate to Australia essentially for two main reasons :
They want to better themselves ( read immigrants ) .
They or their families will be killed unless they get out from where they are ( read refugees ) .
So let ’s get the terminology right to begin with and let us do what we can to achieve an objective discussion on the whole bloody thing .
Ken Lambert writes : Re. “ Mungo : asylum seeking — the rhetoric is hotting up ” ( yesterday , item 18 ) & “ Malcolm Fraser : we should be proud of our record as a migrant nation ” ( yesterday , item 13 ) .
What could you learn from Malcolm Fraser and Mungo McCallum about asylum seeker arrivals ?
Well for a start you could learn that these fellow travellers of the left regularly spray their * holier than thou* missives of moral superiority over the great unwashed who are very uneasy about boats arriving every second day .
Malcolm , while disappointed by Mugabe , still thinks he is eminently qualified to pontificate on race relations and immigration .
You might learn that M&M happily dismiss the obvious and common sense moral problem of this new self - select method of immigration — the $ 10,000 it costs to get to Oz by people smuggler .
Could Malcolm and Mungo enlighten us as to the moral difference between setting up a window in a place of refuge overseas with a sign which says “ those who have $ 10,000 please come forward , and the Australian Govt will speed your passage to Australia ” ?
“ You will be regarded as one of our ‘ refugee ’ intake and the rest of you poor bastards who do n’t have a razoo can watch these $ 10,000 tourists take your place ” .
“ Oh and to make sure you are enterprising enough — you must take a seven day dangerous boat ride to qualify ” .
Of course Malcolm never studied comparative morality in his political education — but we should be thankful that he never claimed ( Rudd - like ) to have phoned and apologised to his partner immediately on waking up in his jocks in a colourful Memphis motel .
Malcolm Turnbull :
Andrew Haughton writes : Re. “ Turnbull departs — but where is his party heading ? ” ( yesterday , item 1 ) .
Farewell Malcolm Turnbull , too bright by far for the average Canberra politician .
Welcome Andrew Robb who will add a broad splash of beige to the colour on the Opposition front bench .
His press conference yesterday reminded us that he has all the warmth and charisma of a bathroom tile .
We look forward to more of the same in the coming election campaign .
Counselling :
Sophie Li , PhD , Clinical Psychologist , writes : Re. “ Crikey clarifier : the regulation of counselling ” ( yesterday , item 16 ) .
I would like to express my concern regarding this article .
The public is currently very confused about the difference between psychiatrists , psychologists , clinical psychologists , counsellors and therapists ( to mention only a few ) and I agree the terms require elucidation .
However , the definitions provided are not only subjective but also misleading .
I believe it promotes counselling and counsellors when there are many people that require more clinically focused ( and heaven forbid , empirically supported ) interventions .
The information provided will only further confuse people who have accessed more factual information , and mislead those who use only this information to access services .
Qantas
Joe Boswell writes : Re . “ The media miss the mark on the real problems with Qantas ” ( yesterday , item 12 ) .
Ben Sandilands wrote :
This prima facie criminal failing on the part of Jetstar was followed by NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION by the ATSB .
There is something rotten in the public administration of air safety in Australia , and the government , the Opposition , and the general media are complicit in ignoring the situation .
Yes , there ’s something rotten , but let ’s not blame the ATSB .
It has no role or function of enforcement .
It does not apportion blame .
It cannot because the legislation under which it operates does not permit it .
As the ATSB says :
Under the TSI Act , it is not a function of the ATSB to apportion blame or provide a means for determining liability .
The ATSB does not investigate for the purpose of taking administrative , regulatory or criminal action .
The rot exists because the state and commonwealth governments are completely confused about whether ( in general , not just air transport ) to deal with safety by proactive advice , by inspection and audit , by licensing and permissioning , by reactive investigation and reporting , by enforcement including prosecution of regulations or by some incoherent combination of these .
That ’s still ignoring the bigger question of whether safety is separate from environmental regulation and how these relate to broader political concerns about public good and infrastructure security .
Neither do the governments have any clear idea how to handle the conflicts of interest that arise by giving agencies a combination of these functions or how to deal with the overlapping roles of multiple agencies all involved in the same things .
On top of that , there ’s confusion about whether such agencies should really be independent of political control and whether they should be financed by the industries they regulate .
And let ’s not forgot the entrenched problems of the Commonwealth trying to take over matters which constitutionally belong to the states .
It ’s all been so rotten for so long most people cannot detect the stink .
Jeremy Davis writes : Re. “ Tips and rumours ” ( yesterday , item 70 .
Crikey published the tip : “ When wondering why Qantas is flying ever closer to the edge , one of the important but seldom - mentioned issues is the age of its fleet . ”
The following information was found at www.airfleets.net for a selection of international carriers that operate to and from Australia :
Average fleet age in years , ( oldest to youngest ) : Air China – 14.8
United – 13.6
Delta – 13.5
Aerolineas Argentinas – 12.6
Thai – 12.6
Hawaiian Airlines – 11.7
British Airways – 11.5
Qantas – 10.8
Garuda – 10.3
Korean – 10
Air NZ – 9.8
Air Canada – 9.8
JAL – 9.7
Virgin Atlantic – 8.6
Vietnam Airlines – 7.4
China Southern – 7
China Eastern 6.9
Singapore – 6.7
Emirates – 5.8
Pacific Blue – 4.5
Jetstar – 3.9
V Australia – 1
The Qantas fleet is by no means geriatric .
In any case most of the “ incidents ” reported in the current Qantas feeding frenzy have involved some of their youngest aircraft — the A380 , A330 and 737-800 series .
I have no particular loyalty to Qantas and more often than not choose to fly other carriers .
Job figures :
Marcus L’Estrange writes : Re. “ Business as usual : Jobs ads slow here , while it ’s boom time in the US , especially for bankruptcies , jobs and cars … ” ( yesterday , item 23 ) .
Why Glenn Dyer uses the ANZ job survey figures is beyond me .
The latest Job Vacancy survey from the ABS found that we had 107,000 vacancies nationally with 600,000 unemployed chasing those vacancies , that ’s if you are silly enough to believe the monthly “ Labour Force ” ( LF ) figures or one vacancy for every 20 plus 2 million unemployed if you believe the real unemployment figures in the “ Persons not in the labour force survey ” ( PLFS ) .
Either way you have one vacancy for every 5 plus unemployed ( LF ) or more realistically one vacancy for every 20 plus , according to the PLF survey .
The ABS Vacancy Survey is far more reliable than the ANZ survey because it surveys all employers , not just those employers who advertise .
When wombats attack :
Jackie French writes : Re. “ Wombat assaults man outside his caravan “ , news.com.au , April 6 .
News published :
Jeff McClure from the Department of Sustainability and Environment ( DSE ) said it was highly unusual for a wombat to attack a person .
“ Wombats that are in an advanced stage of mange will become very agitated from the suffering and the irritation of the mange , ” he said .
He said if wombats are approached or feel threatened they will rush towards someone .
“ But it ’s not known that they will push the attack to where they would physically attack someone . ”
Wombats attack .
Not often .
Most wombats will growl , hiss , lunge or shriek , but not attack .
Yet anyone who lives with wild wombats for more than a few years will know at least one wombat — sometimes elderly , and cranky , though more often a female with young — who will attack if a human comes within a few metres .
Out of more than 200 wild wombats , I have known three who appeared to seek out humans to attack — two wild wombats , another human reared , who had learned that humans provide food , and became angry when that food did not arrive .
As I write this wombats are being culled under permits from the NSW National Parks , on the pretext that wombat populations — somehow , in the past 20 years of drought - have grown to pest proportions .
In South Australia Southern Hairy Nosed wombats are being culled by bulldozing over their burrows , so they slowly die from thirst and hunger .
Neither culls have even the most remotely relevant scientific data to show that they are needed .
We know all we need to about wombats .
They eat roots and leaves , push holes in fences , and make excellent supporting actors on TV , especially if dead and stuffed .
There are no broad scale studies of wombat numbers in Australia , beyond counts of road kill — no true guide to wombat numbers , as in droughts wombats may travel ten kilometres or more to eat the green pick on the sides of the road .
Private studies , such as my own , reveal widespread dramatic declines in wombat numbers leading to local extinctions , both from loss of habitat and from mange .
Mange in wild wombat populations can be controlled , but the only attempts to do this are private , with the relevant departments showing neither interest nor commitment … nor even the knowledge that a wombat will attack , especially if you tread on it , as was the case with the recent attack in Victoria .
A terrified animal tried to retaliate when it believed it was being attacked from above .
It is a tragedy for the people involved , as well as the wombat .
The ignorance of the various State Departments is the most tragic of all .
Disclosure : I am a director of The Wombat Foundation , but the views expressed above are my own .
President Barack Obama would like an opportunity for a televised exchange with Senate Republicans , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday .
Gibbs said that the administration would welcome an invitation for a televised exchange with the Senate GOP , similar to the extraordinary question - and - answer sessions with members of the House Republican Conference at their retreat last week .
" I believe we have been invited to speak to the Senate Republicans , and we will do so , " Gibbs said during his daily press briefing .
The televised session won plaudits from members of the media and other political observers for its openness .
" I think the President enjoyed the give and take on these issues of importance .
You guys seemed to think it was a worthwhile endeavor , " Gibbs told reporters .
" And I think opportunities like this for both sides are important to talk through our ideas . " :
Gibbs said the White House " would n't have any problem " with an exchange with Senate Republicans being open to TV cameras , too .
Today 15 new Assistant U.S. Attorneys and 20 FBI Special Agents were added to the U.S. Department of Justice ’s intellectual property protection task force to expand its ability to respond to these crimes .
Needless to say , the MPAA jumped for joy .
Said the lobbying group for the Hollywood studios : “ With its implementation of the IP Task Force and appointment of Victoria Espinel as the first - ever Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator , the Obama Administration has made it clear that stamping out practices that harm American ingenuity is a strong priority , and we applaud their efforts to combat this threat to creative workers . ”
Michael Macdonald of the Prospect union said : " Not only is it great news for local job security , but workers at Sheffield Forgemasters will be making a vital product to support new nuclear build in the UK , as well as the global market .
This deal provides yet more evidence that new build will bring jobs into the UK supply chain . "

Records from two nearly 100 - year - old shipwrecks , the Titanic and the Lusitania , have given researchers new insight into human selfishness — and altruism .
On one boat , it seems , the men thought only of themselves ; on the other , they were more likely to help women and children .
This occurred for one key reason , researchers said : time .
The Lusitania sank in about 18 minutes , while the Titanic took nearly three hours .
Women and children fared much better on the Titanic .
“ When you have to react very , very fast , human instincts are much faster than internalized social norms , ” said Benno Torgler , an economics professor at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane , Australia , and one of the authors of the study , published in the current issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ It ’s very nice to get a nice and controlled experiment , ” he said .
“ You ’re in the ship ; you can not go in and out .
We were looking for shipwrecks that were very similar — similar structure , similar rates of survival , only a couple of years apart . ”

In a piquant fundraising email to supporters Sunday — hard - edged even for the Democrats ’ newest quote machine — Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) went all out on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
His remarks , which came after Palin criticized him during a trip to Florida , are perhaps the sharpest attack made on the former vice presidential candidate by a member of Congress .
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking in Orlando on Friday , Palin said she “ got to meet quite a few candidates who are lining up in a contested primary who want to take out Alan Grayson . ”
She added : “ What can you say about Alan Grayson ?
Piper is with me tonight , so I wo n’t say anything about Alan Grayson that ca n’t be said around children . ”
Grayson ’s email reply was straight to the point .
He began by referring to Palin as “ the former half - term Governor , current - nothing and future - even - less , ” and snapped , “ Atypically , Palin was wearing clothes that she had paid for herself . ”
The email continues : “ In response to Palin ’s attack on Rep Grayson , Grayson actually complimented Palin .
Grayson praised Palin for having a hand large enough to fit Grayson ’s entire name on it .
He thanked Palin for alleviating the growing shortage of platitudes in Central Florida .
Grayson added that Palin deserved credit for getting through the entire hour - long program without quitting .
Grayson also said that Palin really had mastered Palin ’s imitation of Tina Fey imitating Palin .
Grayson observed that Palin is the most - intelligent leader that the Republican Party has produced since George W. Bush . ”
The Florida Democrat also introduced a reference to the recently released film , Alice in Wonderland .
ADVERTISEMENT
What effect might Palin ’s criticism have ?
he asked rhetorically .
“ As the Knave ’s horse says in Alice in Wonderland , ‘ dogs will believe anything , ' ” he replies .
“ I ’m sure Palin knows all about politics in Central Florida , since from her porch she can see Winter Park , ” part of Grayson ’s district .
The email continues :
Grayson said that the Alaskan chillbilly was welcome to return to Central Florida anytime , as long as she brings lots of money with her , and spends it .
“ I look forward to an honest debate with Governor Palin on the issues , in the unlikely event that she ever learns anything about them , ” Grayson added , alluding to Politifact ’s “ liar , liar , pants on fire ” evaluation of much of what Palin has said .
Scientists are studying Sarah Palin ’s travel between Alaska and Florida carefully .
They hope to learn more about the flight patterns of that elusive migratory species , the wild Alaskan dingbat .

Grayson ’s comparison of Palin to an elusive bird appears to be part of the congressman ’s flying animal repertoire : he used a bat as a metaphor for what he asserted was the “ bloodthirsty ” nature of former Vice President Dick Cheney in a TV appearance last October .
“ I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes , because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he ’s talking , ” Grayson said on Hardball .
“ But my response is this :
He ’s just angry because the president does n’t shoot old men in the face .
But by the way , when he was done speaking , did he just then turn into a bat and fly away ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Another memorable Grayson quote came the same month , when he said , “ Fox News and their Republican collaborators are the enemy of America .
They ’re the enemy of anybody who cares about health care in this country , the enemy of anybody who cares about educating their children , the enemy of anybody who wants energy independence or anything good for this country .
And certainly the enemy of peace , there ’s no doubt about that .
They are the enemy . ”
Last month , Mother Jones claimed that Grayson was spirited away during a coup in Niger by a Blackwater subsidiary , a company he has railed against , but it did n’t stop him from rebuking private US contractors .
“ The Congressman does not deny that there is admirable work being done by some employees of private contractors , ” spokesman Todd Jurkowski said .
“ However , he stands by his criticism of companies who have been found to cheat the American people , defraud our government , and unnecessarily risk the lives of members of our military , all in the name of making a profit . ”
Hey !
Do you remember the cult - hit Kevin Smith movie Mallrats that graced the silver screen in 1995 ?
Man. 1995 .
Those were the days …
All the kids and their crazy long hair , tying their flannels around their waists , wearing their Airwalk sneakers , listening to Bush ( not the president ….
the band ) on their portable discman that used to DRAIN the AA batteries , as they go to the mall and waste the day away .
You ever wonder what happened to all the people that starred in that film ?
I do .
Well , up until this weekend , I did .
This weekend I rented yet another mockbuster movie to add to my ever - growing repertoire of bad films :
The Terminators which stars the former Mallrats cutie - pie , Jeremy London .
Now , this is either the third or the fourth mockbuster in a row that I ’ve rented .
My memory is starting to get hazy as one dumb movie is blending into another .
I do n’t know how much more I can stand .
At this point it ’s like intentionally slamming your hand in a car door .
Sure , maybe you can do it once to show off how stupid you are to your friends while drunk .
Two times in a row , you ca n’t hide the tears that are welling in your eyes .
Four times in a row … you start thinking about a trip to the hospital because your ring finger is starting to look like a squashed grape .
Mentally , that ’s pretty much how I felt after watching The Terminators .
I do this to myself for you , dear readers .
It ’s out of love that I mentally scar myself , much like how Van Gogh cut off his own ear to give to the woman of his desires .
Do you see how I show my love to you by hurting myself ?
No ?
Well …
Then kindly return my mentally gifted ear .
Thank you .
To those of you who accept my psychic ear - gift , please read on .
The Plot
The Terminators takes place just outside of future Los Angeles .
Humanity has technologically evolved to the point where we can build cyborg slaves called TR units .
To remotely control the TR units , we ’ve also built a gigantic orbiting space station complete with Star Destroyer - like tractor beams and defense turrets .
Apparently in the future , we ’re much dumber than we are now , because instead of making all the robots look like Dita Von Teese , we make them all look look steroid junkies and dress them all in identical black tank tops and green cargo pants .
Oh , and we give them all fully - automatic hand guns .
Need a TR unit to paint your house ?
Take this one that looks like he eats kittens for the crunchy enjoyment .
He comes complete with his own gun for opening up those pesky paint cans .
Would you to take home a TR unit to make your Taco Bell runs for you ?
Then you can become the proud owner of this TR unit that looks like he uses the phrase “ make you my bitch ” at least once a day .
Need someone to cuddle with on those lonely nights after downloading terrabyte after terrabyte of hardcore pornography ?
You guessed it !
The TR unit that looks like he starts fights at gradeschool football games is just for you !
He ’s truly the one - robot solution to all your fantasies no matter how mundane or filthy .
Seriously , pay attention , future selves !
If we decide against my proposed Dita Von Teesebot design ( patent pending ) , then at least give our future murderers SEMI automatic hand guns .
It might give a few of us a running chance after we delete all the inappropriate material from our hard drives so our mothers / wives / husbands do n’t realize what pigs we are after we ’re dead .
Anyway , enough about my personal pron contingency plans… back to the plot .
All the world ’s steroid - slaves go haywire and kill the crap out of everyone including the president and his cabinet .
It ’s up to a rag - tag group of perky individuals with handguns to escape LA , find a way to shut down the TR units , and then go back to living their plucky lives .
Not once is the word “ Terminator ” ever spoken in the film .
The first half hour of the movie slowly drags by as the director tries desperately at what can only be described as “ character development . ”
But in reality , I felt like I was eaves dropping on the conversations of people who lead less exciting lives than me .
Once the TR units snap and the killing starts , the movie plays out a lot like a zombie film as the survivors move from one safe location to another .
And surprisingly , that part of the film was n’t too bad .
I found myself enjoying it .
Why they had to rip off The Terminator franchise name is beyond me .
They could have ripped off the Romero franchise and made a halfway decent zombie movie .
I ’m really dubious that Romero has the rights to every single ________ of the Dead movie title .
[ Dawn of the Living Dead ?
Farm of the Dead ?
Day of the Flesh Eaters ?
Just tossing out some ideas . ]
In the wilderness , the remaining survivors run into a long - haired , gun-toting , religious , camo trucker hat - wearing , turkey - necked Jeremy London who saves the weary travelers with a special pulse rifle .
Booyah !
I am the future NRA !
In an expected turn of events , Kurt — London ’s character — is the original designer of the TR robots .
He becomes the unofficial leader of the remaining human escapees ; the pregnant widow , the slutty girl ( who actually bangs the widow ’s husband BEFORE he dies ) , the whiny young guy , the tough girl , and the loyal old guy .
They need to find some rocket fuel , fly into space and turn off the Terminators …
I mean … TR units .
Tough girl dies first .
The rest make it into space where the team finds out the loyal old guy is actually a new version of TR units and they all accept him for being a good guy .
London tries to hack the super computer ’s mainframe on the space station but fails because it ’s too sophisticated even for his super brain .
Whiny guy has his jaw torn off ( thank god ) .
London gets pwned by the super terminator that lives on the space station .
Old guy sacrifices himself out the airlock with the super terminator .
Pregnant girl hides from the remaining TR units on the space station .
And the slutty girl stops all the TR units and saves the world by pulling the plug out of a breaker panel too small for a 2 bedroom apartment , let alone a multi-trillion dollar space station .
That ’ll teach you next time , Kurt .
Haxor skillz not up to the test ?
Try the pulling the plug in the corner , dipshit .
Oh right … you ca n’t read this .
You ’re dead .
Needless to say , the storyline is atrocious .
The special effects are pretty bad but the acting is almost passable for a movie of its pedigree .
Aside from the super - bit parts , London actually delivers the worst performance of the main crew .
I ca n’t even recommend this movie for a hilarious afternoon rental with some friends and some beer .
You ’ll probably lose a friend or two if you make them sit through this .
It ’s too bad to be laughed at .
I highly doubt this will ever make its way even to the SyFy Channel ’s Saturday afternoon line - up .
[ Wait … .
I typed too soon .
After some light googling , I ’ve found that The Terminators did appear on “ Syfy ’s Summer of Schlock . ”
Oh Syfy .
Ca n’t we just watch reruns of Lost in Space and Dark Shadows … or MST3K ? ]
Before you go , dear reader , the morals of the story are :
1 . You ’ll only live through the robotpocalypse if you own a hand gun .
Even though hand guns have no effect on our future robot - masters , it definitely increases your odds .
Get your ass to your local dealer today .
2. Steroid - bot idea = bad .
Mid-1980s Valerie Bertinellibot idea = better .
Dita Von Teesebot idea = WIN .
Christina Hendricksbot = too hot .
Work will never be done and humanity will die off before the machines become self - aware and uprise .
Dial design idea back to Dita Von Teesebot .
3 . Despite what other horror movies have taught you , the slutty girl does not die at the hands of the killer / killers .
Stick with her because she knows how to unplug things .
4 . If for some reason you are able to go back in time to 1995 , please warn Jeremy London about his post - Mallrats career .

US military presence in Afghanistan may have rare bipartisan consensus in Washington , but a bipartisan trio of lawmakers are dissatisfied with the open - ended occupation and are calling for a change in strategy .
New legislation introduced by Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Reps. Jim McGovern ( D - MA ) and Walter Jones ( R- NC ) would require President Barack Obama to implement a flexible timetable to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and update Congress on its progress every three months .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ A large , open - ended presence in Afghanistan is counterproductive to our global fight against al Qaeda , ” said Feingold , who assailed the idea of a “ nation - building strategy in a country that is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t even Al - Qaeda ’s base ” and called for a “ timetable to end our massive presence in Afghanistan . ”
Feingold , McGovern and Jones said the strategy should focus on counterinsurgency and fighting Al - Qaeda , arguing that a major long - term presence in the region costing hundreds of billions of dollars and stretching the military thin is hindering that goal .
“ The American people deserve accountability Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in terms of how and when our troops will be returned to their families and in terms of how taxpayer dollars are being spent , ” said McGovern .
The military occupation began in October 2001 , just weeks after the attacks of September 11 , to topple the Taliban government and hunt down Al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
Eight and a half years later , with tens of thousands of lives lost , the Taliban government has been replaced with one friendlier to the West but bin Laden remains nowhere to be found .
However , the fear of a Taliban resurgence has propelled military leaders to keep troops in the region .

President Obama , like his predecessor George W. Bush , has been a consistent and vigorous supporter of the war , casting it as necessary in the fight against Islamic extremism .
He has labeled it “ not only a war worth fighting ” but one that is “ fundamental to the defense of our people . ”
“ Our defense review is taking a top - to - bottom look at our priorities and posture , questioning conventional wisdom , rethinking old dogmas and challenging the status quo , ” Obama said last year before the Veterans of Foreign Wars .
“ We ’re asking hard questions about the forces we need and the weapons we buy . ”
In a sign that the strategy may be going awry , President Hamid Karzai this month accused the United States of gaming Afghan elections and threatened to join the Taliban insurgency .
ADVERTISEMENT
The three lawmakers referenced this in a letter to Obama this week , noting that continued military presence “ makes us dependent upon an unreliable partner in the Afghan government , as recent events highlight . ”
Violence in the region has seen a considerable uptick this year , and in February the death toll for US troops crossed 1,000 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Feingold has been a vocal opponent of the Afghanistan war for years , and last December warned that Obama ’s strategy to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to the country would backfire .
“ I do not support the president ’s decision to send additional troops to fight a war in Afghanistan that is no longer in our national security interest , ” Feingold said .
The head of Victoria 's Country Fire Authority ( CFA ) Russell Rees has announced his resignation , after coming under mounting criticism for the CFA 's handling of the Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people .
Mr Rees announced he was standing down at a press conference in Melbourne this morning , saying : " I am making the decision to go now so that the future of the CFA is assured . "
" Now is the time to change .
Now is the time for CFA to look forward . "
Mr Rees rejected suggestions he was forced out because of his performance on Black Saturday .
" This decision is mine .
I came to the conclusion at the end of the season , consulted with my family , consulted with the CEO , and now is the right time , " he said .
Struggling to control his emotions at times , Mr Rees said it was important to stay on after Black Saturday to guide the organisation through a difficult time .
But he is leaving in July , 18 months before the end of his contract , and before the Royal Commission 's final report .
" It would be inappropriate of me to stay on , and then leave half way through what I see as being a major change period that will come out of the recommendations of the Commission , " he said .
He declined to make any final assessment of his performance on Black Saturday , saying that was up to the commission to decide .
Mr Rees says his legacy will be the work he has done in implementing new management systems and safety systems for firefighters .
Reaction
Victorian Premier John Brumby says he understands and supports Mr Rees ' decision to quit .
" It opens up new opportunities for the organisation and I think these are the things the very things that Russell would see going forward , " he said .
" That new blood can come in , further changes can be made and the organisation can be furthered strengthened in the future . "
Emergency Services Commissioner Bruce Esplin praised Mr Rees as a hardworking career fire officer who was a passionate and strong champion for the volunteers of the CFA .
He said he believes Mr Rees considered resigning after the bushfires but decided to stay .
" Perhaps it was harder to remain as chief and carry the organisation through the first year of the Royal Commission and the next summer .
And I think he decided that was the hard and appropriate thing to do , " he said .
He said Mr Rees is putting the CFA first .
" His advice to me was he wanted to put the organisation first and give it the chance to appoint a new chief fire officer to take it into the future . "
Mr Esplin said Mr Rees should be credited with helping the CFA work more closely with the DSE .
But Mr Esplin does not necessarily support a union call for amalgamation .
" Amalgamation is not the only answer to achieving the change and improvements that are necessary .
Sometimes you lose more than you gain . "
Peter Marshall , from the United Firefighters ' Union , has thanked Mr Rees for his service .
" Certainly like all firefighters , he 's done the best he could [ have ] at the time .
And no doubt we all have the benefit of hindsight , " he said .
The president of the Volunteer Fire Brigades Association , Gary Lewis , has thrown its support behind Mr Rees .
He says Mr Rees ' service can not be judged on the events of one day .
" There [ are ] a lot of things that Russell has done over the years since he 's been chief officer [ that ] have [ contributed to ] outstanding growth for CFA , " he said .
" Chief officer standing orders , management of the operations side of CFA has been really outstanding over the years . "
The solar system may have formed from the ashes of a massive star like WR124 ( pictured ) , which is shedding vast amounts of material in winds ( Image : Y. Grosdidier et al. / WFPC2/HST/NASA )
The solar system may have been born inside the remains of a single star that ran away from its family , rather than from a tight - knit clan of stars .
If so , it may be more unusual than previously thought .
Meteorites that contain bits of rock called calcium - aluminium - rich inclusions suggest that the solar system may have formed very quickly from the ashes of other stars .
That ’s because the inclusions formed with the radioactive isotope aluminium - 26 , which is forged inside stars tens of times as massive as the sun and decays with a half - life of only 720,000 years .
Such massive stars tend to form in clusters , and they shed material in roiling winds that can cool down and seed planetary systems .
Advertisement
Too hot
But Vincent Tatischeff of the National Center for Scientific Research in Orsay , France , and colleagues suspect a massive star cluster would have been have been so hot that most of the Al - 26 would have decayed before planets could congeal .
Instead , they suggest the solar system sprang from a solitary star ’s ashes , which could have cooled more quickly .
To account for the amount of Al - 26 observed in meteorites , the star would still have had to be massive , meaning it probably formed in a clutch of other stars .
At some point , it may have been flung out of its birth cluster by gravitational tussles with its siblings or the explosion of a companion .
“ The scenario may look complicated , but we think it is the most likely origin of the aluminium - 26 in the solar system , ” Tatischeff says .
Ocean worlds
As it zipped through interstellar space , the star would have released Al - 26 in winds , forming a shell of material around it .
When the star later exploded , its remains would have slammed into this shell , creating a turbulent region with areas dense enough for the sun to form .
Tatischeff says most of the galaxy ’s planetary systems may not have formed as quickly as ours , since many probably arose from clusters .
This makes them likely to have lower levels of Al - 26 , which generates heat as it decays .
The cooler temperatures may have led rocky planets to take a different evolutionary path to Earth , perhaps becoming ocean worlds .
Eric Gaidos of the University of Hawaii at Manoa did preliminary work on the possibility of a runaway star parent last year , but says the single - star scenario still has trouble explaining how hot gas from the star could mix with surrounding material efficiently enough to form the solar system quickly .
“ We have yet to deal with the really tough nuts that have to be cracked , ” Gaidos says .

Though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she'd have the 216 votes to pass health care reform " if we took it up today , " her GOP rivals are disputing Pelosi 's math .
They count 196 " no " votes , 187 " yes " votes , and 48 undecideds — and say the Democrats are losing momentum .
In the constantly shifting fight to pass health care , is Pelosi 's optimism based on reality or fantasy ?
( Watch a PBS discussion on whether Pelosi can keep the health care votes )
This is strategic wishful thinking : Pelosi 's almost certainly bluffing , says Peter Suderman in Reason .
No other Democrats are willing to back up her claim , and her team has n't even begun its official vote tally .
She 's simply trying to shore up confidence amid " ongoing bad press . "
" Nancy Pelosi has the votes to pass health care reform on a day on which there will not be a vote ... "
Do n't count Pelosi out yet :
House leaders face a " staggering set " of hurdles in rounding up the requisite votes , says Jon Ward in The Daily Caller .
Still , " the conventional wisdom is that Pelosi will somehow find a way to pass a bill . "
A lot rests on the final package that Pelosi presents to her wavering flock — and its Congressional Budget Office score .
" Uncertainty prevails in Washington as Democrats wait for health care Budget Office ruling "
Pelosi could have a trick up her sleeve : Pelosi might have the votes ... to pass a different bill , says John Dickerson in Slate .
House Democrats are working on a plan to approve the Senate bill while voting only on a popular " fix " to the bill , which would let them skirt the need to officially support the Senate bill .
That would " limit their political exposure , " but muck up Obama 's call for an " up - or - down vote . "
" Two for one "
Will it pass ?
Watch conservatives : I 'd give Pelosi a 60 percent chance , says Jonathan Chait in The New Republic , and evidently some conservatives agree .
After " gloating that health care reform was dead " in the wake of Scott Brown 's stunning win in Massachusetts , conservatives are now warning Democrats of the " terrible consequences " that will befall the country if they pass the bill .
" Conservatives recognize health care reform might pass "

The Sun newspaper failed to publish a YouGov poll showing that voters fear a Liberal Democrat government less than a Conservative or Labour one .
The Liberal Democrats accused the newspaper , which is owned by Rupert Murdoch , of suppressing the finding .
The paper , which endorsed Labour in the past three elections , declared its support for David Cameron during the Labour Party 's annual conference last October .
Like other Tory - supporting papers , it has turned its fire on Nick Clegg over his policies , pro-European statements and expenses claims since he won last week 's first televised leaders ' debate .
YouGov also found that if people thought Mr Clegg 's party had a significant chance of winning the election , it would win 49 per cent of the votes , with the Tories winning 25 per cent and Labour just 19 per cent .
One in four people Labour and one in six Tory supporters say they would switch to the Liberal Democrats in these circumstances .
The party would be ahead among both men and women , in every age and social group , and in every region .
On a uniform swing across Britain , that would give the Liberal Democrats 548 MPs , Labour 41 and the Tories 25 .
The Liberal Democrats hope the long - standing argument that supporting them would be a " wasted vote " is breaking down following the surge in support for them in the past week .
However , even the most optimistic Liberal Democrats do not expect to win the election .
The party has taken comfort from YouGov 's unpublished finding that more voters would be delighted by the formation of a Liberal Democrat government ( 29 per cent ) , than by a Tory government ( 25 per cent ) or a Labour one ( 18 per cent ) .
Only 21 per cent would be dismayed if a Liberal Democrat administration were formed , compared to 45 per cent for the Tories and 51 per cent for Labour .
A Labour - Liberal Democrat coalition , which would delight 14 per cent of people , would be a more popular outcome than a Conservative - Liberal Democrat one ( 9 per cent ) .
The Liberal Democrats are angry that The Sun did not publish these figures .
Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay , the party 's Treasury spokesman , said : " The numbers show that half the country cannot stand Gordon Brown and that the other half can't stand David Cameron .
I wonder why The Sun would n't share this news with its readers .
" We always knew ... that when people believe the Liberal Democrats can win , there is a big jump in our support .
In 90 minutes in the first debate , Nick Clegg tore open the two - party straitjacket which has stifled British politics for the last 80 years .
Now , at last , people can vote for what they want , not against what they fear . "
The Sun declined to comment last night .
On the day the poll 's findings were published on Tuesday , it focused on the Tories moving into the lead in the share of the vote and said there were signs that the Liberal Democrats ' surprise surge was on the wane .
An editorial comment said : " Mr Clegg is the political equivalent of a holiday romance .
An exciting fortnight 's flirtation so long as you do n't ask too many questions .
We can not gamble the nation 's future like that . "
However , Sun journalists said YouGov 's extensive daily poll always contained too many findings to publish .
On Monday , the paper ran a front - page story saying the Liberal Democrats had taken the lead , based on the previous day 's survey .
Peter Kellner , the YouGov president , said in a commentary on the unpublished poll that it was no longer outlandish to ask whether Mr Clegg could end up as prime minister .
" The answer is probably no – I 'd put the odds at 10 - 1 against – but longer - odds horses have won big races in the past , " he said .
Mr Kellner added : " Not only is a Lib Dem government the most popular option ; it is the one that frightens voters far less than any other option .
If the Lib Dem bandwagon is to be halted and sent into reverse , Labour and the Tories must do far more to persuade voters that a vote for the Lib Dems would be seriously bad for Britain . "
Another poll published yesterday suggested that the Liberal Democrats ' advance has proved more damaging to the Tories than to Labour .
According to the Ipsos MORI poll for Reuters , the Tories have achieved a 5 per cent swing from Labour since the last general election , in 2005 , in Labour - held marginal constituencies .
That suggests Britain is still heading for a hung parliament , with the Tories as the largest party .
The poll , conducted between 16 and 19 April , showed support for Labour fell to 36 percent compared with 41 per cent two weeks ago , while Tory support dropped to 32 percent from 38 per cent .
Liberal Democrat support jumped to 23 per cent from 11 per cent .
The swing to the third party comes mainly from voters who were previously not sure they would vote .
The truth about those smears against Clegg
Claim : Liberal Democrat donors paid up to £ 250 a month into Nick Clegg 's personal bank account ( The Daily Telegraph , yesterday ) .
Truth : Despite the front page headline Mr Clegg did not break any parliamentary rules , and the cash – which the party said helped pay for a researcher in Mr Clegg 's office – was declared in the Commons register of members ' interests .
The Daily Telegraph says he made separate claims under his office allowances budget to cover staffing .
The Liberal Democrats say the story is " wrong in fact " and have produced paperwork to back up their assertion .
Claim : Clegg lobbied for " lax " EU bank laws ( The Daily Telegraph , yesterday ) .
Truth : Before becoming an MP , Mr Clegg had a brief spell as a lobbyist for GPlus .
Its clients included the Royal Bank of Scotland , which was attempting to amend EU directives .
Mr Clegg did work on the RBS account , but did not lobby " externally " on its behalf .
GPlus said last night that Mr Clegg worked for it two days a week for about eight and a half months .
Claim : Clegg made a " Nazi slur on Britain " and said the British have a " more insidious cross to bear " than Germans over the Second World War ( Daily Mail , yesterday ) .
Truth :
The comments were made in a newspaper article by Mr Clegg in 2002 when he was a Euro MP .
Written after two Germans working in a call centre in Swindon went to an industrial tribunal to protest about the abuse they suffered , it argued the British still laboured from " anti-German mania " .
He concluded : " All nations have a cross to bear , and none more so than Germany with its memories of Nazism .
But the British cross is more insidious still .
A misplaced sense of superiority , sustained by delusions of grandeur and a tenacious obsession with the last war , is much harder to shake off . "
Claim : " Clegg refused to return a £ 2.4 m donation to the party from convicted fraudster Michael Brown " ( The Sun , Tuesday ) .
Truth : Brown 's donations in 2004 – the biggest in the party 's history – have hung over the Liberal Democrats for years .
First , there were questions whether Brown 's company , 5th Avenue Partners , was a genuine UK business .
Then in 2008 Brown was charged with fraud and money - laundering and fled bail .
He was convicted in his absence and sentenced to seven years in jail .
Despite the conviction , the Electoral Commission has concluded the donations were permissible because the firm " was carrying on business in the UK " at the time and the Liberal Democrats had no need to return the money .
Claim : The Liberal Democrats have " flip - flopped shamelessly " on Afghanistan ( The Sun , yesterday ) .
Truth :
This is based on a party conference motion last year which said ministers should focus on " concluding the Afghanistan mission " and called on the UK to end the " military first " approach to the country .
However , motions passed at party conferences are not binding and the party 's foreign affairs spokesman , Ed Davey , told delegates the party supported the war .
Its manifesto stops short of setting a timetable for withdrawal and says the Liberal Democrats will be " critical supporters of the Afghanistan mission " .
Claim : Britain 's security would be risked by Liberal Democrat policy to scrap our Trident nuclear defence ( The Sun , yesterday ) .
Truth : The Liberal Democrats ' manifesto does say they would " rule out the like - for - like replacement of the Trident nuclear weapons system " to save £ 100 m .
However , they also say they are multilateralist , not unilateralist .
Former leader Sir Menzies Campbell favours replacing Trident with cheaper , nuclear - tipped cruise missiles which could be stationed on smaller Astute - class subs .
This would mean Britain would remain a nuclear power with a seat at the UN Security Council .
Claim : Liberal Democrats ' " crazy " immigration policy would give jobs to asylum seekers ( Daily Express , yesterday ) .
Truth : The Liberal Democrats propose an amnesty for failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who have been here for 10 years and not committed any crimes .
This is controversial because of fears it could encourage illegal immigrants to try their luck in Britain in the hope of triggering a further amnesty in the future .
The Liberal Democrats would also introduce a regional points - based system to allow migrants to work only where they are needed .
It would be backed up by " rigorous checks on businesses and a crackdown on rogue employers who profit from illegal labour " .
Claim : The Liberal Democrats would free 60,000 convicts ( Daily Mail , Wednesday ) .
Truth : The Liberal Democrat manifesto does promise to " introduce a presumption against short - term sentences of less than six months – replaced by rigorously enforced community sentences which evidence shows are better at cutting reoffending " .
The Daily Mail claimed that in 2008 " no fewer than 58,076 people were sentenced to a prison term of six months or less " .
The Ministry of Justice said the real figure was 55,333 .
The Liberal Democrat policy would spare offenders from going into prison ; it would not " free " prisoners .
Claim : Clegg is posh ( The Sun yesterday ) .
Truth :
His half - Russian banker father sent him to one of Britain 's smartest prep schools , Caldicott ; he went on to Westminster School and Cambridge .
A friend is quoted as saying : " His father was an incredibly wealthy banker with loads of houses – in London , in the Chilterns , a French chateau , a ski chalet in Switzerland ... I think . "
So true – but then so is David Cameron .
Filesharing - Umfrage unter Jugendlichen : Illegal aber egal Quelle : PC Games Hardware Der Börsenverein des deutschen Buchhandels veröffentlicht die Ergebnisse einer Umfrage auf der Leipziger Buchmesse , bei der die Bereitschaft von Filesharing unter Jugendlichen ermittelt wurde .
Insgesamt 313 junge Menschen zwischen zwölf und neunzehn Jahren wurden befragt .
Demnach haben gut zwei Drittel der befragten Jugendlichen bereits Daten über das Internet ausgetauscht .
Wegen der erwarteten stärkeren Nachfrage bei elektronischen Büchern mache sich der Verband Sorgen um einen Rückgang der Einnahmen durch Verlagserzeugnisse .
In einem 21 Seiten PDF , mit dem Titel " Illegal aber egal ?
Ein Forschungsüberblick zum Unrechtbewusstsein von Jugendlichen " , stellt der Verband seine Ergebnisse öffentlich zur Verfügung .
Den Jugendlichen wurden unterschiedlichste Fragen gestellt , wie zum Beispiel , ob sie bereits Daten an andere weitergegeben haben oder ob sie Filesharing als falsch ansehen würden .
Ein Fünftel der Befragten gab an , ihre eigene Bibliothek durch Tauschbörsen zu erweitern .
Fast siebzig Prozent von denen tun dies aus Kostengründen .
Gut 87 Prozent der Jugendlichen sind sich bewusst , dass die Nutzung von Tauschbörsen unter Umständen verboten ist .
In der Bildergalerie finden Sie die Tabellen der Umfrage .
Alexander Skipis , Geschäftsführer des Börsenverbands äußerte :
" Die Umfrage zeigt , wie wichtig es ist , über die Konsequenzen von Filesharing und Datendiebstahl zu informieren .
Junge Leute sind die Zukunft des Buchmarkts .
Wir müssen
Wege finden , ihnen die Folgen ihres illegalen Handelns klarzumachen . "

Last Thursday 's Tea Party at Daley Plaza in Chicago drew about 1500 participants .
Belying their alleged " grassroots " nature , the rally 's organizers were heavily aided by pre-rally publicity in the corporate press including not only the inevitable wall - to - wall Fox News coverage , but also a front - page lead article in the Chicago Tribune .

Anti-war organizers who attempted to hold a rally on Daley Plaza a month before were met with demands by Daley Plaza management that they come up with a $ 2 million per incident insurance policy not only for themselves , but similar policies for each of their vendors .
The insurance demands proved so onerous that anti-war organizers were forced to change the location of their rally .
But the " grassroots " Tea Partiers either came up with the millions of insurance coverage , or got privileged with a pass from Daley Plaza management authorities who refused to give same courtesy to anti-war organizers .
Even though in the weeks leading up to the rally , Tea Party organizers repeatedly told their supporters to leave their nuttier and racist signs at home , a number of kooks defied the organizers ' attempts to clean up their movement 's image .
And that 's just the start of his bigoted agenda .
Here is how Andrzejewski answered a candidates questionnaire :**
Do you support civil unions or gay marriage in the state ?**
Would you support a constitutional amendment to sanctify male / female marriage ?**
Would you make Illinois a right to work state ?**
Do you Support state funding for stem cell research ?**
Are you for allowing sanctuary cities in Illinois ?**
Are you for the moratorium on executions ? [ 1]
Here 's how he answered another questionnaire : ** [ Are you for ]
Allowing and promoting Gay Straight Alliance Clubs and LGBTQ ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender , queer ) programs in taxpayer - funded schools ?**
[ Are you for ] Imposing Federal environmental restrictions on States and individuals ? [ 2]

On one of her blogs she posted a picture of Obama between Hitler and Lenin and wrote , [ 4 ] A typical blog post is entitled , yes , in ALL CAPS , [ 5 ] Besides an array of assorted rightwing crackpots , the Tea Partiers drew at least a few Nazis , who apparently view the Tea Party movement as a potential recruiting ground .
Here is one of them at Thursday 's rally :
And here is a YouTube video of the same Nazi – even wearing the same ubber - patriotic shirt – speaking at a 2009 Hitler Birthday celebration ( note the portrait of Adolph Hitler behind him ) : http://www.youtube.com/user/sorenrenner#p/u/9/hlm5Pd54sEw+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Fortunately there was a strong crowd of anti-war , pro-civil rights counter - protesters , both on one corner of the plaza and mingling on the edge of the Tea Partiers ' rally .
This is true enough , and it should serve as a warning for how we need to oppose them .
If the left is seen as simply tools of the Democratic Party , we lose all credibility , and justifiably so .
Moveon.org and other extensions of the Party are more interested in promoting the Party at all costs while paying lip service to the real hurt that many working people are feeling just days after the federal government released a new round of statistics announcing record foreclosures for the first quarter of 2010 .
Whatever happened to the bold promises of repealing or reforming NAFTA that Clinton and Obama dueled over in the run up to the Ohio primary ?
Or card check ?
And that 's just the beginning of the list .
Almost all of Obama 's promises to the left have been kicked into the second half of the first ( only ? ) term of his Presidency , after the mid-term elections when the Democrats will then have the excuse that they do not have the power to enact their promises into law .
By pushing the business elites ' priorities — the record bailout to the financial services industry and a maintenance and expansion of Bush - era empire building and attacks on civil liberties —
Obama has clearly " played " most of his supporters .
Like with Bill Clinton before him , it has been Obama 's accommodations to the right , while taking the left for granted , that have fueled the rightward drift in Washington politics , where " health care reform " metamorphasizes into private health insurance industry preservation , with big fillips to anti-abortion nuts and a freeze on domestic spending along the way . —
Concerned about the indebtedness of our children and future generations ?
Stop spending 57 percent of the federal budget on past and present wars . —
" Si se puede " ( " Yes we can " ) is not a cheap electoral slogan .
Amnesty for all immigrants .
They are working people like most of the rest of us , trying to eck out a living in hard times .
We are idiots if we allow ourselves to be part of a divide - and - conquer strategy of our opponents trying to scapegoat immigrants for the lack of jobs and social services . —
Full legal equality for Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender people , including marriage rights and equal employment rights in government and the private sector .… and these are just for starters …+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[ 1 ]

The Tories just could not resist using Keane 's " Everybody 's Changing " to highlight their campaign message , although they apparently neglected to consult the band first .
The band 's drummer , Richard Hughes , posted the following on his Twitter :
The Conservatives ' mistimed jump on to the indie bandwagon is reminiscent of David Cameron 's claim a few years ago that Radiohead had granted him a request at a Koko gig .
A band spokesperson said the choice of songs had " nothing to do with any special requests " .
What , another failed attempt to bag the indie vote , Dave ?

The Shower Series
play this essay
For the last few months I have been inviting people to visit my apartment and allow me to photograph them in a very intimate space ; my bathroom .
I have also been inviting them to take a shower as I continue to shoot them .
I soon came to the observation that warm water running over my subjects bodies often relieved them of any unnerving awkwardness the camera brought about .
Once they were relaxed , the bathroom , formerly a beauty parlour , now became a confessional and I the hair dresser .
Many of my subjects shared intimate details of their life with me and every new person in the shower became a brand new allegory .
With every new visit I had a new protagonist ;
A new plot and a new parable of hurt and heroic that came undone under that shower – My Shower .
I felt a personal mythology was being shared in that shower .
An independent study that I have gotten addicted to .
Secretly I have been told by my subjects that it is thrilling and adventuresome to be in my shower ;
Secretly cheating my traditional and tame Indian upbringing I live through all of my subjects .
Fighting their wars and braving their fears for those few hours where we are connected through this pious space .
I continue to investigate this enthralling photo project which has thus far given rise to some of the fastest , most disarming relationships I have formed .
I look forward to these images leading the way as the project continues .
As I have found time and again what I set out to consume , consumes me .
Based on the root structure of my cultural upbringing , ardent seeking is an act of submission .
A project , whether photographic or not , begins with placing good faith in the unknown .
When I suspend the illusion of a plausible predestined fiasco , I start to make my pictures with two most elemental givens , myself and the person in the frame .
As the project progresses , A sentience of the self dissolves , leaving behind a distilled remainder … the subject and the story .
This Essay solely began as a labor of love , I was driven by a mad passion and desire to document the sensory overload i personally experienced .
The texture , the drama , the undeniable sexuality , the relief , it was all there .
But when I photographed the first person in that shower , it was nothing but a response to the visual .
So when it started out , it was very tangible and measurable ;
But as it progressed it gathered the moss only a rolling stone can round up .
It became a lot more than light and water .
it became about what I shared with this person for that finite length of time and what we were willing to give up to be in that bath tub together as we willing broke social norms .
I want this project to communicate that the drive it took to make these images is the drive I aim to sustain as an artist .
If this project is any measure , then I want to be recognized and known for my ability to connect , collaborate and create .
Bio
I was born and raised in Mumbai , India , A terrific country , but I guess you have to go away to love it again .

STEVEN LAUREYS will always remember the 21 - year - old woman who had had a stroke .
She had been taken to a hospital in Liège , Belgium , where her condition worsened rapidly .
She soon lost all motor movement , even the ability to open her eyes .
Her prognosis looked bleak , so her doctors turned to Laureys , a neurologist , for a final opinion before turning off her ventilator .
By recording her brain activity as she was asked to respond to simple tasks , such as counting the number of times her name was spoken in a random string of first names , Laureys confirmed that the woman was aware of her surroundings , and so she remained on life support ( Neurocase , vol 15 , p 271 ) .
Clearly that was the right decision : a year later she had recovered enough to be discharged from hospital .
“ It was only technology that permitted us to show that she was conscious , ” says Laureys of the University of Liège .
There had , however , been another clue to the patient ’s active mental state – too tentative to hold any weight in the diagnosis , but nevertheless significant .
Laureys had observed a signature of coordinated neural activity , present in the resting patient , which seems to appear in the brain of anyone who is conscious .
While such readings may one day provide a better diagnosis of coma patients , their ultimate implications may be even more profound , providing evidence for a 30 - year - old theory that claims to explain consciousness itself .
Consciousness is one of neuroscience ’s long - standing mysteries .
At its most basic , it is the simple question of why we become aware of some thoughts …
I 've probably said it before , but watercolor is definetely one of the greatest techniques of painting there is !
It 's truly incredible what a good illustration will do with it ... so I thought it would be cool to find some watercolor illustrations of Super heroes and villains .
And as usual , I started looking for some cool illustrations at DeviantART , and found a whole bunch of sweet , beautiful illustrations , and they 're listed below !
The colors give each illustration a particular feeling , a single mood for every and each one , and that 's exactly what I found fantastic about it .
Anyways , I hope you guys enjoy these as much as I did ... and please , do n't forget to give some love to each artist by visiting their galleries !!
There are much more great art at their galleries .
Cheers . ;)

The Scandal No Israeli Journalist Can Report A gag order prevents Israeli media from reporting on Anat Kam security case .
JERUSALEM , April 7 , 2010  --
There is a news story in Israel that everyone is talking about , but which cannot be published or broadcast here .
Because of a restrictive gag order on all Israeli newspapers and broadcasters , the details of the story about leaked military documents are only available in the foreign media .
The draconian measure , which is due to be appealed in the Supreme Court , has led to a chorus of complaints across the Israeli media world .
The New York City - based Jewish Telegraphic Agency published the story two weeks ago for the first time and it has since been published around the world , which means that any Isreali within reach of the Internet can access the details .
Journalist Anat Kam , 23 , has been under house arrest since December .
Israeli authorities accuse her of leaking classified military documents about a controversial " shoot to kill " policy pursued by the Israeli army in the occupied West Bank .
She has denied the charges but faces a 14 - year sentence , if convicted .
Kam was in uniform satisfying her compulsory national service at the time of the alleged offense .
She worked in 2007 for the office of General Yair Naveh , who was then senior commander in the West Bank .
He authorized the killing of three Palestinian militants in direct contravention of a Supreme Court ruling , which placed severe restrictions on the army 's right to assassinate militants , according to a 2008 investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz .
The state 's preventing publication of the story in Israel has created a storm of debate about press freedom and the health of Israeli democracy .
" Gag orders impinge on the freedom of the press , and this is allowed if publication is highly likely to cause grave damage to the state , " Dalia Dorner , head of the country 's Press Council and a former Supreme Court justice , told told Israel Radio Tuesday .
" But if the whole world knows , this alone constitutes a reason to withdraw the injunction . "
Israeli Papers Slam ' Blind Faith in Defense Establishment '
The popular tabloid Yedioth Aharanot published a link to the Web site of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency 's original story about the case , with the headline : " What the Shin Bet [ intelligence service ] does not want you to know ? "
The Maariv daily paper took a more satirical line with its declaration : " Due to a gag order we can not tell you what we know .
Due to laziness , apathy and blind faith in the defense establishment , we know nothing at all . "
A preliminary request to the Supreme Court to have the order lifted has already been rejected once .
A formal appeal is expected to be launched by several media organizations today .
The case highlights a recurring tension inside Israel over the reporting of security - related matters .
Given the state 's turbulent history and its carefully maintained narrative of being under a permanent state of threat , magistrates and lower courts have often issued rulings favoring the security establishment .
The advent of the Internet and the freedom enjoyed by the foreign media is making the imposition of these media restrictions more difficult to justify .

A study by researchers at the University of Warwick and Cardiff University has found that money only makes people happier if it improves their social rank .
The researchers found that simply being highly paid was n't enough -- to be happy , people must perceive themselves as being more highly paid than their friends and work colleagues .
The researchers were seeking to explain why people in rich nations have not become any happier on average over the last 40 years even though economic growth has led to substantial increases in average incomes .
Lead researcher on the paper Chris Boyce from the University of Warwick 's Department of Psychology said : " Our study found that the ranked position of an individual 's income best predicted general life satisfaction , while the actual amount of income and the average income of others appear to have no significant effect .
Earning a million pounds a year appears to be not enough to make you happy if you know your friends all earn 2 million a year . "
The study entitled " Money and Happiness : Rank of Income , Not Income , Affects Life Satisfaction " will be published in the journal Psychological Science .
The researchers looked at data on earnings and life satisfaction from seven years of the British Household Panel Survey ( BHPS ) , which is a representative longitudinal sample of British households .
First they examined how life satisfaction was related to how much money each person earned .
They found however that satisfaction was much more strongly related to the ranked position of the person 's income ( compared to people of the same gender , age , level of education , or from the same geographical area ) .
The results explain why making everybody in society richer will not necessarily increase overall happiness -- because it is only having a higher income than other people that matters .
The three authors of the paper were Chris Boyce , Gordon Brown ( both of the University of Warwick 's Department of Psychology ) , and Simon Moore of Cardiff University .
Mobile ad plans are heating up to be another of a growing list of showdowns between Google and Apple .
NEW YORK (
The Street
) --
Apple
( AAPL ) - Get Report
and
Google
( GOOG ) - Get Report
have taken their escalating turf war to another front : mobile advertising .
When Apple unveils the next version of its iPhone software Thursday , it 's also expected to outline its plans for a mobile advertising push .
The move would give Apple yet another revenue line in its expanding iTunes / App Store empire and provide a strong position in the growing smartphone - driven advertising race .
But just as Apple is set to move forward , Google , the search ad giant , looks to be
flagged for a violation
by federal referees .
The Federal Trade Commission regulators reportedly have ended their review of Google 's $ 750 million acquisition of mobile ad shop
AdMob
-- and are now preparing to challenge the deal .
Critics of the deal like Precursor 's Scott Cleland say AdMob would give Google a nearly complete dominance of mobile ad market .
" Google has mostly all the advertisers , the publishers and the users , " says Cleland .
The only thing they do n't have , says Cleland , is the mobile application developers that AdMob would give them .
The FTC would likely seek to block the Google AdMob deal on concerns that it could hurt competition in mobile advertising .
The background for this drama could hardly be more contentious as former partners Apple and Google go toe - to - toe over smartphones .
Also at stake is the mobile advertising market , which is still very much in its infancy .
Smartphones are the new PC , and as such , they represent the unfolding of a potentially huge new market for Internet ad sales .
Gartner predicts smartphones sales will grow 45 % to 250 million units worldwide this year , far outpacing PC growth , which Gartner pegs at 20 % with 366 million units shipped this year .
Google saw the shift to mobile and pushed into the market three years ago with its Android effort .
Apple jumped in at the same time with its first iPhone .
The battle continued in November when Google wrestled AdMob from Apple 's hands .
In a counter move , Apple made a $ 275 million offer in January for
Quattro Wireless
, a mobile ad network operator .
The two companies match up unusually well in this business .
Google effectively controls most of the search ad market , while Apple controls the so - called user experience of its device owners .
Google 's approach is like a blanket , while Apple 's could be more of an IV drip .
Apple owns a prized , well - to - do section of the market .
Advertisers know the value of that .
Google owns just about everything else and it's about to add AdMob to the pot .
The FTC 's effort to stop that deal may only slow it down .
Google bought Net ad giant
DoubleClick
with regulatory blessing .
And in another market , when the FTC tried to block
Whole Food's
( WFMI )
takeover of rival Wild Oats , the merger eventually went through .
Though it 's hitting some speed bumps , Google is still on the road to a showdown with Apple .

MARCH 17 -- In light of recent high - profile name changes ( see ACORN and Bernard Madoff 's daughter - in - law ) , here is a collection of court applications filed by individuals desperate to ditch their given surnames .
In most cases , the plaintiffs were saddled with unfortunate names that likely prompted ridicule from friends , coworkers , classmates , and clergy .
Really , nobody needs to be known as Mr. Doody or Ms. Porn .
Included in the court records are applications filed on behalf of a young Ralph Lauren ( nee Lifshitz ) , and Chad Ochocinco , the NFL star formerly known as Chad Johnson , and Jon Stewart , who settled on a variation of his given middle name .

Ridley Scott says his new prequel to his seminal 1979 space - horror film Alien is definitely happening , and he 's going to talk to venerable designer H.R. Giger about some new creature designs .
And he drops some plot details .
Spoilers ahead ...
Advertisement
According to Scott , he 's looking at the fourth draft of the movie 's script now , and the revision process is simply a matter of making the characters stronger and punching up the film 's three acts .
The goal is to have a script that he can put in front of the cameras — and he assures MTV that " we 're actually making the film .
There 's no question about it — we 're going to make the film . "
He hopes it 'll be in theaters by 2011 , or at the latest 2012 .
And he explains that the prequel takes place about 30 years before the first movie , in 2085 .
Weyland - Yutani does n't exist yet , but Weyland , pre-merger , does .
And it 's very much in the terraforming business .
Adds Scott :
It 's fundamentally about going out to find out ' Who the hell was that Space Jockey ? '
The guy who was sitting in the chair in the alien vehicle - there was a giant fellow sitting in a seat on what looked to be either a piece of technology or an astronomer 's chair .
Remember that ?
And our man [ Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas ] climbs up and says " There 's been an explosion in his chest from the inside out - what was that ? "
I 'm basically explaining who that Space Jockey - we call him the Space Jockey - I 'm explaining who the space jockeys were .

He adds that this new movie wo n't feature Ripley at all , because she 's not born yet .
But the main character will be a woman .
And he plans to talk to H.R. Giger , and " maybe we 'll come up with something completely different . "
Scott has always refused to make a sequel ( or in this case a prequel ) to any of his films , but he changed his mind about going back to Alien because of the way the other film - makers have " squeezed the franchise dry . "
The whole interview is well worth reading .

Apple , which launched its first iPhone barely three years ago , has already become the third largest smartphone maker worldwide , according to an IDC ranking of the top five mobile device companies .
Apple ranked third in terms of market share in smartphones for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the entire year , behind Nokia and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion .
The numbers should be no surprise to smartphone enthusiasts .
Apple 's iPhone has become an iconic product as it has set the standard for elegant hardware design and the distribution of third - party software applications through the App Store .
Much of Apple 's gains has come at the expense of smaller smartphone makers , clubbed in the " others " category .
These include Palm , Samsung and companies such as Sharp and Fujitsu , says IDC analyst Ramon Llamas .
Surprising as it may seem to have Nokia as the market leader on the list–its smartphones are unloved in North America–the company continues to hold on to consumers elsewhere .
" Nokia 's shift to bring more touchscreen - enabled smartphones to market began to pay off , as its 5800 , N97 , N97 mini , and 5530 models drove both revenue and profits , " says IDC in its statement .
Motorola returned to the top - five mobile phone makers list during the fourth quarter , after a year - long hiatus , says IDC .
Last year , Motorola launched a slew of Android - powered devices including the Cliq on T - Mobile and Droid at Verizon Wireless .
Combined sales of both the phones crossed two million since their debut .
Overall , 54.5 million handsets were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2009 , up 39 percent from the same quarter a year ago .
During the year , mobile phone makers shipped 174.2 million handsets .
As for operating systems , IDC says to watch for what Symbian and Windows Mobile do this year .
" 2009 was the coming - out party for Google 's Android and Palm's webOS , " says Kevin Restivo , senior research analyst with IDC .
" More advances are in store for 2010 as Symbian and Windows are expected to unveil new versions of their respective operating systems . "

Billions more for bankers as City workers are handed £ 6.8 bn bonuses
City workers will be handed bonuses totalling an astonishing £ 6.8 billion this year .
They will receive an average payout of around £ 70,000 - almost three times the entire salary of a typical worker elsewhere .
Despite widespread anger over City pay , the bonus pool will be £ 750 million bigger than last year , research reveals today .
Critics described the payouts as ' sickening ' , coming so soon after the recklessness of the banking industry triggered a global recession .
Bumper bonuses : Goldman Sachs is among the investment banks paying massive bonuses to staff
Long - term unemployment has soared to its highest level for 13 years , while many workers have been forced to accept pay freezes or cuts as businesses struggle to cope .
The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts the City windfalls will rise even further over the next two years .
The consultancy forecasts they will soar to £ 7.2 billion in 2011 and £ 7.7 billion in 2012 .
Brendan Barber , general secretary of the Trades Union Congress , said : ' Ordinary people will not understand why City bonuses are on the rise again .
' The economy is still fragile .
Businesses can't get the loans they need , public and private sector workers are frightened of losing their jobs , yet the banks and finance houses that caused the crash are laughing all the way to the City champagne bars . '
LibDem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said : ' The size of their bonus pool is simply sickening .
' How can they keep giving their £ 70,000 V - signs to the rest of Britain ?
' Year after year , Labour bent over backwards to please the bankers so now they 're morally bankrupt to curb this gross greed . '
To rein in risk - taking , the party is calling for all bonuses in excess of £ 2,500 to be paid in shares redeemable only after five years .
Critics : LibDem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott , left , and union boss Brendan Barber have hit out at banks over the bonuses
This year 's bonuses will be shared by around 100,000 City workers in fields including investment banking , hedge funds and foreign exchange .
It excludes insurance workers .
In 2009 , they shared a bonus pot of £ 6 billion , but the CEBR predicts that this will rocket to £ 6.76 billion this year - an inflation - busting jump of 12.4 per cent .
The bonuses come on top of their salaries , which according to official figures average about £ 70,000 .
Today 's report comes days after two of the world 's biggest investment banks revealed that their bonus pools are growing .
On Tuesday , Goldman Sachs revealed £ 3.6 billion in pay and bonuses for its bankers for just three months ' work .
In an extraordinary display of arrogance , the announcement came days after the Wall Street giant was charged with a £ 650 million fraud .
Its 33,100 staff ' earned ' an average salary and bonus of £ 108,000 between January and March , although the exact size of their payouts will not be decided for many months .
On Wednesday , arch - rival Morgan Stanley said it has set aside £ 2.9 billion for its pay and bonus pool for the first three months , more than double last year 's pot .
City bonuses have been condemned by all the major political parties .
In the Chancellor 's debate , Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said the size of the payouts ' beggars belief ' , citing the alleged £ 63 million paid to Barclays president Bob Diamond .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has also singled Mr Diamond out as the ' unacceptable face ' of the banking sector , although Barclays insist the disputed figure is a ' total fiction ' .
In the LibDem manifesto , leader Nick Clegg said : ' Does n't it make you angry that the banks have been allowed to ride roughshod over our economy , and are still handing out bonuses by the bucket load ? '
The bonus pool is large , but it is far from a record .
In 2007 - the year the credit crunch struck - total payouts were more than £ 10.2 billion .
But the taxman will take a much larger chunk of their rewards since the introduction of the 50 per cent tax band on income over £ 150,000 .
Benjamin Williamson , CEBR economist and co-author of the research , said : ' The recent change to the tax system has shifted the balance of rewards from City bonuses in favour of the Government .
' Despite contributing billions of pounds in tax already , the public 's appetite for a larger slice of City bonuses will not go away . '

Video : Arutz Sheva TV visited the archaeological dig that uncovered a wall likely built by King Solomon and described in the Book of Kings .
Even as Muslim spokesmen try to deny Jewish claims to the Holy Land , archaeological discoveries have recently been coming in fast and furious proving the veracity of the Biblical account of history .
Hebrew University archaeologists have revealed an ancient path in Jerusalem believed to date back to the time of King Solomon , along with structures including a gateway and the foundation of a building .
Dr. Eilat Mazar , the leader of the archaeological dig , said the findings match finds from the time of the First Temple .
Arutz Sheva TV's Yoni Kempinski visited the archaeological dig where the ancient wall was revealed and heard from Dr. Mazar about the importance of the find and its connection to the Biblical description about the time of King Solomon .
The latest find includes a 70 - meter long and six - meter - high stone wall , a small house adjacent to a gateway leading to what was once the royal courtyard , a building that served city officials , and a tower that overlooked the Kidron river .
According to Mazar , the wall is likely to be the wall built by King Solomon .
“ This is the first time a building has been found that matches descriptions of the building carried out by King Solomon in Jerusalem , ” she said .
The third chapter of the Biblical book of Kings describes King Solomon building “ his own house , and the house of the L-rd , and the wall of Jerusalem round about . ”
The wall testifies to relatively advanced engineering capabilities , archaeologists said .
It runs through historic Jerusalem , between the City of David and the Temple Mount .
The remnants of a public building discovered along the wall contained shards of pottery that allowed researchers to estimate the date at which the building was in use – the 10th century BCE .
One of the shards was engraved with Hebrew writing saying “ For the chief ... ”
Mazar believes the shard , part of a jug , belonged to the royal baker .
Other jugs bore a seal saying “ For the king ” in Hebrew .
Dozens of seals were discovered using a water sifting technique .
The building was ravaged by fire , researchers said , but the jugs that were found at the site were the largest discovered in Jerusalem to date .
The discoveries were made during a months - long dig run by Hebrew University in cooperation with the Israel Antiquities Authority , East Jerusalem Development Ltd , and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority .
The dig is sponsored by Daniel Mintz and Meredith Berkman of New York .

The volcano erupting under South Iceland ’s Eyjafjallajokull glacier has opened a 2 km long gorge and is already considered much bigger than the nearby Fimmvorduhals volcano which appears to have finally ended yesterday .
Glacier water has already started flooding surrounding land and evacuation orders are in force .
Iceland ’s main highway , Route 1 , is being dug up south of the glacier in an attempt to save Markarfljots Bridge from the flood water .
Flood water is pouring off the glacier both to the north and the south , but both flows will enter the sea to the south .
Due to the evacuations , nobody is believed to be in danger and no towns or villages have been affected – although conditions can change rapidly .

Afghanistan : Another massacre as a bloody summer looms in Kandahar
By James Cogan
23 April 2010
A car carrying an Afghan police officer and three teenagers was blasted with machine gun fire by NATO troops on Monday , allegedly because it came “ too close ” to a convoy traveling along a highway in the eastern province of Khost .
All four occupants were killed .
Once again , the US - NATO International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) occupying Afghanistan made the false claim that two of the passengers were “ known insurgents ” and the others their “ associates . ”
After protests by the local Khost authorities and Afghan president Hamid Karzai , the ISAF admitted that all four were civilians and that no weapons had been found in the vehicle .
According to the father of two of the boys who were killed , the teenagers were returning from a volleyball game .
The latest killing of Afghan civilians follows the massacre of 5 people and wounding of at least 18 others in Kandahar province on April 12 , when American troops opened fire on a bus that also was allegedly “ too close ” to their convoy .
It comes in the wake of confirmation that US special forces dug their bullets out of the bodies of three women — two of them pregnant — to try to cover up the fact they had killed them during a botched nighttime raid on a compound in Paktia province on February 12 .
Until its lies were exposed , the ISAF claimed that the women had been murdered by the Taliban before the raid .
Two men , a local police commander and his brother , were also killed .
The regular killing of civilians has dramatically heightened the already pervasive hatred of the Afghan population for the occupation forces , even as a steady build - up takes place of US and NATO troops in the country .
There are now close to 130,000 deployed , with a further 20,000 — predominantly American — scheduled to arrive by the end of July as part of President Obama ’s “ surge ” of forces in Central Asia .
The centerpiece of the “ surge ” will be an offensive in the city of Kandahar and its surrounding regions , an area that was the stronghold of the Taliban Islamist government from 1996 to 2001 , before it was overthrown and driven underground by the US invasion .
Along with the neighboring province of Helmand , Kandahar has been the focus of Taliban resistance to the occupation .
Last week , with considerable media fanfare , US troops abandoned their positions in the remote Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan , where they were seeking to block the flow of Afghan insurgents and equipment back and forth from Pakistan ’s tribal border region .
Since American troops moved into the valley in 2005 , 40 soldiers and marines have been killed and hundreds wounded in some of the bloodiest battles of the nine - year war .
The withdrawal from positions such as Korengal is part of US - NATO commander General Stanley McChrystal ’s plan to use the bulk of the troops at his disposal to secure the major urban centers like Kandahar , and to rely on air strikes and special forces operations to suppress Taliban activity in the vast rural hinterland of Afghanistan .
After years of failing to subdue resistance , the Soviet occupation army in the 1980s ultimately turned to a similar strategy of holding the urban centers , before it was forced to leave the country in defeat in 1988 .
Considerable hopes are being invested by the US military in its plan to drive the Taliban out of Kandahar city .
A US official told the Christian Science Monitor this month : “ This is the jewel .
If the Taliban lose effective control of the city — their ability to harass , intimidate and control the outcomes of what happens on the normal days of life in Kandahar — they ’ve lost . ”
In March , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen declared , “ Kandahar is the very heart of the insurgency .
It is a cornerstone in reversing the momentum for the Taliban . ”
A force of at least 12,000 US , British and Canadian troops , supported by more than 10,000 Afghan government soldiers and police , is being assembled for the operation , which is set to continue for at least eight weeks until the Ramadan Islamic festival in August .
Thousands of other troops will be used to attempt to block off possible routes for the reinforcement , resupply or retreat of Taliban fighters in the city .
The offensive in Kandahar is slated to begin in June — the first month of summer when both weather and road conditions are more favorable for military operations for both sides .
The expectation among US and NATO commanders is that their casualties will increase dramatically due to the broad popular support enjoyed by the Taliban - led resistance in the area .
A survey in the province commissioned by McChrystal and carried out by a private contractor , Glevum Associates , found that 94 percent of people supported a peace conference with the Taliban and 85 percent viewed the Islamist fighters as “ our Afghan brothers . ”
The ISAF and the puppet Afghan Army and police were considered the greatest threat to personal security by 56 percent of people .
Just 36 percent named the Taliban and the roadside bombs that guerillas regularly use to attack foreign and government forces as the greatest risk .
More than two thirds of those surveyed stated that they viewed the Afghan government of Hamid Karzai as totally corrupt .
The pro-occupation strongman in Kandahar province is Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of the president .
US military reports have alleged that he has intimate ties to local drug barons .
The New York Times reported in October 2009 that he also receives payments from the CIA .
He is further accused of acquiring land and construction projects through corruption .
In sharp contrast to their attitude toward the US - backed figures like the Karzais , some 53 percent of people stated that they consider the Taliban to be honest and “ incorruptible . ”
The survey of some 1,994 people was only carried out in areas under the control of the occupation forces , so its results are most likely an understatement of the opposition to US - NATO forces .
A summary of the findings was first made public on April 16 by Wired.com ’s Danger Room .
This week , the Associated Press published an interview with a local Kandahar Taliban commander named Mubeen , who claimed that the resistance had used the winter months to move additional fighters , explosives and other hardware into Kandahar in anticipation of the offensive .
Kandahar itself is a crowded city of as many as 800,000 people , with narrow roads and labyrinthine streets that lend themselves to urban guerrilla warfare .
With the assistance of locals , the Taliban claims to have been rigging bombs and other traps for the occupation forces .
Mubeen told the AP , “ Because of the American attitude to the people , they are sympathetic to us .
Every day we are getting more support .
We are not strangers .
We are not foreigners .
We are from the people . ”
If the occupation forces proved too strong , he said , “ we will just leave and come back after . ”
The region surrounding Kandahar city has a rural population of some 500,000 , among whom fighters have sheltered since 2001 .
Attacks against occupation targets in Kandahar are already beginning to increase .
On Thursday , Taliban militants assassinated the government ’s director of agriculture in the province while he shopped in a Kandahar suburb .
On Monday , the pro-US deputy mayor of the city was shot dead as he bowed to pray in a mosque .
Explosives rigged to a donkey were detonated outside a police station the same day .
The week before , housing associated with contracting companies working for the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and the Afghan government was bombed , killing 3 locals and wounding as many as 10 foreign workers .
It was the fifth attack on USAID - linked facilities in Kandahar and Helmand in a month .
As of April 22 , 166 US and NATO troops had already been killed this year in Afghanistan — nearly double the number during the same period in 2009 .
In every previous year , the bulk of US - NATO deaths and injuries have been suffered between July and October .
If , as is likely , casualties soar to well over 100 per month due to heavy fighting in Kandahar , it is possible that the overall annual death toll could reach the 1,000 mark this year for the first time during the war .
Since 2001 , the lives of 1,733 US and NATO troops have so far been squandered in Afghanistan to realize the US ’s predatory ambition to dominate the oil - rich and strategic region of Central Asia .
At least another 8,000 have been wounded - in- action , including more than 5,000 Americans .
Thousands more have suffered non -battle injuries and illness .
While there is no accurate count of Afghan casualties over the past eight and a half years , it certainly runs in the tens of thousands .
Obama ’s surge will only to add to the toll of death and suffering .

A plethora of recent news stories have highlighted a growing problem with the regulation of alternative medicine in Britain .
Together they reveal an industry that is increasingly out of control in the absence of any coherent government policy .
The consequences are bad for the public , and bad for alternative medicine practitioners themselves .
The British Homeopathic Association was criticised for giving misleading evidence to parliament , homeopathy was savaged by a select committee report and the 10:23 campaign proved beyond doubt that " there 's nothing in it " by staging mass overdoses .
Police began an investigation into alleged fraud at a charity founded by Prince Charles , the Foundation for Integrated Health .
And Simon Singh yesterday finally defeated the libel action brought by the British Chiropractic Association .
In many cases , the wounds are self - inflicted .
Many questioned the BCA 's wisdom in pursuing Singh through the courts , but perhaps a more pertinent question for chiropractors is what on earth a professional body was doing spending hundreds of thousands of pounds of members ' fees protecting its own interests ?
The consequences have n't stopped there .
A quirk of the General Chiropractic Council 's rules means that chiropractors who make claims that are incompatible with previous Advertising Standards Authority rulings must be investigated by the regulator .
It 's a curiously ad hoc approach to regulation , and it has been exploited by sceptics to the extent that one in four chiropractors are now being investigated by the council for allegedly making misleading claims to the public
Similar stories of regulatory strife can be found across the industry , with an alphabet soup of regulators and professional bodies – often in direct competition with each other – attempting to enforce some sort of order .
The results range from apathy to the sort of pitched battles raging in homeopathy .
Regulators themselves are running amok , with the Society of Homeopaths and Homeopathy Action Trust continuing to fund the homeopathic treatment of Aids in Africa .
Conventional medical regulators are n't free of this confusion either .
I recently asked the General Medical Council about homeopathy .
They told me that doctors " must provide effective treatments based on the best available evidence " ( they declined to comment on the evidence for homeopathy ) , and yet a complaint by Merseyside Skeptics about a GP advocating homeopathy on the news was met with the reply that they " do not require doctors to use only evidence - based treatments " .
Stepping into the middle of all this mess is a new government - backed regulatory organisation , the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council ( CNHC ) , or " OfQuack " as it was inevitably dubbed by critics , set up by Prince Charles ' Foundation for Integrated Health with an additional grant from the Department of Health .
The Department of Health insists that the charity and council are now completely separate organisations .
But how a charity that lobbies on behalf of the alternative medicine industry came to be funded by the government to set up a regulator for the very same industry is unclear , because meetings between Prince Charles and the Secretary of State for Health , Andy Burnham , are among the most closely guarded secrets in government .
They 're probably filed in a basement somewhere between UFO sightings and the real reason for the big cloud of volcanic ash sitting over the country .
The government 's response to a Freedom of Information request I submitted read like something out of Yes Minister :
" The Department neither confirms nor denies that it holds information falling within the description specified in your request ...
This should not be taken as an indication that the information you requested is or is not held by the Department ...
To be clear , the Department is not neither confirming nor denying whether the Secretary of State met with The Prince of Wales ...
The Department is neither confirming nor denying whether it holds any information within the specific terms of your request . "
The CNHC launched with a target of registering 10,000 practitioners across a variety of disciplines .
Almost immediately it became apparent that it would not attract enough members , and more than a year later a little over 2,000 practitioners have signed up , 8,000 short of the number required for the council to be self - financing , as revealed in a recent public meeting .
Part of the reason for this shortfall has been explained as " inaccurate business information " due to a lack of research into the industry – leading to the overestimate of its scale – but a bigger problem is the amount of hostility the council faces from the alternative medicine community .
Suggestions from Andy Burnham that herbal medicine practitioners be brought under the CNHC umbrella have not been received well , while homeopathy groups have pretty much rejected the idea outright .
With a new government set to assume power and all parties likely to take a hard look at budgets and quangos , the future of the CNHC is far from certain .
And even it it were , the fact remains that the council is a voluntary register , and one that is not required to scrutinise the medical claims made by its members .
It is thus about as powerful as , well , most of the medicine it regulates .
Why is there a need for an alternative medicine regulator in the first place ?
This question has never been answered satisfactorily .
Either a product is a medicine , in which case it should be allowed to make health claims and be regulated as a medicine by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , or it is not , in which case it should n't be allowed to make health claims and should be regulated in the same way as , say , a packet of Tic - Tacs .
Allowing this bizarre pseudo - regulation to continue risks legitimising a whole range of bogus medical practices .
The company asks that its customers remove the faulty 196.75 graphics drivers and upgrade to the latest package
Nvidia on Wednesday asked customers to remove drivers that caused its GeForce graphics cards to overheat , which ultimately crashed some PCs .
Nvidia acknowledged on its support site that customers had problems with the 196.75 package of GeForce drivers .
Nvidia is asking customers to remove the faulty driver package and upgrade to the latest package , which is 197.13 .
" Nvidia is aware that some customers have reported fan speed issues after installing 196.75 drivers from Nvidia 's website .
Nvidia has removed these drivers and asked its partners to also remove the drivers , " Nvidia wrote on another support site .
As an alternative , customers could roll back to the older versions of graphics drivers , Nvidia said .
" In almost every case reverting back to our 196.21 driver immediately resolved their issues , " Nvidia wrote .
The GPU drivers need to be changed for the Windows 7 , Vista and XP operating systems .
The fix applies to the GeForce 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 100 , 200 , and 300 series desktop GPUs and Ion desktop GPUs .
Customers on an Nvidia forum reported system crashes due to overheating of graphics cards .
On another Nvidia forum , users reported that automatic fan speed control would not work and Windows would hang when they played games .
By mimicking photosynthesis , Sun Catalytix 's system can store solar energy in the form of hydrogen .
Logo : Sun Catalytix .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
With one bottle of drinking water and four hours of sunlight , MIT chemist Dan Nocera claims that he can produce 30 KWh of electricity , which is enough to power an entire household in the developing world .
With about three gallons of river water , he could satisfy the daily energy needs of a large American home .
The key to these claims is a new , affordable catalyst that uses solar electricity to split water and generate hydrogen .
Using the electricity generated from a 30 - square - meter photovoltaic array , Nocera ’s cobalt - phosphate catalyst converts water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen and oxygen .
The process is similar to organic photosynthesis , except that in nature , plants create energy in the form of sugars instead of hydrogen .
The hydrogen produced through artificial photosynthesis can be stored in a tank and later used to produce electricity by being recombined with oxygen in a fuel cell , even when the sun is n’t shining .
Alternatively , the hydrogen can be converted into a liquid fuel .
" Almost all the solar energy is stored in water splitting , " Nocera said at the first - ever ARPA -E ( Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy ) conference last Tuesday .
" We emulated photosynthesis for large - scale storage of solar energy . "
With his start - up company , Sun Catalytix , Nocera hopes to make the system affordable enough to allow individual homes to generate their own fuel and electricity on - site .
By distributing hydrogen production in this way , the new method could potentially solve the problem of hydrogen transportation .
“ If I could store the sun in terms of a fuel , then at night when the sun goes down I can use the sun , effectively , ” Nocera said in a company video .
“ What we ’ve done is that we ’ve made sunlight available 24 hours a day , seven days a week . ”
In January , Sun Catalytix was awarded $ 4 million in government funding through the new ARPA - E agency .
Modeled after DARPA , ARPA-E was formed to promote the development of advanced energy technologies - in this case , “ direct solar fuels , ” or “ electrofuels . ”
Nocera explained that Sun Catalytix is using the financial support to take its prototype to the next level .
“ Where Sun Catalytix is headed is that your house would become its own power station and gas station , ” he said in the video .
“ All of a sudden , you do n’t need any more energy from anybody else because you ’re using the sun at your house . ”

The first significant signs of a cooler , more ecologically sound Future are now becoming a reality in Toronto Ontario , because as of January 31st 2010 , all new building permits issued for buildings over 2000 sq.ft. will also require Green Roof construction in the building plans .
( UPDATE : See Note at bottom for a loophole that ’s been discovered by some clever property developers though ! ) .
Nevertheless , however brief the Summers may be in these Northern climes , there are still all sorts of other steps that we can take to help cool our cities and reduce the enormous emissions produced by all the cooling energy that we collectively consume during hot Summer months .
In fact , it ’s been estimated that we could reduce the ambient temperature of our cities by as much as 3 degrees C ( 5degF ) , just by putting a few relatively simple measures into place , and reap enormous health , energy , and ecological savings immediately !
The first an most obvious thing is to get more trees in the ground , to start replacing the grand old trees that currently shade us , but which are getting very near the end of their lifetimes .
Make no mistake that especially in cities like Toronto , the mature tree cover that we enjoy ( but so often take for granted ) is not a permanent feature , and in some cases is getting perilously close to the end of it ’s useful life .
There are lots of other , more complicated methods of reducing the heat island effect in the city , if you ’re curious … and willing to factor in some incurred “ expenses ” as the only drawback to reducing future costs as energy prices will soar , while improving our entire urban landscape for all !
We can look to old Mediteranea cities for examples of building design that might not be as applicable to Northern climates , but why not look even closer to home for signs of progress ?
When it ’s not busy trying daring legal end -runs around the U.S. Congress to regulate carbon dioxideas a “ pollutant ” emitted from the nations tailpipes …
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) can also be seen as a fount of useful environmental knowledge , which can help us build a better future , one project at a time .
Here are some of the alternate plans
Cool Pavements
Reduced stormwater runoff and improved water quality : Permeable pavements allow stormwater to soak into the pavement and soil , reducing runoff and filtering pollutants .
Both permeable and non-permeable cool pavements can also help lower the temperature of runoff , resulting in less thermal shock to aquatic life in the waterways into which stormwater drains .
Although the rigors of Northern Winters and frost heave , would likely relegate this technology to parking lots , or residential roads , until formulations and construction ( raod - bed ) methods could be perfected .

: Permeable roadway pavements can improve safety by reducing water spray from moving vehicles and increasing traction through better water drainage .
Better nighttime visibility : Reflective pavements can enhance visibility at night , potentially reducing lighting requirements and saving both money and energy .
Cool Roofs
Reduced energy use : A cool roof transfers less heat to the building below , so the building stays cooler and uses less energy for air conditioning .
Reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions :
By lowering energy use , cool roofs decrease the production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
Improved human health and comfort : Cool roofs can reduce air temperatures inside buildings with and without air conditioning , helping to prevent heat - related illnesses and deaths .
Green Roofs
Reduced energy use : Green roofs absorb heat and act as insulators for buildings , reducing energy needed to provide cooling and heating .
Reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions :
By lowering air conditioning demand , green roofs can decrease the production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
Vegetation can also remove air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions through dry deposition and carbon sequestration and storage .
Improved human health and comfort : Green roofs , by reducing heat transfer through the building roof , can improve indoor comfort and lower heat stress associated with heat waves .
Enhanced stormwater management and water quality : Green roofs can reduce and slow stormwater runoff in the urban environment ; they also filter pollutants from rainfall .
Improving swimming and wildlife habitat , due to higher treatment standards of lowered waste water volume
Improved quality of life : Green roofs can provide aesthetic value and habitat for many species .
Opportunities for local food production
NOTE :
Are there loopholes for
Property Developers ?
It seems like some clever builder ’s may have found a loophole in Toronto ’s new building code , where the requirement for “ Green Roof ” technology , can be offset by the installation of solar panels !
Exemptions for this requirement are provisioned for areas that are set aside for renewable energy installations .
Since nobody will likely be installing windmills on their roofs , we can presume that this relates to solar - electric ( ie. PV ) panels .
There are now quite a few companies out there that are willing to pay “ rent ” in exchange for installing solar panels on rooftops , any savvy - developer will certainly be more willing to take a small amount of money , in exchange for a big saving in building costs .
Also , since there is no clear stipulation in the by - law on how densely installed the PV panels would need to be , a clever layout of their PV array , would easily fill the by - law requirement at a minimal install cost .
Also , Solar PV would n’t offer the same wider ecological benefits ( aside from absorption of visible spectrum , and offsetting a small amount of fossil fuel generated power in between maintenance cycles of course ) .
However , once a lease agreement for solar panels expires , there seems to be no provision in the by - law for re-designing a rooftop to fulfill the “ GreenRoof ” requirements after the fact , if the panels are subsequently removed , re-configured , or become obsolete over time .
Note also , that private terraces , and residential amenity areas ( to a maximum of 2m2/ 21 sf per unit ) are also exempt from this “ green roof requirement , so the entire goal of this initiative can be avoided with just some clever building plans , or partnerships with PV providers who also know the ins-and - outs of the generous government subsidies and grants for renewable energy .
Leave it to real - estate barons to find a way to soak up the solar gains for themselves !
Imprisoned Burmese blogger Nay Phone Latt , whose role in disseminating news of the September 2007 uprising in Burma won him international applaud , has received the prestigious PEN / Barbara Goldsmith award .
Speaking prior the award ceremony last night in New York , PEN president Kwame Anthony Appiah said that Nay Phone Latt , who was arrested in January 2008 and sentenced to 20 years in prison , “ represents a younger generation of Burmese who are longing for freedom and willing to pay the cost of speaking out in its defense ” .
According to news alerts following his sentencing , the 29 - year - old was arrested for posting satirical cartoons of Burmese junta chief Than Shwe on his blog .
The charge of “ causing public alarm ” accounted for two of 20 years he is to spend in prison .
He was also a prolific writer , and posted regular articles during the so - called Saffron Revolution in 2007 that partly compensated for the media blackout enforced by the regime .
Burma has one of the most draconian media environments in the world , and journalists are regularly given painfully long sentences .
Aye Aye Than , the mother of Nay Phone Latt , told DVB today that he was already aware of the honour via someone who visited him in prison , and that “ he was very happy to win this literature award because that is what he is fond of . ”
“ He did n’t attack or criticise or denounce anyone on his blog .
I have no regret about his blogging , ” she said , adding that she last visited him on 1 April and “ he was in good health ” .
Burma ranked 171 out of 175 countries in the Reporters Without Borders ’ Press Freedom Index .
Appiah , a Ghanaian novelist and philosopher , also lamented the fact that internet censorship had become “ one of the great threats to free expression today ” .
“ That Nay Phone Latt is also a poet reminds us that every society speaks with the voice of the imagination as well as through its non-fiction writers .
We honor him .
We thank him .
We ask all who have any influence on the government of Burma to press for his release . ”
The Burmese junta is expected to intensify its crackdown on journalists in the run-up to elections this year .
Around 14 media workers are currently behind bars , some serving sentences of up to 35 years .
Nay Phone Latt had been given no legal representation during his trial due to his lawyer being imprisoned the week before .
Fellow Burmese activist , comedian and part - journalist , Zarganar , was last year honoured with the PEN / Pinter award for ‘ imprisoned writers of courage ’ – Zarganar was sentenced in November 2008 to 59 years , later reduced to 35 years , after giving interviews to foreign media in which he criticized the Burmese junta ’s reaction to cyclone Nargis in May 2008 .
PEN , which advocates for global freedom of expression , is the world ’s oldest human rights organisation and the oldest international literary organisation .
Gray wolves throughout the eastern and western United States were downlisted from endangered to threatened status effective April 1 , 2003 .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it established three Distinct Population Segments ( DPS ) for the gray wolf .
Wolves in the Western DPS and Eastern DPS were listed as threatened but in the Southwestern DPS wolves remain listed as endangered .
The experimental population areas in central Idaho , Yellowstone , and the southwest remain unaffected by this listing action .
The new threatened status in N. Montana and N. Idaho , Washington , Oregon , California , Nevada and the northern portions of Colorado and Utah [ N. Of I - 70 ] is accompanied by a special 4d rule that allows wolf management very similar but slightly more flexible than that already allowed in the experimental population areas Wolves - J. Zumbo T hanks to a controversial but very successful reintroduction program , wolves are now back in Yellowstone after an absence of almost 70 years .
Several dozen wolves were captured in Canada and turned loose in Yellowstone In March 1995 .
Those animals have done remarkably well , reproducing at a rapid rate .
Packs are now located in various parts of the park .
Wolves prey on a variety of species , notably elk in the Yellowstone area , but will also pursue moose , deer , sheep and other animals .
Although wolf packs have wandered outside Yellowstone , the best place to see them Is in the Lamar Valley between Mammoth and Cooke City .
Get there very early in the morning when it 's still dark , park your RV In a pullout and listen very quietly .
Chances are good you 'll hear them howl , and you may see them in this vast open sagebrush area as they hunt for breakfast .
At this time , it will be tough to see them outside the park , although there are often consistent sightings around Nye and Fishtail , Montana .

Trip to Yellowstone Park " More Information More Information Conservation Groups Challenge Bush Administration Wolf Killing Plan
" It 's going to be open season on wolves , " says Natural Resources Defense Council LIVINGSTON , Mont. ( January 24 , 2008 )  Conservation groups say they will file a lawsuit in federal court immediately to block a rule announced today by the Bush administration that will allow the states of Idaho , Montana and Wyoming to kill most of the threatened wolves in the Northern Rockies .
The new  10 ( j )  rule widens a loophole in the Endangered Species
Act that permits the killing of hundreds of wolves even though the animals are considered at risk of extinction .
 The Bush administration is giving a blank check to the states to slaughter wolves for doing what they need to do to make a living  which is eating deer and elk ,  said the NRDCs Louisa Willcox .
 The government spent millions of dollars to reintroduce wolves to the wild in the Northern Rockies , and now it wants to spend millions more to kill them .
That s crazy .
The U.S Fish and Wildlife Service announced today it will publish the rule in the Federal Register on January 28 .
The rule allows states to kill wolves that they believe are adversely affecting on elk .
But elk numbers in the region are at an all - time high .
Despite this fact , the states of Wyoming and Idaho have made it clear that they intend to manage wolves at the minimum allowable level , leaving alive as few as 600 of the 1,500 wolves now living in the region .
According to the rule , aerial gunning and shooting from the ground will be used to kill wolves .
The rule precedes an expected decision to remove wolves from the endangered species list next month .
After that happens , wolf numbers could be reduced to as few as 300 .
 Im prepared to bid for the first ticket to shoot a wolf myself ,  said Idaho Gov. Butch Otter at a press conference at the state Capitol in Boise on January 11 , 2007 .
Wyoming officials say they ultimately aim to kill two - thirds of the approximately 300 wolves on state land according to an article published in the Billings Gazette on June 11 , 2007 , leaving about 100 animals alive  the minimum number allowed by federal law .
The reintroduction of wolves by the federal government 12 years ago has been widely hailed as a major success story .
It has measurably improved the natural balance in the Northern Rockies and benefited bird , antelope and elk populations , according to NRDC .
Many thousands of visitors flock to Yellowstone National Park each year to see and hear wolves in the wild , contributing at least $ 35 million to the local economy each year , the group said .
 Wolves are one of the main attractions for visitors at Yellowstone National Park .
People are amazed and awed when they see them ,  said Willcox .
 Their recovery after more than a century of extermination is nothing short of miraculous .
Turning back the clock would be a huge mistake . 
Conservation groups oppose the revised 10 ( j ) wolf killing rule and the decision to delist wolves because the wolves  numbers , genetic diversity and geographic spread have not increased enough to ensure their long - term survival .
But the loophole announced today allows the slaughter to begin even before the wolves are formally delisted .
It also will allow the state and federal governments to continue killing wolves if conservation groups are successful in slowing or stopping delisting through litigation .
In revising the 10 ( j ) rule , the Fish and Wildlife Service says it needs to make killing wolves easier to protect big game from wolf predation .
However , current rules already allow wolves to be killed if the states can show that they are the primary  cause of elk , moose and deer depletion .
The new rule allows wolves to be killed anywhere big game herds are considered below desired management levels , even though studies show that elk populations are particularly high and not in jeopardy .
Thousands of gray wolves roamed the Rocky Mountains before being slaughtered and eliminated in most of the West by the 1930s .
The gray wolf was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1973 .
Reintroduction efforts placed 66 wolves in Yellowstone National Park and part of Idaho in 1995 - 96 .
As many as 1,500 wolves now live in Idaho , Montana and Wyoming .
 The federal government is giving the states a license to kill under almost any circumstance ,  said Willcox .
 It s going to be open season on wolves . 
Clip from " The Wildlife of Yellowstone " DVD Wolves ( Canis lupus ) in the Northern Rocky Mountain states ( Idaho , Montana and Wyoming ) continue to increase in distribution and numbers ( Figures 1 , 5 ) .
Estimates of wolf numbers at the end of 2002 were 284 wolves in the Central Idaho Recovery Area , 271 in the Greater Yellowstone Recovery Area , and 108 in the Northwest Montana Recovery Area for a total of 663 ( Figure 1 , Table 4a ) .
By state boundaries , there were an estimated 263 wolves in the state of Idaho , 217 in Wyoming and 183 in Montana ( Table 4 b ) .
Of approximately 80 groups of two or more wolves , 43 met the definition of breeding pair ,  an adult male and female raising two or more pups until December 31 .
This made 2002 the third year in which 30 or more breeding pairs were documented within the three - state area .
Recovery criteria have been met for removing these wolves from the Endangered Species List ( Table 4a ) .
It is expected that the process of delisting could begin in 2003 if state management plans are in place .
Wolves in the area subsist mainly on elk ( Cervus elaphus ) , white - tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) , mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) , moose ( Alces alces ) , and bison ( Bison bison ) .
Livestock depredations in 2002 included 52 cattle ( Bos taurus ) , 99 sheep ( Ovis aries ) , nine dogs ( Canis familiaris ) and five llamas ( Lama glama ) confirmed lost to wolves ( Table 5a , 5 b ) .
Approximately 23 of 80 known wolf packs were involved in livestock depredations .
In response , 46 wolves were killed within the 3 - state area .
No wolves were translocated in 2002 .
As new packs are formed between the original core recovery / release areas , the three populations increasingly resemble and function as a single , large population ( Figure 1 ) .
Approximately 12 research projects are underway , examining wolf population dynamics , predator - prey interactions and livestock depredation .
BACKGROUND
Gray wolf populations were extirpated from the western U.S. by the 1930s .
Subsequently , wolves from Canada occasionally dispersed south into Montana and Idaho but failed to survive long enough to reproduce .
Public attitudes toward predators changed and wolves received legal protection with the passage of the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) in 1973 .
Wolves began to successfully recolonize northwest Montana in the early 1980s .
By 1995 , there were six wolf packs in northwestern Montana .
In 1995 and 1996 , 66 wolves from southwestern Canada were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park ( YNP ) ( 31 wolves ) and central Idaho ( 35 wolves ) .
The Northern Rocky Mountain ( NRM ) wolf population contains three recovery areas :
The Northwest Montana recovery area ( NWMT , Figs.1 , 2 ) includes northwest Montana and the northern Idaho panhandle .
The Greater Yellowstone recovery area ( GYA , figs .
1 , 3 ) includes Wyoming and adjacent parts of Idaho and Montana .
The Central Idaho recovery area ( CID , Figs. 1 , 4 ) includes central Idaho and adjacent parts of southwest Montana .
Wolves in the three recovery areas are managed under different guidelines , depending upon their designated status under the ESA .
NWMT wolves are classified as endangered , the most protected classification under the ESA .
GYA and CID wolves are classified as nonessential experimental populations and managed with more flexible options than the endangered population .
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) , responsible for administering the ESA , believes that 30 breeding pairs of wolves , with an equitable distribution among the three states for three successive years , would constitute a viable and recovered wolf population .
That criterion was met at the end of 2002 .
If other provisions required for delisting are met , primarily adequate regulatory mechanisms in the form of state wolf management plans that would reasonably assure that the gray wolf would not become threatened or endangered again , the USFWS would propose delisting in 2003 .
NORTHWEST MONTANA WOLF RECOVERY AREA Personnel Wolves in Montana ( including the NWMT recovery area and parts of the GYA and CID recovery areas ) were monitored in 2002 by USFWS biologists Joe Fontaine in Helena and Tom Meier in Kalispell , and Turner Endangered Species Fund ( TESF ) biologist Val Asher in Bozeman .
They were assisted by seasonal USFWS employees Paul Frame , Rose Jaffe and Isaac Babcock , and work / study employee Therese Hartman .
Other USFWS personnel in Montana included wolf recovery coordinator Ed Bangs ( Helena ) , and law enforcement agents Roger Parker ( Billings ) , Rick Branzell ( Missoula ) , Doug Goessman ( Bozeman ) and Kim Speckman ( Great Falls ) .
In the parts of Montana that lie within the GYA and CID recovery areas , wolves were monitored cooperatively with the National Park Service ( NPS ) and Nez Perce Tribe ( NPT ) respectively .
Many other individuals , organizations and agencies contribute toward wolf monitoring and management ( see Acknowledgments ) .
Wolf control activities in all recovery areas were carried out by USDA / APHIS / Wildlife Services ( WS ) .
WS personnel involved in wolf management in Montana in 2002 included state director Larry Handegard , eastern district supervisor Paul J. Hoover , western district supervisor Kraig Glazier , wildlife specialists John Bouchard , Steve Demers , Michael Hoggan , Chad Hoover , R.R. Martin , Graeme McDougal , Theodore North , James Rost , Bart Smith , and James Stevens , and pilots Tim Graff and Eric Waldorf .
The Montana WS operation covers parts of the NWMT , GYA , and CID wolf recovery areas .
Monitoring Seventeen wolves were captured and radio - collared in NWMT in 2002 .
Seven of those were collared by WS in depredation control actions .
The other 10 were captured by USFWS personnel for population monitoring .
One wolf was darted from a helicopter , and the others were captured in foothold traps .
At the end of 2002 , 26 radio - collared wolves ( 23 % of the population ) from 15 different packs or pairs were being monitored in NWMT .
These packs , together with uncollared packs that have been documented , totaled about 108 wolves ( Figs 1 , 2 ; Tables 1a , 4 ) .
Radio - collared wolves were located from aircraft approximately twice per month .
Collared wolves in and around Glacier National Park ( GNP ) were located more frequently from the ground by GNP and USFWS staff and volunteers .
Packs included in NWMT as of December 2002 were Kintla , Murphy Lake , Ninemile , Castle Rock , Whitefish , Grave Creek , Spotted Bear , Fishtrap , Red Shale ( formerly Gates Park ) , Fish Creek , Lupine , Yaak , Lonepine ( formerly Little Thompson ) , Lazy Creek , Hog Heaven , Green Mountain , Great Divide , Halfway , Blanchard Creek , Potomac , and Chief Mountain .
The Yaak pair consists of a female translocated to the Yaak as a pup in December 2001 , and a male of unknown origin .
A yearling male translocated at the same time remains in the Yaak as a lone wolf .
The Apgar and Danaher Packs , discussed in previous reports , are no longer thought to be present .
A possible pack on the east side of Lake Koocanusa ( Ural Pack ) has yet to be collared and documented .
Packs of wolves in the Yaak , Kootenai , Wigwam , Spruce Creek and Belly River drainages of Canada may stray into Montana , but den and spend most of their time in Canada and are not counted in the NWMT population .
The Grave Creek and Kintla Packs spend a significant part of their time in British Columbia , but are considered part of the NWMT population .
Along the border between the NWMT and CID recovery areas , the Fish Creek and Lupine Packs are counted in the NWMT population , while the Bighole Pack ( near Lolo Pass ) is counted in the CID population .
Reproduction was confirmed in the Kintla , Murphy Lake , Ninemile , Castle Rock , Whitefish , Grave Creek , Spotted Bear , Fishtrap , Red Shale , Fish Creek , Lazy Creek , Hog Heaven , Green Mountain , Great Divide , Halfway , and Blanchard Creek Packs .
In order to count as a breeding pair toward recovery goals , an adult male and female and at least two pups must be present in the pack at years end .
The Grave Creek and Lazy Creek Packs had only one pup each by the end of 2002 , the Halfway Pack had only one adult , and pups from the Blanchard Creek Pack were orphaned in May and certainly died .
Eleven packs met the criteria of breeding pair , counting toward recovery goals .
At least 27 wolves from the NWMT population died in 2002 .
This count does not include animals that disappeared whose fates were unknown , including 22 pups that disappeared .
A female from the Kintla Pack was apparently killed by an elk .
The other documented deaths were human - caused .
Depredation control resulted in the deaths of nine wolves .
Eight wolves were road - killed , and five were known to be illegally killed or their deaths are still under investigation as illegal kills .
Three of the yearling wolves translocated into the Yaak in December 2001 were legally shot in British Columbia .
Another of the Yaak yearlings died after getting caught in a coyote snare .
A semi-tame , wolflike canid that killed two llamas and was shot near Whitefish in July 2002 was not considered to be a wild wolf and is not included in these figures .
Of at least 74 wolf pups known to have been born , 44 survived until December 31 , for a pup survival rate of 59 % to the age of eight months .
This is a maximum figure , because pup counts were not obtained until midsummer for some packs , by which time some mortality may already have occurred .

M.S. thesis completed and available from University of Idaho , Moscow .
Gray wolf populations have persisted and expanded in the northern Rocky Mountains since 1986 , while reintroduction efforts in Idaho and Yellowstone have further bolstered the population .
However , rigorous analysis of either the availability of wolf habitat in the region , or the specific habitat requirements of local wolves , has yet to be conducted .
We examined wolf - habitat relationships in the western U.S. by relating landscape / habitat features found within wolf pack home ranges ( n = 56 ) to those found in adjacent unoccupied areas .
Logistic regression of occupied versus unoccupied areas revealed that a higher degree of forest cover , lower human population density , higher elk density , and lower sheep density were the primary factors related to wolf occupation .
Further , our analysis indicated that relatively large tracts of suitable habitat remain unoccupied , suggesting that wolf populations likely will continue to increase in the region .
Analysis of the habitat linkage among the three main wolf sub-populations indicates that populations in central Idaho and northwest Montana have higher connectivity , and thus greater potential for exchange of individuals , than does either subpopulation to the Greater Yellowstone Area subpopulation .
Thus , for the northern Rocky Mountains to function as a metapopulation for wolves and other carnivores ( e.g. , lynx , wolverine , and grizzly bears ) , it will be necessary that dispersal corridors to the Yellowstone ecosystem be established and conserved .
Wolf and Livestock Conflicts in Montana , Idaho , and Wyoming : an evaluation of wolf control and assessment of factors that may predispose cattle ranches to wolf predation .
Investigators : Elizabeth H. Bradley and Dr. Daniel Pletscher , Wildlife Biology Program , School of Forestry , University of Montana .
Cooperators : USFWS , Turner Endangered Species Fund , Yellowstone National Park , Nez Perce Tribe , Defenders of Wildlife , National Fish and Wildlife Foundation .
We are investigating several aspects of livestock depredation and management in the recovery areas of Montana , Idaho , and Wyoming .
First , we are conducting an analysis of two different management techniques , translocation and lethal control , to determine how effective they are at reducing livestock depredations .
Data are currently being compiled on all wolves translocated and lethally controlled since 1987 .
Effectiveness of translocation will be determined based on the extent to which wolves survive , reproduce , and / or depredate post - translocation .
Sex , age , and social status of translocated wolves , distance of translocation , release method ( hard / soft ) , and post - release movements will all be considered in this context .
Effectiveness of lethal control , as well as translocation will also be determined based on the extent to which the remaining pack members ( if any ) continue to depredate , taking into account the number of individuals remaining and their sex , age , and social status , if known .
Depredation history of packs post - lethal control or translocation will be compared to packs that depredated but did not undergo any form of control .
The second part of this study involves an analysis of what factors may predispose cattle ranches and site specific areas on cattle ranches to wolf predation .
Data were collected from ranchers who had experienced confirmed wolf depredations in confined pastures , to determine what landscape and / or ranch characteristics may be associated with these depredation events .
Each depredated ranch was paired with up to four nearby non-depredated ranches for comparison .
Communities that have experienced multiple depredation events have been the primary focus of this research .
Data collection began in June 2002 and concluded in January 2003 and included the following areas : Paradise Valley , East Front , Marion , Eureka , Deerlodge , Bitterroot , and Big Hole areas in Montana , and the Salmon , Challis , and Stanley Basin areas in Idaho .
Data are currently being compiled and prepared for analysis .
The overall purpose of this study is to provide information that may help decrease wolf conflicts with livestock .
An analysis of the effectiveness of translocation and lethal control of wolves under direction of the USFWS may help future state managers in the northwestern U.S. and elsewhere improve management decisions .
A better understanding of what factors are involved in wolf depredation on cattle ranches may help build better preventive methods .
This project will be completed in late 2003 .
Outreach Program personnel presented informational talks and status reports throughout the year to various federal and state agencies , public and private institutions , special interest groups , and rural communities .
During 2002 , USFWS project personnel gave approximately 50 public presentations to audiences totaling more than four thousand people .
Additionally , scores of informal presentations to small groups or individuals were conducted during this time .
Numerous radio and television interviews and news spots featuring project personnel were broadcast locally and nationally .
Livestock Depredation and Management
In the Northwest Montana wolf recovery area , wolves are currently classified as endangered , and management activities are more restricted than in the experimental nonessential ( Yellowstone and Central Idaho ) recovery areas .
The use of nonlethal ammunition and hazing is restricted to agency personnel , and lethal take permits cannot be issued to livestock owners .
Under the nationwide wolf reclassification proposal expected to take effect in early 2003 , wolves in NWMT would be classified as threatened , and management would be similar to that in the other two recovery areas .
All reports of wolf depredation on livestock are investigated by WS , who take appropriate control action after consultation with USFWS .
Seven of the 20 known wolf packs in NWMT were involved in livestock or dog depredations in 2002 .
Confirmed losses in 2002 included nine cattle , 13 sheep , four dogs and five llamas killed by wolves .
Losses classified as probable wolf depredation included another two cattle and five sheep .
In wooded and / or mountainous country , livestock carcasses may not be found promptly , if ever .
It can be difficult or impossible to confirm wolf depredation when livestock carcasses are eaten or decomposed .
Therefore , confirmed losses represent only a portion of actual losses .
Whether this is a large or small portion of such losses is the subject of much controversy and research ( see Effects of Wolves on Livestock Calf Survival and Movements in Central Idaho , CID research section ) .
Depredation control efforts resulted in the death of nine wolves .
Nonlethal control methods included trapping and hazing of packs to move them away from livestock , nonlethal ammunition , fladry and Radio Activated Guard ( RAG ) boxes .
Ninemile Pack :
A series of livestock depredations in the Ninemile Valley that began in late 2001 continued throughout 2002 , in spite of extensive nonlethal and lethal control actions .
Twelve sheep , five llamas and a dog were confirmed killed by wolves in 2002 , with other livestock injured or suspected to have been killed .
The use of a RAG ( radio - activated guard ) box , electric fencing and fladry probably helped to decrease losses , and six wolves were killed in control actions .
Two more wolves were radio - collared and released , and three pups from the Ninemile Pack were killed by vehicles .
Five wolves were thought to remain in the pack at the end of the year , with depredations continuing into 2003 .
Castle Rock Pack : Although five wolves had been removed from the pack in 2001 , the Castle Rock Pack continued to kill cattle in 2002 .
Four calves were confirmed to have been killed by the pack , with two others considered probable wolf depredation .
Three wolves were captured , radio - collared and released .
Two adult male wolves were killed in a control action in August .
One producer reported 56 calves missing in fall 2002 .
Depredations continued , and the pack was eliminated in February 2003 .
Grave Creek Pack :
Two lion hounds were attacked by the Grave Creek Pack in the Deep Creek drainage in March 2002 .
One dog was killed and eaten , the other escaped .
In July , several cattle were attacked on the Deep Creek / Grave Creek grazing allotment of the Kootenai National Forest .
One cow and two calves were killed or lethally wounded , another calf injured .
Because the Grave Creek Pack had also killed cattle in 2000 and 2001 with no control action taken , it was decided to remove one or more members of the pack .
But when traps were set , the wolves had left the area and none were captured .
The Grave Creek Pack travels widely on both sides of the Whitefish Range and into Canada .
Discussions are ongoing between USFWS , the U. S. Forest Service ( USFS ) , local ranchers , and the National Wildlife Federation , to come up with strategies to mitigate livestock depredation in this area .
Red Shale Pack :
In early January 2002 , the Red Shale ( formerly Gates Park ) Pack , in the North Fork of the Sun River , attacked two lion hounds near Gibson Reservoir .
By the time the hunter located his dogs , both had been killed and one partially consumed .
Great Divide Pack : A calf was confirmed killed by the newly - formed Great Divide Pack in December 2002 .
The calf was a straggler that had escaped roundup .
The Great Divide alpha female , # 281 , was one of five wolves translocated from the Castle Rock Pack to the west side of Lake Koocanusa in 2001 .
She had returned to within 20 miles of her natal territory and bred in 2002 , but was struck by a vehicle and killed in September 2002 .
One Great Divide pup was captured and radio - collared in summer , but its collar was chewed off by other pack members .
There are currently no radio - collars in the pack , thought to consist of the original male , four pups and a newly - arrived female .
Halfway Pack :
A series of incidents of cattle being chased through fences in the area north of Avon was originally attributed to the Castle Rock Pack , until the newly - formed Halfway Pack was discovered .
Alpha Female # 280 , originally from the Castle Rock Pack , had been translocated 200 miles northwest in 2001 , but like Great Divide female # 281 she returned to within 20 miles of her natal pack and bred in 2002 .
She had lost her collar in August 2001 , was recollared in September 2002 but soon disappeared .
The alpha male died in a trap in September .
Livestock depredations continued into early 2003 and the pack was eliminated in February 2003 .
Lonepine Pack :
One cow and one calf , from separate ranches , were confirmed killed by wolves in December 2002 , on the Confederated Salish - Kootenai Reservation between Hot Springs and Polson .
Three wolves have been seen by ranchers in the area .
A wolf that may have been associated with them , Female # 276 , had been mistaken for a coyote and shot earlier in the month .
Female # 276 had been referred to as the  Little Thompson wolf , but the new pack has been named Lonepine to more accurately reflect their location .
Lack of snow hindered attempts to locate and capture wolves from the pack using aircraft .
Efforts will be made to trap and radio - collar them in 2003 .
Lone / Dispersing Wolves : A lone , wolf - like animal was seen repeatedly near Ferndale in summer 2002 .
It attacked poultry and behaved as though it had been associated with people .
The animal gradually moved north and west , killing a llama near Mud Lake in June and another llama near Whitefish in July .
Because of the abnormal behavior of the animal , it was determined that it was an escaped pet wolf or hybrid , and livestock owners in the area were told that they could shoot the animal if they had the opportunity .
A rancher shot it on July 19 , near the site of the last llama depredation .
Examination of the carcass revealed unusual skull shape , eye color , and foot size , validating the conclusion that it had been a wolf - dog hybrid .
Translocated Wolves Between January 1999 and December 2001 , 23 wolves in four groups were translocated within Montana to help mitigate livestock depredation .
In each case , wolves were moved from areas with high livestock numbers to areas of public land with few livestock and abundant natural prey .
Six of those wolves are still known to be alive in 2003 .
Ten were killed by humans , one died naturally and six are missing .
The average distance wolves moved from the release site before settling down or being killed was 57 miles .
Average survival after release was 14 months , as of January 2003 .
Seven of the 23 translocated wolves are known to have paired and bred after they were moved .
The Pleasant Valley , Castle Rock and Gravelly Packs all continued to kill livestock after some of their members were translocated , and lethal control followed within a year .
The Bass Creek Pack was completely eliminated by the translocation .
Although wolf translocation seems like a humane alternative to lethal control , especially when pups are involved , few places in the northern Rockies remain as likely release sites .
With increasing numbers of dispersing wolves and new pairs , all three recovery areas are becoming well occupied by wolves .
For this reason , few if any wolf translocations are expected to be done in the future .
Following are summaries of the four recent wolf translocations :
In January 1999 , four wolves were captured from the Pleasant Valley Pack and moved via truck and snowmobile to Spotted Bear ( 65 air miles from Pleasant Valley ) .
Adult male # 117 remains as the alpha male of the Spotted Bear Pack .
Yearling female # 128 traveled to the East Front and was killed in depredation control .
The cut - off radio - collar from male pup # 119 was found in the Garnet Mountains in September 1999 .
Male yearling # 115 was last heard in the Bob Marshall wilderness in March 2000 .
Ten wolves from the Bass Creek Pack were captured in June 1999 and held until December 1999 at McCall , Idaho .
Four wolves died in captivity .
The adult female and five pups were transported by truck and aircraft to Spotted Bear ( 98 air miles from Bass Creek ) in December 1999 .
They were held overnight in an electrified pen , and released when male # 117 was found to be in the area .
Female # 57 remains with male # 117 in the Spotted Bear Pack .
Female # 45 ( last heard near Ferndale in June 2000 ) and male # 50 ( last heard near Big Salmon Lake in December 2000 ) are missing .
Female # 46 died of unknown causes in the South Fork of the Flathead River , in December 2000 .
The carcass of male # 49 , without its collar , was found in the Clark Fork River in May 2000 .
The cut - off collar from male # 48 was found near Ovando in July 2000 .
Five wolves from the Castle Rock ( Boulder ) Pack were captured in January 2001 , held for two months , then transported by truck to Parsnip Creek , on the west side of Lake Koocanusa , 198 air miles from their home territory .
After their release , they first traveled north to Canada , but soon doubled back , and all returned at least halfway home , to the area west of Flathead Lake .
Two females , # 280 and # 284 , returned to form new packs adjacent to their home territory , the Halfway and Great Divide Packs .
Great Divide female # 284 was killed by a vehicle in September 2002 .
Halfway female # 280 disappeared in fall 2002 .
Little Thompson / Lonepine female # 276 was mistaken for a coyote and shot in December 2002 .
Male # 286 and female # 278 remain in the Hog Heaven Pack , southwest of Kalispell .
An adult female wolf , a yearling male and six pups were removed from the Gravelly Pack between April and June 2001 .
They were held until December 2001 , then transported by truck to the upper Yaak River and released , 319 air miles from their home territory .
Female # 206 soon left the release area , traveling west through Idaho and Washington , then north into British Columbia .
She was last located in February 2002 near Castlegar , British Columbia , 95 miles WNW of her release site .
Yearling male # 204 traveled into Canada , then southeast past Kalispell .
He has not been located since May 2002 .
Several of the pups remained in a group and caused concern among Yaak residents by their seeming lack of fear and their attraction toward domestic dogs , in winter 2001 - 2002 .
Three of them were eventually shot in British Columbia ( male # 229 , male # 233 , male # 234 ) .
Female # 231 was found dead in April 2002 , with a broken - off coyote snare on her neck .
Male # 232 remains in the Yaak / Pipe Creek area as a lone wolf .
Female # 230 has paired with a male wolf and remains in the Yaak .
GREATER YELLOWSTONE WOLF RECOVERY AREA Personnel
Three full - time employees worked for the Yellowstone Wolf Project in 2002 : Project Leader Douglas Smith , Biological Science Technician Debra Guernsey and Biologist Dan Stahler .
Rick McIntyre worked as a seasonal employee on the Druid Peak Pack Road Management Project .
Elena
West also worked on the Road Management Project , through the Yellowstone Park Foundation ( YPF ) .
Volunteers ( see Acknowledgments ) staffed the two early ( Nov - Dec ) and late ( March ) winter study periods .
Wolves in Wyoming outside Yellowstone National Park were monitored by Project Leader Mike Jimenez ( USFWS ) , seasonal biologists Paul Hanson ( USFWS ) and John Stevenson ( USFS ) , and student volunteers from Northwest College in Powell , Wyoming ( see Acknowledgments ) .
USFWS law enforcement agents in Wyoming were Dominic Domenici ( Casper ) , Tim Eicher ( Cody ) , and Roy Brown ( Lander ) .
Monitoring of wolves in the Montana portion of the GYA was conducted by Joe Fontaine ( USFWS ) and Val Asher ( TESF ) , along with other TESF , USFWS and NPS personnel and volunteers .
Wyoming employees of WS who were involved with wolf control or management in 2002 include state director Rod Krischke , district supervisors Sam Crowe and Merrill Nelson , wildlife specialists Jack Clucas , Arnold DeBock , Casey Hunter , Michael Peterson , Marshall Robin , Jed Edwards , Tracy Frye , Stephen Moyles , James Pehringer , and pilot Ted Jensen .
Wolf control in the Montana and Idaho portions of the GYA was carried out by the WS offices and local specialists in those states .
Monitoring Yellowstone National Park Population status :
At the end of 2002 , at least 148 wolves in 14 packs were present in Yellowstone National Park ( Table 2 , Figure 3 ) .
Of these 14 packs , 12 were considered breeding pairs according to the USFWS definition .
The Tower pair was attacked by another pack of six wolves in March ( Agate Creek Pack ) , right after breeding season , and the female likely lost her pups from wounds suffered during the attack .
The Slough Creek Pack , a group that formed from the splitting of the once record - large Druid Peak Pack , also did not breed for unknown reasons .
Four new packs formed in YNP in 2002 .
Three of them resulted from the splintering of the Druid Peak Pack : Agate Creek , Geode Creek , and Slough Creek Packs all formed with at least one Druid Peak disperser and reside on the Northern Range of YNP .
Interestingly , all three of these packs are anchored by females ( #103 F , # 105 F , & # 106 F ) born at the same den in Lamar Valley in 1997 .
The alpha male of the Agate Creek Pack is a five - year - old male from the Chief Joseph Pack .
The last newly formed pack is the Bechler Pack , discovered in August of 2002 after numerous reports of tracks and sightings in the area .
This is the first resident group of wolves in the Bechler area since wolf reintroduction began in 1995 .
Prior to this there was little wolf activity and only occasional reports of tracks .
The group consists of a very large dispersing male from the Rose Creek Pack and three uncollared wolves , two of which are pups so the pack will count as a breeding pair .
They have ranged as far north as Little Firehole Meadows and have so far not been located outside YNP .
The formation of the three new packs from the splintering of the large Druid Peak Pack was mostly observed by field staff and was unique , and not previously recorded in the wolf literature .
As the Druid Peak Pack crumbled during the 2001 - 2002 winter , groups of wolves formed with little affinity to area , and individual wolves moved between the different groups .
For example , # 218 F originally from the Druid Peak Pack , was recorded traveling with the Agate Creek , Geode Creek , and Slough Creek Packs .
Four Nez Perce wolves ( #213 F , # 214 M , # 215 M , & 252M ) from the Madison - Firehole area joined in the melee of wolves often centered around Tower Junction .
The area where many of the interactions took place was mostly newly acquired Druid Peak territory ( usurped from Rose Creek ) .
On one occasion near Hellroaring Creek in March 2002 one of the new split - off Druid packs ( Geode Creek ) interacted with the old , and much reduced Druid Peak Pack .
Wolf # 106 F , an old Druid wolf , greeted her former packmates with her tail up and wagging , but an aggressive interaction ensued between the two groups .
After this encounter the Druid Peak Pack was split and did not reunite until mid-April .
The young pups and yearling Druid wolves remained near Hellroaring Creek , killing elk on their own , while the Druid alphas with two yearlings left the area and never returned .
The Hellroaring area now belongs mostly to the new Geode Creek Pack ( # 106s new pack ) .
Pack size ranged from 2 to 20 and averaged 10.6 .
As expected , the record - large Druid Peak Pack did not stay together , so the formation of new packs did not greatly increase the number of wolves present in YNP from 2001 levels ( 2001 = 132 , 2002 = 148 ; 12 % increase ) .
Reproduction :
At least 67 pups were born to 12 YNP wolf packs in 2002 .
At least 14 litters were born ; the Druid Peak and Agate Creek Packs had two litters of pups each .
The Agate Creek Pack , one of the packs forming from the crumbling of the Druid Peak Pack , denned at separate locations and it appeared that they would split into two packs .
However , the two groups joined up in midsummer and have been functioning as one pack since that time .
Interestingly , despite the fact that both of these packs had two litters , only four pups survived out of eight for the Agate Creek Pack and three of six in the Druid Peak Pack .
Geode Creek had at least eight , possibly nine , pups at midsummer but only three of those were with the pack this fall .
Overall , the maximum number of pups observed at wolf dens this summer was 65 or 66 , and by September only 56 ( 85 % ) of these pups could be accounted for .
It is likely that more pups are missing because the observability of some packs is low .
Mortalities :
At least five adult wolves died in YNP during 2002 .
This figure does not include pups that died within the first four months of life .
Three were natural mortalities , one was a vehicle strike on highway 191 , and one was of unknown cause .
Two of the natural mortalities were due to interpack conflict , and one was due to injuries sustained from encountering prey .
Longtime alpha female # 7 F of the Leopold Pack ( founder wolf , first shipment of wolves from Canada January 12 , 1995 ) was killed by other wolves in May , probably by the Geode Creek Pack which was denning nearby ( see Yellowstone Science Vol. 10 No. 3 ) . Wolf # 2 M , lifelong mate of # 7 F and alpha male of the Leopold Pack ( also a founder wolf from Canada , 1995 ) , was killed on the last day of the year , likely by the same Geode Creek Pack that killed his mate in May .
Wolf # 2 M had lost his alpha status in early December and was using the fringe of the Leopold territory with several other wolves from the main pack when he was killed .
Wolf # 254 M , who dispersed from the Druid Peak Pack , was found dead at the base of a cliff near the headwaters of Timothy Creek .
Cause of death was categorized as natural , but cause of death could have been accidental ( base of a cliff ) , or could have involved other wolves .
The carcass was partly decayed so positive determination was not possible .
The other natural mortality was elk - caused .
Most other wolf mortalities in the GYA were outside YNP and were predominantly human - caused .
One Chief Joseph wolf dispersed to north of Helena , Montana and was shot by WS after killing sheep .
Population Movements :
The parks wolf population increased by 12 % in 2002 .
Almost the entire increase was in non-Northern Range packs .
Seventy - seven wolves occupied the Northern Range in 2001 and 78 did in 2002 , whereas the non-Northern Range wolf population increased from 55 to 70 .
Therefore , despite the increased number of packs on the Northern Range in 2002 ( five in 2001 , eight in 2002 ) there were not significantly more wolves , due primarily to a realignment of packs .
Throughout the rest of YNP there was only one new pack from 2001 ( Bechler Pack , four wolves ) , so the increased number of wolves was due to increases in the number of wolves in existing packs ( Nez Perce 18 to 20 , Cougar Creek 6 to 10 , Mollies 10 to 12 , etc. ) .
Wolf use of YNP was typical of previous years ( see territory map ) except for the new Bechler Pack .
Few prey live in Bechler in the winter , making it difficult for wolves to live there throughout the year .
During April , the time of year when pups are born , the alpha male of the Bechler Pack was located in the northern part of Yellowstone , chasing deer .
The Bechler Pack must have moved to the Bechler area later , or the alpha male made extremely wide - ranging trips in search of prey for a denning female .
Monitoring : Wyoming outside YNP Wolves continued to disperse out of Yellowstone National Park and recolonized areas in western Wyoming .
In 2002 , we documented approximately 67 - 81 wolves ( 38 - 52 adults / yearlings ) in eight different packs with an average pack size of 10.1 wolves ( Table 2 , Figure 3 ) .
We maintained 24 radio - collars in seven packs ( 30 % of the population ) .
Collared wolves were located , on average , twice a month by airplane and more often by ground crews .
Six of these Wyoming packs produced a minimum of 29 pups ( average litter size was 4.8 pups ) .
For the second year in a row , the Teton Pack produced a double litter of 11 pups and the pack consisted of 23 wolves ( Table 2 ) .
A total of at least eight collared wolves dispersed from their natal home ranges and six other wolves were missing at years end .
At least seven wolves died in Wyoming outside of YNP in 2002 , including six wolves killed in depredation control actions .
These mortalities do not include pups that we assumed perished within four months of whelping .
A dispersed two - year - old wolf from the Druid Peak Pack , male # 253 , was accidentally caught by a coyote trapper southwest of Ogden , Utah in November 2002 .
The trapper turned the wolf over to Utah wildlife agents .
USFWS policy is normally to leave such dispersed wolves alone unless there are depredations or other problems .
In this case , with the wolf already in captivity , it was decided to return the wolf to YNP .
This was done , and the wolf has remained in the park .
Subsequent reports have indicated that more wolves are present in northeast Utah .
Monitoring : Montana portion of GYA
Ten packs of wolves that live partly or entirely within the Montana portion of the GYA have been formed in recent years by wolves moving out of Yellowstone National Park .
These include the Sheep Mountain , Mill Creek , Lone Bear , Taylor Peaks , Sentinel , Freezeout , Gravelly , Beartrap , Mission Creek and Red Lodge Packs ( Table 1 b , Figure 3 ) .
The Chief Joseph Pack , though classified as a Yellowstone National Park pack , also spends considerable time outside of the park .
Of an estimated 55 wolves ( not including the Chief Joseph Pack ) , 16 wore radio - collars during 2002 and five new collars were put out between March and December 2002 .
Two radio - collared Druid dispersers ( wolf # 224 and wolf # 252 ) were tracked outside of the park during the reporting period and were associated with non-collared wolves at some point .
Packs were monitored throughout the year by TESF , NPS , MSU , WS and USFWS personnel by radio telemetry , visual observation and snow tracking .
Five packs were confirmed as breeding pairs .
Although other packs produced pups , their status at the end of the year could not be determined .
Nineteen wolves died of human - caused mortalities , including 13 in control actions , four legally shot by landowners , one hit by a car and one still under investigation .
Research Research in Yellowstone National Park Wolf - prey relationships :
Wolf prey relationships were documented by observing wolf predation directly and by recording the characteristics of wolf prey at kill sites .
Wolf packs were monitored during two winter - study sessions , 30 - day periods in March and November December during which wolves were intensively radio - tracked .
The Leopold , Rose Creek II , Geode Creek , and Druid Peak Packs were monitored by two - person teams from the ground and from aircraft ; the Swan Lake , Agate Creek , Tower , Slough Creek , Mollies , Nez Perce , Cougar Creek , Bechler , Yellowstone Delta , Chief Joseph , and Sheep Mountain Packs were monitored from aircraft only .
YNP staff recorded , and entered into a database , behavioral interactions between wolves and prey , predation rates , the total time wolves fed on their kills , percent consumption of kills by wolves and scavengers , characteristics of wolf prey ( e.g. , nutritional condition ) , and characteristics of kill sites .
In addition , similar data were collected opportunistically throughout the year during weekly monitoring flights and ground observations .
The abundance and sex -age composition of elk within wolf pack territories were also estimated from the ground and from fixed - wing aircraft .
Composition of Wolf Kills : Project staff detected 132 definite , 206 probable , and 8 possible kills made by wolves in 2002 , including 291 elk ( 84 % of total ) , 21 bison , ( 6 % ) , 4 deer ( 1 % ) , 4 coyotes ( 1 % ) , 4 wolves ( 1 % ) , 1 badger ( < 0.5 % ) , 1 Canada goose ( < 0.5 % ) , and 22 unknown prey ( 6 % ) .
The composition of elk kills was 34 % calves ( 012 months ) , 31 % cows , 22 % bulls , 5 % adult elk of unknown sex , and 8 % elk of unknown sex and age .
Bison kills included 10 calves ( unknown sex ) , 3 yearlings ( 2 female , 1 male ) , and 8 adults ( 3 female , 3 male , 2 unknown sex ) .
Of the bison kills , 1 was killed during December , 1 in January , 5 in February , 6 in March , 7 in April , and 1 in late May .
The Nez Perce Pack made 13 of the bison kills and Mollies Pack and Druid Peak Pack each killed 2 .
During winter , wolves residing on the Northern Range killed an average of 1.8 elk per wolf per 30 - day study period .
Winter Studies : During the 2002 March winter study ( 30 days ) , wolves were observed for 243 hours from the ground .
The number of days wolf packs were located from the air ranged from 1 ( Yellowstone Delta ) to 15 ( Leopold , Rose Creek II , Tower , and Sheep Mountain ) .
Seventy - two definite or probable wolf kills were detected , including 65 elk , 3 bison , and 4 prey of unknown species .
Among elk , 19 ( 29 % ) were calves , 22 ( 34 % ) were cows , 18 ( 28 % ) were bulls , 4 ( 6 % ) were of unknown sex , and 2 ( 3 % ) were of unknown sex and age .
During the 2002 November - December winter study ( 30 days ) , wolves were observed for 373 hours from the ground .
The number of days wolf packs were located from the air ranged from 1 ( Bechler ) to 18 ( Leopold , Druid Peak , Geode Creek , and Agate Creek ) .
Fifty - nine definite or probable wolf kills were detected , including 57 elk , 3 coyotes , 1 bison , and 1 unknown prey .
Among elk , 22 ( 39 % ) of the kills were calves , 15 ( 26 % ) were cows , 18 ( 32 % ) were bulls , and 2 ( 3 % ) kills were adult elk of unknown sex .
Wolf - Carnivore Interactions :
The reintroduction of wolves into YNP has provided an opportunity to examine interactions among a full suite of carnivores and their prey .
Preliminary evidence from concurrent field studies focusing on the parks large carnivores ( wolves , cougars , grizzly bears , and black bears ) suggests that these interactions have significant effects on carnivore community structure , population dynamics , and prey populations .
Collaborations with interdepartmental ( Bear Management , Ungulate Project , Bison Management ) and interagency ( Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team , Montana Fish , Wildlife & Parks ) researchers have already been productive in pursuing science - based questions on multi-carnivore relationships .
The use of new technologies such as GPS telemetry collars will advance our ability to understand the carnivore community and its interactions , as well as its impact on prey populations .
In fall 2002 , a manuscript was submitted to a scientific journal describing the activities of humans and carnivores on YNPs northern boundary prior to and during the fall elk hunting season .
The study monitored the movements of grizzly bears , wolves , and cougars in a 2,391 - km2 study area centered on YNP 's Northern Range and the Absaroka Wilderness .
Grizzly bears were more likely to be located inside the YNP boundary during the pre-hunt period and outside of the boundary once hunting began .
Cougars tended to be found outside the park during the pre-hunt period and moved inside the park when hunting began .
Wolves did not significantly change their movement patterns during the pre-hunt and hunting periods .
Qualitative information on elk indicated that prey moved into the park once hunting started , suggesting that cougars followed living prey , bears focused on dead prey ( gut piles and crippled elk ) and wolves may have taken advantage of both .
In addition , project staff are documenting behavioral interactions between wolves and grizzly bears , in order to examine the population and community - level consequences of those interactions .
In 34 % of bear - wolf interactions , the two species were simply seen in the same area .
Most wolf - bear interactions ( 66 % ) occurred at kill sites .
In 19 % of interactions , bears were seen defending kills from wolves ( probably wolf kills usurped by bears ) .
In another 19 % , bears were seen actually usurping wolf kills .
When a kill site was contested between bears and wolves , bears were usually the winners ( 40 % of the time ) , or the winner could not be determined ( 40 % ) , even though wolves outnumbered bears in 76 % of the interactions .
Adult bears without cubs were involved in 88 % of the encounters .
The use of wolf - killed ungulate remains by bears is particularly high in Pelican Valley , where most elk leave in winter , but some bison remain .
Bison or elk killed by the Mollies Pack in that part of YNP are routinely lost to grizzlies .
In fact , every time project staff aerially located Mollies Pack on a kill during the spring , summer , and fall of 2002 , at least one grizzly was in the area , or more commonly , at the kill .
During a September backcountry horse trip into upper Pelican Creek , Doug Smith , Dan Stahler , and Wayne Brewster documented six recently - killed bull elk carcasses , all of which were probably Mollies Pack kills and each had evidence of bear visitation .
In poor whitebark pine cone production years , such as 2002 , carrion available to bears from wolf kills may have significant population - level effects .
Such routine wolf - grizzly interactions have important implications both behaviorally and ecologically for both species .
Continued research will allow us to better understand their relationship .
Although wolves lost most disputed kills to bears , wolves were quite successful at defending dens , as highlighted by the following two observations .
On a flight in late July 2002 , the Yellowstone Delta Pack was observed holding a large adult grizzly at bay at the packs Thorofare den .
One of the wolves came up behind the bear and bit it on its hind end , and eventually two wolves escorted the bear out of the den area , with two additional wolves following .
Two weeks later , the same pack was aerially located at their Thorofare rendezvous site , with a large grizzly bear sitting in the middle of six adult wolves and four pups .
The wolves were agitated by the bears presence and maintained pressure on the bear to keep it away from the pups .
Although the outcome of this second observation is unknown because the animals went out of sight into thick willows , the wolves appeared to successfully protect their pups .
Research in Wyoming outside Yellowstone National Park Wolf / elk interactions on state - managed feed grounds in Wyoming Investigators : Michael Jimenez ( USFWS ) , John Stevenson ( USFS ) .
Cooperators : USFWS , USFS , National Elk Refuge , Grand Teton National Park , and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department .
We monitored wolves during the winters from 1999 through 2002 to determine the distribution of wolf packs , describe prey selection by wolves , and document the behavioral response of elk to the presence of wolves on three state - managed feed grounds ( Alkali , Patrol Cabin , and Fish Creek ) along the Gros Ventre River drainage in Wyoming .
We used radio telemetry to locate wolves and estimate home ranges .
We backtracked wolves in snow to locate carcass remains of elk killed or scavenged by wolves .
Elk ( identified with radio - collars or tags ) were followed to describe how elk responded to wolves hunting on the feed grounds .
Two wolf packs recolonized in the Gros Ventre drainage and their home ranges overlapped in two elk feed grounds ( Alkali and Patrol Cabin ) .
We located 119 kills made by wolves in the three feed grounds and adjacent areas within the national forest .
The mean age of adult elk killed was 10 years and the oldest elk killed was 23 years old .
Forty - three percent of the elk killed were cows , 4 % were bulls , and 53 % were calves .
Mean consumption of elk carcasses was 83 % and surplus killing was documented on six occasions .
Calf / cow ratios dropped in 2002 from a 5 - year average of 24 calves / 100 cows to17 calves / 100 cows .
Approximately 800 elk were fed hay in each of the three feed grounds .
Elk frequently left the northern ( Fish Creek ) and southern ( Alkali ) feed grounds but dispersed to the middle feed ground ( Patrol Cabin ) when wolves were present .
Even though wolves killed elk on Patrol Cabin feed ground , elk often remained in the area .
This unexpected crowding of elk on one feed ground became very controversial as the state game managers were forced to adjust winter feeding programs .
Recolonizing wolf research in the Jackson , Wyoming area Investigators : Joel Berger , Kim Berger ( Wildlife Conservation Society , Utah State University ) Cooperators : Wildlife Conservation Society , Utah State University , USFWS , USDA / APHIS /WS , Wyoming Game and Fish , Grand Teton National Park , Bridger - Teton National Forest .
We initiated a three - year study to examine indirect effects of wolves on predator - prey relationships in and around Grand Teton National Park ( GTNP ) , in the southern portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem .
Of particular focus is the extent to which wolves may modulate relationships between coyotes and pronghorn .
During the first year , 10 coyotes and 38 pronghorn were radio - collared to enable the collection of detailed information on age , body mass , movement , pregnancy , home range , and survivorship .
Additionally , a pack of 11 to 22 wolves has primarily inhabited GTNP and an additional pack has a home range outside the park and contained primarily within the Gros Ventre River Drainage ( GVRD ) that encompasses a portion of the longest remaining migration route for pronghorn in the USA .
Preliminary results indicate pronghorn fawn mortality is high in both GTNP and GVRD , averaging ~90 % and 80 % , respectively .
Coyotes were identified as a primary mortality source in most cases , although disease , drowning , and raptor predation played minor roles .
Pronghorn birth weights and fawn sex were not apparently associated with mortality profiles .
Additionally , we assessed whether handling by humans might have contributed to the high juvenile mortality rate by contrasting fawn : doe ratios in areas where fawns were not handled .
Amongst three areas in GTNP , fawn : doe ratios did not differ dramatically .
Nearly all ( 80 % ) of the radio - collared coyotes spent time on the National Elk Refuge during winter , presumably to take advantage of abundant elk carcasses .
The concentration of carcasses on the Refuge as a consequence of elk feeding may be sustaining higher coyote densities than would otherwise be possible in the absence of this supplementary food source , since winter availability of food limits coyote densities .
Coyote densities appear lower in the GTNP wolf core area , and three cases of wolf predation on coyotes have been noted .
Future study plans include : 1 ) developing home range and density estimates for wolves and coyotes and analyzing associated spatial relationships ; 2 ) documenting over - winter and migratory patterns of the surviving fawns and subsequent fidelity to GTNP summer ranges ; and 3 ) increasing the sample size of radio - collared coyotes .
Research in the Montana portion of the Greater Yellowstone Recovery Area Factors affecting wolf - elk interactions in the Greater Yellowstone Area : Investigators : Scott Creel , Bob Garrott , Justin Gude , John Winnie , Eric Bergmann , Thain Cook , Knut Solberg , Montana State University ( MSU ) .
Cooperators : Montana Fish , Wildlife & Parks , Yellowstone National Park , USFWS .
The wolf population reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park has grown steadily since 1995 , expanding in both numbers and geographic distribution .
With this growth has come recolonization by wolves of areas outside of Yellowstone National Park .
The effect of wolf recolonization on the numbers , distribution and behavior of elk is a contentious issue in the statewide management of both wolves and elk .
In anticipation of federal delisting of the wolf ( beginning perhaps as early as 2003 ) , data on wolf - elk interactions in areas outside of YNP will be critical .
This study is collecting data on wolf - elk interactions from five sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem ( one in YNP in the Madison - Gibbon - Firehole area , and four outside the park ) .
Data collection includes ( 1 ) monitoring trends in elk population sizes and recruitment , ( 2 ) quantifying offtake by wolves , ( 3 ) examining interactions between the distributions and movements of elk and wolves , and ( 4 ) examining behavioral responses of elk to the risk of predation .
In addition , we are using noninvasive physiological assays of pregnancy rates and stress hormone levels in elk , to test for sublethal effects on fitness .
Analysis will include comparisons among the five sites , which differ with respect to fundamental variables expected to affect the rate of predation ( e.g. , snow depth , herd size ) , and comparisons within sites of pre-wolf and post - wolf data on population size and demography .
Pre - wolf data extend as far back as 75 years , for some sites .
Outreach YNP wolf staff gave approximately 50 formal presentations to approximately 1500 people and an untallied number of informal talks both within and outside YNP .
USFWS staff gave numerous presentations and status reports to federal and state agencies , conservation groups , rural communities , guide / outfitters organizations , livestock associations , schools , and various private institutions .
These included 13 formal talks to approximately 1700 people .
Wolf recovery personnel also participated in television interviews and newspaper feature stories .
Livestock Depredation and Management Wyoming portion of GYA Five of Wyomings 32 known wolf packs were implicated in livestock depredation in 2002 .
Potential livestock depredations in Wyoming are investigated by WS and USFWS .
Depredations are classified as either confirmed , probable , or other , based on specific criteria agreed upon by the USFWS and WS .
If wolf depredation is confirmed , nonlethal or lethal control , or a combination thereof , is implemented under the direction of USFWS .
In 2002 , we recorded 23 confirmed and four probable livestock losses to wolves ( 25 calves , one heifer , and one cow ) .
Three additional calves were attacked but survived and one dog and two horses were injured by wolves .
Control actions in response to livestock depredations included : trapping and radio - collaring wolves , intensive monitoring , increased riders on grazing allotments , harassing wolves with rubber bullets , cracker shells , and lights , moving livestock to different pastures , issuing three shoot - on - site permits to ranchers , and lethally removing six wolves .
Defenders of Wildlife paid compensation for all confirmed and probable livestock losses .
Livestock losses occurred in the following areas : Teton Pack :
One calf was killed in Teton National Park and one heifer and one cow were killed on private land .
In addition , one calf and one heifer survived wolf attacks in Teton National Park .
The Teton Pack was suspected in other livestock depredations in the Gros Ventre River drainage .
Please refer to the section titled :  Other wolves ( including collared and uncollared )  for further details .
Gros Ventre Pack : The Gros Ventre Pack was suspected in livestock depredation in the Gros Ventre River drainage .
Please refer to the section titled :  Other wolves ( including collared and uncollared )  for further details .
Green River Pack : The Green River Pack was suspected in livestock depredation in the Gros Ventre River drainage and Union Pass area .
Please refer to the section titled :  Other wolves ( including collared and uncollared )  for further details .
Washakie Pack :
Over the last several years , the Washakie Pack has repeatedly killed livestock on public and private land .
In 2002 , at least five calves were killed by wolves on private land .
Three wolves were killed in control actions , and one adult male wolf was captured , radio- collared , and released on site .
Beartooth Pack : No depredations reported .
Absaroka Pack :
No depredations reported .
Sunlight Pack : Wolves from the Sunlight Pack killed and attacked numerous livestock in 2001 .
In 2002 , at least four calves were killed on public land by Sunlight wolves .
Three wolves were killed in control actions , and the alpha male and female wolves were trapped , fitted with new radio - collars , and released on site .
Greybull River Pack : No depredations reported .
Other wolves ( including collared and uncollared ) :
In 2002 , at least 27 cattle were killed by wolves ( reported as confirmed and probable ) .
Twelve of these 27 cattle were killed by wolves from the Teton , Washakie , and Sunlight Packs .
Ten additional cattle were killed in the Gros Ventre River drainage where the home ranges of the Teton , Green River , and Gros Ventre Packs overlap .
Five cattle were killed ( one confirmed , four probable ) by wolves in the Union Pass area where home ranges of the Green River , Washakie , and Gros Ventre Packs overlap .
Depredations were reported and promptly investigated .
Despite intensive monitoring and trapping efforts by WS and the USFWS , we were not able to determine which wolves were responsible for these specific depredations because wolves repeatedly left the kill sites .
Regardless of which wolf pack caused the depredation , ranchers were compensated for all confirmed and probable livestock losses reported .
Livestock producers in the Gros Ventre and Union Pass area claimed their losses increased substantially this year , but neither the ranchers , USFWS , WS , nor the Wyoming Game and Fish Department were able to determine whether some cattle died of depredation ( wolf or grizzly bear ) or other unknown causes .
Depredation and Management : Montana portion of GYA
In the Montana portion of the Yellowstone Wolf Recovery Area ( Figure 1 ) , seven of 10 known wolf packs were involved in livestock depredation in 2002 .
Cattle and sheep depredations continue to be a significant problem in this area .
A variety of nonlethal techniques have been used to help reduce depredation , in addition to the lethal removal of 17 wolves in 2002 .
Confirmed losses in 2002 included 10 cattle and 71 sheep killed by wolves , and an additional 25 sheep injured .
Four cattle and 34 sheep were classified as probable wolf depredation .
Taylor Peaks Pack : A ranch managers herding dog was killed in his yard by the Taylor Peaks Pack on March 21 .
He and neighboring landowners were trained and given permits to use less - than - lethal munitions to haze wolves .
A RAG box was set up around the house and a telemetry receiver and antenna were issued to monitor the wolves .
In August the wolves were reported hanging around the ranch house again .
On August 10 , project personnel walked in on the female wolf and hazed her out of a daybed near the ranch house .
A neighboring ranch reported wolves feeding on a calf carcass in late August , but it could not be verified as wolf predation .
A male pup was captured and radio - collared on September 23 .
A calf was confirmed killed by wolves in September , but control actions were not taken by request of the landowner .
Two more calf carcasses were found on the property in early November but they were determined to have died of pneumonia .
Sentinel Pack :
This new pack has formed in the Taylor Fork drainage .
The male is a collared gray wolf from the Taylor Peaks Pack , wolf # 234 .
No depredations were reported in this area in 2002 .
Freezeout Pack :
A wolf - killed calf was investigated in April and traps were set , but no wolves were captured .
On July 20 , two ewes and probably two lambs were killed by wolves on a USFS allotment in the Gravelly range .
One non-collared gray yearling female was shot by WS on July 25 .
The other members of the Freezeout Pack were harassed by helicopter in hopes of driving the wolves out of the area , where six bands of sheep were stationed .
The bands are monitored by herders and guard dogs .
In September , WS investigated a pileup of 80 dead sheep crushed against a fence .
The cause could not be determined .
On September 11 , WS confirmed a calf killed by a wolf in the Freezeout Pack territory .
One non-collared gray male wolf was killed nearby on September 12 , but it was unknown whether this wolf was associated with the pack .
Gravelly Pack :
Twenty - one sheep were killed and 13 others wounded by wolves on February 24 .
Tracks indicated at least two wolves were responsible .
This area is fifteen miles from where the Gravelly Pack killed sheep last year .
Two non-collared wolves were left from last years control action , after eight wolves were relocated and one killed .
Tracks and sightings of three black wolves had been observed in the area over the winter .
Lethal control was authorized , and on February 27 , WS shot two of the wolves , with the third escaping into the timber .
One of the wolves shot was # 202 , a Chief Joseph disperser whose collar had failed , and the other was a non-collared female .
On March 3 , seven ewes and one ram were killed by wolves , and another 11 wounded .
WS continued to look for the third wolf to lethally remove it , and lethal - take permits were issued to qualifying ranches in the area .
No wolves were killed under the 45 - day shoot - on - sight permit , which expired in early July .
In early July , a 45 - day permit to shoot two wolves seen in the act of attacking livestock was issued to producers who graze sheep on USFS allotments in the Gravelly range .
These producers had losses earlier in the spring on private property .
In late August - early September , sheep were killed by predators in the Dillon / Gravelly area .
WS set M - 44 cyanide devices as part of a coyote control action .
Two wolf pups pulled M - 44s and were killed .
During the week of September 7 , a shoot - on - sight permit for one wolf was issued to a sheep producer .
The producers tentative totals were 32 sheep missing , 12 found dead by the rancher , eight confirmed as wolf kills by WS and three more ewes found dead near the dead wolf pups .
During the week of September 13 , several sheep were reportedly killed by either a mountain lion or wolves .
No control was taken as the bands of sheep were due to move off grazing allotments around September 15 .
On October 7 , a sheep producer shot a gray wolf on private land using his lethal control permit .
The wolf was YNP Druid disperser # 252 , who had been traveling with two black wolves in the area for most of the summer .
This was the first wolf killed under these permits .
On Oct. 8 WS darted and collared an adult black female wolf and released her on - site .
She was found to be traveling with a black animal , presumed to be a pup .
Three ewes were killed by wolves on private land in the Dillon / Gravelly area on October 22 .
The radio - collared female was in the area and sightings of two wolves were reported .
Lethal control and shoot - on - sight permits were reauthorized .
On October 24 , the radio - collared female and her pup were lethally removed by WS .
The landowners lethal take permit ended on December 6 .
Mill Creek Pack : A landowner killed a male Mill Creek Pack wolf in May 2002 when it killed and fed on his calf .
A lactating female ( wolf # 271 ) was caught and radio - collared in the area by WS ten days later .
In October , the Mill Creek Pack killed 15 sheep and ran off a llama .
A ram was killed on the next day .
Fladry ( flagging ) was hung around the sheep pasture on October 31 and a RAG box was set up in the pasture .
Carcasses were removed and buried on the property .
A kill permit to remove two wolves was issued to the landowner and adjacent neighbors .
Two gray female pups were legally removed using this take permit in November .
The owner of the sheep was issued a permit to remove one wolf and a second RAG box was put in the pasture when the wolves continued to frequent the property .
Adjacent landowners in the area were issued permits to use less - than - lethal munitions to haze wolves .
One ewe was confirmed killed on December 12 , when two wolves jumped over the flagging to kill and feed on her .
The flagging seemed to be effective for about forty - two days .
WS began a trapping and collaring effort .
One wolf jumped the flagging and killed a pregnant ewe on December 26 .
Efforts are still being made to collar more members in this pack .
Flagging has been removed .
Sheep Mountain Pack :
Six wolves were reported harassing a cow and her calf in March , near Emigrant in Paradise Valley .
The landowner was issued a less - than - lethal munitions permit and given a telemetry receiver to monitor the wolves .
The wolves were seen in a neighboring calving pasture the same night and were hazed by a landowner using a pick - up truck .
On March 13 the wolves ate a calf that had died of natural causes .
The wolves killed a calf on March 18 .
Intensive night monitoring of the wolves was conducted .
The wolves were found feeding on a cow carcass .
She may have been run through a fence by the wolves and eventually died .
Carcasses were removed from both properties .
A RAG ( Radio Activated Guard ) box was set up on March 21 .
Four wolves were lethally controlled on March 26 , including Druid disperser # 224 , and one wolf infected with mange .
By the end of April , the pack seemed to localize at their natal den site .
In September , the Sheep Mountain Pack occupied a rendezvous site in the middle of a cow / calf operation .
The landowner was diligent in hazing the wolves over a month - long period using trucks , ATVs , horses and gunfire .
A RAG box was also set up in the pasture .
No depredations occurred during this time .
Red Lodge Pack : WS confirmed a wolf - killed calf in the Red Lodge area on the night of May 25 .
Efforts to radio - collar members of the pack , suspected to be four to five wolves , were attempted throughout the summer , but searches did not reveal a concentration of wolf sign and trapping was not conducted .
On September 23 , WS confirmed another calf killed by wolves .
Efforts to trap , collar and release on - site were made until nighttime temperatures became too cold for safe wolf trapping .
A cow was confirmed to have been killed by the pack in December .
The Red Lodge Pack was finally radio- collared , and later eliminated , in February 2003 .
Lone Bear Pack : WS investigated a wolf - killed calf in the Wineglass area south of Livingston the week of September 20 .
Efforts to trap , collar and release on - site were made .
No wolves were caught .
This new group was reported feeding on a calf carcass early in November , but no depredations were confirmed .
Landowners in the area were issued permits for less - than - lethal munitions .
Two pups and one yearling had been caught incidentally and reported by a coyote trapper near Paradise Valley in late November and early December .
The wolves were radio - collared and released on - site by WS and wolf project personnel .
Mission Creek Pack :
Three wolves have been sighted repeatedly in this area , and WS heard howling during a depredation investigation .
Wolf # 241 , a Sheep Mountain disperser , has been located in the area , but it is not known whether she is associated with the pack .
Beartrap Pack : A group of four gray wolves was repeatedly sighted on and near the Flying D ranch , south of Gallatin Gateway , in November and December .
At least one of the wolves is thought to be a pup .
Efforts will be made to radio - collar these wolves .
Chief Joseph Pack :
A livestock producer reported that several members of the Chief Joseph Pack were coming into a Paradise Valley calving pasture and killing deer .
The cows were starting to calve , so fladry ( flagging ) was hung around a 10 - 15 acre pasture to deter the wolves from entering .
It was determined by snow - tracking that the wolves tested the flagging until they found a gap in it .
They entered the pasture and tried to exit at the opposite end , testing the flagging in numerous places , but would not cross it , and eventually circled back and exited the way they came in .
The gap in the flagging was fixed , and no depredations occurred .
The flagging kept the wolves out for about 30 days , before one wolf jumped over it .
Calves were moved out of the pasture when they were older , and the flagging was removed with the help of Predator Conservation Alliance volunteers .
Fresh digging was found in April 2002 , at the 2000 den site in Cinnabar Basin .
The new breeding female may have been born in the 2000 den and was trying to re-dig the den to have pups .
As in 2001 , the den was again filled in with mothballs , sticks and rocks in an attempt to persuade the wolves to den in Yellowstone National Park , as they had in previous years .
This was apparently successful , and they returned to the Park den .
Throughout the year , the Chief Joseph Pack traveled through Cinnabar Basin and Tom Miner Basin .
No conflicts occurred , although they were quite visible to landowners in both basins .
Landowners were issued permits for less - than - lethal munitions in both areas .
Miscellaneous and Lone Wolves : Dispersing male wolf # 203 , originally from the Chief Joseph Pack , killed 19 sheep near Wolf Creek on April 8 .
The wolf was shot by WS when it returned the next day .
A calf was killed near Pipestone Pass ( south of Butte ) by a single wolf on April 24 .
Traps were set around the carcass , but the wolf , probably a disperser , did not return to the area .
A cocker spaniel near Livingston was severely injured by a large canid in April .
A dispersing wolf was suspected .
In late December 2002 , 34 sheep were killed by an unknown predator near Harlowton .
It was suspected that a lone wolf was responsible , but it could not be found in two days of aerial hunting , and no further depredations were reported .
Depredation and Management : Idaho portion of GYA
No wolf depredations were known to have occurred in the portion of Idaho that lies in the Greater Yellowstone wolf recovery area ( east of Interstate 15 ) in 2002 .
CENTRAL IDAHO WOLF RECOVERY AREA Personnel The Nez Perce Tribe Wolf Recovery Program , headed in 2002 by Project Leader Curt Mack and biologists David Bell , Adam Gall , Jim Holyan , Jason Husseman , and Kent Laudon , conducted management and monitoring of the Central Idaho wolf population .
Volunteers Isaac Babcock , Eric Burnham , Brady Couvillion , Jamie Craig , Denise Jantzer , Cherise Miller , Erin Simmons , and Harvey Zimmer assisted during the field season .
Cheri Ramos , office assistant , left the Project .
Her position has yet to be refilled .
The USFWS was represented in Idaho by Idaho recovery coordinator Carter Niemeyer , and in Montana by biologist Joseph Fontaine .
Law enforcement agents in the Boise USFWS field office included Senior Agent Craig Tabor and Special Agent Scott Bragonier .
Special Agents Steve Magone ( Idaho Falls ) and Paul Weyland ( Boise ) transferred out of the Boise office .
WS personnel involved in wolf control or management in Idaho in 2002 included State Director Mark Collinge , Assistant State Director George Graves , District Supervisors Layne Bangerter , Charles Carpenter and Craig Maycock , wildlife specialists Jeff Ashmead , Lee Czapenski , Jonathan Farr , Douglas Hunsaker , Gary Looney , Justin Mann , Kelly Parker , Eric Simonson , Dave Thomas , and Richard Williamson , and pilot Gerald Peterson .
Monitoring
Twenty - five wolves were captured during the 2002 field season ; 16 by helicopter darting and nine by leg - hold trapping .
Of that total , 22 new wolves were collared and three wolves were recollared .
At the end of 2002 , 38 wolves ( 13 % of the population ) were being monitored in 19 groups .
These packs , along with known uncollared packs , accounted for about 284 wolves in the central Idaho recovery area .
Approximately 263 of these live in the state of Idaho ( Table 3 ) and 21 in the state of Montana ( Table 1 b ) .
Radio - collared wolves were located approximately twice per month by airplane .
Packs in Idaho as of December 2002 included Big Hole , Buffalo Ridge , Chamberlain Basin ( extant but not monitored due to loss of radio - collars ) , Five Lakes Butte ( no radio - collars ) , Gold Fork , Gospel Hump , Jureano Mountain , Kelly Creek , Landmark , Marble Mountain , Moyer Basin , Orphan , Scott Mountain , Selway , Thunder Mountain , Wildhorse , and Wolf Fang ( Table 3 , Figures 1,4 ) .
In addition , five packs are suspected to live in the Montana portion of the recovery area ; in the East Fork of the Bitterroot River drainage ( Sapphire Pack ) , the West Fork of the Bitterroot River drainage ( Painted Rocks Pack ) , in the west - central Bitterroot valley ( Como Lake ) , in the North Fork of the Bighole River drainage ( Battlefield Pack ) , and in the Flint Creek area ( Willow Pack ) ( Table 1 b ) .
Reproduction was confirmed in 12 packs , producing a minimum of 52 pups .
Nine of the 12 reproductive packs met the recovery standards of a breeding pair ( Tables 1b , 3 ) .
Two wolves died of natural causes , 19 of human - related causes ( including 14 removed in control actions ) , and five of unknown causes .
Two collared wolves were known to have dispersed away from their home territories and another four wolves went missing in 2002 and may have dispersed .
Four new Idaho wolf packs were documented in 2002 : Buffalo Ridge ( with alphas that dispersed from the former Stanley Basin and Moyer Basin Packs , respectively ) , Como Lake ( on the Montana - Idaho border ) , Five Lakes Butte ( possibly the former Snow Peak Pack ) , and Moyer Basin ( composed of a dispersing male from the former Stanley Basin Pack and a female of unknown origin ) .
The status of the Chamberlain Basin Pack was unknown by the end of 2002 .
Both radio - collars in the pack expired , so the fates and whereabouts of the remaining members are unknown .
Investigations during the summer showed that wolves used the traditional den site , and visual observations , tracks , scats , and howls indicated that wolves still inhabit the territory .
There are no known radio - collared members in the Five Lakes Butte Pack , so monitoring is problematic .
The Whitehawk Pack was eliminated through lethal control in April .
Of the five packs known to live in the Montana portion of the CID recovery area , only one , the Willow Pack , is currently radio - collared .
Collared wolves from the Painted Rocks and Battlefield Packs were illegally killed in 2002 , leaving no radio - collars in those packs .
The Como Lake and Sapphire Packs are known only from reported sightings .
In 2003 , increased efforts will be made to radio - collar and monitor these packs .
Research Continued conflicts between wolves and livestock and potential effects of wolves on big game populations remain key management issues .
The Recovery Program continues participation in ongoing research to help address these challenges .
Scientific information collected through these efforts will foster a better understanding of wolf - livestock and wolf - big game relationships , and more effective wolf conservation and management .
Five research projects have been initiated since 1999 .
Two address predator - ungulate relationships and three concern wolf - livestock interactions .
Preliminary Assessment of Radio Activated Guard Units in Deterring Wolf Predation in the East Fork of the Salmon River of Central Idaho .
Investigators : Stewart Breck , USDA / APHIS / WS / National Wildlife Research Center ; Rick Williamson , USDA / APHIS / WS .
Cooperators : Nez Perce Tribe , USFWS , and private landowners .
From January 2001 to April 2002 , WS specialists and researchers tested the effectiveness of Radio Activated Guard ( RAG ) units for deterring livestock depredation by the Whitehawk wolf pack .
In early February 2001 the Whitehawk Pack moved into the East Fork of the Salmon River and killed a calf .
A WS specialist in Idaho , in conjunction with researchers at National Wildlife Research Center , placed RAG boxes and monitors in small pastures of privately owned property to deter wolves from killing more cattle and to test the effectiveness of RAG boxes .
Activation of the device , utilizing signals from radio- collars , triggered a strobe light and loud sound effects from a tape player .
By adjusting the gain and volume , the sensitivity of the receiver was fine - tuned so that it fired only when individuals entered the area to be protected .
The radius of protection varied from 66 feet ( 20 meters ) , which may keep wolves out of dead animal pits or other small areas , to 984 feet ( 300 meters ) , which could be effective for protecting small pastures .
In order to reduce habituation to the device , 30 different recorded sounds were used , and each time the box was triggered , a different sound was played .
Within each base station , a small electronic monitor was installed to record radio - collar frequency , date and time that wolves activated a RAG box , and the number of pulses received during a predetermined time interval .
Monitors were used to evaluate the performance of the RAG boxes and detect behavioral responses of wolves to the scare device .
The Whitehawk Pack activated the scare devices approximately 10 - 15 times from mid-February to mid-April 2001 .
No calves were killed in pastures protected by RAG boxes and there was no indication that wolves were habituating to the boxes .
However , on March 19 , 2001 , a calf was killed by the pack in a pasture where a RAG box was present but malfunctioned , i.e. , did not activate when the wolves came into the field .
RAG boxes were used again during late winter / spring 2002 with the same pack in the same area of the East Fork of the Salmon River .
Eight to nine RAG boxes were used from February to early April .
Initially it appeared the RAG boxes were helping keep wolves away from livestock but in late March 2002 the pack habituated to the devices and began killing livestock despite the presence of RAG boxes .
Data from the monitors clearly indicated that these wolves had habituated to the devices .
Generalizations about the amount of time it took wolves to habituate to RAG boxes should not be made until further monitoring has been conducted .
However , it does appear that RAG boxes offer short - term ( 2 - 3 months ) protection and significant advantage over other scare devices that fire randomly or at fixed intervals .
Preliminary Assessment of Fladry as a Deterrent to Wolf Depredations in Central Idaho .
Investigators : Stewart Breck , USDA / APHIS / WS / National Wildlife Research Center ; Rick Williamson , USDA / APHIS / WS .
Cooperators : Nez Perce Tribe , USFWS , USFS , Defenders of Wildlife , private landowner .
Fladry , a non-lethal livestock protection technique , was tried for the first time in Idaho in 2002 at two sites .
A technique borrowed from Polish wolf hunters , fladry involved encircling the wolves with a barrier of colored flags , evenly spaced , hung from ropes .
For unknown reasons , wolves do not willingly cross this " fence , " so it was hoped that wolves would be unable to gain access to livestock surrounded by fladry .
WS and Defenders of Wildlife , with the cooperation of the owner of an inholding in the Salmon National Forest , strung approximately nine miles of fladry entirely around the fenced 1,000 - acre ( 400 - hectare ) ranch .
Approximately 400 cattle grazed here from late May through mid-October .
After the Jureano Mountain pack , which denned on the privately owned parcel , moved to a rendezvous site off of the ranch , fladry was installed .
It was also used for approximately one month during September in the Sawtooth Valley following a depredation there .
The goal of this project was to monitor wolf activity on and off the ranch using two different techniques .
The first monitoring technique used a receiver and a data logger that collected and stored information when it received a signal from a radio - collared wolf .
Data included the radio - collar frequency , date and time , and duration a signal was received .
The second monitoring method used tracking plots to detect wolf presence .
Such plots have been used successfully with numerous carnivore species to ascertain activity levels .
Fladry was set on the existing barbed wire fence that surrounded the ranch .
The entire perimeter of the ranch was examined every 48 hours to maintain the flagging barrier .
We recorded the number of days wolves were located within 1.9 miles ( 3 km ) of the ranch , and the number of days fladry was set before wolves crossed it .
Wolves were monitored from the ground and air in an attempt to obtain one location per day .
Of the eight members of the pack , four were radio - collared when the study began and two more were collared during the course of work .
Members of the Jureano Mountain Pack crossed fladry barriers after 61 days .
The effectiveness of fladry for protecting large areas is not well understood , though results from this study indicated that it may be useful for limited time periods .
During the trial some flags either got wrapped around the barbed wire or were pulled off by cattle .
Thus , fladry required persistent maintenance along the perimeter .
While this pack was excluded from the ranch they depredated on free - ranging livestock on an adjacent public grazing allotment .
Winter Predation and Interactions of Wolves and Cougars on Panther Creek in Central Idaho .
Investigators : Dennis Murray and Jason Husseman , University of Idaho ; Gary Power , Lemhi County ; and Dick Wenger , USFS .
MS thesis completed and available from University of Idaho , Moscow .
Cooperators : Nez Perce Tribe , Salmon - Challis National Forest , USFWS , Bureau of Land Management , Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation , Wolf Education and Research Center , Hornocker Wildlife Institute , Idaho Department of Fish and Game , Lemhi County .
This 3 - year study was initiated to investigate wolf - cougar interactions and predation on wintering ungulate populations within GMU 28 west of Salmon , Idaho .
Two groups of wolves , the Jureano Mountain and Moyer Basin Packs , had established territories within the study area .
In addition , four to six cougars were radio - tracked over the course of the study .
We documented prey characteristics and kill - site attributes of predator kills during winters 1999 - 2001 in Idaho , and located 120 wolf - killed and 98 cougar - killed ungulates on our study site .
Elk was the primary prey for both predators ( wolf = 77 % ; cougar = 74 % ) , followed by mule deer ( wolf = 23 % ; cougar = 24 % ) .
Both predators preyed disproportionately on elk calves ( wolf = 60 % ; cougar = 53 % ) and old individuals .
Among mule deer , wolves appeared to select for fawns ( 65 % ) , whereas cougars killed primarily adult deer ( 76 % ) .
Nutritional status of prey , as determined by percent femur marrow fat , was consistently poorer in wolf - killed prey , with a greater proportion of wolf - killed prey exhibiting fat levels indicating severe malnutrition .
We found that wolf kills occurred in habitat that was more reflective of the entire study area than cougar kills , suggesting that the coursing hunting behavior of wolves likely operated on a larger spatial scale than did the ambush hunting strategy of cougars .
We concluded that the disparity in prey selection and hunting habitat between predators probably was a function of predator - specific hunting behavior and capture success , where the longer prey chases and lower capture success of wolf packs mandated a stronger selection for disadvantaged prey .
For cougars , prey selection seemed to be limited primarily by prey size , which could be a function of the solitary hunting behavior of this species and the risks associated with capturing prime - aged prey .
Winter Predation and Interactions of Cougars and Wolves in the Central Idaho Wilderness .
Investigators : Holly Akenson , James Akenson , Howard Quigley .
Cooperators : University of Idaho , Hornocker Wildlife Institute - Wildlife Conservation Society , DeVlieg Foundation , Nez Perce Tribe , Idaho Department of Fish and Game .
The winter of 2002 was the fourth field season tracking wolves , primarily the Chamberlain Basin pack , and cougars in the Idaho wilderness .
This research project was initiated in 1998 , following the reintroduction of wolves to Idaho in 1995 .
We are evaluating the effects of wolf and cougar predation on wintering elk , mule deer , bighorn sheep , and moose populations and investigating the interspecific interactions and competition between cougars and wolves .
Since 1999 we have examined 183 large mammal carcasses .
Twice as many carcasses were found of animals killed by cougars as those killed by wolves .
An extensive forest fire burned most of the winter range in 2000 and contributed to changes in animal numbers and distribution on the Big Creek winter range .
A helicopter elk census in 2001 confirmed that elk numbers have declined 30 % during the last six years , although observations of mule deer suggest that deer numbers are stable or increasing .
Cougar and wolf winter diets were similar .
Neither predator showed a strong diet preference between elk and mule deer .
Being coursing predators , wolves killed more elk in poor condition than did cougars , which hunt by stalking and ambushing prey .
The large home range of the wolf pack allowed the wolves to follow the elk when they migrated to a new unburned ungulate winter range the first winter after the wildfire .
The cougar response to post - fire changes in elk numbers and prey health was to remain in their smaller home ranges and diversify their diets .
Cougars even killed three moose that were starving after the fire burned up the riparian shrubs .
Moose are usually not vulnerable to cougar predation due to their large size .
Elk calves and deer fawns were more vulnerable to wolf predation than cougar predation .
The cougar population experienced a high rate of replacement for resident cats due to mortality .
The main causes of cougar mortality were hunter harvest , fighting between males , wildfire , and starvation .
Strife among carnivores was documented on several occasions .
Cougars killed three cougars , three coyotes , and two bobcats , while wolves killed two coyotes .
Cougars appeared to avoid wolves and their kills .
Cougar kitten production has been low .
In the two winters since the forest fire , no kitten production was documented .
Track surveys and carcass locations suggest there are several areas previously used by female cougars that are now unoccupied .
During winter 2001 - 2002 , the Chamberlain Basin wolf pack contained 8 - 12 wolves .
The wolf pack hunted in two ungulate winter ranges .
Last winter was the first in which more kills were found on the Big Creek winter range made by wolves than cougars .
These large carnivores indirectly influence animal and plant populations and communities at lower trophic levels .
For example , cougars and wolves repeatedly killed coyotes and bobcats during this study .
These midsize carnivores strongly targeted fawns as a food source .
If the large carnivores suppress the midsize carnivore populations , predation pressure could shift from deer fawns toward elk calves .
In contrast , where female cougar home range areas have been unoccupied following the fire , coyote activity and predation on fawns have increased .
Effects of Wolves on Livestock Calf Survival and Movements in Central Idaho .
Investigators : John K. Oakleaf ( University of Idaho ) , Curt Mack ( Nez Perce Tribe ) , Dennis L. Murray ( University of Idaho ) .
MS thesis completed and available from University of Idaho , Moscow .
Cooperators : USFWS , Salmon - Challis National Forest , Lemhi County Cattle Association , Diamond Moose Association , Lemhi County , Defenders of Wildlife , Wolf Education and Research Center , National Wildlife Federation , Idaho Cattle Association .
We examined interactions between wolves and domestic calves within a grazing allotment in central Idaho to evaluate the role of wolves in calf survival and movements .
During the 1999 and 2000 grazing seasons we radio - marked 231 calves per year , representing 33 % of the calf population , on the Diamond Moose Association ( DMA ) grazing allotment , and monitored their survival and movements relative to wolf distribution .
Overall , calf survival was high ( 95 % ) , with relatively few mortalities ( n =13 ) among the marked population .
Of the 13 calf mortalities , eight were unrelated to predation ( pneumonia , unknown natural causes , and fire ) , four were wolf predation , and one was coyote predation .
Calves selected by wolves were younger than the surviving cohort by an average of 24 days ( wolf - killed : March 31 ± 13 days , n = 4 [ mean birth date ± SE ] ; live population : March 7 ± 1.6 days , n = 207 ) ( P < 0.05 ) .
Calf movement patterns and group size did not vary relative to the level of spatial overlap with wolves .
However , vulnerability to predation appeared to be correlated with spatial proximity of calves to wolf home ranges and rendezvous sites .
These results suggest that in our study area wolves did not significantly affect calf survival or behavior .
Carcass detection rates were low in our study , suggesting that current compensation procedures in the western U.S. may require adjustment to fully cover losses incurred from wolf depredation ( i.e. , an increased payment for each confirmed wolf - caused calf mortality ) .
Currently , compensation payments result from confirmed wolf - killed cattle found by ranchers on an allotment ( Fischer 1989 ) .
In the case of the DMA , our detection rate data suggest that this method of compensation would result in payment of only one - eighth of the actual losses to wolves .
Although this ratio may be lower ( e.g. , one - half ) in less timbered or rugged country , it is indicative of a consistent underpayment of ranchers with wolf depredations occurring on their allotment .
Outreach Program personnel presented informational talks and status reports throughout the year to various federal and state agencies , public and private institutions , special interest groups , and rural communities .
Additionally , scores of informal presentations to small groups or individuals were conducted during this time .
Livestock Depredation and Management
Of approximately 25 packs of wolves in the Central Idaho recovery area , four to six packs were involved in livestock depredation in 2002 .
All reports of livestock depredation are investigated by WS , who then take appropriate action in consultation with USFWS .
A total of 10 calves , 15 sheep , and four dogs were confirmed killed by wolves in the CID recovery area in 2002 .
Another seven calves were classed as probable wolf kills and wolves probably wounded one calf .
Fourteen wolves were killed in depredation control actions , and none were translocated .
Another four wolves were captured and released on - site in these operations .
The number of investigations and numbers of livestock killed in 2002 was similar to 2001 .
The number of wolves killed in 2002 was more than double the number killed in 2001 .
The similarity in depredation investigations and losses may be related to the continued presence of wolf packs , despite prior wolf control , in areas that overlap livestock grazing allotments .
Whitehawk Mountain Pack : After the Stanley Basin Packs territory was left vacant through relocations , dispersals , and lethal control , the Whitehawk Mountain Pack moved into the area .
They also used parts of the former White Cloud Packs territory along the East Fork of the Salmon River .
Two members of this pack were lethally controlled in 2001 .
The NPT and WS attempted to deter them from additional depredations through the use of RAG boxes and nonlethal hazing .
In early spring the pack was implicated in three depredations ( one sheep and two calves confirmed killed and two calves probably killed ) on privately - owned land in the East Fork of the Salmon drainage .
Control actions were implemented following each incident , and ultimately all 10 wolves were killed .
Jureano Mountain Pack : Alpha female B46 reclaimed her natal territory to rejuvenate the Jureano Mountain Pack in 2000 .
Unfortunately she continued the tradition of livestock depredations in this area west of Salmon , Idaho .
Six calves were confirmed killed by this pack in summer 2002 , and one additional calf was classified as a probable kill .
B46 and a yearling male wolf were lethally removed , and one adult and two yearlings were captured , radio - collared , and released on - site .
Wildhorse Pack :
The Copper Basin region that this pack inhabits holds several thousand cattle during the summer grazing season , but this pack ranged widely this summer following the death of alpha female B66 in January , and spent less time there than in 2001 .
In May and June at least some of the four radio - collared members of this pack were located nearby when one calf and 18 sheep were classified as possible wolf kills .
These three incidents occurred well outside of the home range used by the Wildhorse Pack during 2000 and 2001 .
No control actions were authorized .
Gold Fork Pack :
This pack , which committed three confirmed depredations in 2001 , was implicated in four depredation incidents in 2002 .
All were classified as probable wolf involvement ; with three calves killed and one calf injured .
The livestock producer operating in the area discovered several additional carcasses , but there was not enough evidence present to determine why the animals had died .
B133 and associates : B133 , a subadult male , was captured in May at the site of a confirmed wolf depredation on sheep .
B133 , and as many as three other wolves , were implicated in three additional depredations that resulted in 11 dead ewes / lambs .
Following the fourth depredation WS lethally removed two uncollared subadult females , leaving B133 and an uncollared wolf .
There were no further depredations after this control action .
Lone and Dispersing Wolves : Radio - collared male wolf B105 may have been responsible for two calves killed by an unknown predator in the area south of Riggins , Idaho .
B107 , a dispersing female from the Moyer Basin Pack , killed a domestic calf in the Sawtooth Valley .
A lethal control action was authorized , but was later rescinded when an injunction against lethal control on lands administered by the Sawtooth National Recreation Area was handed down .
Three sheep were confirmed killed by wolves in the Big Smoky drainage in late June .
Although B133 and wolves associated with him had used this area , it was not determined that they were present at this time .
A WS trapping effort did not result in the capture of any wolves .
Battlefield Pack ( state of Montana ) :
In late April , WS confirmed that wolves had killed one calf , and probably killed another , north of Wisdom , Montana .
Wolf B100 , a disperser from Idaho , was in the area along with three other wolves .
Traps were set , but no wolves were captured .
In May , wolves harassed cattle at a night calving pen , causing damage to fences but no mortalities .
A mortality signal was received from B100's collar , in the Big Hole River , in early
But there are many other gospels , some of which have been known for centuries and some of which have been more recently discovered .
I thought I should look at them , too .
One view of these other texts is that of M?R James , the great writer of ghost stories , who published a translation of various apocryphal gospels in 1924 .
He wrote : ‘ People may still be heard to say , “ After all , these Apocryphal Gospels and Acts , as you call them , are just as interesting as the old ones .
It was only by accident or caprice that they were not put into the New Testament . ”
The best answer to such loose talk has always been , and is now , to produce the writings and let them tell their own story .
It will very quickly be seen that there is no question of anyone ’s having excluded them from the New Testament ; they have excluded themselves . ’
In other words , they ’re just not very good .
And it ’s true : for the most part , the apocryphal gospels in James ’s selection have nothing like the clarity and force of Matthew , Mark and Luke , or the poetry of John .
They include some remarkable fragments , but also a welter of undistinguished narratives , sayings , exhortations and fairy tales that make pretty hard reading .

A Shillong court issued an arrest warrant against a Delhi - based publisher on Tuesday who is allegedly responsible for printing school textbooks carrying an objectionable picture of Jesus Christ .
" We have obtained an arrest warrant against publisher Indramohan Jha from chief judicial magistrate court here .
A police team will leave for New Delhi to arrest and interrogate him , " Deputy Superintendent of Police Vivek Syiem said .
" A case under Section 295 ( A ) ( deliberate and malicious act intended to hurt religious feelings ) of the IPC has been registered against Skyline Publication .
The offence is non-bailable , " he said .
Over 120 books have been seized by the police from a convent school and a distributor .
Authorities of St Joseph Girls ' Higher Secondary School in Shillong , where the cursive writing book was supplied among the students of Class I to IV , had filed a first information report against the publisher after the objectionable picture of Christ came to notice .
A case was registered on February 19 .
The cursive writing book for Class I is a spelling tutor , where ' Idol ' is used for ' I ' .
Against this word , a picture of Jesus Christ holding a cigarette and a beer can was used .
The picture was also printed in cursive writing books of Class II , III and IV .

In Japan the number of owners abandoning their pets is so high the authorities are having to devise new ways of ' disposing ' of them .
Instead of being looked after in animal protection centres the majority of unwanted pets are destroyed .
One municipal authority in Japan has developed a mobile gas chamber to put down abandoned dogs while they are transported to a crematorium .
It is a policy which some Japanese animal lovers find hard to understand .

The antigen ( s ) responsible for GPC have yet to be identified .
From circumstantial evidence , the initiating event is believed to be mechanical irritation and / or antigenic stimulus of the tarsal conjunctiva of the upper lids by a contact lens surface or edge ( rigid or flexible ) or deposit .
Histologic changes in the tissue occur with mast cell degranulation and a secondary inflammatory cascade .
This leads to conjunctivitis and further tissue changes with increasing inflammatory markers in the tears .
GPC can be caused by all forms of ocular prostheses , including rigid and hydrogel ( soft ) contact lenses , prosthetic eyes , extruding scleral buckles , exposed portions of sutures , filters , knots , and even corneal scars . [ 8 ]
Heat sterilization , poor cleaning , thick or rough contact lens edges , and extended wearing times also predispose to the development of GPC .
Lipid and protein deposits from the tears , as well as debris coating the surface of contact lenses , may also lead to a spiral of inflammation .
This , in turn , causes even more lens deposits to form , leading to additional inflammation . [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
The level of coating on the lenses varies among individuals and the polymer of the contact lenses .
High - water hydrogel ( HEMA ) contact lenses tend to coat more than lower - water HEMA contact lenses .
Silicone contact lenses tend to accumulate more lipid deposits than HEMA lenses .
First - generation silicone hydrogel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development , perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or their higher propensity for lipid deposition .
Silicone hydrogel lenses tend to induce more local GPC ( similar to the changes seen with rigid lenses ) , whereas hydrogel lenses tend to induce more generalized GPC reactions in the palpebral conjunctiva . [ 9 ]
Children must go through airport scanners , says Adonis
Concerns had been raised about passenger privacy Children selected to walk through the full body scanners at airports must do so , the transport secretary has said .
Lord Adonis , announcing a consultation on a code of conduct for the scanners , said to exclude children risked undermining the security measures .
Civil rights groups had raised concerns that the resulting images would breach child pornography laws .
The scanners are being introduced after a failed attempt to blow up a plane in the US in December .
The government 's code of practice on the scanners said airport security staff had all been vetted , including a check of criminal and security service records .
' Sensitive ' staff
They had also been trained in aviation security and " customer service " to carry out their jobs " in a sensitive and proportionate manner . "
The government said it was aware of concerns under the Protection of Children Act , but that there were also provisions for the prevention , detection or investigation of crime .
The government described its privacy controls as sufficient , but added that " some individuals , such as trans - gendered , disabled or elderly passengers , or passengers with particular religious or other beliefs might , notwithstanding the existing privacy controls , have concerns about undergoing a security scan . "
Why risk giving perverts and those looking to make a fast buck the opportunity to spy on us ?
Dylan Sharpe
Big Brother Watch
It said staff would be able to handle such situations " sensitively " .
Dylan Sharpe , campaign director of Big Brother Watch , said : " It beggars belief that the government is to force young children through these body scanners .
" Only last week a security guard was exposed as having abused the technology .
How many more cases like that do we need before the transport secretary admits that the operators have not had sufficient training and vetting to handle this technology ?
" Security minister Lord West admits that the scanners are only 50 - 60 % effective , so why risk giving perverts and those looking to make a fast buck the opportunity to spy on us ? "
' Naked ' images
The launch of the consultation comes after a Heathrow Airport security guard was given a police warning after he was allegedly caught staring at images of a female colleague in a body scanner .
The scanners , to be phased in gradually , will initially operate alongside metal detectors , and are eventually planned for use for all flights in and out of the UK .
The £ 80,000 full body scanners produce " naked " images of passengers .
They work by beaming electromagnetic waves on to passengers while they stand in a booth .
A virtual three - dimensional image is then created from the reflected energy .
Airports around the world began introducing them after Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , now in custody , was accused of trying to detonate a bomb on a plane bound for the US on 25 December .

The iPad
Back in December , here ’s how I concluded my piece on what I expected from Apple ’s then - still - unannounced tablet :
If you ’re thinking The Tablet is just a big iPhone , or just Apple ’s take on the e-reader , or just a media player , or just anything , I say you ’re thinking too small — the equivalent of thinking that the iPhone was going to be just a click wheel iPod that made phone calls .
I think The Tablet is nothing short of Apple ’s reconception of personal computing .
After the iPad was announced , I got two types of emails from readers .
The first group saying they were disappointed , because they had been hoping I was right that The Tablet would be Apple ’s reconception of personal computing .
The second group wrote to tell me how excited they were because I was right that The Tablet would be Apple ’s reconception of personal computing .
Count me in with the second group .
Apple has n’t thought of everything with iPad , but what they ’ve thought about , they ’ve thought about very deeply .
I got mine Saturday morning , and I ’ve been using it since — or at least as often as I could get it away from my son .
Here are my thoughts .
The Big Picture
The whole thing feels fast fast fast .
The only thing that feels slow overall , so far , is web page rendering .
Not because it ’s slower than the iPhone — it ’s not , it ’s definitely much faster — but because it ’s so much slower than my MacBook Pro .
It ’s easy to forget on modern PC - class hardware just how computationally expensive HTML rendering is .
The funny thing is , the iPad , in raw CPU terms , is a far slower machine than a modern Mac .
But the iPad is running a lightweight OS and lightweight apps .
It ’s like a slower runner with a lighter backpack who can win a race against a faster runner wearing a heavier backpack .
Thus , many of the things you do are faster , or at least feel faster ( which is what matters ) , on the iPad than the Mac .
Like , for example , launching applications .
The built - in apps , and many of the third - party apps I ’ve been using the most , are ready to use within a moment of launching them .
( Games tend not to load instantly , but that ’s true on high - power consoles like Xbox and PS3 , too . )
There ’s something fundamentally strange about how fast the iPad feels considering how underpowered it is versus a modern PC or Mac .
How can a computer with so much less CPU speed feel faster ?
What Apple has done is re-think several fundamental aspects .
The iPad was designed from the ground up with a different set of priorities .
I think Tim Bray summarizes it well :
For a 1 Ghz device with limited memory , the iPad is unreasonably fast .
I suspect this accounts for a whole bunch of the “ Wow ! ” reaction the iPad obviously provokes .
Since there ’s no free lunch , I think it ’s really important that we understand what they sacrificed to get that performance .
My bet would be on some combination of windowing and virtual memory .
I tend to work on lots of things at once , but in fact I look at things in rapid succession , my eyes can really only focus on one thing at one time .
Given sufficiently fast switching , maybe we all ought to be getting less WIMPy .
The iPad ( and iPhone OS across all devices ) does indeed lack virtual memory .
1
The only memory is honest - to - god RAM .
RAM is fast , virtual memory is slow .
The tradeoff is that without virtual memory , the iPad can do far less at once , but what it does do is never going to require hitting virtual memory .
Without a windowing system , drawing is simpler and faster .
Apple has made other significantly different tradeoffs as well .
Battery life on the iPad is simply stunning .
Reviewers across the board are getting real - life results that beat Apple ’s promise of 10 hours of battery life .
This is a function both of software ( which does less and works hard to keep the CPU from drawing power while the iPad is being used ) and hardware — i Fixit ’s teardown shows that , internally , the iPad looks more like a battery with a computer than a computer with a battery .
The iPad , so far , never gets warm .
Browse a bunch of web sites .
Play some video .
Play a game .
It still feels as cool to the touch as when it ’s turned off .
It is also dead quiet — no fan , no humming , nada .
This is the future of computing .
The iPad was designed with an entirely different set of priorities than Macs or PCs .
Someone may well produce a worthy iPad rival in the next year , but it ’s not going to be something like HP ’s Slate that runs Windows 7 , an operating system that epitomizes the traditional set of computer design priorities .
The iPad is also eminently affordable .
$ 500 for this thing seems hard to believe .
I would n’t hesitate to recommend it at double the price .
But clearly there were tradeoffs involved to hit this price point .
Build quality is not one — the thing feels perfect in hand .
But it only has 256 MB of RAM — perhaps the single biggest hardware weakness of the device ( see the section on Safari below ) .
It is super high - quality , but clearly designed for the mass market .
Anyone who thinks
Apple only makes high - priced products has completely lost sense of reality .
“ Affordable luxury ” is the sweet spot for mass market success today , and Apple keeps shooting bulls eyes .
In fact , the only thing that makes my heart ache regarding the iPad is when I start imagining a hypothetical Pro model — imagine what Apple could put in an iPad that cost as much as a MacBook Pro .
( My dream iPad Pro : double the display ’s pixel resolution and include a gigabyte or two of RAM . )
Affordability presents itself in other ways , too .
Nothing is included in the box other than the power adapter .
The dock and case are separate SKUs , and it does n’t even come with headphones .
It ’s like buying a Honda , not an Acura — the base model is not “ well - equipped ” .
$ 500 is affordable but not cheap , and the iPad does not feel cheap in any regard .
The build quality is outstanding .
The brushed aluminum back makes my plastic iPhone 3GS feel cheap .
The iPad takes more cues from the current iMacs than it does from the iPhone .
The seam between the glass and the aluminum is nearly perfect .
It ’s just one piece of aluminum and a piece of glass — there is no superfluous chrome bezel between the glass and the backing as there is on all iPhones and iPod Touches to date .
Even without turning it on it looks and feels a step beyond the iPhones and iPod Touches we ’ve seen to date .
The Killer App
One thing that ’s making it hard for some people to grasp the purpose of the iPad is that no one has an answer to what precisely it is for .
This was not so for the iPhone .
The answer to the question of what the original 2007 iPhone was meant for was right there at the bottom of the iPhone home screen , in the “ dock ” : phone , email , web , music and video .
The other apps were icing on the cake .
The four apps in the dock were what Apple designed the iPhone to do .
The iPad also has a “ dock ” on the home screen , and the default apps in that dock are clearly important : Safari , Mail , Photos , iPod ( which , on the iPad , is only for audio ) .
But some are treating the iPad as , fundamentally , an e-reader .
Others as a gaming device .
Others as a movie player .
None of those things are represented in the iPad ’s default dock apps .
The truth is that the App Store is the killer app .
The iPad is meant for anything that can be represented on a 10 - inch color touchscreen .
Back in January when we were playing the “ What ’s Apple going to name the tablet ? ” game , my favorite , by far , was “ Canvas ” .
I ’m not saying here that Canvas would have been a better name than iPad , but the word conveys perfectly what the iPad is .
Adam Engst captured this :
The iPad becomes the app you ’re using .
That ’s part of the magic .
The hardware is so understated - it ’s just a screen , really - and because you manipulate objects and interface elements so smoothly and directly on the screen , the fact that you ’re using an iPad falls away .
You ’re using the app , whatever it may be , and while you ’re doing so , the iPad is that app .
Switch to another app and the iPad becomes that app .
If that ’s not magic , I do n’t know what is .
As did Cultured Code ’s Jürgen Schweizer :
Steve Jobs said about the iPod that “ it is all about the music ” .
With the iPad , Apple has done the same for personal computing as it has done before with the iPod : it made technology go away .
But if the device is gone , and the operating system is gone , what is left ?
The iPad is an empty canvas that invites us to imagine what is possible .
It inspires our imagination and it makes us want to create , because never before were we able to create software that was so close to the user .
The iPad hardware and OS are profoundly humble — they put all the focus on whatever app it is that is open .
Out of Box Experience
One thing that is very iPhone - like about iPad is that when you first take it out of the box , it wants to be plugged into your Mac or PC via USB and sync with iTunes .
In some ways , that ’s understandable .
USB syncing is how you load your iPad with music and videos and transfer over stuff like your email accounts , and , if you ’re not using MobileMe , your contacts and calendars .
But , on the whole , it feels retrograde .
It creates an impression that the iPad does not stand on its own .
It ’s a child that still needs a parent .
But it ’s not a young child .
It ’s more like a teenager .
It ’s close .
So close that it feels like it ought to be able to stand on its own .
Android devices do not have this problem .
You can sync an Android device with a desktop computer via USB , for transferring things like music and videos , but you do n’t have to .
Out of the box , a Nexus One is ready to go .
Google ’s big advantage here is that they ’re using online services as primary data stores .
The Google Way is to use Gmail for email and contacts , and Google Calendar for events .
You just tell your Android device your Google ID and password , and your email , contacts , and calendars start syncing over the air .
Apple has MobileMe , but because it ’s a paid service , they ca n’t ( or at least wo n’t ) assume that all iPad owners are going to use it .
But then even those of us who do use MobileMe get stuck with a first - run iPad experience that involves a tethered USB connection to a computer .
The Apple Way is to assume that your primary data stores for these things are locally stored on your Mac or PC — Address Book , iCal .
At the very least , these things ought to be able to sync between iTunes ( on your Mac or PC ) and your iPad over your Wi -Fi network .
Third - party iPhone OS apps like
Things do a great job with this — there ’s no reason iTunes and the iPhone OS should n’t too .
Those Heart - Stopping ‘ Scratches ’
On the iPhone ( and iPod Touch ; assume from here out that when I say “ iPhone ” I ’m referring to both ) , app icons on the home screen sit atop a plain black background .
On the iPad , they ’re spaced further apart , which is why I think Apple has added wallpaper — making the iPad home screen look a lot more like a Mac or Windows desktop .
The default wallpaper shows a sunset skyline of a mountain range in front of a lake .
There ’s a meteor shower in the sky .
And the streaking meteors look , at a glance , like a series of severe scratches on the display .
It ’s a curious choice .
Update :
They ’re not meteors .
It ’s a long exposure and the “ scratches ” are the tracks of stars moving across the sky .
The Touchscreen Keyboard
It ’s a lot like the iPhone ’s , but , it ’s different .
Because it ’s bigger , there are no pop - up indicators showing which key you hit as you type .
They ’re not necessary .
The feel , overall , is pretty much like typing on a really big iPhone .
If you ’re in a position where you can set the iPad down on your lap or a table top , it ’s not too hard at all to type with all your fingers when the iPad is in landscape ( horizontal ) orientation .
Now , to me , it ’s nowhere near as good as even the worst full - or nearly - full - size hardware keyboard I ’ve ever used .
You ca n’t just rest all eight of your fingers on the home row keys , and you ca n’t feel where the key cap edges are .
You have to look at the keyboard a fair amount as you type .
On a hardware keyboard , I hardly ever look at the keys .
But for a touchscreen , it ’s good .
In portrait ( vertical ) orientation , I can type on the iPad using just my two thumbs , as I do on my iPhone .
I have relatively large hands , though — I do n’t think most people can do it .
The keyboard in this layout is way too small for me to type with all of my fingers , though .
In portrait orientation most people will type using one finger , I expect .
Now , the funny thing is , in general , bigger keyboards are easier to type on than smaller ones .
That ’s why big laptops are easier to type on than compact ones , and , indeed , that ’s why the landscape iPad keyboard on the iPad is easier to type on than the portrait one .
But at a certain point , the curve flips around and smaller becomes faster .
I type much faster on my iPhone using the smaller portrait orientation keyboard than the wider landscape keyboard .
In both modes , I use just my two thumbs .
With the smaller iPhone keyboard , my thumbs have to travel less from one key to the next .
People who are n’t very proficient at the iPhone keyboard , or who have very large thumbs and therefore have trouble precisely tapping the smaller keys , may well prefer the iPhone ’s wider landscape keyboard .
But for me it ’s not even close .
I never type in landscape on my iPhone .
And in fact ( and this is the aforereferenced “ funny part ” ) , I type faster on my iPhone than I do on the iPad .
That ’s especially true for when the iPad is in portrait mode , which puts the keyboard size in a no - man ’s land — too small to eight - finger - type , too big to thumb - type .
But it ’s also true for when the iPad is in landscape mode .
I ’m hopeful that this is just a factor of experience and muscle memory — I have nearly three years of experience typing on the iPhone , and , as I type this sentence , only two days experience with the iPad.
Last Friday I watched Andy Ihnatko eight - finger - type on his iPad — which he ’d been using for over a week — and he was typing pretty goddamn fast .
One problem I ’ve run into is that Apple has subtly changed the layout of the keyboard from the iPhone’s .
On the iPhone , the Delete key is on the lower right , above the Return key .
On the iPad , it ’s in the upper right corner , and the Return key is next to the L key .
The iPad adds a right - side Shift key .
The iPad layout makes perfect sense — both these keys are now where they reside on traditional hardware keyboards .
Their weird positions on the iPhone are a compromise forced by the extreme lack of space on the iPhone display .
Apple has also added a new key to the iPad keyboard ’s numeric / punctuation mode : Undo .
It ’s a good idea — I have the feeling most iPhone users do n’t know about the system - wide shake - to - undo gesture , and even for users who do , the iPad is harder to shake ( and , when docked , downright silly to shake ) .
But this new Undo key moves the period and comma keys over to the right by two positions .
The iPhone keyboard layout is so firmly ingrained in my mind that these changes are problems for me — I keep hitting the ( new to the iPad ) right - side Shift key when I mean to hit Delete , and I keep hitting Undo when I mean to type a period .
I ’ll get used to it soon , I ’m sure , but I find it interesting that my iPad typing muscle memory is based on the iPhone keyboard , not regular keyboards .
I think this is because , overall , it really does feel like a big iPhone keyboard .
Hardware Keyboard Support
I do n’t have ( and did not order ) the iPad keyboard dock , but I have been using an Apple Bluetooth keyboard .
In fact , I ’m using it to type this entire review .
Pairing ( via the iPad Settings app ) is easy and quick .
And it works great .
Several essential text - editing shortcuts from the Mac OS work system - wide on the iPad : Command - Z , -X , -C , and -V work for Undo , Cut , Copy , and Paste .
Command - A works for Select All .
You can use the arrow keys to move the insertion point .
Option - Arrow keys work to move the insertion point one word at a time .
Command - Left / Right moves the insertion point to the beginning / end of the current line ; Command - Up / Down moves the insertion point the start / end of the current text field — which , in the case of something like Pages , is the beginning / end of the entire document .
Holding down
Shift extends the selection range , and works in conjunction with the Option and Command keys as expected .
( Some of Cocoa ’s long - standing Emacs - style text editing shortcuts work too : like Control - K ( kill ) and Control - H ( backspace ) . )
Certain of the function keys on the Bluetooth keyboard are useful on the iPad .
The brightness keys control the iPad ’s display brightness .
The volume ( and mute ) keys work .
The playback buttons — play / pause , next , previous — all work to control the iPod app .
By default , once you ’ve started using a hardware keyboard , the on - screen keyboard no longer appears , which is great , because the full display is now available for displaying content .
But if you want to use the on - screen keyboard while a hardware keyboard is active , you can toggle it using the hardware keyboard ’s Eject key .
The Esc key dismisses the auto - complete suggestion — it ’s like tapping the little “ x ” next to the suggestion under the current word you ’re typing .
While a keyboard is connected , you can wake up the iPad by hitting any key — completely bypassing the iPad ’s slide - to - unlock screen .
Very nice .
The iPad is fundamentally a touchscreen device .
You absolutely do not need a hardware keyboard for it .
But if you ’re hoping to do any amount of serious writing with it ( and , for obvious vocational reasons , I plan to ) , you ’re going to want one .
There are a few places in the iPad UI where I really wish the keyboard was useful but it is n’t .
For example , Safari location field suggestions .
On the Mac , you can use the up and down arrow keys to move through the list of suggestions .
On the iPad , you must use touch to select from the list .
Since you ’re already typing if you ’re entering a URL , this is just begging for arrow key support .
( Ditto for suggested results from the Google search field in Safari . )
The Esc key does not dismiss popovers , but that ’s probably OK .
It ’s only possible to invoke popovers via touch , so it seems OK that you must dismiss them via touch as well .
The Tab key can be used to switch between text fields ; Shift - Tab goes in reverse order .
( When using the hardware keyboard , I do find myself hitting Command - Tab , without thinking about it , when I want to switch to another app ; it does nothing on the iPad . )
Display
The iPad display is , overall , wonderful .
Colors are bright and ( unlike the Nexus One ’s OLED display ) accurate .
Photos and videos looks great .
Touches seem precisely accurate .
The glass feels good .
Viewing angles are shockingly good .
You can lay the iPad flat on a table while you eat or drink and it looks just fine at a decidedly skewed angle — far more so than with the iPhone .
This IPS stuff is the real deal ; here ’s to hoping for an IPS display in this year ’s new iPhones .
The only complaint I have about the display is that the pixel resolution is n’t all that dense .
The iPad ’s 1024 × 768 display has a resolution of 132 pixels per inch .
The iPhone ’s 480 × 320 display has a resolution of 163 pixels per inch .
The difference is n’t huge , but it ’s definitely noticeable .
Type looks crisper on the iPhone than the iPad , and type rendering falls far short of even newspaper - caliber resolution , let alone glossy - magazine caliber .
( Those of you who doubt that the pixels - per - inch resolution is n’t high enough , just wait until you see the type rendering on this summer ’s new iPhones . )
Safari
The iPad is so good as a web reader , that , if you ’re a web junkie , everything else the iPad does is just gravy .
It ’s good .
I ’m so used to Safari on the iPhone , though , where the toolbar is at the bottom , that I ’m having a hard time getting adjusted to the toolbar at the top .
I ’m not saying it ’s a bad decision on Apple ’s part .
In fact , the iPad HIG is quite explicit that iPad toolbars should go at the top , not bottom — which makes me think Apple thought about and tested this and has concluded that the top works better for the iPad form factor .
It ’s just that I use Safari on my iPhone a lot , and I am really used to the button placement .
When you create a new page in Safari on iPad , text focus goes to the Google search field by default , rather than the URL location field .
That ’s a change from both desktop and iPhone Safari .
I ’m finding this hard to get used to , but I can see how this might be a better design for typical users .
It makes the default search engine all the more essential to the web browsing experience , though .
Zooming and flicking are essential to the experience , just like on the iPhone .
Flicking is how you scroll , no surprise .
The zooming , though , may come as a surprise .
It was n’t too long ago when 1024 × 768 was considered a large display for full - size web browsing .
But : what matters on the iPad ( and iPhone ) is not the pixel count of the display , but the physical size .
9.7 inches diagonally is a bit small for a non-zoomed web browser .
But the action of zooming — whether through double - tapping or pinching — is so smooth , fast , and natural that it feels better , not worse , than old - school desktop web browsing .
There ’s one severe problem in Safari for iPad , though : memory crapping out .
MobileSafari for iPhone has always allowed you to open up to eight pages at a time .
It tries to keep them all truly open , in RAM , so that you can quickly switch between them .
But when it runs out of memory it starts flushing some of the pages .
It does n’t forget the URLs for those pages , and , in recent versions , it saves a static thumbnail image of the rendered page , but when you switch back to those purged pages , MobileSafari must reload the page — thus , you must wait both for the contents of the page to download and for the page to actually render ( which — the rendering — often takes longer than the downloading ) .
It ’s very noticeable .
Switching between unpurged Safari pages is instantaneous .
Switching to a purged page takes as long as opening it from scratch .
Wolf Rentzsch , linking to this complaint from Peter - Paul Koch , wrote a brief technical overview of why Apple might have designed MobileSafari this way .
( Keep in mind that iPhone OS does not use virtual memory ; thus RAM is severely constrained . )
This purging problem got a lot better with the iPhone 3GS .
The original iPhone and iPhone 3G only had 128 MB of RAM .
The 3GS has 256 .
MobileSafari ’s ability to keep more pages in memory is probably my single favorite aspect of the 3GS .
The iPad also has 256 MB of RAM .
But , in my use , iPad ’s Safari is n’t able to keep nearly as many pages open as I can on my 3GS .
In fact , sometimes it seems I can only have one , and every page I switch to gets completely reloaded .
This is more than just annoying — it can lead to data loss if you have unsubmitted form data sitting in an “ open ” iPad Safari page .
I ’ve run into this posting items to DF from the iPad — my posting interface is a web page form .
When I want to link to the current page , I invoke a bookmarklet which opens a new page with the title and URL fields of the posting form set to the title and URL of the page from which I invoked the bookmarklet .
Often , though , I want to switch back to the page I ’m linking to copy another URL or a bit of text to quote .
Twice so far , when going back to the posting form , it ’s been purged and must reload from scratch — in which case I lose anything I ’ve already written .
I never run into this problem on my iPhone 3GS when switching between just two open Safari pages .
The problem is also severe for AJAX web apps , which tend not to be designed with full page refreshes in mind .
I hope this can be improved significantly in an iPad software update , but I worry that it ’s endemic — that because the iPad screen is so much larger than the iPhone ’s , that MobileSafari must allocate significantly more memory per page for the framebuffers .
256 MB of RAM simply may not be enough for MobileSafari to keep more than two or three pages in memory .
If so , Apple really needs to consider some sort of caching or serialization scheme rather than completely flushing away purged pages .
Pages
I wrote the entire 4,828 - word first draft of this piece on my iPad using Pages .
2
I did n’t use any of the formatting or layout tools — I used it as a text editor rather than a word processor .
It ’s quite serviceable .
What I like best is that it opens very quickly .
Switching between , say , Pages and Safari and back to copy - and - paste a URL feels more like switching than quitting , launching , quitting , relaunching .
You do n’t need to ( and ca n ’t ) save manually .
Whatever you do in a document simply persists automatically .
When you go back to the list of documents , they ’re presented as big thumbnails — very much like the list of open web pages in Safari .
Pages ’s toolbar and ruler are only visible when in portrait mode .
In landscape mode , all of the chrome disappears .
It ’s just a full - screen editing view , a la WriteRoom .
I ’m writing this piece in this full - screen ( landscape ) mode , with my iPad propped up on a table in Apple ’s iPad case .
It ’s a nice setup , and I can genuinely imagine leaving my MacBook at home for trips in the future , with the addition of a few missing iPad apps ( like , say , a good SFTP client ) .
But when I say there ’s no chrome in the landscape mode , I mean none .
Pages has a decent simple little find and replace feature , but it ’s only possible to invoke it in portrait mode .
( I must have hit Command - F a dozen times so far , to no avail . )
There are already complaints piling up that the iWork apps do n’t support the complete feature set of their current Mac counterparts — open a file created in a Mac version of Pages / Numbers / Keynote on your iPad and certain document features may be removed .
( The iPad apps prompt you with an alert telling you which aspects of the document have been changed or removed . )
Another way of looking at it though , is that the iPad iWork apps are to their Mac counterparts what the iPad as a whole is to the Mac — simpler , more focused , but in some ways faster .
Pages launches and is ready for input far quicker on my iPad than on my MacBook Pro .
Writing this review , I ’ve been switching back and forth between Pages and Safari .
It does n’t feel like quitting Pages , launching Safari , copying a URL , quitting Safari , and re-launching Pages .
It feels more like switching — it only takes a moment after tapping the Pages icon on the home screen to be back where I was in my open document .
( My only complaint is that you lose the insertion point when leaving and coming back to Pages — the document re-opens to where you left off , but you must tap the screen to place the insertion point .
When switching several times , that becomes slightly tedious . )
This is obviously not even close to a full review of Pages , but I can say without hesitation that it ’s easily worth $ 10 .
Syncing
There is , however , a severe shortcoming inherent to the iWork suite of iPad apps : document syncing between Mac and iPad .
It ’s a convoluted mess .
In short , the only way to edit a document on your iPad that was created on your Mac , or vice versa , is to go through a convoluted multi-step process of exporting , copying , syncing or downloading , and importing .
Ted Landau has copiously documented the entire situation in this article at The Mac Observer .
Read it and weep .
What it boils down to is that there is no syncing really .
Real syncing is something like IMAP for email , or the way MobileMe handles calendars and contacts .
When I read a bunch of new email messages using my iPad or iPhone , when I next sit down at my Mac , those messages are marked as read in my inbox .
I do n’t have to do anything on the Mac for that to happen .
That ’s just how IMAP works .
I can add a new calendar event on my Mac , then walk away from my computer , take my iPhone out of my pocket , and the event is there .
I can add a note to that event using my iPhone and a few moments later the note will be synced to the event on my Mac .
Certain of my favorite iPad and iPhone apps sync like this too .
When I read a bunch of RSS items using NetNewsWire on my iPad , they ’re marked as read on my Mac .
Sitting at my Mac in my office , I can send a long article to Instapaper .
I go downstairs , pick up my iPad , sit on the couch , launch the Instapaper iPad app , and a few seconds later , there ’s the article I just added to my Instapaper queue .
This is the sort of data flow that makes me feel like I ’m living in the future — using multiple hardware devices to view , edit , and modify the same data .
I do n’t worry about where separate copies of my data exist .
Conceptually it ’s just there in the apps , and the apps do all the hard work of pushing and pulling changes made on other clients .
The data flow with these iWork apps is n’t like that at all , and needs to be for them to be truly useful .
It does n’t matter how good the user interface for viewing and editing spreadsheets is in Numbers for iPad if my spreadsheets are n’t there .
Here ’s an example .
I keep the schedule for Daring Fireball RSS sponsorships in a Numbers document .
What I ’d like to be able to do on my iPad is launch Numbers and access the current version of that spreadsheet .
But the only way I could possibly do that today would be if I went through the following steps every single time I made a change to the document on my Mac :
Before opening the current version of the file on my Mac , check to make sure there is n’t a more recent version of it on my iPad .
Open the file on my Mac and make changes .
Save .
Dock my iPad to my Mac via USB .
Switch to iTunes and go to the Apps tab for my iPad .
Add the newly - saved revision of the document to the file sharing list for the iPad ’s Numbers app .
Sync .
Even after going through all of this , when I do want to open this file on my iPad , I have to remember not to open the last revision of it listed in the iPad Numbers app ’s “ My Documents ” list , but instead remember first to import the latest revision from Numbers ’s file sharing list to Numbers ’s “ My Documents ” .
And , again , it ’s effectively up to me to keep track of which machine , Mac or iPad , has the most recent revision of the file .
To say the least , this is a recipe for disaster , and even if you do n’t make a mistake and inadvertantly make significant changes to an out - of - date version of the document on one of the two machines , you ’re stuck with a preposterously , mind - bogglingly convoluted workflow each and every time you make a change to the document .
The bottom line , obviously , is that there is no way that anyone is going to use these iPad apps in the way I describe above .
As - is they ’re only useful to me in two ways .
First , I can imagine using Pages on the iPad to compose original new documents — posts for Daring Fireball — while I ’m using my iPad .
I ’ll either finish them there and then copy - and - paste the result into the web - based posting interface for DF , or , I ’ll send the draft to my Mac for further editing ( which is what I did for the piece you ’re reading right now ) .
I can also imagine creating finished Keynote decks on my Mac and then moving them , once , to my iPad , and taking only my iPad with me to the presentation — i.e. using Keynote , Numbers , and Pages on the iPad as viewers for finished documents .
( And , conveniently , they ’re viewers that can make edits if you notice a mistake or want to make a last - minute change or addition . )
But there ’s no possible way to use these apps as clients alongside their Mac counterparts on an ongoing basis .
The sort of over - the - air syncing I ’m imagining for iWork is , admittedly , a difficult problem to solve .
But the bad news for Apple is that their top competitor in this space has a solution : Google Docs .
With Google Docs , there ’s no making copies , importing / exporting , manually invoked syncing , or USB tethering involved if you want to edit a single instance of a spreadsheet from multiple machines .
You just make changes on one machine , and when you next look at that document from another machine the changes are there .
The workflow for iWork is downright antediluvian .
It ’s not just pre-Cloud , it ’s pre-network .
It ’s effectively the “ Who ’s got the latest revision of this file ? ” workflow of the days when we moved files from one machine to another via floppy disks .
What in the world is iWork.com for if not for solving this problem ?
At least iWork.com lets you avoid having to physically tether the two machines via USB to get a document from the Mac to the iPad ( or vice versa ) , but it ’s no better than file sharing through iTunes conceptually .
When you send a file to iWork.com ( from either Mac or iPad ) you ’re pushing a copy , a snapshot of the document from that moment .
After making subsequent changes , you ’ve got to push those changes to iWork.com all over again .
And to get them on the other device , you must manually import — making just another copy .
What you ought to be able to do is specify iWork.com as the canonical shared storage location for an iWork document .
iWork.com does n’t serve any such purpose today .
i Phone Apps
I predicted it ’d be crummy to run non-iPad - optimized iPhone apps on the iPad — like Classic apps running on Mac OS X — and I was right .
It ’s OK for games — they look jaggy , but jaggy games are n’t that uncommon .
But regular ( non - game ) apps just look and feel weird .
When you run them pixel - doubled text does n’t scale dynamically — everything is pixel doubled .
It ’s a good way of proving that the iPad is not “ just a big iPhone ” , though .
The only iPhone app I find myself using on my iPad is Simplenote , for copying and pasting bits of text to and from my Mac and iPhone .
Needless to say , I ’d love an iPad - optimized version of Simplenote .
iBooks and Kindle
The iBooks app is free , but does n’t ship with the iPad by default — you have to download it from the App Store .
Apple has n’t explained why this is so , but there are several reasons I can think of .
For one thing , e-book rights are managed on a country - by - country basis — it seems likely that the iBooks store wo n’t be available in every country where the iPad will soon be sold .
Making it an App Store app will also allow Apple to update the app on its own schedule — built - in system apps only get updates along with the entire system .
So in some ways , the iBooks app is on equal footing with other e-book readers available in the App Store , particularly Amazon ’s Kindle app .
But iBooks does get some special treatment — the first time I launched the App Store app on my iPad , it prompted me with a dialog box asking if I ’d like to down the free iBooks app .
It ’s impossible to miss .
The iBooks app also has display brightness controls that are not available through public APIs .
Winnie the Pooh is included as a free sample , and the choice is genius — it ’s a beloved story , a good read , and best of all ( from Apple ’s perspective ) it ca n’t be read properly on the Kindle because the color illustrations are a big part of the experience .
No book on the Kindle will ever look this good .
The Kindle has its own advantages — its books are generally cheaper , its selection bigger , and e-ink works better in bright sunlight — but Winnie the Pooh epitomizes the iPad ’s advantages .
iBooks ’s page - turning animation is delightful — it does n’t just track your finger - swipe precisely , but even renders the type faintly in reverse on the other side of the “ sheet ” .
The practical minded can simply tap the right and left edges of the screen to turn pages .
Amazon ’s iPad-native Kindle app is good , too .
Oddly , to my mind , it is superior to their recent Mac app in every way .
It looks better , feels better , renders text better , and has more features .
I say this is odd because the iPad was announced just two months ago ; Mac OS X was announced over a decade ago .
I suspect part of the reason the Mac version is so crippled is that they were more worried about keeping Mac users from un -DRMing Kindle content than they were about making the Mac app an actual good - to - use app .
The Kindle does n’t do animated page - turning , but that ’s not a big deal .
Reading is great .
And the Kindle ’s ace - in - the - hole , of course , is the far larger selection of e-books in its store — hundreds of thousands versus Apple ’s tens of thousands .
I bought When the Game Was Ours , a new book by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson .
It is not available in the iBooks store .
So Kindle ’s advantage is library size ( and , secondarily , price per title ) .
iBooks ’s advantage is the color display .
I ’d be shocked if every single piece of advertising Apple produces for iBooks does n’t focus entirely on screenshots of books with color illustrations , photos , and video .
I think it ’s going to be easier for Apple to improve the iBooks store library than it will be for Amazon to create a Kindle hardware model with a color display .
I think Amazon would do well to add color support to Kindle e-books for use on iPads and iPhones .
Kindle has a better chance of long - term success as a software platform than a hardware one .
Update : Several readers report that some Kindle ebooks do contain color when displayed on color - capable devices like the iPad .
Good to know .
Also , you can turn on page - turning animation ( which is off by default ) in the Kindle app ’s “ Info ” popover .
( But the animation sucks compared to iBooks ’s . )
Third - Party Apps in General
Given that most iPad-native apps in the store right now were developed using only the simulator by developers without access to actual iPads , you might expect apps to be buggy and UIs to be awkward .
I ’ve found the bugginess to be true , but the UIs are actually good .
I think the physical prototypes developers jury - rigged for themselves paid off , design - wise .
There ’s no question that UIs are going change rapidly in the coming weeks now that developers have the real deal to measure the feel of their apps against , but for the apps I ’ve been using the most , they ’re pretty damn good already .
As for the bugginess , I ’m not saying it ’s inexcusable or even surprising — the SDK simulator is not a perfect simulation .
Several of the bugs I ’ve reported are only present when the apps are running on actual iPad hardware .
On the whole , though , the quality of iPad apps on day one is better , by far , than I had expected considering that developers had to build them in the dark , as it were .
Prices , so far , are significantly higher than for iPhone apps — but still far cheaper than category equivalent Mac apps .
For example , NetNewsWire is $ 10 ( and going to $ 15 in May ) ; Things is $ 20 ; and OmniGraffle is $ 50 .
No doubt there are going to be wildly popular 99 - cent iPad apps , but it ’s also shaping up as a serious platform for serious tools .
Games are a bit more expensive , too , but , to me , reasonably so .
I love doughnuts .
Do you love doughnuts ?
Glazed , powdered sugar , jelly - filled , cream - filled , custard - filled , long johns , chocolate - glazed , chocolate with
glaze , maple , cinnamon ?
Excellent , then we ’re on the same page .
Today I ’m going to show you how to make your own doughnuts at home , not only from scratch ( which is pretty easy on its own ) but also a much easier and quicker way using biscuit dough you can buy ready - made from any grocery store .
Origins of the Doughnut
The history of the doughnut is rather disputed , and two theories currently exist concerning its origin :
The Dutch brought them over along with a bunch of other deserts that they were responsible for introducing to early colonial America such as cookies , cream pie , apple pie , and cobbler .
There is solid evidence to support this : in the early 1800s , doughnuts were , in some places , known as a type of “ olykoek ” , which is a Dutch word that literally means “ oil cake ” , a treat that was a “ sweetened cake fried in fat . ”
The second explanation is , in my opinion , true but not correct ( meaning I think the guy is telling the truth , but I do n’t think he was the first person to figure this out –I suspect the Dutch were there long before him ) : an American , Hansen Gregory , claimed that he invented the classic round - doughnut - with - a - hole - in - it doughnut back in 1847 while he was a 16 year old sailor on a lime - trading ship .
The story goes that he was irritated with the regular , and oddly shaped , doughnuts on board the ship because they were not only too greasy but also always had a raw center .
He says that he punched a hole in the middle of an uncooked doughnut with a tin pepper box , fried it normally , and “ Eureka ! ” .
He later taught this hole - punching technique to his mother from whom it spread rapidly .
Fast doughnuts ( with biscuit dough )
Here ’s a really quick and easy technique to make homemade doughnuts that does n’t require you to make your own dough .
The Food Network has a chef and his daughter whip these up together in a few minutes ( you might
need 10 minutes or so , not including prep ) , all you need to this is a skillet , some vegetable oil ( the old - fashioned way would be to use lard … just saying 😉 ) , some tongs ( for turning the doughnuts ) , packaged biscuit dough ( e.g. Pilsbury ) , and whatever topping you want to use ( the next video actually shows
you how to make your own icing , by the way , but it looks like they ’ve got some Pilsbury chocolate cake icing there which actually sounds like a really good idea ) .
Here we go :
How to make doughnuts from scratch
This is a bit longer , about 10 minutes , but you get to make everything from scratch ( dough and icing ) , which actually is n’t even that difficult .
Here are the ingredients you ’ll need :
1/2 cup castor sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup of milk
50g ( 3.5 tablespoons ) melted butter
2 cups plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 and 1/2 cups icing sugar
1 egg
Lots of colored sprinkles

What will I have for lunch ?
Every day , millions of Americans consider this question .
Perhaps a sandwich , or leftovers from last night , or a take - out meal will sustain you .
But if you 're a student in one of the country 's elementary or high schools , you will probably be stuck with whatever is being served from large metal trays in your cafeteria .
School lunch is currently one of the hot topics in food policy .
So much that a new film called Lunch Line , produced by Uji Films , is coming out this spring to emphasize the history and development of the school lunch program .
The film presents a compelling and intense narrative of the behind - the - scenes tensions of school lunch reform .
On one side , we see chef Ann Cooper , a trailblazer in school lunch reform , railing against a " flawed " system that should be " blown up " .
But opponents of reform are also represented , one of whom defends the current standards by emphasizing that " after all , we 're feeding millions of people . "
This film is extremely timely .
This year , as they do every five years , Congress will vote on the Child Nutrition Women , Infants , and Children Reauthorization Act ( CNRA ) .
The CNRA is a large piece of legislation that sets guidelines for several federal nutrition programs , including the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program ( NSLP ) .
The NSLP was first implemented in 1946 , when the army reported that many World War II recruits were severely malnourished .
At the time , about seven million children came to be covered by the program , and the federally provided subsidy per lunch was about 9 ¢ .
Today , over 30 million children participate in the program , and the subsidy has been increased to $ 2.68 .
Many critics claim that this subsidy is far too low to ensure healthy and fresh food for students .
Most advocate an increase of at least a dollar per meal , though Alice Waters has pushed for a per-meal subsidy as high as $ 5 per meal .
There is strong resistance in the government to subsidy increases , which is understandable to an extent — no member of Congress wishes to advocate an increase of billions of dollars in federal spending .
But keeping the price down to cut corners means this : 95 % of food delivered to school cafeterias is frozen , simply defrosted and served .
Indeed , most school kitchens lack the equipment and skilled workers to even cook food at all .
Beyond the meals themselves , Congress must also address poor regulation and oversight of the food served to our children .
Between 1998 and 2007 , there were more than 470 outbreaks of food - borne illness in schools , nearly all of which were linked to contaminated processed foods supposedly under regulation by the FDA .
While this lack of oversight affects the whole population , it is particularly sad that children cannot be protected even in their own school cafeterias .
Congress is set to renew the CNRA in the coming months .
With any luck , the efforts of lobbying groups and researchers , and influence of documentaries such as Lunch Line , will yield some real reform to our botched lunch program .
Now is the time to act , to make positive changes to the National School Lunch Program .
We can only hope that Congress steps up to the challenge .

For anyone who thought Fox News would offer any kind of alternative to the fever pitch media demonization campaign being run by the likes of CNN and MSNBC against conservatives , libertarians , and anyone angry at the passage of Obamacare – think again .
It turns out that Fox News has been spending its time trawling the comments section of Infowars.com looking for any excuse to shop Alex Jones in to the authorities .
That ’s right – amidst thousands of political websites and millions of comments left on articles and forums across the entire spectrum of the world wide web , Fox News decided to target Alex Jones ’ websites for a Nazi - style denunciation campaign in an effort to have the powers that be crack down on Infowars and shut down their competition .
“ Hundreds of comments were posted in response to an incendiary story on infowars.com , the radical far - right Web site owned by radio host Alex Jones .
The story , entitled , ‘ The Cost Of Defying Obamacare : $ 2,250 a Month And IRS Goons Pointing Guns At Your Family , ’ focused on the ‘ increasing militarization of the IRS ’ and its expansion of powers under the new health care law , ” writes Fox News ’ Jana Winter , adding that a “ federal probe has been launched into the comments ” .
In a separate Fox News article about an investigation into comments allegedly posted on Infowars.com by an individual calling himself “ ACA , ” we learn that it was Fox News itself who reported the comments to authorities .
“ ACA , ” the husband of a military servicewoman living on a Tennessee Naval base , had his weapons seized and is under scrutiny by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service as a result of alleged threats he made to kill police officers and other government officials .
“ This action was taken after FoxNews.com inquired about the online comment , ” states the article .
The Fox News story is posted in the “ Terror ” section of the website , an effort to link Alex Jones and Infowars.com to terrorists .
So in actual fact Fox News is paying its employees to search through the thousands of comments Infowars receives each day that even our own moderators cannot properly keep up with , in a desperate effort to find any hint of violent rhetoric as an excuse to turn in Alex Jones to the authorities , in some kind of bizarre thought police / Nazi denunciation campaign .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Fox News is n’t interested in Neo - Nazi and white supremacist websites that openly call for violence on a daily basis , nor do they care about the hundreds of comments that can casually be found on any day of the week underneath You Tube videos calling for Obama to be assassinated – no – they ’re only interested in sifting through mountains of comments on websites owned by Alex Jones that might be perceived as violent .
Anyone who listens to the Alex Jones Show will know that Jones repeatedly denounces violence on a daily basis and constantly urges people to follow the non-violent principles of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
This can hardly be considered a political doctrine of the “ radical far - right , ” as Fox frames it .
Unlike Fox News , whose lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq led to the slaughter of over a million people , we have no interest whatsoever in falling into the government ’s trap by promoting violence .
Unlike Fox News , who aggressively push for Iran to be bombed on a regular basis , an attack that would slaughter 16 - 20 million people , we do not want to see anyone killed .
Behind every so - called “ patriot ” spouting violence you will find a federal informant .
Just as OKC bomber Timothy McVeigh was directed by an FBI agent , so were the members of the Hutaree militia arrested this past weekend .
Precisely as we predicted on Monday , it turns out that the group had been infiltrated by an undercover FBI agent named Thomas William Piatek .
As we have highlighted in every other major terror bust in the U.S. , planned violence is always provocateured by a federal informant who has penetrated the group , providing the excuse for the bust and allowing the media to enjoy more grist for their endless fearmongering about how we need to give up our rights because terrorists are everywhere .
While scaremongering about Americans turning to violence in response to the passage of Obamacare , the government itself funds double agents like Hal Turner to pose as patriots , telling them directly to spout violence and threaten to kill federal judges .
Let us be clear – unlike the government , we do n’t pay people to make violent threats against public figures , and unlike Fox News we do n’t allow our media platform to be used to disseminate baseless propaganda that leads to the violent slaughter of millions of innocent people .
Fox News ’ ludicrous agenda to frame Alex Jones and Infowars as instigators of violence is a blatant ploy to chill free speech , characterize opponents of Obamacare as violent thugs , and demonize us as extremists that should be silenced through the power of the state – thereby pushing the same rhetoric constantly invoked by their so - called “ liberal ” adversaries over at CNN and MSNBC .
This proves once again that while some of its hosts , people like Glenn Beck , masquerade as great defenders of conservatives and libertarians , Fox News itself is hell bent on joining the rest of the establishment media in framing Tea Partiers , Constitutionalists , Ron Paul supporters and patriots as violent radicals and even terrorists .

On 4th March thousands of workers and students across California took action in protest against budget cuts , lay - offs and fee hikes caused by the state ’s financial crisis .
This article from Indybay was written after 157 people were arrested for occupying the I - 880 motorway .
“ Why the hell did you get on that highway ? ” asked the cops , our cell mates , our coworkers , our classmates .
There are many responses that could be given that have been outlined by banners , occupation demands , student leaders , or budget statistics , but none of them really connect to why one would take over a highway .
Obviously there are no libraries on a highway .
The funding for schools is n’t going to be found on any one of those lanes of oncoming traffic .
And , in fact , a lot of people who were arrested on the highway were not students or teachers .
This is because the highway takeover is an action against a power structure that is much larger than this year ’s budget crisis .
That morning we awakened to newspaper headlines stating the governor ’s support for sanctioned student protests .
We were n’t the least bit impressed by this patronising rhetoric .
Our motivations for walking up that on ramp to 880 were far deeper and broader than some piddly demand for a return of the same : an education system that has for a long time been the bedrock to our highly divided class system in the United States .
The myth that change will come to this society by poor people reaching middle class status through the university makes no sense ; a school degree does not impact the condition of the neighborhoods and families we come from .
It should also now be clear to everyone that ritualized demonstrations that fail to break out of the normal functioning of society represent nothing more than the further consolidation of state power .
What fails to concretely disrupt the system ultimately strengthens it .
We know that if we “ win ” funding from Governor Schwarzenegger this is no victory , but a diversion of funds from one group of already - struggling people to pacify another , without changing shit .
For example , plans are in the works that will take money from the health care of prisoners in order to fatten university administrators ’ pockets .
We refuse to accept a shallow bribe that places “ our ” interests in competition with those of our potential comrades .
It was our experience on the highway that made the question of who our allies and adversaries are infinitely clear .
As we ran up the on - ramp behind hand - held flares declaring our occupation of the freeway , inmates in the adjacent jail pounded on their cell windows in excitement .
Later , after the police beatings , as we sat in cuffs on the other side of the freeway , yuppies held a sign in the windows of their condominiums reading “ Fuck U Protesters , ” as commuters who were stuck in traffic honked and cheered for us .
For a few hours we substantially disrupted commerce ; shipments of products were delayed and crowds at local shopping malls dwindled .
On the day - to - day we do n’t , in any tangible way , have any sway over the systems that rule our lives .
We had many slogans and ideas in each of our individual brains from all the speeches and banners having to do with fee hikes , demands to Sacramento , blah blah .
But underneath all of our different reasons we could formulate for media quotes and skeptical friends was a desire to exercise some sort of power over a system that we really have no control over .
For those of us who are not students , those who labour in the service industry , who live precariously on welfare benefits , who share overcrowded rooms , who ca n’t pay the rent and are months behind on the utilities , for those of us who are told everyday that we are nothing , taking over the highway was an assertion of our collective power .
It is unlikely that anything we have ever done has had as great an effect on our surroundings .
The sight of miles of traffic brought to a standstill was an indication of a true , if fleeting , glimpse of the havoc we are capable of .
As has been echoed many times since the fall of 2008 , we are not making this shit up : We Are The Crisis .
Each action brings another inspiration and another lesson .
The highway takeover was not perfect by any stretch of the imagination .
We sat in our jail cells shaking our heads asking ourselves and others why we decided to march on the 880 .
Some of us felt pressure to connect the action to the education budget crisis .
Some of us felt like it was a huge tactical error to enter onto a freeway overpass without escape routes .
But somehow , despite these apprehensions and valid concerns , we decided to go anyway .
This is a message to affirm and congratulate that instinct that forced our feet forward to shut down a major artery of the bay area .
Next time we will strike when it is even more unexpected ; when the state is not prepared .
We will choose terrain that is to our tactical advantage and not allow ourselves to be so caught up in symbolic locations .
We will continue to wait long hours outside of jail houses and in courtrooms for each other .
In each action we take we gain confidence in the power we have together .
Soon we will be unfuckwithable .
During a police charge on the 880 , 15 year - old Francois Zimany fell from the 25 foot high overpass , sustaining fractures to his skull , pelvis , and wrist .
Initial reports suggested that he was pushed by police officers , newer information indicates that he most likely fell trying to escape arrest .
In either situation , we hold the Oakland Police Department responsible for his injuries .
Francois , we do n’t know you , but we love you .
We are comrades for life .

“ Se dieron con todo … y aki afuerita de la escuela !!!
Estoy en un lado haciendo un proyecto y hasta temblaba todo el pedo con las granadas ” , escribió JAP , estudiante del Tec de Monterrey , en su página de Facebook a las 2:04 de la madrugada del viernes .
“ Ya está el ejército en el Campus ! ” , alertó DOT a las 2:33 .
“ Estamos en las residencias y desde aquí estomas viendo todo , por favor compañeros no salgan de sus cuartos ” , suplicó Dulce a las 2:54 .
“ Los soldados siguen dentro del tec nadie sale .
se escuchan balas nuevamente ” , describió otro a las 5:12 en Twitter .
Se le está complicando demasiado al Presidente .
No hay ninguna evidencia de que su gobierno vaya ganando la guerra contra el crimen y cada vez más la sociedad está pagando una cuota de pánico y sangre que no parece estar dispuesta a pagar en lugar de los criminales .
Ya se desgastó ese discurso de que los niveles de violencia son fruto de la “ desesperada reacción ” de los narcos ante el ataque oficial .
Lucen demasiado frecuentes las muertes de ciudadanos limpios que desvanecen eso de que se matan “ entre ellos ” .
Los asesinatos de 16 jóvenes en Juárez y dos estudiantes regios de excelencia exhiben la estrategia oficial — primero federal , luego estatal — de intentar volver sicarios a los inocentes que caen en medio de las batallas .
La sociedad está impaciente , con la incertidumbre del “ hacia dónde vamos ” .
¿ Seguirán las encuestas mostrando apoyo social a la estrategia presidencial ?
En los medios de comunicación y sobre todo en las redes sociales de internet los relatos de terror despiertan la solidaridad pública y contradicen el panorama triunfalista de “ vamos ganado la guerra ” : Reynosa , Matamoros , Nuevo Laredo , Chihuahua , Ciudad Juárez , Monterrey , Acapulco , Torreón , Culiacán , Apatzingán , Uruapan y Lázaro Cárdenas son “ ciudades fallidas ” por el dominio de los cárteles .
Cómo estará el asunto que el otro día se escuchó decir a un taxista de Tijuana : “ con verlos a ellos , hasta aquí ya nos sentimos seguros ” .
Camino al estado de sitio van Veracruz , Tepic , Mexicali , Durango , Zacatecas , Saltillo , Gómez Palacio , Villahermosa .
Cuando en diciembre de 2006 el presidente anunció el plausible deseo de frenar a los cárteles y delineó su estrategia , planteó tres objetivos : recuperar todos los territorios en poder del narco , hacer las policías confiables y reducir el consumo de droga en México .
Ninguno se ha cumplido .
P.D. Este reportero no se cansará de insistir : mientras no haya combate financiero al narcotráfico , no habrá combate al narcotráfico .
Y las autoridades hacendarias siguen sin coordinarse con las de seguridad .

New York ( CNN ) --
The man who rescued an 11 - year - old girl lost in a dense Florida swamp said Wednesday that God led him directly to her and that finding her was no surprise .
James
King said he set out on his own to look for Nadia Bloom on Tuesday , trusting that he was going in the right direction even when that meant through water or dense brush .
" I was expecting to hear her voice , " King told CNN .
" So I 'm yelling , ' Nadia ! ' and at one point , I yell , ' Nadia ! ' and I hear ' What ? '
And I said that way -- right there . "
Tanya Bloom , Nadia 's mother , said later Wednesday that the family is " so fortunate God used him to bring her back . "
" She 's doing remarkably well , " Bloom said .
" She has swollen feet and lots of bug bites and scratches , but she 's doing great . "
Dr. Mary Farrell , who treated the girl when she arrived at the hospital , said that Nadia was in good shape but that she would remain hospitalized a little longer because of a bacterial infection .
" When she got here , she was a little bit dehydrated but she had been resuscitated pretty well , " Farrell said , " and she looked remarkably well considering she had been out for four and half days . "
King said he was surprised at the good shape Nadia was in .
She had been missing since Friday .
Shoeless and covered in insect bites , she was in otherwise good condition , he said .
" She was not panicked .
She looked like she had been sitting there , waiting on me , " he said .
The two of them then stayed in the swamp , near Lake Jesup in central Florida , while King called authorities .
When he got hold of the 911 dispatcher , he put Nadia on the phone .
" Hi . This is Nadia .
I 'm the girl who got lost , " came the little girl 's voice .
King said it took him " two hours of rough time " trekking through the swamp to find Nadia .
He said he figures it took Nadia just as long to reach the same spot .
She told King that she had gone on a nature walk and simply got lost .
" We are so , so grateful , " Nadia 's father , Jeff Bloom , said .
" I can't even express how we felt when she was found -- beyond words . "
The swamp was so dense , King said , that the rescuers who carried Nadia out on a black cloth stretcher Tuesday had to use machetes to cut through the brush , bushes and trees .
" I see it as an answer to a lot of people 's prayers , " King told CNN .
" I 'm just very thankful , I 'm thankful that God used me as a part of it to be able to find her .
It 's definitely a miracle .
" I did n't know where she was .
The only person who knew where she was was God , and I asked him and he led me directly to her , straight -- well , as straight as you can go through the swamp . "
King said he prayed the whole time he was searching , even when it seemed like he was going in the wrong direction .
In one case , he said , there was water all around and he did n't know where to go .
" He said , ' Go that way . '
And I 'm looking at water .
I said , ' Lord , are you sure ? '
He said .
' I got ya . '
And as soon as I start walking , the ground under the water is solid .
It 's only about a foot and a half deep .
He took care of me all the way there . "
The disappearance of Nadia , described as mildly autistic , had sparked an Amber Alert that was canceled when King found her .
Both King and Nadia 's family at one time attended the same church , Metro Church in Winter Springs , Florida , but they did n't know one another -- though King said Nadia did seem to register him as a friendly face when she was found .
The church held an open - air thanksgiving service to celebrate Nadia 's return Tuesday evening .
" Give the glory to God , " Nadia 's father told reporters after seeing his daughter Tuesday .
King had brought trail mix and drinks to give to Nadia if he found her , but he also brought another important item -- toilet paper .
The swamp vegetation was so thick that the helicopter that came to retrieve Nadia and King could n't see them on the ground .
King said he heard the chopper overhead and tried to give the dispatcher directions for the pilot , but it still did n't work .
" I had brought toilet paper for signaling , and so I covered the top of a couple of bushes that were in more of an open area than I was in , " King told CNN .
" They still had a hard time finding me , but I used that on the top ( of the bushes ) and they finally were able to locate it . "
Authorities questioned King after they got to safety , something King said was unexpected but understandable , especially given his ability to find Nadia so quickly .
" They also have a job to do , " he said .
" They have a responsibility to the community to make sure there is no foul play .
And so I understand that , I understood it completely . "
Coming out of the swamp was a blur with lots of hugs and praise , King said .
He said he hopes to be able to see the Bloom family again , and that Nadia even hinted he'd be welcome : " She said she might invite me to her pizza party . "
There must be urgent changes to the way foreign doctors working shifts in the NHS are vetted , senior MPs said today .
In a highly critical report , the health select committee warned that NHS trusts " were not doing their jobs " by failing to check language and medical skills .
It pointed out that no disciplinary action had been taken against an NHS body that did not check the language skills of German doctor Daniel Ubani , who unlawfully killed a patient on his first shift in Britain .
Seventy - year - old David Gray was accidently given ten times the normal dose of diamorphine .
In evidence to the committee last month , the General Medical Council 's ( GMC ) chief executive , Niall Dickson , said there was a " gaping hole " in the registration system for doctors coming from the European Union .
The report said : " If the GMC had been able to check the language skills and clinical competence of EEA doctors wishing to practise as GPs , lives might have been saved .
There is a difference of legal opinion between the Department of Health and the GMC .
We recommend that , without delay , the Department and the Council share their legal advice about the legality of amending the Medical Act 1983 . "
Over the last 20 years , 2°C has been referenced in climate policies and agreements made by the Council of the European Union , the G8 ( now the G7 ) , and more .
So what makes two degrees so important ?
A street in Windermere is causing motorists grief because for some unexplained reason car remote controls and similar devices will not work when they park there .
Ed Roberts reports .
Vancouver International Airport has been named the best airport in North America after a UK - based research company surveyed 9.8 million airline passengers worldwide .
The airport also placed 11th on Skytrax 's top 25 worldwide airport rankings .
It was one of only two North American airports to make the list , the second being San Francisco 's airport in 20th place .
Passengers got to nominate an airport for the best airport award and rate the experience in 39 different categories .
Some of the categories included questions about airport staff , such as attitude and language skills , and accessibility , such as public transportation options , taxi availability and prices , and disabled persons access .
Skytrax conducted the World Airport Survey and polled passengers through in - person interviews , telephone interviews , and online questionnaires from July 2009 - March 2010 .
Anne Murray , vice president of YVR's Community and Environmental Affairs , told ctvbc.ca that YVR has worked hard to ensure these areas are well developed .
She said the airport has a strong focus on customer care and service , and is designed for accessibility , both in architecture and in being connected to the Canada Line .
The airport is also well designed for disabled persons and includes wheelchair - friendly floors , curbside ramps , Braille throughout for the visually impaired , and volume - controllable handsets at check - in counters for the hearing - impaired .
" We have been putting in a huge amount of work , " she said .
YVR has placed in the top three for the World Airport Awards ' Best North American Airports category for the past three years , placing second in 2008 and third in 2009 .
The World 's Best Airport Award went to Singapore Changi Airport , which also won the awards for Best Airport Leisure Amenities and Best Asian Airport .
Morris “ Dick ” Jeppson , a weapons specialist who was mid-flight when he completed arming the first atomic bomb , which the Enola Gay B - 29 Superfortress dropped on Hiroshima in World War II , has died .
He was 87 .
Jeppson , a retired scientist and businessman , died March 30 of complications related to old age at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas , said his wife , Molly .
The historic combat mission on Aug. 6 , 1945 , was the only one Jeppson ever flew .
Worried about his family ’s safety , he remained silent for decades about his role in the attack that killed at least 80,000 people , leveled two - thirds of the Japanese city and ignited controversy for having unleashed atomic power as a weapon .

When the Army Air Forces unit that flew the mission gathered in 1995 , Jeppson attended and spoke in public about the bombing for the first time .
“ You had a job to do , you just did it , ” Jeppson had often said since then .
The mission is credited with helping to bring an early end to the war .
Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima , another B - 29 dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki , prompting the Japanese surrender .
Navigator Theodore “ Dutch ” Van Kirk , 89 , the only surviving member of the 12 - man Enola Gay crew , told The Times that Jeppson was “ quiet , efficient and businesslike ” during the mission .
“ He was n’t the type of guy to blow his own horn . ”
Advertisement
Jeppson , one of several men trained to arm the bomb , was a 23 - year - old second lieutenant when he was chosen to climb into the bomb bay on a coin toss .
With him was weaponeer Navy Capt .
William “ Deak ” Parsons .
Together they began arming the bomb with Jeppson acting as assistant , handing over tools .
“ They did that very early in the mission , in the first half hour , ” said Dick Daso , curator of Modern Military Aircraft at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum .
“ After that , they had to come inside the cabin because the bomb bay was n’t pressurized . ”
A few hours later , Jeppson made a final visit to the bay to change out three green safety plugs -- each “ the size of a saltshaker , ” he later said -- for the red plugs that armed the bomb .
Advertisement
He made his way to the cockpit and told the plane ’s pilot , Col. Paul W. Tibbets Jr. , that the bomb called “ Little Boy ” was set to go .
Once Jeppson felt the B - 29 jerk up , he knew the bomb had been dropped .
“ People were looking down and seeing this enormous cloud coming up and the destruction spreading , ” Jeppson told Time magazine in 2005 .
“ And that ’s the point that it ’s somber because you know a lot of people are getting destroyed down there in the city . ”
After the 12 - plus - hour flight , the plane returned to Tinian Island in the Pacific , where Jeppson was unexpectedly greeted by a good friend who was a Navy lieutenant .
They were sharing dinner when a Navy officer asked Jeppson , “ What did you do today ? ” he recounted in Time .
“ I said , ‘ I think we ended the war today . ’ ”

Morris Richard Jeppson was born June 23 , 1922 , in Logan , Utah , one of three sons of Robert and Elsie Jeppson .
While he was growing up in Carson City , Nev. , his father worked in agricultural education for the state .
At 19 , Jeppson joined the military and was part of a group that spent 10 months studying engineering and radar at Yale and Harvard universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
With several others , he was assigned to remote Wendover , Utah , and the 509th Composite Group .
It was the first military unit formed to wage nuclear war .
At the end of the Enola Gay mission , Jeppson kept a few of the plugs that signified his role in the bombing .
When he sold two of them for $ 167,500 at auction in 2002 , the federal government claimed they were classified material and tried , but failed , to block the sale .

After the war , Jeppson studied toward a doctorate in physics at UC Berkeley , working at its radiation laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore laboratory .
He also founded a number of companies , including Applied Radiation Corp. , which built electron - beam accelerators for nuclear physics research , and Cryodry Corp. , a maker of industrial microwave ovens .
A longtime resident of Carmel , Calif. , he retired to Las Vegas 20 years ago .
In addition to Molly , his wife of 48 years , Jeppson is survived by a brother , four daughters , two sons , 11 grandchildren and 10 great - grandchildren .

What the Terrorists Want
On August 16 , two men were escorted off a plane headed for Manchester , England , because some passengers thought they looked either Asian or Middle Eastern , might have been talking Arabic , wore leather jackets , and looked at their watches — and the passengers refused to fly with them on board .
The men were questioned for several hours and then released .
On August 15 , an entire airport terminal was evacuated because someone ’s cosmetics triggered a false positive for explosives .
The same day , a Muslim man was removed from an airplane in Denver for reciting prayers .
The Transportation Security Administration decided that the flight crew overreacted , but he still had to spend the night in Denver before flying home the next day .
The next day , a Port of Seattle terminal was evacuated because a couple of dogs gave a false alarm for explosives .
On August 19 , a plane made an emergency landing in Tampa , Florida , after the crew became suspicious because two of the lavatory doors were locked .
The plane was searched , but nothing was found .
Meanwhile , a man who tampered with a bathroom smoke detector on a flight to San Antonio was cleared of terrorism , but only after having his house searched .
On August 16 , a woman suffered a panic attack and became violent on a flight from London to Washington , so the plane was escorted to the Boston airport by fighter jets .
“ The woman was carrying hand cream and matches but was not a terrorist threat , ” said the TSA spokesman after the incident .
And on August 18 , a plane flying from London to Egypt made an emergency landing in Italy when someone found a bomb threat scrawled on an air sickness bag .
Nothing was found on the plane , and no one knows how long the note was on board .
I ’d like everyone to take a deep breath and listen for a minute .
The point of terrorism is to cause terror , sometimes to further a political goal and sometimes out of sheer hatred .
The people terrorists kill are not the targets ; they are collateral damage .
And blowing up planes , trains , markets , or buses is not the goal ; those are just tactics .
The real targets of terrorism are the rest of us : the billions of us who are not killed but are terrorized because of the killing .
The real point of terrorism is not the act itself , but our reaction to the act .
And we ’re doing exactly what the terrorists want .
We ’re all a little jumpy after the recent arrest of 23 terror suspects in Great Britain .
The men were reportedly plotting a liquid - explosive attack on airplanes , and both the press and politicians have been trumpeting the story ever since .
In truth , it ’s doubtful that their plan would have succeeded ; chemists have been debunking the idea since it became public .
Certainly the suspects were a long way off from trying :
None had bought airline tickets , and some did n’t even have passports .
Regardless of the threat , from the would - be bombers ’ perspective , the explosives and planes were merely tactics .
Their goal was to cause terror , and in that they ’ve succeeded .
Imagine for a moment what would have happened if they had blown up ten planes .
There would be canceled flights , chaos at airports , bans on carry - on luggage , world leaders talking tough new security measures , political posturing and all sorts of false alarms as jittery people panicked .
To a lesser degree , that ’s basically what ’s happening right now .
Our politicians help the terrorists every time they use fear as a campaign tactic .
The press helps every time it writes scare stories about the plot and the threat .
And if we ’re terrified , and we share that fear , we help .
All of these actions intensify and repeat the terrorists ’ actions , and increase the effects of their terror .
( I am not saying that the politicians and press are terrorists , or that they share any of the blame for terrorist attacks .
I ’m not that stupid .
But the subject of terrorism is more complex than it appears , and understanding its various causes and effects are vital for understanding how to best deal with it . )
The implausible plots and false alarms actually hurt us in two ways .
Not only do they increase the level of fear , but they also waste time and resources that could be better spent fighting the real threats and increasing actual security .
I ’ll bet the terrorists are laughing at us .
Another thought experiment : Imagine for a moment that the British government arrested the 23 suspects without fanfare .
Imagine that the TSA and its European counterparts did n’t engage in pointless airline security measures like banning liquids .
And imagine that the press did n’t write about it endlessly , and that the politicians did n’t use the event to remind us all how scared we should be .
If we ’d reacted that way , then the terrorists would have truly failed .
It ’s time we calm down and fight terror with anti-terror .
This does not mean that we simply roll over and accept terrorism .
There are things our government can and should do to fight terrorism , most of them involving intelligence and investigation — and not focusing on specific plots .
But our job is to remain steadfast in the face of terror , to refuse to be terrorized .
Our job is to not panic every time two Muslims stand together checking their watches .
There are approximately 1 billion Muslims in the world , a large percentage of them not Arab , and about 320 million Arabs in the Middle East , the overwhelming majority of them not terrorists .
Our job is to think critically and rationally , and to ignore the cacophony of other interests trying to use terrorism to advance political careers or increase a television show ’s viewership .
The surest defense against terrorism is to refuse to be terrorized .
Our job is to recognize that terrorism is just one of the risks we face , and not a particularly common one at that .
And our job is to fight those politicians who use fear as an excuse to take away our liberties and promote security theater that wastes money and does n’t make us any safer .

This essay originally appeared in Wired :

Details on the British Terrorist Arrest
Details are emerging :
* There was some serious cash flow from someone , presumably someone abroad .
* There was no imminent threat .
* However , the threat was real .
And it seems pretty clear that it would have bypassed all existing airport security systems .
* The conspirators were radicalized by the war in Iraq , although it is impossible to say whether they would have been otherwise radicalized without it .
* They were caught through police work , not through any broad surveillance , and were under surveillance for more than a year .
What pisses me off most is the second item .
By arresting the conspirators early , the police squandered the chance to learn more about the network and arrest more of them — and to present a less flimsy case .
There have been many news reports detailing how the U.S. pressured the UK government to make the arrests sooner , possibly out of political motivations .
( And then Scotland Yard got annoyed at the U.S. leaking plot details to the press , hampering their case . )
I still think that all of the new airline security measures are an overreaction .
As I said on a radio interview a couple of weeks ago : “ We ban guns and knives , and the terrorists use box cutters .
We ban box cutters and corkscrews , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
We screen shoes , and the terrorists use liquids .
We ban liquids , and the terrorist will use something else .
It ’s not a fair game , because the terrorists get to see our security measures before they plan their attack . ”
And it ’s not a game we can win .
So let ’s stop playing , and play a game we actually can win .
The real lesson of the London arrests is that investigation and intelligence work .

My initial comments on the arrests :
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/…
More Than 10 Ways to Avoid the Next 9/11
On 10 September 2006 , the New York Times published a feature called “ Ten Ways to Avoid the Next 9/11 ” : “ The Op - Ed page asked 10 people with experience in security and counterterrorism to answer the following question :
What is one major reason the United States has not suffered a major attack since 2001 , and what is the one thing you would recommend the nation do in order to avoid attacks in the future ? ”
Actually , they asked more than 10 , myself included .
But some of us were cut because they did n’t have enough space .
This was my essay :
Despite what you see in the movies and on television , it ’s actually very difficult to execute a major terrorist act .
It ’s hard to organize , plan , and execute an attack , and it ’s all too easy to slip up and get caught .
Combine that with our intelligence work tracking terrorist cells and interdicting terrorist funding , and you have a climate where major attacks are rare .
In many ways , the success of 9/11 was an anomaly ; there were many points where it could have failed .
The main reason we have n’t seen another 9/11 is that it is n’t as easy as it looks .
Much of our counterterrorist efforts are nothing more than security theater : ineffectual measures that look good .
Forget the war on terror ; the difficulty is n’t killing or arresting the terrorists , it ’s finding them .
Terrorism is a law enforcement problem , and needs to be treated as such .
For example , none of our post - 9/11 airline security measures would have stopped the London shampoo bombers .
The lesson of London is that our best defense is intelligence and investigation .
Rather than spending money on airline security , or sports stadium security — measures that require us to guess the plot correctly in order to be effective — we ’re better off spending money on measures that are effective regardless of the plot .
Intelligence and investigation have kept us safe from terrorism in the past , and will continue to do so in the future .
If the CIA and FBI had done a better job of coordinating and sharing data in 2001 , 9/11 would have been another failed attempt .
Coordination has gotten better , and those agencies are better funded — but it ’s still not enough .
Whenever you read about the billions being spent on national ID cards or massive data mining programs or new airport security measures , think about the number of intelligence agents that the same money could buy .
That ’s where we ’re going to see the greatest return on our security investment .

Educating Users
I ’ve met users , and they ’re not fluent in security .
They might be fluent in spreadsheets , eBay , or sending jokes over e-mail , but they ’re not technologists , let alone security people .
Of course they ’re making all sorts of security mistakes .
I too have tried educating users , and I agree that it ’s largely futile .
Part of the problem is generational .
We ’ve seen this with all sorts of technologies : electricity , telephones , microwave ovens , VCRs , video games .
Older generations approach newfangled technologies with trepidation , distrust , and confusion , while the children who grew up with them understand them intuitively .
But while the don’t - get - it generation will die off eventually , we wo n’t suddenly enter an era of unprecedented computer security .
Technology moves too fast these days ; there ’s no time for any generation to become fluent in anything .
Earlier this year , researchers ran an experiment in London ’s financial district .
Someone stood on a street corner and handed out CDs , saying they were a “ special Valentine ’s Day promotion . ”
Many people , some working at sensitive bank workstations , ran the program on the CDs on their work computers .
The program was benign — all it did was alert some computer on the Internet that it was running — but it could just have easily been malicious .
The researchers concluded that users do n’t care about security .
That ’s simply not true .
Users care about security — they just do n’t understand it .
I do n’t see a failure of education ; I see a failure of technology .
It should n’t have been possible for those users to run that CD , or for a random program stuffed into a banking computer to “ phone home ” across the Internet .
The real problem is that computers do n’t work well .
The industry has convinced everyone that people need a computer to survive , and at the same time it ’s made computers so complicated that only an expert can maintain them .
If I try to repair my home heating system , I ’m likely to break all sorts of safety rules .
I have no experience in that sort of thing , and honestly , there ’s no point in trying to educate me .
But the heating system works fine without my having to learn anything about it .
I know how to set my thermostat and to call a professional if anything goes wrong .
Punishment is n’t something you do instead of education ; it ’s a form of education — a very primal form of education best suited to children and animals ( and experts are n’t so sure about children ) .
I say we stop punishing people for failures of technology , and demand that computer companies market secure hardware and software .

Human / Bear Security Trade - Off
I like this example from SlashDot : “ Back in the 1980s , Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem with bears :
They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage bins .
This put both bears and people at risk .
So the Park Service started installing armored garbage cans that were tricky to open — you had to swing a latch , align two bits of handle , that sort of thing .
But it turns out it ’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans just right .
Make it * too* complex and people ca n’t get them open to put away their garbage in the first place .
Said one park ranger , ‘ There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists . ' ”
It ’s a tough balance to strike .
People are smart , but they ’re impatient and unwilling to spend a lot of time solving the problem .
Bears are dumb , but they ’re tenacious and are willing to spend hours solving the problem .
Given those two constraints , creating a trash can that can both work for people and not work for bears is not easy .

Land Title Fraud
There seems to be a small epidemic of land title fraud in Ontario , Canada .
What happens is someone impersonates the homeowner , and then sells the house out from under him .
The former owner is still liable for the mortgage , but ca n’t get in his former house .
Cleaning up the problem takes a lot of time and energy .
The problem is one of economic incentives .
If banks were held liable for fraudulent mortgages , then the problem would go away really quickly .
But as long as they ’re not , they have no incentive to ensure that this fraud does n’t occur .
( They have some incentive , because the fraud costs them money , but as long as the few fraud cases cost less than ensuring the validity of * every * mortgage , they ’ll just ignore the problem and eat the losses when fraud occurs . )

Kobi Alexander fled the United States ten days ago .
He was tracked down in Sri Lanka via a Skype call .
Ars Technica explains :
“ The fugitive former CEO may have been convinced that using Skype made him safe from tracking , but he — and everyone else that believes VoIP is inherently more secure than a landline — was wrong .
Tracking anonymous peer - to - peer VoIP traffic over the Internet is possible .
In fact , it can be done even if the parties have taken some steps to disguise the traffic . ”
Let this be a warning to all of you who thought Skype was anonymous .

Is There Strategic Software ?
If you define “ critical infrastructure ” as “ things essential for the functioning of a society and economy , ” then software is critical infrastructure .
For many companies and individuals , if their computers stop working , they stop working .
It ’s a situation that snuck up on us .
Everyone knew that the software that flies 747s or targets cruise missiles was critical , but who thought of the airlines ’ weight and balance computers , or the operating system running the databases and spreadsheets that determine which cruise missiles get shipped where ?
And over the years , common , off - the - shelf , personal - and business - grade software has been used for more and more critical applications .
Today we find ourselves in a situation where a well - positioned flaw in Windows , Cisco routers or Apache could seriously affect the economy .
It ’s perfectly rational to assume that some programmers — a tiny minority I ’m sure — are deliberately adding vulnerabilities and back doors into the code they write .
I ’m actually kind of amazed that back doors secretly added by the CIA / NSA , MI5 , the Chinese , Mossad and others do n’t conflict with each other .
Even if these groups are n’t infiltrating software companies with back doors , you can be sure they ’re scouring products for vulnerabilities they can exploit , if necessary .
On the other hand , we ’re already living in a world where dozens of new flaws are discovered in common software products weekly , and the economy is humming along .
But we ’re not talking about this month ’s worm from Asia or new phishing software from the Russian mafia — we ’re talking national intelligence organizations .
“ Infowar ” is an overhyped term , but the next war will have a cyberspace component , and these organizations would n’t be doing their jobs if they were n’t preparing for it .
Marcus is 100 percent correct when he says it ’s simply too late to do anything about it .
The software industry is international , and no country can start demanding domestic - only software and expect to get anywhere .
Nor would that actually solve the problem , which is more about the allegiance of millions of individual programmers than which country they happen to inhabit .
So , what to do ?
The key here is to remember the real problem : current commercial software practices are not secure enough to reliably detect and delete deliberately inserted malicious code .
Once you understand this , you ’ll drop the red herring arguments that led to CheckPoint not being able to buy Sourcefire and concentrate on the real solution : defense in depth .
In theory , security software is an after - the - fact kludge because the underlying OS and apps are riddled with vulnerabilities .
If your software were written properly , you would n’t need a firewall — right ?
If we were to get serious about critical infrastructure , we ’d recognize it ’s all critical and start building security software to protect it .
We ’d build our security based on the principles of safe failure ; we ’d assume security would fail and make sure it ’s OK when it does .
We ’d use defense in depth and compartmentalization to minimize the effects of failure .
Basically , we ’d do everything we ’re supposed to do now to secure our networks .
It ’d be expensive , probably prohibitively so .
Maybe it would be easier to continue to ignore the problem , or at least manage geopolitics so that no national military wants to take us down .
This is the second half of a point / counterpoint I did with Marcus Ranum the September 2006 issue of “ Information Security Magazine . ”
Here ’s his half :
http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/…
Media Sanitization and Encryption
Last week NIST released Special Publication 800 - 88 , “ Guidelines for Media Sanitization . ”
There is a new paragraph in this document ( page 7 ) that was not in the draft version : “ Encryption is not a generally accepted means of sanitization .
The increasing power of computers decreases the time needed to crack cipher text and therefore the inability to recover the encrypted data can not be assured . ”
I have to admit that this does n’t make any sense to me .
If the encryption is done properly , and if the key is properly chosen , then erasing the key — and all copies — is equivalent to erasing the files .
And if you ’re using full - disk encryption , then erasing the key is equivalent to sanitizing the drive .
For that not to be true means that the encryption program is n’t secure .
I think NIST is just confused .
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/#sp800-88
What is a Hacker ?
A hacker is someone who thinks outside the box .
It ’s someone who discards conventional wisdom , and does something else instead .
It ’s someone who looks at the edge and wonders what ’s beyond .
It ’s someone who sees a set of rules and wonders what happens if you do n’t follow them .
A hacker is someone who experiments with the limitations of systems for intellectual curiosity .
I wrote that last sentence in the year 2000 , in my book “ Beyond Fear . ”
And I ’m sticking to that definition .
This is what else I wrote in “ Beyond Fear ” :
“ Hackers are as old as curiosity , although the term itself is modern .
Galileo was a hacker .
Mme .
Curie was one , too .
Aristotle was n’t .
( Aristotle had some theoretical proof that women had fewer teeth than men .
A hacker would have simply counted his wife ’s teeth .
A good hacker would have counted his wife ’s teeth without her knowing about it , while she was asleep .
A good bad hacker might remove some of them , just to prove a point . )
“ When I was in college , I knew a group similar to hackers : the key freaks .
They wanted access , and their goal was to have a key to every lock on campus .
They would study lockpicking and learn new techniques , trade maps of the steam tunnels and where they led , and exchange copies of keys with each other .
A locked door was a challenge , a personal affront to their ability .
These people were n’t out to do damage — stealing stuff was n’t their objective — although they certainly could have .
Their hobby was the power to go anywhere they wanted to .
“ Remember the phone phreaks of yesteryear , the ones who could whistle into payphones and make free phone calls .
Sure , they stole phone service .
But it was n’t like they needed to make eight - hour calls to Manila or McMurdo .
And their real work was secret knowledge :
The phone network was a vast maze of information .
They wanted to know the system better than the designers , and they wanted the ability to modify it to their will .
Understanding how the phone system worked — that was the true prize .
Other early hackers were ham - radio hobbyists and model - train enthusiasts .
“ Richard Feynman was a hacker ; read any of his books .
“ Computer hackers follow these evolutionary lines .
Or , they are the same genus operating on a new system .
Computers , and networks in particular , are the new landscape to be explored .
Networks provide the ultimate maze of steam tunnels , where a new hacking technique becomes a key that can open computer after computer .
And inside is knowledge , understanding .
Access .
How things work .
Why things work .
It ’s all out there , waiting to be discovered . ”
Computers are the perfect playground for hackers .
Computers , and computer networks , are vast treasure troves of secret knowledge .
The Internet is an immense landscape of undiscovered information .
The more you know , the more you can do .
And it should be no surprise that many hackers have focused their skills on computer security .
Not only is it often the obstacle between the hacker and knowledge , and therefore something to be defeated , but also the very mindset necessary to be good at security is exactly the same mindset that hackers have : thinking outside the box , breaking the rules , exploring the limitations of a system .
The easiest way to break a security system is to figure out what the system ’s designers had n’t thought of : that ’s security hacking .
Hackers cheat .
And breaking security regularly involves cheating .
It ’s figuring out a smart card ’s RSA key by looking at the power fluctuations , because the designers of the card never realized anyone could do that .
It ’s self - signing a piece of code , because the signature - verification system did n’t think someone might try that .
It ’s using a piece of a protocol to break a completely different protocol , because all previous security analysis only looked at protocols individually and not in pairs .
That ’s security hacking : breaking a system by thinking differently .
It all sounds criminal : recovering encrypted text , fooling signature algorithms , breaking protocols .
But honestly , that ’s just the way we security people talk .
Hacking is n’t criminal .
All the examples two paragraphs above were performed by respected security professionals , and all were presented at security conferences .
I remember one conversation I had at a Crypto conference , early in my career .
It was outside amongst the jumbo shrimp , chocolate - covered strawberries , and other delectables .
A bunch of us were talking about some cryptographic system , including Brian Snow of the NSA .
Someone described an unconventional attack , one that did n’t follow the normal rules of cryptanalysis .
I do n’t remember any of the details , but I remember my response after hearing the description of the attack .
“ That ’s cheating , ” I said .
Because it was .
I also remember Brian turning to look at me .
He did n’t say anything , but his look conveyed everything .
“ There ’s no such thing as cheating in this business . ”
Because there is n’t .
Hacking is cheating , and it ’s how we get better at security .
It ’s only after someone invents a new attack that the rest of us can figure out how to defend against it .
For years I have refused to play the semantic “ hacker ” vs. “ cracker ” game .
There are good hackers and bad hackers , just as there are good electricians and bad electricians .
“ Hacker ” is a mindset and a skill set ; what you do with it is a different issue .
And I believe the best computer security experts have the hacker mindset .
When I look to hire people , I look for someone who ca n’t walk into a store without figuring out how to shoplift .
I look for someone who ca n’t test a computer security program without trying to get around it .
I look for someone who , when told that things work in a particular way , immediately asks how things stop working if you do something else .
We need these people in security , and we need them on our side .
Criminals are always trying to figure out how to break security systems .
Field a new system — an ATM , an online banking system , a gambling machine — and criminals will try to make an illegal profit off it .
They ’ll figure it out eventually , because some hackers are also criminals .
But if we have hackers working for us , they ’ll figure it out first — and then we can defend ourselves .
It ’s our only hope for security in this fast - moving technological world of ours .

Bruce Schneier Facts :
http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/
Some of these are pretty funny .
And no , I had nothing to do with it .
TrackMeNot
In the wake of AOL ’s publication of search data , and the “ New York Times ” article demonstrating how easy it is to figure out who did the searching , we have TrackMeNot :
“ TrackMeNot runs in Firefox as a low - priority background process that periodically issues randomized search - queries to popular search engines , e.g. , AOL , Yahoo ! , Google , and MSN .
It hides users ’ actual search trails in a cloud of indistinguishable ‘ ghost ’ queries , making it difficult , if not impossible , to aggregate such data into accurate or identifying user profiles .
TrackMeNot integrates into the Firefox ‘ Tools ’ menu and includes a variety of user - configurable options . ”
Let ’s count the ways this does n’t work .
One , it does n’t hide your searches .
If the government wants to know who ’s been searching on “ al Qaeda recruitment centers , ” it wo n’t matter that you ’ve made ten thousand other searches as well — you ’ll be targeted .
Two , it ’s too easy to spot .
There are only 1,673 search terms in the program ’s dictionary .
Here , as a random example , are the program ’s “ G ” words : gag , gagged , gagging , gags , gas , gaseous , gases , gassed , gasses , gassing , gen , generate , generated , generates , generating , gens , gig , gigs , gillion , gillions , glass , glasses , glitch , glitched , glitches , glitching , glob , globed , globing , globs , glue , glues , gnarlier , gnarliest , gnarly , gobble , gobbled , gobbles , gobbling , golden , goldener , goldenest , gonk , gonked , gonking , gonks , gonzo , gopher , gophers , gorp , gorps , gotcha , gotchas , gribble , gribbles , grind , grinding , grinds , grok , grokked , grokking , groks , ground , grovel , groveled , groveling , grovelled , grovelling , grovels , grue , grues , grunge , grunges , gun , gunned , gunning , guns , guru , gurus
The program ’s authors claim that this list is temporary , and that there will eventually be a TrackMeNot server with an ever - changing word list .
Of course , that list can be monitored by any analysis program — as could any queries to that server .
In any case , every twelve seconds — exactly — the program picks a random pair of words and sends it to either AOL , Yahoo , MSN , or Google .
My guess is that your searches contain more than two words , you do n’t send them out in precise twelve - second intervals , and you favor one search engine over the others .
Three , some of the program ’s searches are worse than yours .
The dictionary includes : HIV , atomic , bomb , bible , bibles , bombing , bombs , boxes , choke , choked , chokes , choking , chain , crackers , empire , evil , erotics , erotices , fingers , knobs , kicking , harier , hamster , hairs , legal , letterbomb , letterbombs , mailbomb , mailbombing , mailbombs , rapes , raping , rape , raper , rapist , virgin , warez , warezes , whack , whacked , whacker , whacking , whackers , whacks , pistols
Does anyone really think that searches on “ erotic rape , ” “ mailbombing bibles , ” and “ choking virgins ” will make their legitimate searches less noteworthy ?
And four , it wastes a whole lot of bandwidth .
A query every twelve seconds translates into 2,400 queries a day , assuming an eight - hour workday .
A typical Google response is about 25 K , so we ’re talking 60 megabytes of additional traffic daily .
Imagine if everyone in the company used it .
I suppose this kind of thing would stop someone who has a paper printout of your searches and is looking through them manually , but it ’s not going to hamper computer analysis very much .
Or anyone who is n’t lazy .
But it would n’t be hard for a computer profiling program to ignore these searches .
As one commentator put it : “ Imagine a cop pulls you over for speeding .
As he approaches , you realize you left your wallet at home .
Without your driver ’s license , you could be in a lot of trouble .
When he approaches , you roll down your window and shout .
“ Hello Officer !
I do n’t have insurance on this vehicle !
This car is stolen !
I have weed in my glovebox !
I do n’t have my driver ’s license !
I just hit an old lady minutes ago !
I ’ve been running stop lights all morning !
I have a dead body in my trunk !
This car does n’t pass the emissions tests !
I ’m not allowed to drive because I am under house arrest !
My gas tank runs on the blood of children ! ”
You stop to catch a breath , confident you have supplied so much information to the cop that you ca n’t possibly be caught for not having your license now . ”
Yes , data mining is a signal - to - noise problem .
But artificial noise like this is n’t going to help much .
If I were going to improve on this idea , I would make the plugin watch the user ’s search patterns .
I would make it send queries only to the search engines the user does , only when he is actually online doing things .
I would randomize the timing .
( There ’s a comment to that effect in the code , so presumably this will be fixed in a later version of the program . )
And I would make it monitor the web pages the user looks at , and send queries based on keywords it finds on those pages .
And I would make it send queries in the form the user tends to use , whether it be single words , pairs of words , or whatever .
But honestly , I do n’t know that I would use it even then .
The way serious people protect their web - searching privacy is through anonymization .
Use Tor for serious web anonymization .
Or Black Box Search for simple anonymous searching ( there ’s a Greasemonkey extension that does that automatically ) .
And set your browser to delete search engine cookies regularly .

USBDumper
USBDumper is a cute little utility that silently copies the contents of an inserted USB drive onto the PC .
The idea is that you install this piece of software on your computer , or on a public PC , and then you collect the files — some of them personal and confidential — from anyone who plugs his USB drive into that computer .
( There ’s a similar program that downloads a disk image , allowing someone to recover deleted files as well . )
No big deal to anyone who worries about computer security for a living , but probably a rude shock to salespeople , conference presenters , file sharers , and many others who regularly plug their USB drives into strange PCs .

Microsoft and FairUse4WM
If you really want to see Microsoft scramble to patch a hole in its software , do n’t look to vulnerabilities that impact countless Internet Explorer users or give intruders control of thousands of Windows machines .
Just crack Redmond ’s DRM .
Security patches used to be rare .
Software vendors were happy to pretend that vulnerabilities in their products were illusory — and then quietly fix the problem in the next software release .
That changed with the full disclosure movement .
Independent security researchers started going public with the holes they found , making vulnerabilities impossible for vendors to ignore .
Then worms became more common ; patching — and patching quickly — became the norm .
But even now , no software vendor likes to issue patches .
Every patch is a public admission that the company made a mistake .
Moreover , the process diverts engineering resources from new development .
Patches annoy users by making them update their software , and piss them off even more if the update does n’t work properly .
For the vendor , there ’s an economic balancing act : how much more will your users be annoyed by unpatched software than they will be by the patch , and is that reduction in annoyance worth the cost of patching ?
Since 2003 , Microsoft ’s strategy to balance these costs and benefits has been to batch patches : instead of issuing them one at a time , it ’s been issuing them all together on the second Tuesday of each month .
This decreases Microsoft ’s development costs and increases the reliability of its patches .
The user pays for this strategy by remaining open to known vulnerabilities for up to a month .
On the other hand , users benefit from a predictable schedule : Microsoft can test all the patches that are going out at the same time , which means that patches are more reliable and users are able to install them faster with more confidence .
In the absence of regulation , software liability , or some other mechanism to make unpatched software costly for the vendor , Patch Tuesday is the best users are likely to get .
Why ?
Because it makes near - term financial sense to Microsoft .
The company is not a public charity , and if the Internet suffers , or if computers are compromised * en masse* , the economic impact on Microsoft is still minimal .
Microsoft is in the business of making money , and keeping users secure by patching its software is only incidental to that goal .
There ’s no better example of this of this principle in action than Microsoft ’s behavior around the vulnerability in its digital rights management software PlaysForSure .
In August , a hacker developed an application called FairUse4WM that strips the copy protection from Windows Media DRM 10 and 11 files .
Now , this is n’t a “ vulnerability ” in the normal sense of the word : digital rights management is not a feature that users want .
Being able to remove copy protection is a good thing for some users , and completely irrelevant for everyone else .
No user is ever going to say : “ Oh no .
I can now play the music I bought for my computer in my car .
I must install a patch so I ca n’t do that anymore . ”
But to Microsoft , this vulnerability is a big deal .
It affects the company ’s relationship with major record labels .
It affects the company ’s product offerings .
It affects the company ’s bottom line .
Fixing this “ vulnerability ” is in the company ’s best interest ; never mind the customer .
So Microsoft wasted no time ; it issued a patch three days after learning about the hack .
There ’s no month - long wait for copyright holders who rely on Microsoft ’s DRM .
This clearly demonstrates that economics is a much more powerful motivator than security .
It should surprise no one that the system did n’t stay patched for long .
FairUse4WM
1.2 gets around Microsoft ’s patch , and also circumvents the copy protection in Windows Media DRM 9 and 11 bet a2 files .
And four days later , Microsoft issued another patch .
That ’s where things stand now .
Any guess on how long it will take the FairUse4WM people to update their software ?
And then how long before Microsoft to patch once again ?
Certainly much less time than it will take Microsoft and the recording industry to realize they ’re playing a losing game , and that trying to make digital files uncopyable is like trying to make water not wet .
If Microsoft abandoned this Sisyphean effort and put the same development effort into building a fast and reliable patching system , the entire Internet would benefit .
But simple economics says it probably never will .
