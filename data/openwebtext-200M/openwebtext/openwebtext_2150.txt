In another blog ( thed.a.r.k ) it was found in Mexico .
Now , although it reminds me of some of my relatives , the eyes are highly suspicious ( as are my relatives ' ) ; nice doll , though .
now if it was a mermaid i think it'd have attracted more ppl :D
The number of foreclosed homes owned by lenders continues to rise despite signs that they are increasingly willing to slash prices to sell those properties .
Lenders and investors in mortgages owned about 660,000 foreclosed homes in April , up from 493,000 in January and 231,000 in January 2007 , according to First American CoreLogic , a research firm based in Santa Ana , Calif. , that collects data from lenders and county clerks .
The April total works out to about one in seven previously occupied homes available for sale nationwide .

THIRTY miles outside town , in a wet , stunningly bleak meadow ringed by moss - draped Oregon ash , vampires are playing baseball .
They ’re decked out in a hodgepodge of vintage jerseys , caps and striped socks , presumably collected over their last century of eternal life .
They make such a racket with their supernatural abilities that they have to take the field under cover of a thunderstorm .
Catherine Hardwicke , who ’s directing the scene for her adaptation of Stephenie Meyer ’s bestselling young - adult novel “ Twilight , ” is excited about the sequence in which balls are hit with the force of cannon blasts and gravity - defying catches are the norm -- and about one gag in particular .
In it , two players “ are in competition to catch the same ball and have a huge , crazy midair collision 20 feet up in the air when a huge crash of thunder resounds , ” making it appear as though their clash created the resounding boom .
One of them also “ totally climbs up a tree crazy - style and catches a ball midair -- like way at the top of the tree .
It ’s a really fun stunt . ”
Lest anyone unfamiliar with Meyers ’ “ Twilight ” series think this is some strange “ Lost Boys ” meets “ Field of Dreams ” mash - up , the story concerns much more than baseball .
It ’s about benevolent vampires who struggle with their blood lust in much the same way teens struggle with their surging hormones .
Mostly , it concerns young , forbidden love .
And its fans ca n’t seem to get enough .
On the field , a 17 - year - old girl named Bella watches as the teams pitch and hit the ball with unnatural force .
She ’s recently figured out that the coolest kids at her school are decades - old vampires masquerading as teens .
They drink animal blood rather than human -- jokingly referring to themselves as “ vegetarians . ”
They do n’t have fangs and the sun does n’t harm them ( though it does tend to make them sparkle like Ziggy Stardust ) .
One of them -- moody , gorgeous Edward -- is the instant love of Bella ’s life .
As Bella ( Kristin Stewart ) watches the game , a nomadic trio of more traditional , human - fed vampires strides into the clearing .
One of them , James ( Cam Gigandet ) , sniffs the air and realizes a human “ snack ” is present .
Edward ( Robert Pattinson ) drops into a protective crouch and snarls .
A soggy set
THIS being March in the Columbia Gorge , which is standing in for remote Forks , Wash. , the weather is changing its mind every 20 minutes -- showering a cast slathered in pale vampire makeup with alternating doses of sun , rain and what Pattinson ( Cedric Diggory in two of the “ Harry Potter ” movies ) calls “ hail globs the size of golf balls . ”
It ’s turned the set into muddy quicksand .
Production assistants cover the ground with hay .
Actors huddle in a heated “ fire tent ” and stuff Kleenex to their cold , runny noses ; they carry hot - water bottles ( while PAs hold umbrellas over their carefully made - up heads ) and exchange rubber boots for Adidas just before the cameras roll .
Two pieces of heavy production equipment , including a Gradall all - terrain forklift , are hopelessly stuck in the muck .
A studio light makes a sizzling noise that causes a technician to do a backward leap .
( He ’s fine . )
God help you if you drop your cellphone .
“ I had the whole crew doing a ‘ cloud dance ’ -- shaking their heads , singing to the sky , ” Hardwicke says .
As you may have gathered , it has n’t been the easiest of shoots thus far .
Actor availability and the need to cut a cool trailer - full of special effects mean that the first two weeks of production have been spent on both the action - packed finale , which reportedly gave the stuntmen a proper beating ( they ’re also fine , mostly ) , and the ballgame .
But Hardwicke -- who ’s something of a troubled - teen expert after helming the gritty “ Thirteen ” and “ Lords of Dogtown ” -- is on the hunt for her trademark immediacy , and wants to get as much of the action in - camera as possible .
“ Thirteen ” in particular -- with its controversial depiction of young girls ’ angst and reckless rebellion -- suggests that “ Twilight , ” which is slated for a December release , might be a surprisingly good fit for Hardwicke .
Despite its ( mostly ) family - friendly supernatural bent , the material really is n’t all that far afield of Hardwicke ’s well - mined terrain .
“ Thirteen , ” after all , concerns a teenage girl who , like Bella , has inattentive parents and falls in way over her head with a rough crowd .
If you stretch it a bit , “ Lords of Dogtown ” also sets up camp in a world of thrill - seeking , physically gifted athletes chasing the troubled immortality of skateboarding fame .
“ Even ‘ Nativity ’ is about a 13 - year - old , ” says the director , laughing as she stretches the connection further with her “ The Nativity Story . ”
“ It felt to me like Stephenie Meyer had really captured that feeling of the first time you fall in love and you ’re head - over - heels intoxicated -- crazy , spiraling , will do anything to be with that person that you love .
In this case , Bella would go so far as to become a vampire -- to lose her soul to be with the person she loves . ”
Hardwicke is once again working with “ Thirteen ” star and co-writer Nikki Reed , who plays good vampire Rosalie .
“ It ’s not a joke , working with Catherine , ” says Reed .
“ She ’s not the kind of girl who ’s like , ‘ Let ’s stick you on some pads and bubble wrap and let you slide in a warehouse . ’
She ’s like , ‘ Nikki -- there ’s the field .
There ’s your mud .
I ’ll slap a kneepad on you and a butt - pad and you ’re going for it . ’ ”
“ Thirteen ” cinematographer Elliot Davis is also back .
“ One thing Elliot and I tried to do with our other movies is make them feel real , ” Hardwicke says .
“ In ‘ Thirteen , ’ Elliot almost breathes with the actor .
He ’s so intimate with them with the camera .
When they ’re feeling something , he ’s so sensitive that he moves in at the right times .
. . .
That sort of intimacy is what we ’re trying to accomplish with this film too . ”
A hot - blooded romance
AFTER THE baseball game is in the can , Hardwicke and Davis get to spend the rest of the shoot focusing on what made “ Twilight ” such a literary phenomenon : the boiling romance between Bella and Edward .
Meyer ’s book has sold more than 1 million copies , with 1.4 million more in sales for its two sequels , “ New Moon ” and “ Eclipse . ”
A fourth installment , “ Breaking Dawn , ” publishes Aug .
2 .
The book has spawned its own sub - genre of young - adult lit imitators .
Meyer is a devout Mormon and mother of three , and her novels wind you up with denial :
They ’re chaste , conversation - driven hormonal pressure - cookers .
Peter Facinelli , who plays Dr. Cullen , leader of the vampire family , describes the Bella - Edward romance as “ Romeo and Juliet squared .
They can not be together .
. . .
He has to fight every instinct he has not to eat the girl .
It ’s funny on the outside , but it also makes for a real sexual tension . ”
“ My screenwriter [ Melissa Rosenberg ] and I only had two or three months before the writer ’s strike to really try and boil this down into a tight story , ” Hardwicke says .
“ In the book , Bella and Edward ask each other lots of questions .
. . .
We try to distill those down to the three pages that are the most potent .
“ In the book , for example , where Bella reveals she knows he ’s a vampire , it was in a long conversation , just driving in a car .
We ’re doing that scene by the Salmon River , which is this beautiful , crazy , vivid , wild stream , and it ’s got this ancient tree just wrapped around this huge rock that they ’re standing against in the most beautiful forest you ’ve ever seen . ”
Hardwicke ’s pump - up - the - visuals approach extends to the costuming .
In the book , the nomadic trio of human - feasting vampires are described as being “ dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers . ”
Hardwicke re-imagines them as evil rock stars .
Gigandet wears a leather jacket festooned with what he jokingly calls his “ flair ” -- trophies from victims , ranging from police badges to wedding rings to schoolgirl baubles .
Edi Gathegi , as nomad leader Laurent , rocks some dreads .
Rachelle Lefevre , playing wild - huntress vampire Victoria , is decked out in a massive fur coat that would do Mick Jagger proud .
In another part of the field , hidden from the first unit behind some camouflage , second - unit director and stunt coordinator Andy Cheng , a frequent Jackie Chan collaborator , films the nomads ’ entrance with five cameras .
They stride out of an artificial fog bank on a leaf - covered moving catwalk dubbed “ the magic carpet ” -- a 200 - foot sled pulled by high - tension cables .
Gigandet , Gathegi and Lefevre look like they ’re effortlessly strolling into the clearing at about 30 miles an hour , and it looks ‘ 80s - music - video cool .
Beware the blog floggers
AFTER HE was cast as the ne plus ultra of gorgeous male vampirism , Pattinson says he faced “ this torrent of [ online ] abuse at the beginning that my mum made me aware of -- she sent me this link to this petition that said , ‘ Please !
Anyone else apart from him !’ ”
That rabid fan base has surprised the “ Twilight ” crew -- and a few jaded film writers .
On April 20 , Slash Film ’s Peter Sciretta reported ( in a post that read like a cocked eyebrow ) that “ ‘ Twilight ’ is actually the 14th - most - searched movie on the Internet according to IMDbPro ’s moviemeter .
‘ Twilight ’ ranks higher than ‘ Sex and the City : The Movie , ’ ‘ The Incredible Hulk , ’ ‘ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , ’ ‘ Speed Racer , ’ and even ‘ Indiana Jones 4 . ’
Even more surprising is the film ’s 18 listed cast members make up most of the top 30 searched stars on the web . ”
It is perhaps instructive that Sciretta ’s post on this matter has since received more than 1,400 comments -- several of them written by passionate fans who apparently type with one elbow on the exclamation key .
Hardwicke says she ’s paying attention : “ I do n’t go online every day , but certainly my assistant looks and tells me things . ”
Fans have been referred to as “ Twilighters ” or “ Twi - hards . ”
( A post on the MTV movies blog asking which nickname fans prefer has generated more than 2,500 comments . )
They gather online on dozens of fan sites including Twilight Moms , Twilight Teens and His Golden Eyes ( a reference to the Midas - colored irises of the good vampires ) .
The Twilight Moms ( who bill themselves online as married women who balance “ family , work , home , marriage and . . . our Twilight obsession ” ) crashed one set last week , looking for Pattinson ’s autograph .
Another popular fan site , TwilightLexicon.com , tracked one of the actors down on his MySpace page -- for which he uses an alias .
Pattinson can see where that passion comes from .
“ A lot of these teen adaptations just fizzle away , ” he says .
“ The books do n’t fizzle away , so why should the films ?
There ’s something mad about that .
I mean , even if this does n’t get made into a trilogy -- and I think it probably will be -- this story is so perfect for a film .
It just needs to have the right elements emphasized . ”
Abstract
This paper examines 77,236 federal offenders sentenced under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and concludes the following .
First , after controlling for extensive criminological , demographic , and socioeconomic variables , I found that blacks , males , and offenders with low levels of education and income receive substantially longer sentences .
Second , disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines , rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines .
Departures produce about 55 percent of the black ‐white difference and 70 percent of the male ‐female difference .
Third , although black ‐white disparities occur across offenses , the largest differences are for drug trafficking .
The Hispanic ‐white disparity is generated primarily by those convicted of drug trafficking and firearm possession / trafficking .
Last , blacks and males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available ; less likely to receive downward departures ; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and , conditioned on having a downward departure , receive smaller reductions than whites and females .

No great surprise , but the numbers in a new study show mathematicians are viewed as geeks , a stereotype that keeps students from studying math or using the subject later in life .
The researchers suggest there is a link between popular culture 's image of nerdy mathematicians and a lag in math students .
" Given the narrow , negative clichés associated with maths and mathematicians , it is hardly surprising that relatively few young people want to continue with the subject , " said lead researcher Heather Mendick of the Institute for Policy Studies in Education at the London Metropolitan University .
With funding from the Economic and Social Research Council , Mendick and her colleagues conducted interviews , focus groups and a survey of more than 650 individuals , with high - school students and college undergraduates .
Male students were more than three times as likely as their female counterparts to view themselves as excelling in math , with more than 10 percent of guys and 3 percent of girls reporting they are " very good " at math .
Nearly all participants , both math - friendly students and those who steer clear of equations , think of a mathematician as a white male with white hair , who is obsessed with the number - laden subject to the exclusion of any social life .
For instance , participants labeled Albert Einstein and John Nash ( portrayed in the movie " A Beautiful Mind " ) as lacking social skills and as weird or not normal .
" The dominant image is a very traditional image — white male , middle class , " Mendick told LiveScience .
" When you go a bit deeper , you find people are quite critical of that kind of image . "
Students who chose to study math once they entered college were more likely to view this math - obsession as a sign of skill , commitment or devotion rather than madness .
A few math majors in college put a positive spin on geek status , even though several of these individuals went to considerable lengths to claim their own normality .
" Some people did want to reclaim ' geek , ' and say ' I am a geek and I 'm quite proud of it , ' " Mendick said .
After the tenor Juan Diego Flórez popped out his nine shining high C’s in “ La Fille du Régiment ” at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night , the crowd rose and cheered .
Mr. Flórez obliged with something not heard on the Met stage since 1994 : a solo encore .
He sang the aria “ Ah! Mes Amis ” again , nailing the difficult note  a kind of tenor ’s macho proving ground  nine more times .
It was one of those thrilling moments that opera impresarios live for .

And , in this case , prepare for .
Peter Gelb , the Met ’s general manager , said on Tuesday that he had asked Mr. Flórez weeks ago whether he would be prepared to repeat the aria , if the audience demanded .
Mr. Flórez had already done so at other houses , including the Teatro alla Scala in Milan , where last year he became the first to violate an encore ban since 1933 .
Browse column FRESNO , CA — OK , we ’ve just gone through a really exciting time in world military moves , so let ’s test your strategic IQ .
What ’s the relation between these three recent developments : 1 . On May 9 , Hezbollah took over West Beirut against feeble resistance .
2 . The Iraqi Army , such as it is , is now moving into Mosul in a major anti-al Qaeda operation .
3 . At the end of March , the Iraqi Army attacked Sadr strongholds in Basra and East Baghdad , and got its ass kicked .
If you want some clues , you can read my account of event # 3 in detail from my April 2nd column : http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=18297&IBLOCK_ID=35
The other clue that might help is that Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Iraq is totally based on Nasrallah ’s Lebanese Hezbollah , so — to kinda give it away a little — in just over a month ’s time , you ’ve got two Shia militias stomping the better - armed and - funded old - style powers in Arab countries a thousand miles apart .
Kind of a trend .
Item # 2 , the move on Mosul , is the trick question here , because there are no Shia to speak of up there ; the Iraqi Army is moving against Al Qaeda in Iraq up there .
What ’s the connection ?
As you chew on that food fer thought , let ’s fill in the details on what happened and why in this week ’s sudden Shia-ization of what the media always call " fashionable West Beirut . "
" Fashionable " — I love imagining these Shia puritans with Kalashnikovs and RPGs stalking through rubble filled with confused airhead supermodels : " Like … hel - LO ?
What are you …I mean … doing here anyway ?
In that ugly Kevlar vest which does n’t match your beard at all , I mean YUCK , and that so - eighties gun accessory … do n’t you realize I ’ve got a SHOOT today ? "
The Hezzies do n’t get her babble , but they hear the word " shoot " and it all goes to pieces very fast .
That ’s one of the first thing a supermodel ’s got to learn : do n’t say " shoot " around a nervous militiaman who thinks women should wear black hefty bags , head to foot , even when showering .
Or " if " showering ; for these boys , Sharia tops hygiene every time .
South Beirut or Sadr City : Can You Tell The Difference ?
Hezbollah took their beach trip on May 9 , but it was n’t announced to anybody in the media .
The Lebanese elite was stunned .
This was not supposed to happen .
It would be like West LA being overrun by Baptist gangs from Bakersfield .
And there was nothing the cool Lebanese could do about it but sneer and whine and blog .
Boy , did they blog .
In the blog - o - sphere battle , the West Beirut coolsters won hands down .
Out on the streets , though , it was all Hezbollah .
They came , they saw , they burned down a TV station that had been broadcasting anti-Hezbollah stories … and a couple of days later , they left .
It was n’t like your classical military maneuver ; these are commuter troops , and what they did was pack their weapons — mostly rifles and RPGs , some of the rifles looking surprisingly new and expensive — in the trunks of their little fuel - efficient sedans , and head back to the slums of South Beirut .
No word on whether traffic was snarled by the sudden withdrawal : " KBRT ’s traffic helicopter , Beirut ’s only traffic reporter with look - down - shoot - down capability , brings you this update : avoid the Shia - town expressway , which is jammed with weekend Hezbollah visitors evacuating the capital ….

Along with the Christmas trees and family gatherings , there 's another end - of - the - year ritual in Oakland - a candlelight vigil for the murdered .
The body count is woven into the civic consciousness here - a number chased by homicide inspectors , studied by criminologists , lamented in churches , reported by journalists .
Every mayor leaves City Hall on broken promises to quell the violence , and the killings continue .
An additional 115 have been killed this year , putting Oakland on pace for another gruesome record .
In the last five years , 557 people were slain on the city 's streets , making Oakland the state 's second - most murderous city , behind Compton .
Most victims are young , black men who are dying in forgotten neighborhoods of East and West Oakland .
A handful of their killers , speaking from prison , describe an environment where violence is so woven into the culture that murder has become a symbol of manhood .
The inmates say the only difference between these neighborhoods and prison is the absence of walls .
The same hierarchies apply - the meanest rise to the top .
It 's a survival skill that ensures ownership of drug corners , a sense of self - worth , female attention and protection from attack .
Experts fear that the neighborhoods are only getting more violent .
There are entire blocks without a single two - parent family , where drug dealers have become the predominant male role models , and children fend for themselves in crowded , chaotic homes where they are routinely exposed to drugs , sex and guns .
Criminal families are on their third and fourth generations .
Grandparents - the ones who have historically stepped in to help raise fatherless boys and instill a sense of right and wrong - are dying off .
Back in the 1980s , drug dealers who first brought crack cocaine to Oakland used to hide their activities from their parents because it was shameful , but now it 's a full - blown family business , said Michelle Gandy , a private investigator who interviews murder defendants for Alameda County court - appointed criminal defense attorneys .
" The kids today recognize that their parents are in it , too , so there 's this hopelessness , " she said .
Increasingly , the young murder suspects coming to the station for questioning seem to lack basic morality , said Sgt. Tim Nolan , who has been investigating Oakland homicides for 17 years .
" There are more and more families where there 's less and less structure , " he said .
" Talking to these suspects day in and out , there 's a higher percentage today with no sense of right and wrong .
It 's frightening , but we are creating super - criminals . "
All it takes is a look , a put - down or a lost fight , and bullets fly .
Disrespect has become the No. 1 reason to kill .
Killings have been concentrated in these neighborhoods for so long that revenge killings continue for decades .
There 's a six - degrees - of - separation phenomenon that happens after each death :
The killers and their victims can typically trace a relationship through family , friends , schools or prison stints .
That 's why Oakland murders are rarely random .
More often they are the result of historical battles between crews who hold Mafia - like influence on blocks and drug corners .
" Many people who live there rarely leave Oakland , let alone their block , so their disputes take on epic proportions , " said Nolan .
Witnesses are cowed into silence because snitches have been known to disappear .
Nearly half of all murders in Oakland go uncharged for lack of a willing witness , so a shooter knows he has about a 50 - 50 chance of getting away with it .
" Murder is hardly ever a whodunit in Oakland , " said criminal defense attorney William Du Bois , who has been representing Oakland homicide suspects for nearly three decades .
Because witnesses wo n't testify , certain Oakland neighborhoods have an abnormally high per capita rate of killers walking the streets .
They are known , feared , and have an incredibly toxic influence on impressionable young boys aching for structure .
" In these neighborhoods of concentrated poverty , all the doctors , lawyers , pharmacists , architects and postal workers have left , " said Richard Miles , chief executive officer of Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Bay Area .
" The kids have nobody but drug lords to look up to . "
For this report , The Chronicle conducted prison and telephone interviews with five convicted Oakland killers , reviewed the court files of 60 murder trials , listened to police interrogation tapes and talked with homicide inspectors , district attorneys , family members , criminal defense lawyers , forensic therapists and criminologists .
The inmates who spoke to The Chronicle hoped that their stories would dissuade younger generations from following in their footsteps .
Their stories , and those told in the court files , show that Oakland killers share many characteristics .
They are young .
Most killed before their 25th birthday .
A majority grew up without a father - he was either murdered , incarcerated or abandoned his children .
Mom is typically absent , too , either because she 's working several jobs for minimum wage or because she 's also lost to the streets through drugs , prostitution or prison .
Many of the convicted killers were quasi- homeless in grade school , moving every 90 days on eviction cycles , or bouncing between friends ' and relatives ' homes , where they slept on recliners and couches and floors .
Inside the home is pure chaos .
Typically , they live with a third - generation relative , an elderly grandmother or aunt , who also opens her home to several other wayward relatives .
They all pile into one home , bringing their boyfriends and girlfriends and their children .
There 's no particular person in charge , no house rules , and people come and go .
Often it's in these houses where young boys first learn how to hold a gun , how to break a rock of cocaine into dime and nickel bags for sale .
Without parents to help them mature , the mental world of these young killers stays stuck in an infantile , egotistic state , said forensic psychologist Shawn Johnston , who has conducted more than 15,000 court evaluations of adult and juvenile criminals in 15 Northern California counties .
" What keeps us from killing each other is empathy , and we learn it from bonding with parents who pick us back up when we get hurt or teased as children , " Johnston said .
" Without it , you get guys who live in a constant state of protecting the fantasy that they are the most important thing this side of the Milky Way .
And because they do n't have empathy , they will shoot or stab to protect their illusion . "
Teachers who work with these boys in the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center say the first thing they do is stock their classrooms with food , to help their students concentrate .
Young boys fend for themselves in the absence of structured mealtimes - grabbing what they can from a fast - food restaurant or a corner liquor store when they can scrape together or steal some money .
There is an equivalent of a mafia in Oakland 's ghettos .
Some kids are born into families that " claim " streets .
Children in these families are expected to put the family 's gang wars above anything else - they skip school when the turf wars heat up and the gang members are expected to stand out on the streets in a show of force .
" Everyone in my family was in the game - my mother , stepfather , brother , cousins , " said Donte Osborne , 28 , who is serving a 15 - year sentence in Corcoran State Prison for second - degree murder .
" I caught a dope case when I was 10 years old and sold to a decoy , " he said .
" I adapted to my surroundings .
It 's not like I wanted to do it , but if I did n't , I would have been left out of my family . "
Without anyone in charge of their moral development , young boys come up with their own rules .
When they get in disputes , they do n't have the ability to resolve them because no one has ever taught them how to manage anger and stress other than with fists or a gun .
In this world , challenges cannot be left unanswered .
A boy who is jumped , robbed or insulted and does n't respond is labeled " soft , " or a " punk " or a " bitch . "
He becomes prey .
Once he is perceived as weak , the attacks keep coming .
He loses not only his honor , but his friends and his personal safety , until he fights back and wins - sometimes via homicide .
" It does n't matter how bad your circumstances are , at a cellular genetic level you know it 's not supposed to be this way and you 're pissed off with no way to ameliorate it , " Miles of Big Brothers Big Sisters said .
A majority of the men studied by The Chronicle had criminals in their families .
Most had juvenile records , the majority for selling or carrying drugs .
Many developed their own chemical habits and a little more than half dropped out of school .
Their role models are the drug dealers on the corner who have the cars , clothes , girls , money and most of all - respect .
" In a dysfunctional environment , it 's prestigious to be a gangster , and it inspires you to act the same , " said convicted killer Ivan Kilgore , 32 , who is serving a life sentence in California State Prison , Sacramento .
" It fulfills that ego , gives you a sense of identity .
Big dudes respect you .
It 's like being a star athlete - kids in constructive environments , their peers give them accolades and support to continue their good behavior by bolstering their ego .
It 's identical in the streets , only the behavior that is rewarded is different .
It 's like , ' Hey !
I saw you in a stolen car ! ' and you get a high five . "
Respect is money , money is power and power is masculinity .
Violence defines you as a man .
" These kids have one thing in this world , and when you have nothing else , no money , no access , no privileges , no resources , no means , the only thing you have , from a little boy on , is your respect , " investigator Gandy said .
Inmates told The Chronicle that it was the drug dealers who gave them their first sense of belonging .
The gang on the block is the first group that wants them , that pays attention to their whereabouts , that asks what they are doing and what they think about things .
Sometimes there 's a girl out there who thinks they 're cute .
All of a sudden the neglected boy has a posse - the first place that feels like home .
Prisoner Hamisi Spears , serving a 39 - year sentence in High Desert State Prison in Susanville , described the criminal evolution as an organic process - like a seed that 's planted and watered and grows into a shoot .
" You see these guys who are three or four years older than you , who are not doing kid stuff anymore , not playing tag football in the street .
We watch him and all of a sudden he's got a car , he 's dressing differently , and we want that too so we approach and say , ' Wassup , man ? ' "
At first , the older guy will likely shoo the youngster away , telling the boy he 's not ready to get in the game .
Then one day he 'll ask the boy to ride in his car .
It 's the moment that the boy has been aching for .
" You 're there , it 's nice , the music is playing , and he 'll run an errand .
He 'll say ' Here , hold this . '
It 's a gun or some dope .
He 'll jump out and then jump right back and then he knows he can trust you .
He 'll turn to you and say , ' Hey , you hungry ? ' and go get you something to eat .
You are part of him now . "
Now the boy is loyal , even if caught selling drugs for the older dealer .
The code of the street dictates never telling on the man who is providing for you .
" When you get out of jail , you 've got street cred , " Spears said .
" He sees you , knows you stopped him from going to jail , and he 'll respect you , take you and buy you a couple of outfits . "
Boys go from nobody to somebody overnight .
Navigating this world is delicate .
Shootings can occur simply because someone made a movement that could have been interpreted as a reach for a gun in a waistband .
While this is a common strategy in court to claim self - defense , there is an element of truth to it .
Many of the killers studied by The Chronicle killed enemies who put word out on the street that they were going to kill first .
In this warped environment , killing someone can actually protect you .
It 's a way to keep others in fear .
Gun laws can't reach places like East and West Oakland .
Rarely do boys go get a gun and kill - the gun is already there .
Guns are as common as cell phones .
Friends give their friends guns for protection after losing a fistfight .
Every day , drug addicts trade guns for a fix .
Groups of boys share guns , keeping them hidden in abandoned homes , in empty lots , in the rain gutters and under their beds .
Boys do n't think they will live past 25 , so they do n't live their life as if they will .
None of the convicted killers told The Chronicle that they were worried about their futures or the consequences of their criminal lifestyle before going to prison .
To be a square , to go to school , work for minimum wage and shun the " game , " takes an enormous amount of patience and personal risk in the middle of what is , in effect , a war zone .
The payoff is too far off for someone who does n't plan for middle age or a career .
At the time , the quick buck did n't seem like a bad choice , inmates said .
Only a handful of the killers had legitimate jobs .
Criminal records and lack of a high school diploma , no car to get to work , and no support from immediate family ensure that they simply do n't fit in to what society sees as employee material .
It was only after they were taken out of their environment and given years to reflect behind bars that they had time to grasp the concept of another way of life .
The experts - and the killers - say a mentor might have saved them , anyone from the outside who could have shown them another way to be a man .
After so many years in prison , the convicted killers who spoke to The Chronicle have had time to think about why their lives turned out the way that they did .
They are remorseful , they are angry at themselves and the circumstances that they were born into , and they are trying to do something useful with what 's left of their tragic lives .
It 's a second chance that their victims will never get .
" I do n't care how bad your situation is , as we grow up in this world we know right from wrong , " said Gerlen Anderson , who held her son William as he lay dying from Ivan Kilgore 's shotgun blast near a pay phone at 30th and San Pablo avenues in 2000 .
When Anderson saw that her 21 - year - old son was n't going to make it , she whispered in his ear , " Go to the angels . "
Kilgore claimed that Anderson had repeatedly attacked him and robbed him of $ 100 .

JIT on Tamarin Tracing
前回のつづき . 今日は JIT を眺めてみます .
そのまえに少し補足 .
TT のコードはまだ登場したばかりで , じゃんじゃん書き変わっている .
なのでここで書いている内容は早々古くなってしまう.
どんな勢いで書き変わっているかというと , たとえば前回紹介した TT Forth の " SUPER : " は もうすぐ撤廃される .
( 該当bug . ) かわりに fc.py が命令列の長さから半自動的に superword を生成するようになる .
ついでに Interpreter.cpp に書かれていた IL プリミティブの実装 C++ コードが vm.fs のインラインに埋め込まれるようになる . ( semantic aciton みたいなもんですね . )
そんなわけなので , あとから照合し て 「 全然違うじゃん!」と怒らないようにしてください > いつかぐぐってやってくる方々.
Tracing Tree
で , 本題. TT の使う JIT , Tracing Tree アルゴリズムは , " Incremental Dynamic Code Generation with Trace Trees ( PDF ) " という記事で詳しく解説されている .
Tracing
Tree にはおおよそ三つの特徴がある :
制御構造を CFG ( control flow graph ) = DAG ではなく , ツリー構造であらわす .
( basic block を繋ぐ辺が合流しない . )
関数ではなくループをコンパイルの単位とする
能動的に命令列を解析するのではなく , VM の評価ループから呼ばれるフックでツリー構造などをつくる
アルゴリズムだけを説明しても先の記事の焼き直しになってしまうので , 実装を覗きつつ話を進めたい .
JIT 結果のコー ド( IL/LIR /x86 ) は TC 同様 - Dverbose で見ることができます .
loopdge ( ) : JIT のためのフッ ク
三つめの特徴にあるように , JIT 関係のコードは VM の評価ループにこそっと埋めこまれている .
具体的には分岐命令をフックする.
これは二つめの特徴 , ループを中心とした JIT に関係している .
実行中にループを検出するため , JIT は " 前方向へのジャンプ " をループの終点をみなす .
ジャンプ先をループの先頭だと仮定するわけ.
... loop : var i = 0 ; do_something ( ) ; ++i ; if ( i < 10 ) { goto loop ; } // ここでフックする . ...
具体的なフックの呼び出しこんなかんじ :
// Interpreter.cpp // bool -- // branch if false , 4 byte offset PRIM ( void , LBRF ) ( Interpreter & interp , Frame * & f , wcodep& ip , Boxp& sp , wcodepp& rp ) { // ip = ip + ( a ? 4 : *(( int32_t * ) ip ) ) ; int32_t j = readUnaligned Int32 ( ip ) ; sp--; if ( ! s p [ 1 ] .i ) { ip += j ; if ( j < 0 ) // ジャンプ幅のオフセットが負 = 前方向なら .... { ... LOOPEDGE ( interp ) ; // フックを呼び出す } } .... }
IL の命令である LBRF にフックが埋め込まれているのがわかる .
ほかに 条件が正ならジャンプする LBRT 命令と , 関数呼び出しの ENTERABC 命令 , 関数から抜ける EXITABC 命令にフックがある .
関数まわりは再起呼び出しの場合のみフックを呼ぶ.
LOOPEDGE ( ) マクロはこんなの .
#include " nanojit.h " # define LOOPEDGE ( i ) do {\ InterpState state ( ip , sp , rp , f ) ; \ TIMING_START ( t_taken ) \ ( i).loopedge ( state ) ; \ TIMING_END ( t_taken ) \ f=state.f ; ip=state.ip ; sp=state.sp ; rp=state.rp ;\ } while ( 0 )
loopedge ( ) メソッドがフックの実体だ .
いくつかの例外を除き , JIT 関係の処理は この loopedge ( ) を起点にする .
関数呼び出し/呼びだされを起点にする典型的な
JIT とはだいぶ違いそうなのがわかる .
Fragment : Tracing
Tree のデータ構 造
loopedge ( ) を見てみよう .
void Interpreter ::loopedge( InterpState &state ) { if ( ! allowTracing ) return ;
Fragment * frag = frago -> getLoop ( state ) ; ...
冒頭で " Fragment " というオブジェクトを取得している .
" frago " 変数は Fragment オブジェクトのコンテナである Fragmento のインスタンス .
( このクラス名はどうよ ... ) Fragmento::getLoop ( ) は必要に応じて Fragment のインスタンスを作成する .
Fragment * Fragmento::getLoop ( const avmplus :: InterpState &is ) { Fragment * f = _frags -> get ( is.ip ) ; if ( ! f ) { f = new Frag ( is ) ; _frags -> put ( is.ip , f ) ; .... } return f ; }
この Fragment ( o なし ) オブジェクトがコンパイラでいう basic block にあたる .
InerpState : :ip は VM の instruction pointer .
つまり Fragmento コンテナは命令の先頭位置をキーに Fragment を保存している .
定義を抜粋しておこう :
/** * Fragments are linear sequences of native code that have a single entry * point at the start of the fragment and may have one or more exit points * *
It may turn out that that this arrangement causes too much traffic * between d and i-caches and that we need to carve up the structure differently .
*/ class Fragment { public : .... DWB ( Fragment * ) branches ; // ツリーの子 DWB ( Fragment * ) nextbranch ; // ツリーの兄弟 DWB ( Fragment * ) anchor ; // ツリーのルート DWB ( LirBuffer * ) lirbuf ; // LIR 出力 .... private : NIns * _code ; // ptr to start of code ( ネイティブコード ) GuardRecord * _links ; // code which is linked ( or pending to be ) to this fragment // コード生成時に考慮すべき " ガード " のリスト ( 後述 ) int32 _t _hits ; // パスの通過回数 ( 後述 ) LInsp _map ; // serialized state of the stacks packed in LIR buffer } ;
ツリー構造になっているのと , JIT ぽいあれこれがあるなーという理解で十分 .
あとでまた出てきます .
loopedage ( ) は分岐命令からのフックだったのを思いだそう.
Tracing
Tree では , このように VM の実行に応じて basic block ならぬ Fragment のデータ構造を構築していく .
だから通らないパスのコードが JIT されることはない .
loopedage ( ) に戻ってつづき .
( 基本的にこのメソッドが tracing tree のほとんど全てです ) :
void Interpreter ::loopedge( InterpState &state ) { ... Fragment * frag = frago -> getLoop ( state ) ; if ( tracing ( ) ) { ...// 最初はこっちを通らないので省略 } if (! frag->code ( ) ) // JIT された native code がなければ ... { // この Fragment を通過した回数を数えて , if ( ++ frag - >hits ( ) > HOTLOOP ) { // そのカウントが閾値を越えたら... sot ( frag , state ) ; // " tracing " を開始する : " Start Of Trace " } } else ... }
このように , loopedge ( ) では実行パスの通過回数を
Fragment オブジェクトに記録しておく .
で , 回数が所定の量を越えると JIT を行う.
頻度に応じた JIT の仕組みが少しずつ見えてきた , かも .
" trace " するとは具体的に何をするのだろう. まず sot ( ) を見てみる :
void Interpreter :: sot ( Fragment * tracefrag , InterpState &interp ) { ... set_tracing ( true ) ; // 開始フラグをたてた !
this -> tracefrag = tracefrag ; // trace 対象の Fragment を保存 ... NanoAssert(!tracefrag->code ( ) ) ; // まだ JIT 前なのを確認 ... // LIR 命令を出力する LirWriter を用意 LirBuffer * lirbuf = new ( core -> gc ) LCompressedBuffer ( frago ) ; LirWriter * lirout = lirbuf -> writer ( ) ; ... }
LirWriter をセットアップしている .
TT での " tracing " とは , native コードの手前の低レベル表現である LIR の生成を指している .
元ネタである Tracing
Tree の tracing は制御構造の追跡全般を指している .
ちょっと紛らわしい .
class Interpreter { .... inline void set_tracing ( bool t ) { m_nottracing = t ?
0x00 : 0xff ; }
set_tracing ( ) では m_nottracing をセットする .
ここからしばらくいやらしい C のコードがつづくけど我慢してください .
まずこんなマクロがあって ...
# define NEXTIP ( * ip++ & m_nottracing )
評価ループの先頭にこんなコードがある...
void Interpreter : : inner ( Frame *f , wcodep ip , Box * sp , wcodepp rp ) { top_of_loop : INTERP_PRE switch ( NEXTIP ) { ... ここで命令の解釈 }
tracing 中はいつも NEXTIP がゼロになるのに注目 .
値がゼロの命令は ...
// vm.fs ... // TRACE must come first ( and have a value , even if bogus ) because it must be op 0 { TRACE (( -- ) )
0 }
うへ. なんつう bogus だよ. TRACE の実装をみると ...
# define INTERP_TRACE(x ) TIMING_END ( t_interp ) } goto handle_trace ;
はいはい ...
// Interpreter : :inner ( ) handle_trace : .... if ( superpos ) { ... // super word 用の workaround .
// superword を構成する個々の word を trace しなおす } else { ... trace ( f , ip - 1 , sp , rp ) ; ... switch ( curword ) { ... // 評価ループの該当ラベルに goto .
実際の命令が実行される. } ... }
はいはい ...
void Interpreter : : trace ( Frame * f , const wcodep ip , const Boxp sp , const wcodepp rp ) { ... const Token curword = ip [ - 1 ] ; ... trace 2 ( f , ip , sp , rp ) ; ... }
...というわけで無事いやらし圏を突破. tracing 中は命令毎に trace2 ( ) メソッドが呼ばれ , そのあと命令本体が動くのがわかった .
trace2 ( ) は , いま動かしてい る IL に対応した LIR を生成する :
void Interpreter : : trace2 ( Frame * f , const wcodep ip , const Boxp sp , const wcodepp rp ) { LirWriter * lirout = tracefrag -> lirbuf -> writer ( ) ; .... // このへんで定数伝搬などの局所最適化を行う .... switch ( * ip ) // 現在実行している命令について... { ..... case CHOOSE : { // 対応する LIR を発行! LIns* i0 = uselo ( sp ) ; LIns* i1 = uselo ( sp - 1 ) ; LIns* i2 = uselo ( sp - 2 ) ; // sp [ - 2 ] = sp [ 0 ] ? sp [ - 2 ] : sp [ - 1 ] i = lirout -> ins_choose ( i0 , i2 , i1 , assm -> has_cmov ) ; varset ( sp - 2 , i ) ; break ; } ..... } }
他にも細かな高速化が色々ちりばめられているので , 興味のあるひとは覗くと面白いかもしれない.
とにかく , TT における tracinig は LIR の生成というネイティブコードの準備フェーズだということが わかった .
このまま LIR を生成し続けると , あっという間にメモリが溢れてしまう .
適当に打ち切る必要がある. 打ち切りには eof ( ) メソッド ( end of tracing ) を使う .
void Interpreter ::eot ( InterpState &state , Fragment * target ) { TIMING_START ( t_eot ) set_tracing ( false ) ; // tracing フラグを戻す .
... if ( assm - > error ( ) ) ... else { // if we are currently tracing let 's terminate it and then join the fragments guard ( lastop , /* cond * / NULL , state , target ) ; if ( assm - > error ( ) ) ... else { // // JIT の瞬間!
LIR をネイティブコードに変換する . // assm は nanojit モジュールの Assembler オブジェクト . // compile ( strk.location , rtrk.location , assm , tracefrag ) ; ... } } verbose_only ( if ( core->config.verbose_trace ) verbose = assm -> _verbose = false ; ) TIMING_END ( t_eot ) ; }
こうして tracing 中に作られた LIR は無事ネイティブコードになった .
万歳! LIR -> native の変換は特に新味もないので省略 . 先に進みます .
eot ( ) メソッドはエラー時に呼ばれるほか , 先に登場した分岐フックの loopedge ( ) からも呼ばれている .
void Interpreter ::loopedge( InterpState &state ) { if ( ! allowTracing ) return ; Fragment * frag = frago -> getLoop ( state ) ; if ( tracing ( ) ) // tracing 中なら ... { ... eot ( state , frag ) ; // tracing を終える // might have just flushed , re-get frag frag = frago -> getLoop ( state ) ; } ... // 下の抜粋につづく... }
JIT で作られたネイティブコードはいつ動かすのかというと , このあとすぐに呼ばれる .
// Interpreter : : loopedge ( ) つづき ... if (! frag ->code ( ) ) { ...// JIT されたコードがない場合 . ( 既出. ) } else { callfrag : ... // calling to generated arm code , use normal address union { NIns * code ; GuardRecord * ( FASTCALL * func ) ( InterpState * , Fragment * ) ; } u ; u.code = frag -> code ( ) ; lr = ( * u.func ) ( &state , 0 ) ; ... TIMING_END ( t_frag ) currentFrame = state .f ; ... } ...
frag -> code ( ) が JIT の作ったネイティブコードを返し , それを呼び出している .
あるループで LIR を生成したら , その次のループからナイティブコードになるわけね.
あたりまえの話だけれど , 同じコー ド( パス ) の trace / JIT は基本的に一度だけ .
ネイティブコードは Fragment : : _code に保存されており , 次回以降の loopedge ( ) ではすぐにそれが呼び出される .
...これで TT JIT の大まかな流れがわかった .
ただし大筋以外にも解決すべき問題は色々あり , コードにはそのための仕掛けが用意されている.
このあとは , その仕掛けから面白そうなものをいくつか紹介する.
ガード
上で説明した Tracing JIT は , インタプリタの実行したパスしかコンパイルしない.
だから , たとえ ば
function foo ( n :int ) : int { var i:int = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i< n ; ++i ) { if ( 100 == i ) { for ( var j:int ; j < 10 ; ++j ) { i = i+j ; // 特に意味はありません... } return i ; } } return i ; } ... var x:int = foo ( 10 ) ;
みたいなコードを動かすと , " 100 = i " のパスは実行されず , コンパイルもされない .
その後の呼び出しで " 100 = i " のパスに入ると , ネイティブコードは中断してインタプリタに戻る .
イメージとしてはこんなコードにコンパイルされる.
void generated_foo( interpreter_t* interp ) { int n = interp -> args [ 0 ] ; int i = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i< n ; ++i ) { if ( 100 == i ) { goto side_exit_at_path_1 : } } interp -> result = i ; return ; side_exit_at_path_1 : interp -> state = the_state_at_the_path ; return ; }
この <ネイティブコードを中断してインタプリタに戻る>
仕組みをガード ( guard ) , 中断する位置を side exit という .
TT の JIT はガードを多用する .
コンパイラづくりは分岐で basic block を区切るのがお約束になっている .
TT JIT はガードを使うことで , " 前に戻る " ジャンプまでが一区切りのコードブロックになる .
その間には( 先に進む ) 分岐を含むことがある . 先に Fragment は basic block に相当すると書いたけれど , うけもつコード片は分岐をふくむぶん長くなる .
状態の復 元
伝統的な関数単位の JIT は , バイトコード上の関数とネイティブの関数が 1 - 1 で対応していた .
おかげでインタプリタからネイティブコードへの呼び出しも割と素朴に実装することができた. ( see TC . )
TT はループ単位で JIT を行うため , バイトコードの関数と生成されるネイティブコードが
1 - 1 で対応しない .
そのせいでネイティブコードをバイトコードの関数の途中で呼び出したり , ネイティブコードから戻る場所がバイトコードの関数の中間だったりする.
戻る側は特に厄介だ . 戻った箇所から整合性を保って
VM のインタプリタを再開するには , インタプリタの状態を適当に復元する必要がある.
たとえば以下のような AS のコードがあったとして ...
function bar ( n:int ) : int { var i:int = 0 ; for ( i:int = 0 ; i< 10 ; ++i ) { if ( 5 == bar ( ) ) { break ; } } //after_loop : i += 10 ; return i; }
この for 文のブロックだけが JIT されたとする .
( Tracing JIT では典型的な場面 . )
JIT で作られたネイティブコードから戻ったあと , インタプリタは after_loop とコメントのある行から動作を開始し , VM のローカル変数 i にも適当な値が入っていなければいけない .
これはガードのパスで特に問題になる .
TT JIT は , ネイティブ関数の引数としてインタプリタの状態をまとめた
InterpState 構造体を引き渡す .
JIT はここに状態を書き戻すコードを生成し , 整合性の問題を扱う .
( 詳しくは Assembler : : nFragExit ( ) など参照. ) めんどい .
パッチ
さて , ガードではハズレのパスに入るとインタプリタに戻ると書いた.
これは少し悲しい .
初回にたまたま頻度の低いパスを選んでしまったら , ループの中でいつもインタプリタに戻る羽目になる.
Tracing
Tree の木構造を考えてみよう .
この場合 , 通常 の ( 外側の ) ループを含む foo のパスが親ノード .
i=100 のパスの( 内側の ) ループが子ノードとなる .
TT JIT は子ノードを別の Fragment としてコンパイルする .
親も子もイティブコードを持つとき , 一旦インタプリタに戻るのは無駄足だ .
TT JIT は後からコードを書き直し , ガード時のジャンプ先を子ノードに変更する .
この仕組みを patch と呼ぶ .
コードをみてみよう .
まずネイティブコードから戻ったところから.
ネイティブコードの戻り値 lr は GuardRecord 型のオブジェクト .
インタプリタ再開のための追加情報が含まれている.
void Interpreter ::loopedge( InterpState &state ) { lr = ( * u.func ) ( &state , 0 ) ; // ネイティブコード実行 ... if ( ( frag = lr-> target ) == 0 ) // 復帰先の Fragment が指定されていない { if (... ) { frag = frago -> getMerge ( lr , state ) ; // 既存のパスを探すか } else { .... frag = frago-> createBranch ( lr , state ) ; // 新しく作る .... } .... // writing to the lr here requires dcache / icache sync lr-> target = frag ; if ( frag -> code ( ) ) { // コードがあった場合の処理 assm->patch(lr ) ; // ネイティブコードの戻りパスを子の
Fragment に繋ぐ goto callfrag ; } else { frag->addRecord ( lr ) ; // この復帰先にジャンプしてくるパスとして , // 元のネイティブコードからの戻り位置を記録する // コード生成の際にはパスをつなぐ } .... } .... }
中断情報を元に , 子( ジャンプ先 ) の
Fragment で patch しているのがわかる .
コード生成時に patch ( ) をすることもある :
// Assembler.cpp void Assembler : : assemble ( Fragment * frag ) { // とりあえず普通にコード生成 ... _epilogue = genEpilogue ( SavedRegs ) ; ... NIns * loopJump = gen ( frag -> lirbuf ->reader ( ) ) ; // perform single pass ... NIns* patchEntry = genPrologue ( SavedRegs ) ; ... if ( !error ( ) ) // エラーでないなら { .... frag -> fragEntry = patchEntry ; frag->setCode ( _nIns ) ; // patch other frags to this new one now .
GuardRecord * lr = frag -> links ( ) ; while ( lr ) { GuardRecord * next = lr-> next ; NanoAssert ( lr -> target == _thisfrag ) ; patch ( lr ) ; // 先に登録しておいたジャンプ元が // 生成したコードにジャンプするよう変更 lr = next ; } } ... }
こうした地道な工夫がガードのペナルティを減らしている. ちなみに patch ( ) の実装は CPU 毎に異り , i386 だとこんなの :
// Nativei386.cpp void Assembler : : patch ( GuardRecord * lr ) { Fragment * frag = lr->target ; NIns * save = _nIns ; verbose_only ( verbose_outputf ( " patching jump at % X to here " , lr->jmp ) ; ) _nIns = lr->jmp +5 ; // +5 is size of JMP JMP_long_nochk ( frag-> fragEntry ) ; _nIns = save ; }
メソッド呼び出 し
JIT の単位がループだと , メソッド呼び出しの変換は面倒が多そうだ .
なにしろこのままだと関数の冒頭は JIT されない .
一旦インタプリタに戻ればいいが , 性能を考えると都合が悪い .
メソッド呼び出しは , Forth では enterenv 命令としてこう記述されている :
// caller will NEST to get here , EXECUTE is an indirect jump ( tail jump ) , // so the impl code 's EXIT will return directly back to caller : enterenv ( obj args argc -- result ) ckint RSTKREM 0<= IF stkover THEN ENV getforthimpl EXECUTE ;
( 本当はこの前後にフレームの push / pop があるけれど , 本筋とは関係ないので省略 . )
getforthimpl は C++ の関数で , forth 命令列へのポインタを返す .
IL の INVOKEI 命令を通じて呼び出される .
wcodep FASTCALL getforthimpl( MethodEnv* env ) { return env->getForthWord ( ) ; }
EXECUTE は C++ で実装された IL プリミティブ .
getforthimpl がスタックに積んだ命令列で , 現在の instruction pointer を上書きする .
PRIM ( void , EXECUTE ) ( wcodep& ip , const wcodep newip ) { AvmAssert ( newip != 0 ) ; ip = newip ; }
こうした IL レベルの操作を , どう LIR にマップすればいいのだろう. trace2 ( ) を見てみよう .
case FINVOKEI : case IINVOKEI : case QINVOKEI : { lirout->ins( arg1op , useq_or_lo( arg1 op , sp ) ) ; i = lirout -> insCall ( ip [ 1 ] ) ; varset ( sp , i ) ; break ; }
getforthimpl を呼び出すための IINVOKEI 命令は , LIR の call 命令に置き換えられる .
意外性はないものの , IL のポインタがあってもネイティブコードはどうしようもない...
EXECUTE はこんなの :
case EXECUTE : guardConstant ( sp , state ) ; break ;
ガードがあるだけ .
仮想関数テーブルをひっぱるだとか , call 命令を書くだとか , そういうコードは見当たらない .
ここまで読んでる人はあまりいないだろうけれど , 今回の話ではここが一番面白いところだったりする.
仮に EXECUTE がどんな LIR にも対応しないとして , このまま tracing を続けると何がおこるだろう .
賢明な読者諸氏は気付かれかもしれない(私は賢明でないのでだいぶ悩んだ)が , tracing 中はインタプリタも同時に動いている .
これがトリックの肝になる .
先に見たとおり , インタプリタは EXECUTE を解釈して ip を書き換える .
それに続く評価ループは呼び出されたメソッド( 書き換えた ip ) を実行する .
このとき tracing は継続したままだ .
従って呼び出したメソッドの IL も LIR に変換される .
その結果 , メソッドを呼び出し た Fragment の LIR には , 呼び出し先メソッドの LIR が追記されていく .
つまり メソッドがインライン化される .
もちろん仮想関数を素朴にインライン化するとトラブルになる. そこで trace2 ( ) の EXECUTE はガードを挟み , 呼び出すメソッドがインライン化したものと同じであることを保証している.
元と違うメソッドを呼び出そうとすると , ガードにかかってインタプリタに戻る. 参 考までに guardConstant ( ) のコードを載せておく .
EXECUTE は引数 p に VM のスタックポインタを渡している .
このときスタックの先頭には getforthimpl の戻り値が入っている :
void Interpreter :: guardConstant ( Box * p , const InterpState& state ) { LirWriter * lirout = tracefrag -> lirbuf -> writer ( ) ; LInsp rt_v = uselo ( p ) ; if ( !rt_v->isconst ( ) ) { // use guard to ensure value is const LInsp ct_v = lirout -> insImm ( p->i ) ; // p(スタックの先頭 ) が指す値と等しい定数を作る
LInsp cond = lirout -> ins ( LIR_eq , rt_v , ct_v ) ; // 定数とスタックの比較条件を作る guard ( LIR_xf , cond , state , 0 ) ; // その条件で分岐するガードの LIR を生成する ... } }
つまり , こんな AS のコードから ...:
public class Foo { public function bar ( ) : void { doSomething ( ) ; } } ... foo = new Foo( ) ; ... foo.bar ( ) ;
こんなかんじのネイティブコードができると考えればいい:
// クラス定義は省略 ... Foo* foo = new ( gc ) Foo( ) ; ... // 呼び出すメソッドをチェックする. vtbl は仮想関数テーブルをあらわす空想上の変数 if ( Foo::vtbl.bar != foo -> vtbl -> bar ) { goto side_exit_at_path_1 ; } doSomething ( ) ; // インライン化された bar ( ) の実装 .
ほんとは更にこいつもインライン化されるはず. ...
ガードを入れながらトレースするだけの至ってシンプルな仕組みで , 仮想関数がインライン化された. JIT の力を痛感する .
インライン化されれば関数をまたいだ最適化の恩恵にも与れる.
また tamarin - devel での議論をみていると , 将来の改善ではガードをループの外に追い出すような高速化も目論みにあるようす .
ABC のメソッドだけでなく , forth をコンパイルしてでき た IL ランタイムも同様にインライン展開される .
なお Sun の Hotspot Java VM は , クラス階層を分析することでチェックのいらない仮想関数をインライン化するという.
いまどき仮想関数テーブルとかいってるのは
C++ だけかもしらん. あー , JIT いいなあ ...
速いの？
基本的に JIT は速度のためにやるものなので , TC には TT より速くなってほしい .
外野は期待してしまうが , 先人ウォッチャーのベンチマーク によるとまだ TC より遅いらしい .
これは開発中だからというせいもあるだろうし , 実のところ速度で TC に勝つのが TT の目的なのかも怪しい .
各種紹介記事 ( これ とか これ ) は利点として消費資源の少なさを強調している.
モバイル向け VM が目的であるように見える .
部分的なコードしか JIT しないのと , アルゴリズムの単純さが省メモリに寄与するというわけ.
Sun の Hotspot Client VM はこれとは違い , 対話性を落とさないために インクリメンタルな JIT を導入するという触れ込みだった .
他にもサーバ VM を統合するなど , 色々と野心的なゴールを持っていた .
" 局所的な JIT " という部分だけを見ると Java hotspot VM も TT も 同じように見えてしまう .
けれど , ゴールは少し違っている .
もっとも Mozilla で採用するなら性能は無視できない要素だから , 結局は性能でも TC を越える必要があるのかもしれない .
紹介を読んだ時は期待していなかったけど , インライン化をみたら急に期待が強まった. 我ながらまったく勝手なもんです.
まとめ
といわけで Tamarin Tracing の JIT のコードを読んでみた .
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) , caught on tape
Given the Republican corruption scandals of the last couple of years , it ’s easy to get inured to the seriousness of the controversies .
After a while , names like DeLay , Cunningham , Ney , Foley , Lewis , and Burns start to blur together .
Which one was Abramoff ’s buddy ?
Which one took bribes from defense contractors ?
But as ongoing corruption scandals go , let ’s not lose sight of the world of trouble Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) is in .
An executive from oil company has already admitted to offering Stevens bribes , and today we learn that the senator ’s calls were being secretly taped by FBI investigators .
An Alaska oil contractor cooperated with the FBI by tape - recording phone calls with Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) as part of a public corruption investigation , a source familiar with the probe said last night .
The recordings done by former Veco Corp. chief executive Bill Allen mean that Stevens , who is the longest serving Republican in the Senate , was under scrutiny by the FBI much earlier than June , when the senator first acknowledged publicly that he was a subject of FBI inquiries .
The central focus of all of this stems from Veco Corp. , an oil - services company , remodeling Ted Stevens ’ house in an exclusive ski resort area .
After the lavish renovation was complete , Stevens steered $ 170 million in contracts to Veco , which , would n’t you know it , looked suspicious to the FBI .
So , Stevens appears to be in fairly big trouble .
The next question , of course , is why reporters do n’t seem to care .
A TPM reader hammered this point home :
Last night , news broke that the FBI had been taping phone calls placed to the senior Republican in the United States Senate as part of a bribery investigation stretching back more than a year .
In fact , the man alleged to have bribed the senator is cooperating with investigators , and the calls recorded included some he placed at the FBI ’s behest .
The Washington Post , always eager to cover political stories of national import , ran the news on page A10 .
Most papers gave it similar prominence , if they ran the item it at all .
Contrast that to the ( admittedly lurid ) tale of Norman Hsu , fronted by papers around the nation .
That was a case of a major donor to Democratic figures who turned out ( unbeknownst to the politicians to whom he donated ) to be a crook and a fraud .
That ’s big news .
But when a businessman who is a major donor to Republican politicians turns out to be a crook and a fraud , and some of the nation ’s senior legislators are revealed to have knowingly accepted his bribes and funneled him earmarks in return , it ’s hardly worth mentioning .
Where ’s the outrage ?
That ’s hardly an unreasonable question .
I got an email recently from a right - wing reader who was outraged that I have n’t been covering the Hsu scandal .
Truth be told , I ’m not entirely sure why Hsu is such a huge deal in the first place .
As far as I can tell , the story , in a nutshell , is this :
Hsu is accused of being a crook , who happened to raise a lot of money for Dems .
Now those Dems do n’t want his money .
And Hsu is probably going to jail .
This is a huge political story , why ?
It ’s not as if anyone had ever heard of Norman Hsu up until a few weeks ago .
But his trial is on the front page , while Stevens ’ sting operation is an afterthought .
The prior is some random crook who allegedly ran a Ponzi scheme ; the latter is a sitting member of the U.S. Senate , who appears to have taken bribes .
If it were some unknown GOP donor and a Democratic senator , would the circumstances be reversed ?

What followed was often so smutty that the BBC felt it could only be heard on Sunday lunchtimes , weekday early evenings , and by millions of people who would otherwise claim not to know a single dirty joke .
Samantha is the show 's fictional scorer , and has an active social life .
She once trained opera singers - " having seen what she did to the baritone , the director is keen to see what she might do for a tenor , " as Lyttelton put it - while her baking instructor " popped her bread rolls straight into his mouth and he 's promised to try her muffin next week " .
Of a builder , " she was pleased to see his tender won , but was startled when it suddenly grew to twice its size " .
Equally startled was Lyttelton , who every week managed to seem the victim rather than the perpetrator , a nice old man who had been slipped a verbal whoopee cushion by the impertinent comics he was reluctantly forced to keep in line .
Samantha is a croupier and often works at an exclusive Soho club where gamblers pay top money to play roulette all day and poker all night
Humphrey Lyttelton Barry Cryer , a panellist on the Radio 4 show since it started , and a friend of Lyttelton 's for more than 50 years , says : " He had this tired , patrician air about him and he would read the lines with an air of complete innocence .
" It would n't have worked if he had done it in a knowing way .
It was a shared experience with the audience , as he only seemed to realise what he had said at the same time as they did .
He had this brilliant gift of appearing not to know what he was doing . "
This became his act , but it was how the jazz musician had actually felt when he was unexpectedly asked to chair a panel game .
As he drove to the first show , he felt bewildered , embarrassed and grumpy .
" I 've hung on to that particular thought since 1972 , " he told an interviewer last year .
Even though he soon grew to love the programme , the persona never changed .
So while it might not have looked like a performing style , it was a very good one .
Ooo and er David Benson , an actor who has written and performed one - man West End shows about Kenneth Williams and Frankie Howerd , says performers have capitalised on their audience 's reaction in different ways .

" Howerd [ did ] the mock outrage ' how dare you ' approach .
Benny Hill and Max Miller would give a cheeky smile as if to say ' Aha !
Your minds are as dirty as mine ! '
There are many ways to play it , but of course it all begins and ends with good writing . "
Those comedians are long gone , and were it not for Lyttelton , it would be easy to think of British innuendo as being a century or so of history that first got its end up in the music halls , rubbed up against some saucy postcards along the way , then had a final , brilliant ( de ) flowering with Private Widdle and co in the Carry On films .
But try this for size , Samantha .
What is the " small miracle that hangs near a man 's thigh , stiff , strong , bold , brassy and pierced in front " ?
Shame on you .
It 's a key , or a sheath for a dagger .
Actually , we can only guess the clean half of the double entendre because it was written by an Anglo - Saxon monk more than 1,000 years ago .
Chaucer also loved a bit of innuendo , although the naughty bits were deleted from the editions at my school , and Shakespeare had a Benny Hill moment when he had Romeo 's friend Mercutio saying " the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon " .
The bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon
Mercutio in William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet Innuendo has always been with us , because it has always been useful .
Brett Mills , a lecturer in film and television studies at the University of East Anglia and an expert on situation comedy , says : " It allows us to refer to sex - a very repressed topic , especially in England - but as it's done comedically it does n't have the power or impact that a serious statement about sex might have . "
So while the BBC guidelines used to warn programme makers to avoid innuendo " at all costs " , writers and performers have never been able to live without it .
The Goon Show got round the ban with phrases like " pink oboe " and " vermillion sock " , which had been used in the armed forces but of which BBC managers were ignorant .
By the time Porridge came on screen in the 1970s , there was much more sexual innuendo permitted , but swearing was still tightly controlled , so a new word - " nerk " - had to be invented as a term of abuse .
Still at it But in societies that now talk about little except sex , do we still even need innuendo ?
Here come the naughty bits ...
Yes , one reason being that even in places like Britain , we can't talk about it in every situation .
'' There is more innuendo flying around the average office than in a decade of Carry On films , " says Benson .
It also allows the odd " dog whistle " to be broadcast to an adult audience .
For those who think Dr Who is just for kids , a sly reference to Captain Jack Harkness 's sexuality can seem like a reward for watching .
The fact that Benny Hill 's character Ernie , the fastest milkman in the West , " gets his cocoa " with Sue three times a week means that a tale of promiscuity and murder sits comfortably on my two - year - old daughter 's music compilation , along with Nellie the Elephant and You 're a Pink Toothbrush - although Graham Norton could do wonders with the latter .
And when she saw the size
Of his hot meat pies
It very near turned her head
Ernie ( the fastest milkman in the West ) by Benny Hill Dr Mills says a less restrictive climate might make innuendo less necessary .
" There 's still a lot of pleasure from it - Julian Clary says very obviously rude things , to the point where there 's almost no innuendo , and the pleasure is in that excess . "
Cryer says there was a reaction against the innuendo - filled 60s and 70s , and a feeling that " why do n't they say what they mean ? "
But he says that missed the point - the best innuendo still works because the audience admires its skill and enjoys working out the meaning .
He says Lyttelton 's air of innocence , and his immense popularity , enabled him to take the curse off what he was saying - meaning that he defused the content - but it may also be true that he took the curse off innuendo itself for those who'd come to think of it as naff ( another Porridge - ism used in place of ruder words ) .
As Samantha might have said , what a useful tool it is .
The March Hare may have urged Alice to " say what you mean " , but in our more confusing world , we will always need a way of not saying what we do mean .

Has any other culture got the beautiful comeback to a million innocuous statements , " As the actress said to the bishop " ?
Terry Weldon , Basildon
The normally humourless atmosphere of this office was lifted when I told the boss that " reception just called to say you 've got a big package " .
That was an entirely accidental innuendo , but one that had us all chortling for a long time afterwards .
Dennis Blandford , Richmond , UK I 'm a student of ceramics .
When handles are attached to mugs or pitchers , some potters carve hash - mark lines into the two surfaces that are to be joined , which is called " scoring . "
One day my professor gave a demonstration on this .
He was against scoring .
He said , " I have n't scored in three years , and my nobs have n't fallen off yet . "
Abigail Lundberg , Oregon , USA I personally feel this kind of thing leaves a nasty taste in one 's mouth , and that the perpetrators need to be taken firmly in hand .
Dave Lawrence , Portsmouth , Hants I remember Alan Davies on QI mentioning a pub which has a sign saying : " Liquor in the front , Poker in the rear " .
Innuendo is a wonderful thing , allowing adult humour to be expressed in mixed company .
Without it , many a best man 's speech ( my own included ) would be much less funny .
In my opinion , it may not be big , but it certainly is clever .
TS , Bromley , England Re Shakespeare 's " the bawdy hand of the hour is on the prick of noon " - I remember a footnote saying that " hour " at the time was pronounced similarly to whore " .
Sue H , London
In the modern world where pretty much anything goes , innuendo is rewarding precisely because of the skill and humour involved .
Where would we be without Terry Wogan 's exquisite Janet and John stories ?

The greatest thing about Humph was that I knew he'd leave me breathless after half an hour of fun every Monday night .
Mary Hinge , Bournemouth , UK Innuendo and double entendres work on several levels - they are more subtle than up - front humour , they challenge the audience to interpret it .
So it is interactive humour , and as the comedian is saying one thing , but it can be interpreted as something else , we are using that age old comedy device of the misunderstood - always a keystone or even foundation of comedy .
We can laugh at their cunning , or laugh at their innocence , depending how it is played .
Steb , Morecambe
The chaps at Viz comic elevated double - entendres almost to the stratosphere with their Finnbar Saunders strip - phrases such as " I 've got to get Mrs Gimlet to Oldham and then I 'm going to Bangor as fast as I can " - pure , utter filth , but only if you have the mindset and sense of humour to understand it .
RIP Humph , Radio 4 will never be the same again .
Stewart Mercer , Milton Keynes , UK I used to have tears or laughter running down my face some days when listening to Mark and Lard on Radio 1 - how they got away with some of their innuendos , I 'll never know .
Harry White , Aberdeen
The Goons had some interesting characters which slipped past the censors .
For example Hugh Jampton ( huge Hamton - if you need the rhyming slang translating ask a Cockney ) and the perennial baddie Gryptyne Thinn ( grip thyne thing ) .
Innuendo is also fun when , initially , unintended as in " The batsman is Holding , the bowler Willis " .
Or a comment on Joe Davis declining the rest during a snooker match , instead sprawling on the table : " Joe may be 68 but he can still get his leg over . "
Joe , Warrington Actually I think it was " the bowler 's Holding the batsman 's Willey " .
Vice versa works just as well .
Graham , York Sorry to be pedantic but the versions I 've heard were slightly different ( and even better ) .
The bowler in the cricket story was Peter Willey of Northants and England , to give us the line " the bowler 's holding , the batsman 's Willey " .
Joe Davis was trying a shot that he'd previously achieved by climbing partly on to the table but in view of his advancing years played the shot left - handed instead to allow the commentator to say " at the age of 68 , Jo has given up trying to get his leg over and has resorted to using his left hand " .
Priceless .
Mark , Pontypridd Humph 's deliciously dead - pan presenting style was exactly the same as Kenneth Horne on Round the Horn .
Those scripts were full of outrageous innuendoes innocently spoken by Horne in a completely normal voice , so the audience got two jokes for the price of one .
Mary , Islington Innuendo is possibly my favourite type of comedy , which is perhaps why I love Morrissey 's lyrics so much .
I may just have a filthy mind though , as I find innuendo all over the place .
It requires the audience to provide the punch line , so it can be lost on people of lesser intelligence - which has its own sense of satisfaction , like an inside joke .
A workmate recently sent an e-mail saying " Let me know when you have checked in the changes so I can get them out " and I had to suppress my laughter for ages .
It was quite hard , but I managed to pull it off .
Douglas Daniel , Glasgow , Scotland I do n't think innuendo is quite as witty as the article makes out .
Suggestions that it takes a great degree of intelligence to understand ?
Please ... wind yr neck in .
I remember dying of embarrassment sitting around the kitchen table on Sundays as a teenager while my parents cracked up to Humphrey Lyttelton 's little comments .
Did they honestly think a 13 - year - old boy would not understand ?
Most of it was as subtle as a brick in the face and it got tired very quickly .
Innuendo is not big , it 's not hard , and nobody is impressed .
Chris W , Houston , Tx Oh , Chris W , you just do n't get it do you ?
You just do n't get it .
Get it , Eh ???
Get IT ???
You just do n't get it ?
IIITTT ???
Eh ?
GET IIIIITTTTTTTTT
GET ... it ...
GET IT ...?
No ...
Er ... Get IT !!!
Ask your parents .
Cameron Seddon , Morecambe Funnily enough , this kind of humour hardly exists at all in America , where I live .
You need to regard sex as embarrassing or strange to find humour in it .
For better or worse this is an almost uniquely British phenomenon .

Click to viewA Dartmouth lecturer is suing her class for discrimination , as she revealed in a series of regrettable and bizarre emails that promptly ended up all over Dartmouth blogs .
Priya Venkatesan ( Dartmouth ' 90 , MS in Genetics , PhD in literature ) emailed members of her Winter '08 Writing 5 class Saturday night to announce her intention to seek damages from them for their being mean to her .
The email , and so , so much more , below :
Date : Sat , 26 Apr 2008 20:56:35
From : Priya Venkatesan
Subject : WRIT.005.17.18 -WI08 : Possible lawsuit
Dear former class members of Science , Technology and Society :
I tried to send an email through my server but got undelivered messages .
I regret to inform you that I am pursuing a lawsuit in which I am accusing some of you ( whom shall go unmentioned in this email ) of violating Title VII of anti-federal discrimination laws .
The feeling that I am getting from the outside world is that Dartmouth is considered a bigoted place , so this may not be news and I may be successful in this lawsuit .
I am also writing a book detailing my eperiences as your instructor , which will " name names " so to speak .
I have all of your evaluation and these will be reproduced in the book .
Have a nice day .
Anti-federal discrimination laws ?
That 's serious business .
Or whatever the exact opposite of serious business is .
The details of the discrimination and harassment ?
Students did n't pay attention to her , complained about her to her boss , and accused her of not " accepting opinions contrary to her own " and said she would " lower the grades of students her disagreed with her . "
In other words , the exact smarmy complaints all entitled college students level against inexperienced teachers .
From the Dartmouth News :
As an example of Venkatesan 's rejection of views different from her own , the student highlighted Venkatesan 's cancelation of class for a week after the class applauded a student who contradicted Venkatesan 's opinions about post - modernism .
Venkatesan said the incident occurred when she was lecturing about " The Death of Nature , " a book by Carolyne Merchant , and the witch trials of the Renaissance .
The student went on a " diatribe " about the inappropriate nature of challenging patriarchal authority , Venkatesan said .
Vakatesan respected the student 's right to express this opinion , she said , but the manner in which he vocalized his views and the applause afterward were disrespectful and offensive .
" I was horrified , " Venkatesan said .
" My responsibility is not to stifle them , but when they clapped at his comment , I thought that crossed the line ... I was facing intolerance of ideas and intolerance of freedom of expression . "
She was horrified !
Horrified that an Ivy League undergrad bitched about hearing some academic nonsense about the entrenched power structures that got them where they are today !
( No winners in this story , folks . )
The emails apparently started last Friday , when Venkatesan emailed seven or more students to warn of a " possible lawsuit " against them .

Subject : Class Action Suit
Dear Student :
As a courtesy , you are being notified that you are being named in a potential class action suit that is being brought against Dartmouth College , which is being accused of violating federal anti-discrimination laws .
Please do not respond to this email because it will be potentially used against you in a court of law .
Priya Venkatesan , PhD
From : Priya Venkatesan
Sent : Friday , April 25 , 2008
Subject : Class Action Suit
Dear Student :
Please disregard the previous email sent by Priya Venkatesan .
This is to officially inform you that you are being accused of violating Title VII pertaining to federal anti-discrimination laws , by the plaintiff , Priya Venkatesan .
You are being specifically accused of , but not limited to , harassment .
Please do not respond to this email as it will be used against you in a court of law .
Priya Venkatesan , PhD
In a statement to Dartblog , Venkatesan reveals that she 's retained an attorney from New Hampshire , and that she has absolutely no clue what a class - action suit is or how it works .
The students I am naming in this suit were mostly from Winter 08 term with a few from Fall .
Essentially , I am pursuing litigation to see if I have a legal claim , that is , if the inappropriate and unprofessional behavior I was subjected to as a Research Associate and Lecturer at Dartmouth constitutes discrimination and harrassment [ sic ] on the basis of ethnicity , race and gender .
This includes not just students , but a few faculty members that I worked with .
Possibly on the advice of her lawyer , Venkatesan is now making it more clear that she 's suing Dartmouth for harassment by her superior in the writing program , but she wo n't let go of her brilliant idea to also sue the students who did n't like her very much .
According to her Dartmouth bio , Venkatesan 's " current position is as Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School , which will form the basis of [ her ] latest manuscript , A Postmodernist in the Laboratory . "
We can't believe her bio leaves out the fact that this manuscript will " name names " ( so to speak ) .

Although behavioral studies clearly indicate that exposure to drugs , alcohol and tobacco in utero is bad for a baby 's developing brain , specific anatomic brain effects have been hard to tease out in humans .
Often users do n't limit themselves to one substance , and demographic factors like poverty can also influence brain development .
Now , an NIH - funded study using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scans , led by Children 's Hospital Boston neurologist Michael Rivkin , MD , suggests that prenatal exposure to cocaine , alcohol , marijuana or tobacco ( alone or in combination ) may have effects on brain structure that persist into early adolescence .
The findings , published in the April issue of Pediatrics , are of public health significance , the researchers say , since it 's estimated that more than 1 million babies born annually in the United States have been exposed to at least one of these agents in utero .
Researchers at Children 's and Boston Medical Center employed volumetric MRI imaging to study the brain structure of 35 young adolescents prenatally exposed to cocaine , marijuana , alcohol or tobacco .
The children , who averaged 12 years old at the time of imaging , were part of part of an historic cohort of children assembled by Deborah Frank , MD at Boston Medical Center and followed there since birth .
Prenatal exposures were confirmed by a combination of maternal history , urine testing of the mother or urine or meconium ( stool ) testing of the infants at birth .
" We found that reductions in cortical gray matter and total brain volumes were associated with prenatal exposure to cocaine , alcohol or cigarettes , " says Rivkin , who is first author on the study .
" Importantly , although volume reductions were associated with each of these three prenatal exposures , they were not associated with any one of these substances alone after controlling for other exposures . "
Notably , the effects were found to be additive - the more substances a child was exposed to in utero , the greater the reduction in brain volume .
Rivkin notes that the study is also the first to document joint long - term neuroanatomic effects on the brain of prenatal cocaine , cigarette and alcohol exposures .
Moreover , while previous studies have documented brain effects of prenatal alcohol exposure , these studies were mostly limited to children with fetal alcohol syndrome , a diagnosis that was excluded in the current study .
Although investigators initially set out to study cocaine exposure , they were struck by the finding of brain effects of prenatal tobacco exposure .
" Approximately 20 percent of women who smoke continue to smoke during pregnancy , " Rivkin says .
" From the vantage point of preventive health care , it is important to determine the consequences on brain structure of prenatal exposure to cigarettes , alone and in combination with other substances . "
Rivkin emphasizes that the number of children studied was too small to find statistically significant effects of single substances after controlling for exposure to other agents .
The study was also too small to consider the effects of different levels of exposure .
But the overall results are highly suggestive .
" We 're hopeful to be able to study the whole sample of 150 children followed at Boston Medical Center , which will permit such determinations , " Rivkin says .
Both investigators concur that health care providers should offer pregnant women comprehensive care to help them reduce use of all psychoactive substances .
Public health campaigns should not ignore the risks of some substances while focusing on others , as it may well be that the greater the number of total prenatal exposures , the higher the chance there will be adverse and lasting consequences for the developing brain .

Moreover , immense federal deficits in modern life are financed largely by foreign buyers of our debt .
This means that the American taxpayer must work a good chunk of the year to send money to China , Japan , the petro-states and other buyers of United States debt .
In effect , we become their peons .
By flooding the world with debt , we in effect beg foreigners to take our dollars , and this leads to a lower value of the dollar and a higher cost of imports , including oil .
If you feel pain filling up the tank , you can partly thank those tax cuts .
If you feel the sting of inflation , you can partly thank the supply siders .
Deficits matter .
What to do ?
You appear to have changed your mind over time and have recently shown more support for the Bush tax cuts than in the past .
If you become president , you can just keep up the ( latter - day ) Republican game of make - believe .
You can propose still more tax cuts , create still more deficits and add to the debt , and say to yourself , like Louis XV , “ Après moi , le déluge . ”
Or , you can raise taxes .
But whom to tax ?
The poor are , well , poor .
The middle class is struggling to pay for its middle - class life .
That leaves the rich .
It would be lovely if we did not have to tax them .
Many have worked hard for their money .
Many have created useful businesses .
Many of them are fine people .
But as Willie Sutton said when asked why he robbed banks , “ Because that ’s where the money is . ”
By definition , the truly rich have a lot more money than they need .
If they do n’t , then they are not rich by my standards .
The first step toward putting our house in order , once we are past the seemingly looming recession , is much higher taxes on the truly rich and serious enforcement to prevent offshore tax evasion .
TO put it even more starkly , the government  which is us  needs the money to keep old people alive , to pay for their dialysis , to build fighter jets and to pay our troops and pay interest on the debt .
We can get it by indenturing our children , selling ourselves into peonage to foreigners , making ourselves a colony again , generating inflation  or we can have some integrity and levy taxes equal to what we spend .
You are probably the bravest man to have a chance at being elected president in my lifetime .
Do you have the guts to stand up to the myth makers and tax cutters and the rich ?
Or will you just kick the can down the road ?
ONCE upon a time , not all that long ago , there existed a magical country that was a lot like the United States , only less expensive .
Its enchanted currency  the other dollar  allowed Americans to indulge as they could not back home .
This delightful fantasyland was called Canada , and for centuries it was synonymous with frugality .
No more .
With the precipitous decline of the United States dollar , Canada has slid off the budget - travel map , and nowhere is the challenge to stay frugal greater than in Toronto , a city of 2.5 million whose ascendancy is not merely attributable to fluctuating exchange rates .
Toronto has , in recent years , become a hub of development , an eating - and - shopping paradise and even a celebrity magnet : Jay - Z held his bachelor party at the Lobby Bar and Restaurant , where the Zen Margarita costs a whopping 25 Canadian dollars ( about $ 25 U.S. , give or take a buck , since the two currencies have been close to parity since last fall ) .
As the Frugal Traveler , however , I live for this sort of challenge , and so in late April , I set off for Hogtown  so nicknamed for the abattoirs that once dotted downtown  to attempt a weekend of revelry on a budget of $ 500 .
I arrived early on a sunny Friday afternoon , winging in on Porter Airlines , a budget carrier that at the end of March began nonstop service from Newark ( with one - way fares as low as $ 99 ; see www.flyporter.com).
Not only was the flight itself surprisingly pleasant ( free red wine  in an actual glass ! ) , but it landed me at the City Centre Airport , on an island but right downtown , just a 400 - foot ferry ride away .
From that ferry , the 15 - minute walk to my hotel began to reveal to me the city ’s many facets .
To begin , there was that skyline  the dome of the Rogers Centre and the jumble of skyscrapers , all anchored by the iconic , 1,815 - foot CN Tower straining heavenward like a space ship .
Closer to my path , I saw crisp apartment buildings , green parks interleaved among the highways , a skein of railroad tracks threading into the distance and the excavated foundations of coming luxury condos .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior World Bank official said on Thursday that countries should not greatly increase biofuels production until there is more clarity about how much they have contributed to the global food price crisis .

REUTERS / Nasser Nuri
Juergen Voegele , director for agriculture and rural development department at the World Bank , cautioned against shifting a lot of the blame to biofuels but also said massive subsidies for the biofuel industry was not helping the crisis .
“ We do n’t think it ’s advisable to vilify biofuels and make it responsible for all evil at the moment , nor do we think we can continue to support biofuels the way it is supported at the moment in many countries , ” Voegele told Reuters .
He said the World Bank was analyzing biofuels on several fronts , including its economic , environmental and social value .
“ The interlinkages with food production are complex , and we need to get a much better understanding of what is sustainable in the long run , ” said Voegele .
“ There are a lot of expectations that second and third - generation biofuels will have better economic , environmental and social balance sheets . ”
Experts blame the food crisis on the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuel , as well as drought , changing diets in fast - growing developing countries and more expensive fuel .
Riots in poor Asian , African and Latin American countries have followed the steep rise in food prices , which has also prompted governments to revert to old and potentially damaging controls .
Anti-poverty activists argue that the biofuels industry is exacerbating the crisis by diverting needed crops , while a leading U.S. - based agricultural research group has called for a moratorium on grain - and oilseed - based biofuels to help cut crop prices substantially .
The Bush administration has defended its corn- based ethanol policy , saying it accounts for somewhere between 2 percent and 3 percent of the overall increase in global food prices .
“ This is a debate that is taking place right now ; different models give us different results and it will take us time to figure this out , but we are actively studying it , ” Voegele said .
NO RESPITE SOON
Still , he said the World Bank did not expect the crisis to ease any time soon , and the development agency was advising between 30 to 50 countries on ways to deal with higher prices , cautioning them against actions that disrupt supplies .
“ Overall , we see supply responses in all these crops , but it ’s also not going away very quickly , ” he said , noting that increased supplies had lowered wheat prices over the past six weeks , although they remained at historical highs .
Voegele said the World Bank had warned for several years about increasing food price volatility but “ no one can claim they saw this coming the way it has actually happened . ”
World Food Program Executive Director Josette Sheeran has referred to the crisis as “ the silent tsunami ” that threatens to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger .
Voegel said the crisis was not as much about shortages as it is about countries , especially in the developing world , struggling to deal with sharply higher prices .
He said there were “ clear indications ” that global grains stocks are too low and need to be rebuilt .
Voegele said there were measures being taken to urgently deal with the crisis and said the World Bank welcomed statements by Southeast Asia nations on cooperation on rice .
“ We really hope the rice - producing countries and the rice - consuming countries -- they overlap to a large extent -- get together and work out trading arrangements that are beneficial at the regional and global level , and we certainly see that happening , ” he added .
Voegele said the food crisis had highlighted the need for governments to rebuild agricultural sectors , which have been neglected over the years because food prices were low .
“ I think it ’s a wake - up call and we certainly think the international community needs to invest more in international agricultural research to get more productivity increases in the next few years , to allow countries to climate - proof their agriculture , ” he added .

Glenn Reynolds , the law professor and " Instapundit " blogger , wrote that he recently needed to write on a new , HP Mini-Note :
That it is now getting attention in the mainstream , as more , smaller , less expensive and mobile PCs are becoming available , is noteworthy .
But whether it was free or not would n't make much of a difference if it did n't work .
A quick look at the OOo 3.0 beta on this end was a little mixed .
The suite has a friendly , new " Welcome " screen that is icon-based and permits quick navigation to either Writer , Calc , Base or any of the other apps in the suite .
According to the release announcement , " Behind the scenes , OpenOffice.org 3.0 will support the upcoming OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) 1.2 standard , and is capable of opening files created with MS - Office 2007 or MS - Office 2008 for Mac OS X ( .docx , .xlsx , .pptx , etc. ) .
This is in addition to read and write support for the MS - Office binary file formats ( .doc , .xls , .ppt , etc. ) . "
Do n't underestimate support for Office 2008 or Office 2008 for Mac - - the portability of documents and files between platforms has become more and more solid with each , new OOo release .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 loads on a Vista for Business - based PC in about two seconds , compared with about seven seconds to load version 2.4 on the same system .
Opening documents and applications is quick , too .
The community has made solid ease - of - use improvements to Calc and Base .
( Although Base is still light years behind Microsoft Access . )
OOo 3.0 is lighter , faster and , cosmetically , friendlier than earlier versions .
The bad news :
The beta crashed a few times while trying to save a text document to the server .
( The stable , 2.4 version has never crashed on this PC in more than a month of heavy use so it could be a beta issue .
More testing will be needed to try to narrow it down . )
As the 3.0 version gets closer to launch and code stability later this year , we 'll have a full - blown review .
For now , though , that launch may be shaping up as another Excedrin moment in Redmond .
Update : Paul Thurrott disagrees and , among other things , says Office does n't cost $ 499 .

Advertisement Russian tanks and intercontinental missile launchers have been paraded through Moscow for the first time since the collapse of the USSR .
The Russian leadership has decided to revive the Communist - era custom of featuring military hardware in the annual Victory Day parade .
New President Dmitry Medvedev said the army and navy were getting stronger .
Observers say the point of the parade was to demonstrate that Russia is a serious military force .
The Kremlin insists the event , which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 , is not meant to threaten anyone .
President Medvedev , who was inaugurated on Wednesday , has been leading the parade on Red Square .
Cheering crowds lined the streets everywhere with their mobile phones and digital cameras out to record every passing ICBM , tank and jet
Justin N , Moscow
Readers ' views on parade " Our army and navy are gaining strength " , he said .
" And in their power today lies the historical glory of Russian arms , therein lies the traditions of victory and the high spirit of our army . "
His predecessor , Vladimir Putin , said earlier that the display of heavy weapons in this year 's Victory Day parade was " not sabre - rattling " , but " a demonstration of our growing defence capability " .
Show of military might Marching bands and 8,000 troops goose - stepped across Red Square , and heavy weapons such as Topol - M ballistic missiles and T - 90 tanks were on display .
The cobbles of Red Square had been reinforced , in advance of the parade , to cope with the tanks and other heavy weaponry .

Television stations showed soldiers marching in cities around the country , as well as veterans with chests laden with medals .
Russia has made other recent shows of its military capability , including the resumption of long - range flights by the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber , an icon of the old Soviet arsenal .
But analysts say that despite these signs of military might , there is evidence of the Russian army and navy suffering from lack of money , a shortage of training , and low morale .
The BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow says conscripts in the army can be subjected to shocking brutality .
Last year 450 conscripts died from beatings or suicide .

What are these ?
In an effort to circumvent contribution limits , the governor and his associates disguised the source of the contributions by listing them under other people ’s names , the indictment alleges .

In return for the Pennsylvania contributions , the indictment says , Mr. Acevedo helped the business executives obtain contracts from Puerto Rican government agencies for themselves and their clients .
During the governor ’s successful 2004 gubernatorial bid , the indictment says , Puerto Rican business executives made large and unreported donations to the campaign  as much as $ 50,000 apiece  by disguising them as payments to the campaign ’s public relations and media company .
The campaign would paper over the contributions by drawing up fake invoices to make them appear to be payments for legitimate business expenses .
The indictment also accuses Mr. Acevedo of spending campaign funds on personal expenses and illegally failing to report it on his income tax returns .
Federal officials say that Mr. Acevedo used this money to pay for family vacations in Miami , Orlando and China ; to pay for $ 57,000 worth of “ high - end ” clothing ; and to pay personal credit card bills .
The investigation had been a lively topic of conversation and speculation in Puerto Rico ’s political circles since it began ; in the absence of many hard facts about what invesitgators were finding , rumor became the operative currency .
In recent months , the consensus among political analysts and politicians had been that Mr. Acevedo would probably escape charges but could be named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator .
So news that the governor himself had been indicted seemed to take even the most seasoned and jaded members of the island ’s political class by surprise .
But it also produced something of a collective exhalation , and allowed the island to pass from the wilderness of gossip to the stark realities of a federal criminal case .
Not surprisingly , the indictment dominated the island ’s news media on Thursday , as well as conversations in the workplace and around the kitchen table .
As magazines and newspapers hunt for the new thing they need to be to thrive in the Internet era , some find that part of the answer lies in the old thing they used to be .
Publications are rediscovering their archives , like a person learning that a hand - me - down coffee table is a valuable antique .
For magazines and newspapers with long histories , especially , old material can be reborn on the Web as an inexpensive way to attract readers , advertisers and money .
Sports Illustrated , which faces fierce daily , even hourly , competition with ESPN , Yahoo Sports and others , has something its main rivals do not : a 53 - year trove of articles and photos , most of it from an era when the magazine dominated the field of long - form sports writing and color sports photography .
On Thursday , the magazine will introduce the Vault , a free site within SI.com that contains all the words Sports Illustrated has ever published and many of the images , along with video and other material , in a searchable database .

It is a bit strange : China ’s totalitarian state has taken notes from the United States and Britian , where the control grid is rather advanced .
Alexander Lew reports for Wired :
Imagine the lines that commuters will have to face once Beijing introduces security checkpoints in its subway system starting June .
Just like in American airports , there are rules regarding bringing liquids onboard .
But instead of the 3 - 1 - 1 rule where airport passengers have to pack 3 oz .
bottles in a quart size bag , passengers on the subway will be required to drink their bottled liquids to prove that it is not a hazardous material .
In addition to x-ray machines , dogs will be stationed at transit stops to sniff out banned liquids .
Bangkok ’s MRT subway already has security checkpoints at entrances , where guards manually check every bag that enters the system .
Commuters are expecting long lines ( and frustrated passengers ) , especially at rush hour .
The subway carried 4.3 million passengers on April 30 , breaking its record for the highest daily traffic .
The Littlest Big Bang
Scientists are building ultra-cold systems that mimic the most extreme edges of the universe .
Can these analogues help solve the big bang ’s mysteries ?
Amazon EC2 users now have access to a pair of new “ High - CPU ” instance types .
The new instance types have proportionally more CPU power than memory , and are suitable for CPU - intensive applications .
Here ’s what ’s now available :
The High - CPU Medium Instance is billed at $ 0.20 ( 20 cents ) per hour .
It features 1.7 GB of memory , 5 EC2 Compute Units ( 2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units Each ) , and 350 GB of instance storage , all on a 32 - bit platform .
The High - CPU Extra Large Instance is billed at $ 0.80 ( 80 cents ) per hour .
It features 7 GB of memory , 20 EC2 Compute Units ( 8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units each ) , and 1,690 GB of instance storage , all on a 64 - bit platform .
The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator now supports these new instance types .
We ’ve been working with a number of tool vendors to line up early support for this important new feature .
I plan to update the blog post several times in the coming days as this support becomes available .

GIFT GRIPE VS .
GOPER|BIDDING TO REPLACE QNS .
SEX - SCANDAL POLA complaint filed against a Republican running to replace scandal - scarred ex-Councilman Dennis Gallagher claims the candidate used his position as a Board of Elections Commissioner to get campaign donations and gifts from subordinates .
The anonymous complaint , filed with four city agencies – including the Conflicts of Interest Board and the Campaign Finance Board – alleges that Anthony Como abused his position as a Queens Republican Elections Commissioner .
Como – who is the Queens County GOP committee ’s choice to win the June 3 special election – strongly denied the allegations .
“ Mr. Como has flagrantly violated the law multiple times , ” reads the complaint , which was obtained by The Post .
“ He . . . has solicited and accepted contributions from many Board of Elections employees [ subordinates ] over whom he had direct control and authority . ”
Filings with the CFB show Como took eight donations from board employees in late March and early April .
The complaint also claims Como took gifts from board employees for his wedding , including a trip for himself and his wife worth more than $ 1,000 , even though most of the subordinates invited to his wedding “ had no prior or personal relationship with ” him .
COIB rules prohibit officials from asking subordinates to donate to campaigns .
Como called the allegations “ bulls - – – ” and said he never asked his workers for anything .
He said the one trip he ’s ever been on with his wife “ was my honeymoon , ” and that no employees paid for it .
He initially said he could n’t have taken donations from board employees because he resigned his position on April 18 , when the special election was called , and did n’t form his committee until then .
He later acknowledged the campaign account was opened earlier , but said he had held one campaign kickoff event and did n’t solicit donations for it .
He called the allegations “ absolutely atrocious and disgusting ” and said he and his wife were owed apologies .
Gallagher , who represented Middle Village , resigned his seat last month as part of a plea deal in which he admitted to misdemeanor sex - abuse charges with no jail time in a case that began with a rape allegation from a woman he met at a local bar last year .
Gallagher , a Republican , told The Post recently that he thought he could have been cleared .
“ I believe that had this gone to trial , I would have been vindicated , ” Gallagher said .

Mr Holmes was alarmed by the level of unemployment and poverty
Undersecretary General John Holmes said it was the result of Israel closing its border crossings and the " limited food and other materials " allowed in .
Mr Holmes said 80 % of Gaza 's 1.5 m population now depended on food aid .
Israeli spokesman Mark Regev said the situation could " very quickly return to where it was " if rocket attacks ceased .
Israel tightened its blockade of Gaza last month after a sharp rise in rocket attacks by militants based there .
The restrictions prompted militants from the Islamist movement Hamas , which controls Gaza , to blast holes in the border with Egypt on 23 January .
The breaches were sealed by Egyptian security forces only on 3 February , by which time hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had taken the opportunity to cross into Egypt and obtain essential supplies .
' Basic dignity denied '
As part of a four - day visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories , Mr Holmes toured the Shifa Hospital , the largest in the Gaza Strip , and the Karni industrial zone near the closed cargo crossing on the Israeli border .
" I have been shocked by the grim and miserable things I have seen and heard about during the day , " he told reporters at the main UN compound in Gaza City .
What is essentially needed is an opening of the crossings , a lot more goods coming in
John Holmes
UN Undersecretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs
" [ They ] are the result of the current restrictions on the crossings into Gaza , and the very limited amounts of foods and other materials being allowed in . "
Mr Holmes , who is also the UN 's emergency relief co-ordinator , said the level of goods entering Gaza had dropped to 10 % of what it was a year ago .
He said the Israeli restrictions had led to the collapse of the territory 's economy , which in turn caused widespread unemployment and poverty .
As a result , some 80 % of Gazans now depended on food aid , he added .
" All this makes for a grim human and humanitarian situation here in Gaza , which means that people are not able to live with the basic dignity to which they are entitled , " he said .
" So what is essentially needed is an opening of the crossings , a lot more goods coming in . "
Raw Story vs. The White House : The Saga Continues Eric Brewer
Published : Wednesday April 16 , 2008

Print This Email This After I embarrassed Dana Perino last month over President Bush 's claim that if we leave Iraq , al Qaeda will take over Iraq 's oil , some of you speculated that she 'd never call on me again .
On Monday I got to test that theory .
But let 's back up a minute .
After my story came out , I wondered whether the White House would continue to make that claim .
So when Bush gave another speech on Iraq last Thursday , in which he announced that he was deciding to do what he had previously instructed Petraeus to advise him to do , I checked to see if he was still using the al - Qaeda - is - going - to - steal - all - the - oil argument .
And what do you know , it was gone : " If we fail there , al Qaeda would claim a propaganda victory of colossal proportions , and they could gain safe havens in Iraq from which to attack the United States , our friends and our allies . "
But my victory was short - lived .
Just three hours later on Sean Hannity 's radio show , Dick Cheney did it again : Q
If we pull out too early , what do you believe the consequences would be ?
THE VICE PRESIDENT : [...]
For us to walk away from Iraq I think would have at least that bad an effect , probably worse , because if al Qaeda were to take over big parts of Iraq , among other things , they would acquire control of a significant oil resource .
Iraq has almost 100 billion barrel reserves , producing 2.5 - 3 million barrels of oil a day .
If you take a terrorist organization like al Qaeda and give it that kind of revenue , there 's no telling the amount of trouble they could get into .
I figure that it was Dick 's idea in the first place .
He 's too fond of it to let go .
So I went in Monday to give Dana one more chance to explain how this might work .
Is it really plausible that 25 million Iraqis would allow their oil wealth to be siphoned off by a few thousand foreign terrorists ?
Would Exxon , or Shell , or even China , really buy oil from al Qaeda ?
I got a prime seat in the middle of the second row ( the Washington Post reporter did n't show ) and held my hand up throughout the half - hour briefing .
Dana called on reporters to my right .
She called on reporters to my left .
She even called on a reporter sitting two rows behind me .
But she did n't call on me .
The AP reporter who traditionally has the job of shutting down the briefing by saying " thank you " after the questioning has run its course noticed that I was being ignored , and she held off for as long as she could but finally gave in .
( She advised me later that I should email Cheney 's office to get an answer .
That 's no fun . )
So now we know why White House reporters ask so many brain - numbingly boring questions at the briefings .
Step out of line , and you 're silenced .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush ’s decision to intervene in setting air pollution standards is part of a longstanding administration pattern of meddling in environmental science , watchdog groups said on Friday .

In cases this week dealing with polar bears , ozone smog and environmental research , groups that monitor these decisions faulted the Bush administration for slighting science in favor of politics .
Bush overruled officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken U.S. standards for smog - forming ozone meant to protect parks , crops and wildlife .
On Wednesday , the agency tightened a different ozone standard aimed at protecting human health , but not as much as its own scientists unanimously recommended .
Asked why the president intervened , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said : “ What we were trying to do on the smog decision was try to have a decision that was consistent with our interpretation of the statute .
This was not a weakening of regulations or standards governing ozone , but it was an effort to make those standards consistent . ”
Environmental and scientific groups disagreed , saying the decision benefits coal - fired power plants and other industries that emit ground - level ozone .
In addition to harming plants , ozone smog endangers human health , especially the young , the elderly and those with respiratory problems .
“ This is a pattern unfortunately that extends across the Environmental Protection Agency , across pretty much every science based agency in the federal government , ” said Tim Donaghy of the Union of Concerned Scientists .
‘ AN EPIDEMIC OF INTERFERENCE ’
“ In the last several years , there has been an epidemic of interference in the work of scientists , ” Donaghy said by telephone .
“ And often this happens because interfering in the science is an easy way in winning the battle over the policy . ”
The Clean Air Act , which includes the ozone standards , forbids consideration of any other factor but science in making this kind of decision .
But in announcing the new standards on Wednesday , EPA chief Stephen Johnson suggested the act should be changed to include economic factors .
The ozone decision showed that “ real science appears to have been tainted by political science , ” said Frank O’Donnell , president of Clean Air Watch .
Mark Wenzler of the National Parks Conservation Association concurred .
“ The scientists carefully explained what needed to be done to protect plants and wildlife and the administration completely ignored the science and decided it would protect industry from having to do anything in addition to what they ’re doing , ” he said .
On another front , the EPA drew criticism for closing some of its 26 research libraries to save money .
The Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , said the changes “ could have impaired the continued delivery of library materials and services to its staff and the public . ”
In practice , the library move meant scientists who ca n’t get to EPA libraries have to go online , where only about 10 percent of the agency ’s collections are available .
On Monday , environmental groups sued the Interior Department for failing to meet a court deadline to decide whether polar bears are threatened by climate change under the Endangered Species Act .
The EPA said its lawyers were still considering the case .

Napoleon ’s post - mortem said he died of stomach cancer aged 51 , but the theory he was assassinated to prevent any return to power has gained credence in recent decades as some studies indicated his body contained a high level of the poison arsenic .
“ It was not arsenic poisoning that killed Napoleon at Saint Helena , ” said researchers at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics and the University of Pavia who tested the theory the British killed him while he was in exile on the South Atlantic island in 1821 .
The Italian research -- which studied hair samples from various moments in his life which are kept in museums in Italy and France -- showed Napoleon ’s body did have a high level of arsenic , but that he was already heavily contaminated as a boy .
The scientists used a nuclear reactor to irradiate the hairs to get an accurate measure of the levels of arsenic .
Looking at hairs from several of Napoleon ’s contemporaries , including his wife and son , they found arsenic levels were generally much higher than is common today .
“ The result ?
There was no poisoning in our opinion because Napoleon ’s hairs contain the same amount of arsenic as his contemporaries , ” the researchers said in a statement published on the university ’s website .
The study found the samples taken from people living in the early 1800s contained 100 times as much arsenic than the current average .
Glues and dyes commonly used at the time are blamed for high environmental levels of the toxic element .
“ The environment in which people lived in the early 1800s evidently caused the intake of quantities of arsenic that today we would consider dangerous , ” the scientists said .
One theory was that Napoleon was poisoned accidentally by arsenic vapor from dyes in his wallpaper at Saint Helena , but the study showed there was no massive increase in arsenic levels in his latter years .
“ It is clear that one cannot talk about a case of poisoning , but of a constant absorption of arsenic , ” the researchers said .
Napoleon had been exiled once before -- on the Italian island of Elba after his failed invasion of Russia .
But he returned to France and was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815 after which he was sent to the much more remote Saint Helena .
CARACAS , Venezuela  President Hugo Chávez has used his decree powers to carry out a major overhaul of this country ’s intelligence agencies , provoking a fierce backlash here from human rights groups and legal scholars who say the measures will force citizens to inform on one another to avoid prison terms .
Under the new intelligence law , which took effect last week , Venezuela ’s two main intelligence services , the DISIP secret police and the DIM military intelligence agency , will be replaced with new agencies , the General Intelligence Office and General Counterintelligence Office , under the control of Mr. Chávez .
The new law requires people in the country to comply with requests to assist the agencies , secret police or community activist groups loyal to Mr. Chávez .
Refusal can result in prison terms of two to four years for most people and four to six years for government employees .
“ We are before a set of measures that are a threat to all of us , ” said Blanca Rosa Mármol de León , a justice on Venezuela ’s top court , in a rare public judicial dissent .
“ I have an obligation to say this , as a citizen and a judge .
This is a step toward the creation of a society of informers . ”
Does playing violent video games make players aggressive ?
It is a question that has taxed researchers , sociologists , and regulators ever since the first console was plugged into a TV and the first shots fired in a shoot 'em up game .
Writing May 14 in the International Journal of Liability and Scientific Enquiry , Patrick Kierkegaard of the University of Essex , England , suggests that there is scant scientific evidence that video games are anything but harmless and that they do not lead to real world aggression .
Moreover , his research shows that previous work is biased towards the opposite conclusion .
Video games have come a long way since the simplistic ping - pong and cascade games of the early 1970s , the later space - age Asteroids and Space Invaders , and the esoteric Pac-man .
Today , severed limbs , drive - by shootings , and decapitated bodies captivate a new generation of gamers and gruesome scenes of violence and exploitation are the norm .
Award - winning video games , such as the Grand Theft Auto series , thrive on murder , theft , and destruction on every imaginable level explains Kierkegaard , and gamers boost their chances of winning the game by a virtual visit to a prostitute with subsequent violent mugging and recovery of monies exchanged .
Games such as ' 25 To Life ' remain controversial with storylines involving violent gangs taking hostages and killing cops , while games such as World of Warcraft and Doom are obviously unrelated to the art of crochet or gentle country walks .
Kierkegaard points out that these violent games are growing more realistic with each passing year and most relish their plots of violence , aggression and gender bias .
But , he asks , " Is there any scientific evidence to support the claims that violent games contribute to aggressive and violent behaviour ? "
Media scare stories about gamers obsessed with violent games and many research reports that claim to back up the idea that virtual violence breeds real violence would seem to suggest so .
However , Kierkegaard has studied a range of such research papers several of which have concluded since the early 1980s that video games can lead to juvenile delinquency , fighting at school and during free play periods and violent criminal behaviour such as assault and robbery .
Evidence from brain scans carried out while gamers play also seem to support a connection between playing video games and activation of regions of the brain associated with aggression .
However , Kierkegaard explains , there is no obvious link between real - world violence statistics and the advent of video games .
If anything , the effect seems to be the exact opposite and one might argue that video game usage has reduced real violence .
Despite several high profile incidents in US academic institutions , " Violent crime , particularly among the young , has decreased dramatically since the early 1990s , " says Kierkegaard , " while video games have steadily increased in popularity and use .
For example , in 2005 , there were 1,360,088 violent crimes reported in the USA compared with 1,423,677 the year before .
" With millions of sales of violent games , the world should be seeing an epidemic of violence , " he says , " Instead , violence has declined . "
Research is inconclusive , emphasises Kierkegaard .
It is possible that certain types of video game could affect emotions , views , behaviour , and attitudes , however , so can books , which can lead to violent behaviour on those already predisposed to violence .
The inherent biases in many of the research studies examined by Kierkegaard point to a need for a more detailed study of video games and their psychological effects .
The Oddworld series has quite a history .
Games have appeared on the PlayStation , Game Boy , Game Boy Color , Game Boy Advance , and Xbox .
A new game has been discovered and is currently in development .
Although there is no firm platform announced , there are quite a few details on the title .
There ’s a new 3D system in the works which allows for a 1:1 ratio for cinematic - like animation quality .
Also , there is a hint that when the game releases , there will be episodic content to accompany it as well .
Because the latest iteration of Oddworld released on the Xbox , the new game points to a 360 release .
However , based on the history of the series , it ’s possible that this title will release on either the PlayStation 3 or Wii .

Now , this , I like to see .
John McCain is a campaign finance criminal .
The punditry can’t grasp that fact about their darling .
But , the DNC gets it .
They ’re going to court to stop McCain ’s illegal activities :
Democratic Party officials want a federal judge to order an investigation into whether Sen .
John McCain violated election laws by withdrawing from public financing , saying federal regulators are too weak to act on their own .
A lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission , to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court , questions the agency ’s ability to enforce the law and review McCain ’s decision to opt out of the system .
The Republican presidential candidate , who had been entitled to $ 5.8 million in federal funds for the primary campaign , decided earlier this year to give up that money so he could avoid strict spending limits between now and the GOP ’s national convention in September .
During a conference call with reporters Sunday , DNC officials said the FEC is unable to act because four of its six seats are vacant .
They want a judge to either order the FEC to begin an immediate review , or allow the Democratic Party to file a lawsuit against McCain ’s campaign challenging his decision .
Tom McMahon , the party ’s executive director , said “ there is a compelling public interest in determining whether Senator McCain agreed to participate in the matching funds program so he could get a loan for his campaign , then violated the terms of that agreement so he could ignore the spending cap and raise unlimited money from lobbyists and special interests . ”
The DNC is seeking civil fines or an order barring McCain from exceeding spending limits , said DNC general counsel Joe Sandler .
Guests and MPs are served mineral water at committee meetings
The House of Commons is to continue to serve bottled water in its meeting rooms , despite pressure across Whitehall to switch to tap water .
A cross-party MPs committee decided at a private meeting on 1 April to keep using mineral water from Hampshire .
Labour MP John Spellar said it was " disappointing "
MPs were not prepared to take " simple steps " to cut waste .
Committee chairman Frank Doran said the decision was taken on cost and hygiene grounds but may be reviewed in future .
More than 30,000 litres of mineral water are served up in Commons rooms each year .
' Extraordinary ' decision
The water is sourced from Broughton , Hampshire - 77 miles from Westminster - and it is estimated that the company delivering it has clocked up more than 70,000 miles over the last five years .
The issue has recently been re-examined by the Commons ' facilities department , amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of bottled water .
Who the hell do MPs think they are to carry on ?
Jeanette Longfield
Sustain Last month Civil Service chief Sir Gus O'Donnell wrote to the heads of all government departments suggesting they stop serving bottled water at meetings .
But the Commons administration committee has decided to stick with it .
Former minister Mr Spellar said there was a " considerable " impact on the environment - from transporting it to burying the packaging in landfill .
' Like fools ' " I find it disappointing and extraordinary that MPs , who are constantly lecturing the public on cutting carbon footprints and helping the environment , are not prepared to take simple steps themselves . "
Jeanette Longfield from the lobby group Sustain , which campaigns against bottled water , said the decision made MPs " look like fools " .
" When the whole of the rest of government has been instructed by the Cabinet Office not to waste taxpayers ' money on bottled water , who the hell do MPs think they are to carry on ? "
But administration committee chairman Mr Doran said : " The committee looked at all the options for providing water in committee rooms and decided on the grounds of cost and hygiene that there was no better solution than the one in use at the moment .
" However , this is something the committee could look at again in future . "
The government says evidence suggests that drinking tap water uses about 300 times less energy than drinking bottled water .
The House of Lords is considering installing an on - site machine to bottle its tap water for meetings , having previously resisted using jugs of tap water because of concerns about hygiene and time constraints .
Whitehall is also phasing out its use of plastic bags as part of a wider programme of environmental action .

What are these ?
This story is a supplement to the feature " Digital Forensics : How Experts Uncover Doctored Images " which was printed in the June 2008 issue of Scientific American .
Lighting
Composite images made of pieces from different photographs can display subtle differences in the lighting conditions under which each person or object was originally photographed .
Such discrepancies will often go unnoticed by the naked eye .
For an image such as the one at the right , my group can estimate the direction of the light source for each person or object ( arrows ) .
Our method relies on the simple fact that the amount of light striking a surface depends on the relative orientation of the surface to the light source .
A sphere , for example , is lit the most on the side facing the light and the least on the opposite side , with gradations of shading across its surface according to the angle between the surface and the direction to the light at each point .
To infer the light - source direction , you must know the local orientation of the surface .
At most places on an object in an image , it is difficult to determine the orientation .
The one exception is along a surface contour , where the orientation is perpendicular to the contour ( red arrows right ) .
By measuring the brightness and orientation along several points on a contour , our algorithm estimates the light - source direction .
For the image above , the light - source direction for the police does not match that for the ducks ( arrows ) .
We would have to analyze other items to be sure it was the ducks that were added .
Eyes and Positions
Because eyes have very consistent shapes , they can be useful for assessing whether a photograph has been altered .
A person ’s irises are circular in reality but will appear increasingly elliptical as the eyes turn to the side or up or down ( a ) .
One can approximate how eyes will look in a photograph by tracing rays of light running from them to a point called the camera center ( b ) .
The picture forms where the rays cross the image plane ( blue ) .
The principal point of the camera — the intersection of the image plane and the ray along which the camera is pointed — will be near the photograph ’s center .
My group uses the shape of a person ’s two irises in the photograph to infer how his or her eyes are oriented relative to the camera and thus where the camera ’s principal point is located ( c ) .
A principal point far from the center or people having inconsistent principal points is evidence of tampering ( d ) .
The algorithm also works with other objects if their shapes are known , as with two wheels on a car .
The technique is limited , however , because the analysis relies on accurately measuring the slightly different shapes of a person ’s two irises .
My collaborators and I have found we can reliably estimate large camera differences , such as when a person is moved from one side of the image to the middle .
It is harder to tell if the person was moved much less than that .
Specular Highlights
Surrounding lights reflect in eyes to form small white dots called specular highlights .
The shape , color and location of these highlights tell us quite a bit about the lighting .
In 2006 a photo editor contacted me about a picture of American Idol stars that was scheduled for publication in his magazine ( above ) .
The specular highlights were quite different ( insets ) .
The highlight position indicates where the light source is located ( above left ) .
As the direction to the light source ( yellow arrow ) moves from left to right , so do the specular highlights .
The highlights in the American Idol picture are so inconsistent that visual inspection is enough to infer the photograph has been doctored .
Many cases , however , require a mathematical analysis .
To determine light position precisely requires taking into account the shape of the eye and the relative orientation between the eye , camera and light .
The orientation matters because eyes are not perfect spheres : the clear covering of the iris , or cornea , protrudes , which we model in software as a sphere whose center is offset from the center of the whites of the eye , or sclera ( above right ) .
Our algorithm calculates the orientation of a person ’s eyes from the shape of the irises in the image .
With this information and the position of the specular highlights , the program estimates the direction to the light .
The image of the American Idol cast ( above ; directions depicted by red dots on green spheres ) was very likely composed from at least three photographs .
Send in the Clones
Cloning — the copying and pasting of a region of an image — is a very common and powerful form of manipulation .
This image is taken from a television ad used by George W. Bush ’s reelection campaign late in 2004 .
Finding cloned regions by a brute - force computer search , pixel by pixel , of all possible duplicated regions is impractical because they could be of any shape and located anywhere in the image .
The number of comparisons to be made is astronomical , and innumerable tiny regions will be identical just by chance ( “ false positives ” ) .
My group has developed a more efficient technique that works with small blocks of pixels , typically about a six - by - six - pixel square ( inset ) .
For every six - by - six block of pixels in the image , the algorithm computes a quantity that characterizes the colors of the 36 pixels in the block .
It then uses that quantity to order all the blocks in a sequence that has identical and very similar blocks close together .
Finally , the program looks for the identical blocks and tries to “ grow ” larger identical regions from them block by block .
By dealing in blocks , the algorithm greatly reduces the number of false positives that must be examined and discarded .
When the algorithm is applied to the image from the political ad , it detects three identical regions ( red , blue and green ) .
Camera Fingerprints
Digital retouching rarely leaves behind a visual trace .
Because retouching can take many forms , I wanted to develop an algorithm that would detect any modification of an image .
The technique my group came up with depends on a feature of how virtually all digital cameras work .
A camera ’s digital sensors are laid out in a rectangular grid of pixels , but each pixel detects the intensity of light only in a band of wavelengths near one color , thanks to a color filter array ( CFA ) that sits on top of the digital sensor grid .
The CFA used most often , the Bayer array , has red , green and blue filters arranged as shown below .
Each pixel in the raw data thus has only one color channel of the three required to specify a pixel of a standard digital image .
The missing data are filled in — either by a processor in the camera itself or by software that interprets raw data from the camera — by interpolating from the nearby pixels , a procedure called demosaicing .
The simplest approach is to take the average of neighboring values , but more sophisticated algorithms are also used to achieve better results .
Whatever demosaicing algorithm is applied , the pixels in the final digital image will be correlated with their neighbors .
If an image does not have the proper pixel correlations for the camera allegedly used to take the picture , the image has been retouched in some fashion .
My group ’s algorithm looks for these periodic correlations in a digital image and can detect deviations from them .
If the correlations are absent in a small region , most likely some spot changes have been made there .
The correlations may be completely absent if image - wide changes were made , such as resizing or heavy JPEG compression .
This technique can detect changes such as those made by Reuters to an image it released from a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in 2005 ( above ) : the contrast of the notepad was adjusted to improve its readability .
A drawback of the technique is that it can be applied usefully only to an allegedly original digital image ; a scan of a printout , for instance , would have new correlations imposed courtesy of the scanner .
Sources at Google have disclosed that the humble domain , , will soon provide a home for terabytes of open - source scientific datasets .
The storage will be free to scientists and access to the data will be free for all .
The project , known as Palimpsest and first previewed to the scientific community at the Science Foo camp at the Googleplex last August , missed its original launch date this week , but will debut soon .
Building on the company 's acquisition of the data visualization technology , Trendalyzer , from the oft - lauded , TED presenting Gapminder team , Google will also be offering algorithms for the examination and probing of the information .
The new site will have YouTube - style annotating and commenting features .
The storage would fill a major need for scientists who want to openly share their data , and would allow citizen scientists access to an unprecedented amount of data to explore .
For example , two planned datasets are all 120 terabytes of Hubble Space Telescope data and the images from the Archimedes Palimpsest , the 10th century manuscript that inspired the Google dataset storage project .
UPDATE ( 12:01 pm ) : Attila Csordas of Pimm has a lot more details on the project , including a set of slides that Jon Trowbridge of Google gave at a presentation in Paris last year .
WIRED 's own Thomas Goetz also mentioned the project in his fantastic piece of freeing dark data .
One major issue with science 's huge datasets is how to get them to
Google .
In this post by a SciFoo attendee over at business |bytes|genes |molecules , the collection plan was described :
( Google people ) are providing a 3TB drive array ( Linux RAID5 ) .
The array is provided in “ suitcase ” and shipped to anyone who wants to send they data to Google .
Anyone interested gives
Google the file tree , and they SLURP the data off the drive .
I believe they can extend this to a larger array ( my memory says 20TB ) .
You can check out more details on why hard drives are the preferred distribution method at Pimm .
And we hear that Google is hunting for cool datasets , so if you have one , it might pay to get in touch with them .

Beijing is notoriously polluted , the haze often obscuring buildings
All building sites in Beijing will be shut three weeks before the start of the Olympic Games , as the city tries to clear its skies of pollution .
Digging , pouring of concrete and outdoor spray - painting will also be banned under plans announced by the Environmental Protection Bureau .
The move follows mounting concern that athletes may suffer from Beijing 's noxious atmosphere .
Olympic chiefs have already voiced concern over the issue .
President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge had previously warned that he would postpone certain endurance events if pollution levels were excessive .
' Everything possible '
When Beijing bid for the Olympic Games in 2001 it promised to provide a clean environment for the athletes by August 2008 , when the Games open .
But the BBC's James Reynolds , in Beijing , says the air in the city is often astonishingly bad and the city authorities have found this promise tough to keep .
Our correspondent says there are days when it is hard to see more than a few blocks away .
So on 20 July all construction sites in Beijing will be shut down - as well as cement manufacturers and concrete mixing plants .
And 19 businesses have been told to cut their emissions by 30 % .
Officials say they will announce steps to take cars off the city 's roads and have pledged to do " everything possible " to honour their promise to provide a clean atmosphere .
Hillary Clinton said she finally spoke out on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy Tuesday because she was asked a direct question by the Pittsburgh Tribune Review and simply answered it .

It should come as no surprise that Hollywood studios often turn to the pages of comic books and graphic novels for source material — especially for action - packed summer releases like Iron Man .
Some of these films , such as Iron Man , Batman Begins , Spider - Man 2 or X - Men 2 , achieve a great deal of commerical and critical success .
In addition , they ’re also embraced by comic book fans as great examples of what comic book movies should be .
Unfortunately , there are also those other comics - to - film adaptations that disappoint critics , mainstream audiences and comic book fans alike .
These films , whether due to bad writing , inept direction , gross miscasting , or a combination of factors , are often not only bad comic book adaptations , but bad movies in general .
Yet , even with Iron Man ‘s phenomenal success , it ’s important to remember these bad films .
These particular movies occupy a special place in the hierarchy of bad filmmaking and deserve to be highlighted — especially so you can avoid seeing them if you have n’t already .
Here then , in no particular order , is the ComicMix Six list of the Worst Movies Adapted From Comic Books .
GHOST RIDER ( 2007 ) : Why " director " Mark Steven Johnson was allowed to make another film after the abysmal Daredevil is beyond me .
Maybe he has pictures of studio execs in compromising situations ?
That ’s the only way I can explain his continued employment as a director , writer or anything else .
It certainly does n’t have anything to do with his ability to work with actors or tell a story .
Did n’t anyone watch Daredevil before they hired him for Ghost Rider ?
Apparently not .
Which brings us to . . .
DAREDEVIL ( 2003 ) : I do n’t have anything against Ben Affleck as a person or as an actor .
However , his performance in this film ranks pretty low — even by Gigli standards .
Plus , the non-existent direction , weak story and lame " fight " on the see - saw in the playground left a very bad taste in my mouth from this film that no amount of tooth - brushing or mouthwash could remove for some time afterward .
At least this film did serve one purpose : it was so bad we were not subjected to a sequel .
What about Elektra , you may wonder ?
I like to pretend that was just a deleted scene from Daredevil that was n’t good enough to make the final cut .
NICK FURY : AGENT OF S.H.I.E.L.D. ( 1998 ) : Sure , this was technically a TV movie , but seriously , I only have one thing to say about this abomination : David Hasselhoff as Nick Fury .
Let me say that again for the cheap seats : David - freakin’- Hasselhoff as Nick Fury .
That alone should be enough to condemn this piece of junk to the bowels of cinematic hell where it belongs .
Even with all this film has going against it , it ’s still better than Daredevil and Ghost Rider .
Plus , at least writer David S. Goyer went on to write some really good films since this one , like Batman Begins .
BATMAN & ROBIN ( 1997 ) : Coming after Tim Burton ’s two Batman films and the dismal Batman Forever , director Joel Schumacher can rest assured that his most infamous contribution to Batman movie franchise history is that he managed to put nipples on the Batsuit and destroy the franchise to the point where eight years and a complete reboot was necessary to get Batman back into theaters .
Other than that , this poor excuse for a film features a cast of all the wrong people playing all the wrong roles : George Clooney as Batman , Alicia Silverstone as a pudgy Batgirl ( stunt casting to appeal to the young audience if I ever saw it ) and even Uma Thurman , who is usually pretty good , has trouble playing Poison Ivy under Schumacher ’s " direction . "
And do n’t even get me started on Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze , featuring some of the worst dialog ever uttered in a major motion picture .
This film is a mess .
At least Warner Bros. had the good sense to stop after this one , wait a few years , and then produce Batman Begins .
Now that was a comic book adaptation worth watching .
THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN ( 2003 ) : Alan Moore ’s hatred for Hollywood has been well documented , and maybe he has good reason after seeing this butchering of his work .
For some reason , Hollywood has the uncanny ability to take great source material and turn it into this kind of lame tripe .
I can only imagine what this film could have been , had it featured an actual director instead of yet another FX - guy - turned - director at the helm .
Is it me , or do these directors turn to CGI and action sequences to cover up any problems with story , characters or pretty much anything else ?
I guess I can’t really blame them too much , because it ’s what they know .
Plus , its got to be way easier than telling a story , working on the performances or doing any kind of actual directing .
CATWOMAN ( 2004 ) : There ’s a lot one can infer by the fact that Pitof , the " director " of this huge mistake of a film , has not been put in charge of another movie based on a comic book since Catwoman .
Perhaps the folks at Warner Bros . and other major studios realized he was n’t the right man to handle a huge comic book franchise film like this ?
If only they had realized it beforehand .
From changing the main character to casting Sharon Stone as the villain who wants to rule the world using evil cosmetics , this is one of those movies that makes audiences hate Hollywood and its " rush something out to make a quick buck " mentality .
After watching this film , you ca n’t really blame audiences — especially fans of Catwoman comics — for being angry about this waste of 104 minutes of their lives .

BEIJING -- Some Chinese citizens , angry over foreign criticism of their country 's policies in Tibet , are calling for boycotts of at least two European retailers for purportedly supporting the Dalai Lama , the latest sign of growing tension between China and the West ahead of the Olympics .
Internet users in China -- it is unclear how many -- have been using instant - messaging services , blogs and bulletin boards to spread a call for Chinese consumers at home and abroad to boycott French supermarket operator Carrefour SA and cosmetics retailer the Body Shop , owned by L'Oréal SA .
Those advocating the boycott argue that a major Carrefour shareholder has contributed funds to the Dalai Lama , regarded by many Tibetans as their spiritual leader .
And Chinese critics are targeting the Body Shop because they say its Australian operation helped promote a tour of the Dalai Lama to that country in June .
Over the weekend , Chinese leaders again defended their actions against the sometimes - violent Tibetan protestors and lashed out at critics overseas .
China 's president , Hu Jintao , told visiting Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that " the Tibet problem is entirely an internal issue of China , " adding that " no government will sit idle for such crimes . "
The government also said it arrested nine Tibetan Buddhist monks in connection with an alleged bomb attack on a government building .
Scott Kronick , president of WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide China , says he is n't surprised that the Chinese have reacted so strongly to criticisms and now are using the Web to fight back .
The Internet has been " the medium by which they have been very active in expressing their views " and their patriotism , he says .
In past weeks , overseas Chinese also have been organizing pro-China marches and announcing them online , and more such campaigns may be expected as long as anti-China sentiment persists .

WHY OWL COUNTRY ?

Quote from : Guert link=topic=
1124.msg26560#msg26560 date=1206019705
Once upon a time , in Montreal , Canada , a small group of indie developers were leaving an event called Gamma 256 .
The evening had been lovely and it was time for everyone to go back home and dream about the wonderful time they just had .
Destiny had something else planned ...
As they sayed their good - byes , a common pigeon flew over their heads .
Little did it know , this little flight proved to be a horrible mistake .
Out of nowhere , an owl flew out of the darkness and viciously attacked it .
Dazed and confused , the pigeon landed right in front of our friends and tried to escape by flying away .
Unfortunatly for mister pigeon , mister owl had an ace up its sleeve .
The noctural hunter zoomed above , landed in the a nearby tree .
Few seconds later , feathers floated down on the group .
Since that day , all of the witnesses of this event were deeply affected by the violence of the owl , except Fish , who keeps claiming that he does n't remember a thing .
But in the end , we all know that Fish had the owl under his command , which explains why he " does n't remember " ...
Now , you know the story ...
Actually , as far as we know , the pigeon escaped .
The feathers that floated down were from the initial swoop , and it was our presence that startled the owl away .
However Guert 's retelling is pretty close .
Details will follow , but for now here 's a list of all the people who contributed .

news A Good Pac - Man Is Hard To Find
On Friday , reader Russ Morgan spotted Pac - Man on Spadina .
Someone had converted one of the panels of the streetcar shelters between Baldwin and Nassau to depict a stand - off straight out of the classic video game : to the south , a big pixelated Pac - Man ; to the north , Pokey , a big pixelated orange ghost ; and , between them , a big pixelated cherry power - up .
The yellow dots that always line the streetcar shelters , untouched by the artist , magically became pac-dots .
Sadly , by the time we hurried down to Spadina to look at the shelter , only the bright yellow Pac - Man was left , his fuel and foe both gone .
Originally , Russ thought that the whole scene might have been an advertisement , but from what we saw , the Pac - Man , pasted onto the back of the shelter , looked homemade ; we have n’t seen or heard of any other Pac - Men roaming around the city ; it ’s just outside of Kensington Market , a favourite site for street artists ; and if the installation was an ad , it ’s not likely that two - thirds of the setup would have been removed by the end of the weekend .
Astral — who is ( like Viacom / CBS ) somewhat contentiously in charge of selling ads on the clear transit shelters throughout the city — was not able to get back to Torontoist in time for this article , but we ’re putting our money on it being an unauthorized addition rather than a bought advertisement .
Not that we ’re not utterly charmed by it either way .

Mrs Blair says she has ' nothing personal ' against Gordon Brown Tony Blair is giving advice to Prime Minister Gordon Brown and has told him how to win the next election , Cherie Blair has said .
Her disclosure is made in an interview with the Times newspaper to coincide with its serialisation of her autobiography , Speaking for Myself .
In one extract from the book , she reveals how her husband suffered a crisis of confidence over the Iraq war .
But she writes he decided to stay on as PM to fight for his domestic legacy .
' Rattling the keys ' During 10 years in Downing Street , Mrs Blair , the former prime minister 's wife , continued her high - flying legal career and became a high profile media figure in her own right .
Over the years she was in the headlines almost as much as her husband , and not always for the reasons she would have liked .
The book , to be published later this month , gives her account of the widely reported tensions between herself and the then chancellor , Gordon Brown , and explains why her husband chose not to stand down before the 2005 general election .

In it , she accuses Mr Brown of " rattling the keys " of Downing Street over Mr Blair 's head to try to force him out .
And she says Mr Blair would have stood down in 2005 if only Mr Brown had been prepared to back his public service reforms .
Instead , she says he decided that he had to stay on in order to entrench his plans for city academies , foundation hospitals , and pensions reform .
In other extracts from the book and the interview , she says :
The leadership deal that Mr Blair and Mr Brown struck happened at a neighbour 's home , not at the Granita restaurant in Islington as was widely reported
Mr Blair used to tell Mr Brown to get married if he wanted to be leader
Mr Brown , as the new chancellor , was wrong to announce he was not going to take a salary increase , thereby putting pressure on others to follow suit .
" How dare Gordon do that ?
What did he know about financial commitments ?
He was a bachelor living on his own in a flat with a small mortgage , " she writes .
She said the Blairs had " a mortgage the size of Mount Snowdon " on their £ 3.6 m house in London 's Connaught Square .
" That was very scary .
Whatever happened , we had to meet the monthly payment and it was down to me .
Because no one else was going to meet it , were they ? "
" The problem between me and Gordon is not anything personal .
It is because I thought my husband was the best person for the job and it is a damn difficult job . "
It was her idea for Carole Caplin , her lifestyle guru , to give Mr Blair massages and it was Ms Caplin who " kept her thin " Mrs Blair 's book had been scheduled for publication in autumn .
Its surprise early release comes at a difficult time for the Labour government which suffered substantial losses in the recent local elections .

What are these ?
What do you do with a robot armed with a million - round - per - minute gun ?
" Crowd control , " naturally .
For several months , Metal Storm , the troubled electronic gun developer , has been working with iRobot – the makers of military machines and cute , semi-autonomous vacuum cleaners – to arm some of their new , 250 - pound unmanned ground vehicles .
Last week , at a defense trade show , the two firms showed off the results of their joint venture .
Metal Storm 's weapons fire bullets electronically , instead of with firing pins and primer .
The ammunition is stacked , rather than mechanically reloaded .
And the only moving parts in the weapon are the ammunition itself .
Which means the weapon can fire at a rate of thousands of rounds per minute – maybe even up to a million , theoretically .
Metal Storm 's 40 mm weapons mount , the company tells us , can deliver both high - explosive and less - lethal rounds .
Which makes it perfect for everything from urban assaults to " border patrol " to " infrastructure protection " to " crowd control . "
Ordinarily , iRobot 's military bots have been used to look out for terrorists and their improvised bombs .
But , in the last year , the company has made a push into armed robotics , signing deals with stun - gun maker Taser and with Metal Storm .
Its rival , Foster - Miller , has already tried out its machines with Metal Storm weapons , and has three machine gun-toting ' bots in Iraq .
Because of safety concerns , however , they 're not seeing much action .
Not even crowd control .

月周回衛星 「 かぐや （SELENE ） 」の
地形カメラによるアポロ15号の噴射跡の確認について
宇宙航空研究開発機構 （JAXA）は、月周回衛星 「 かぐや （SELENE）」に搭載している地形カメラ（TC）の観測データに基づき作成した立体視画像により、アポロ15号※1のエンジンの噴射によって生じた「ハロー」と呼ばれる噴射跡と考えられるものを確認しました。
この画像は、平成20年2月24日に地形カメラがアポロ15号の着陸地点（雨の海を取り囲むアペニン山脈の麓、ハドレー谷付近）を観測したデータを、研究者チームが処理を行い作成したもので、アポロ15号の噴射跡とみられるものが観測で確認されたのは、アポロ計画終了後としては、世界で初めてのことです。
あわせて、アポロ15号飛行士が撮影した写真と同じ風景を地形カメラの立体視画像から作成し、地形カメラの観測精度が高いことを確認したほか、同じくアポロ15号において確認されたハドレー谷の上部に30数億年前に噴出した溶岩流が積み重なる様子も把握できました。
※1 アポロ15号は、アポロ計画における第9番目の有人飛行ミッション、第4番目の月着陸ミッションであり、昭和46年7月26日に打ち上げられ、7月31日に月面に着陸し、8月8日に地球に帰還した。このミッションは以前のアポロミッションに比べて科学調査をより重視し、月面に長時間滞在することを目指した最初の「Jミッション」である。
図1 アポロ15号の着陸地点付近の地形カメラの立体視画像昭和46（1971）年7月30日、アポロ15号は雨の海を取り囲むアペニン山脈の麓、ハドレー谷に着陸しました（北緯26度07分
東経3度38分）。ハドレー谷は、全長80km、深さ300mの蛇行谷と呼ばれる谷で、この谷の成因を調べるのがアポロ15号の任務のひとつでした。谷の向こうには高さ3400mの山塊がそびえる月の名勝地でもあります。地形カメラの立体視画像であり、高度15kmに視点をおき、東方向にハドレー谷を見ているようにしています。図2 アポロ15号の着陸地点の地形図（☆はアポロ15号着陸地点、赤矢印が図1の立体視画像の見ている方向）（出典：

Michael Bloomberg said giving drivers a break from the gas tax is “ the dumbest thing I ’ve heard in an awful long time . ”
I asked him about it right after he delivered his executive budget at City Hall just now .
He said , “ It ’s the dumbest thing I ’ve heard in an awful long time from an economic point of view .
I do n’t understand why you think there ’s any merit to it whatsoever .
We ’re trying to discourage people from driving and we ’re trying to end our energy dependence .
We do n’t do that — oh , and incidentally , we ’re trying to have more money to build infrastructure .
All three of those things go fly in the face of giving everybody $ 30 a year .
The $ 30 bucks is not going to change anybody ’s lifestyle .
The billions of dollars that we would otherwise have in tax revenues can make a big difference as to what kind of a world we leave our children . ”
Bloomberg praised officials who opposed the “ summer break on gasoline taxes which would help Chavez , Qaddafi and other people like that .
I do n’t know why anybody would want to do it . ”
He went on to say critics like Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver were right .
" And , " he added , " [ Barack ]
Obama was right on this one , and that [ John ] McCain and [ Hillary ] Clinton were wrong .
The last thing we need to do is encourage people to drive more and to take away the monies we need for infrastructure in this country . "
UPDATE : Joe Bruno ’s spokesman , Mark Hansen , responds : " The vast majority of New Yorkers , especially upstate , must rely on their cars to get to work and school and do not have any mass transit .
The rising price of gas is costing them $ 10 to $ 20 more every time they fill up their tanks .
The Senate , like John McCain and Hillary Clinton , support cutting gas taxes because it is the right thing to do to give New Yorkers relief . "
Sunday Times :
The government faces a diplomatic row with America over disclosures that it has provided the Iranian regime with financial support worth about £ 290 m while at the same time calling for sanctions .
The Sunday Times
Jonathan Leake and Sarah Baxter
THE government faces a diplomatic row with America over disclosures that it has provided the Iranian regime with financial support worth about £ 290 m while at the same time calling for sanctions .
The money was offered by the Export Credits Guarantee Department ( ECGD ) to support British firms exporting to Iran , mainly to the countrys petrochemical industry .
Many of the loans were being negotiated while British ministers were threatening sanctions against Iran for creating a nuclear enrichment facility to make atomic weapons .
Last week Gordon Brown called for new sanctions against Iran in addition to those already imposed by the United Nations security council .
The prime minister wants a ban on investment in the oil and gas industries if Iran does not agree to end the production of enriched uranium .
This weekend government sources signalled their embarrassment over the ECGDs activities .
 There is clearly a gap between our actions and our rhetoric ,  said one Whitehall insider .
The US administration has been privately lobbying Britain to end the financial support .
Stuart Levey , the US Treasury official responsible for terrorism and financial intelligence , stepped up the pressure in private discussions with British ministers in London in July , claiming that such export credits were inconsistent with UN sanctions .
Danielle Pletka , an expert on trade links with Iran at the Washington - based American Enterprise Institute , said :  You cant subsidise with one hand and sanction with the other .
Britain is saying the European Union needs to do more but it needs to lead by example , not just by its mouth . 
The government is also under political pressure at home .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said :  Our government must make up its mind about export credit guarantees to Iran .
Britain should lead the way with a clear , unequivocal commitment to banning new export credit guarantees to Iran . 
The ECGD underwrites bank loans to enable overseas buyers to purchase goods , often including military hardware , from UK companies .
It stopped providing support for Iran in 1994 but resumed in 2000 .
Much of the support was for the National Iranian Oil Company and a subsidiary , the National Petrochemical Company .
The decision to start pushing hard for new business came in 2003 , the year of the second Iraq war .
It coincided with a declaration by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran had been secretly constructing a nuclear enrichment plant .
The same year , however , the ECGD announced a £ 72 m deal for a plastics plant in Iran .
It then sent John Weiss , its business group director , to Iran to speak at a petrochemical conference to drum up more business .
Weiss said then :  The petrochemical sector in Iran is a key target for the ECGD , but we are also keen to look at sectors including oil , gas , transport , power , water and telecommunications . 
Such optimism contrasted with warnings throughout 2003 from Tony Blair , then prime minister , that Iran should halt its nuclear ventures .
He also accused it of supporting terrorist groups attacking British troops in Iraq .
In the same year the ECGD negotiated a series of deals involving the National Iranian Oil Company that were worth another £ 63 m .
In 2005 the ECGD extended credit worth £ 109 m to the oil company , with more to other Iranian firms .
Parliamentary records show that the ECGD received 153 requests for credit guarantees from firms dealing with Iran between 2002 and March 2007 .
Most of the contracts are still in force and Britains total exposure to Iranian deals is now valued at £ 290m .
Last week the Foreign Office said that money earned by the Iranian oil industry was used to support its nuclear enrichment programme and the Iraq insurgency .
The ECGD , however , said it had acted completely within the law .
A couple of months ago , Sen . Thad Cochran of Mississippi , one of John McCain ’s conservative Republican colleagues and a man who ’s worked with McCain for years , raised serious doubts about McCain ’s temperament .
“ The thought of him being president sends a cold chill down my spine , ” Cochran said .
“ He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . ”
The number of examples to bolster these concerns keeps going up .
Not surprisingly , after the speech last week at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , McCain ’s campaign could not talk enough about international cooperation — what McCain had called a “ new compact . ”
“ He has such a deep relationship with so many Europeans and those in other regions , including Asia and the Middle East , ” said one adviser , Rich Williamson , who added that McCain has kept up his global profile by “ going each year to the Munich Security Conference . ”
It was all very reassuring .
There ’s just one problem : John McCain does n’t always behave according to his own statesmanlike script .
In fact , while attending that same Munich conference in 2006 , the Arizona senator had another one of what have come to be known as McCain Moments .
In a small meeting at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof , McCain was conferring with Frank - Walter Steinmeier , the foreign minister of Germany — one of America ’s most important allies — when the others heard McCain erupt .
He thought the German was being insufficiently tough on the brutal regime in Belarus .
Raising his voice at Steinmeier — who ’s known for speaking in unclear diplomatese — McCain “ started shaking and rising out of his chair , ” said one participant , a former senior diplomatic official who related the anecdote on condition of anonymity .
“ He said something like : ‘ I have n’t come to Munich to hear this kind of crap ’ . ” McCain ’s old pal Joe Lieberman jumped in .
“ Lieberman , who reads him very well , put his hand on McCain ’s arm and said gently , ‘ John , I think there ’s been a problem in the translation . ’
Of course Lieberman does n’t speak German and there had n’t been any problem in the translation …
It was just John ’s explosive temper . ”
As Newsweek noted , this did n’t amount to an international incident , and “ the Germans later said all was forgiven . ”
It was , however , just McCain being McCain .
He ’s an equal - opportunity hothead , berating Republicans , Democrats , the powerful , the powerless , and anyone who annoys him in this country or any other .
Just the kind of guy we want leading the most powerful military on the planet during a time of war , right ?

Did elephants ’ trunks evolve to function as snorkels ?
This suggestion might be outlandish but new fossils make a strong case that extinct relatives of elephants were aquatic .
Speculation about a watery stage in the evolution of the world ’s largest land mammal has continued on and off for years , but now palaeontologists have solid evidence that relatives of elephants lived in freshwater swamps or rivers near the coast of what is now Egypt .
Elwyn Simons of Duke University in North Carolina and colleagues analysed the teeth of Moeritherium , an elephant ancestor the size of a large hog that lived 37 million years ago .
The teeth have uniformly low levels of oxygen - 18 , a distinctive signature of organisms that live in fresh water .
And their carbon - 13 levels indicate that the animal ate freshwater plants .
Oxygen and carbon isotope levels are similar in the teeth of Barytherium , a much larger but poorly known beast more closely related to modern elephants .

No connection
Simons says that the results suggest that the ancestors of modern elephants went through an aquatic or semi-aquatic stage before going back to the land .
William Sanders of the University of Michigan agrees that both Moeritherium and Barytherium were aquatic but says neither was on the direct line to elephants .
He also dismissed the “ trunk - as - snorkel ” hypothesis , arguing that trunks grew long to reach beyond the elephants ’ tusks .
He doubts that purely aquatic traits would have remained long after ancestral forms left the water .
Paleomastodons , which are direct ancestors of elephants , were fully terrestrial when they appeared around 30 million years ago , but no one knows what their ancestors were or what they were doing .
Simons hopes that isotopic studies of other fossils might provide the answer .

Evolution – Learn more about the struggle to survive in our comprehensive special report .
One of the few things I think XHTML2 got absolutely , totally , 125 % right was freeing the href attribute from the few elements that accepted it and spreading it all over the language .
It saddens me that this is n’t happening in HTML5 , especially since at least 1.5 of the four reasons given seem off base or flat - out incorrect .
From where I stand , at any rate .
Here , let me explain by having a pseudo - dialogue with the four reasons .
It is n’t backwards compatible with existing browsers .
Neither was CSS , table markup , PNG support , or any number of other worthwhile advancements in the web .
And yes , table markup was an absolutely worthwhile advancement : previous to that , the only way to have a table of data that lined up in any fashion was to space - format it and throw the whole thing into a pre element .
Ugly nonsemantic fun !
For that matter , if lack of backwards compatibility is an accepted reason to exclude something from HTML5 , then a whole bracket of new elements — like , say , nav , article , aside , dialog , section , time , progress , meter , figure , video , datagrid , header , footer , need I go on ?
— need to come out of the specification right now .
They ’re totally unsupported , and may not even be stylable , by older browsers .
( Yes , I just proposed that the term for a group of elements be a “ bracket ” .
A pod of whales , a flock of seagulls , a bracket of elements .
Try it out , see how it feels on the tongue .
A little angular , perhaps ?
Do n’t worry , you ’ll get used to it . )
It adds no new functionality that can’t already be achieved using the a element .
What ?
What ?!?
Given a table where each row contains several cells of of summary data , and there is a desire to be able to click on a row to get more detailed information via a search keyed off that summary information , please explain to me how being able to use < tr href= " ... " > on each row as opposed to writing a whole bunch of JavaScript to associate a click event listener and delegation code and handler functions and target assembly logic just to simulate what < tr href= " ... " > would do , were it permitted , constitutes “ no new functionality ” .
Please .
I would love to hear that one .
Unless of course HTML5 is going to let us wrap a elements around whatever arbitrary collection of elements we like , in which case , never mind .
I ’ll just wrap all my tr s in a s and be done with it .
That ’d be keen .
Will that be possible ?
Will the HTML5 syntax be so flexible as to permit that ?
Yeah , that ’s what I thought .
Not that I spent half the week banging my head against this problem and getting a bunch of hand - holding in the arcana of JavaScript and inconsistent browser event handling just to address what twenty - five seconds or so would have sufficed to resolve in an href - everywhere world or anything .
And for the flip side of this , see Wilson Miner ’s “ Accessible Data Visualization with Web Standards “ , where a bar graph is built out of span s so that they can all be wrapped in an a element in order to let you click on any “ row ” — that is , what would have been a row had he been able to use table markup — and get more information .
Yes , absolutely , all that stuff should be in a table , but it was a case of have a table with a bunch of not - that - easy JS forced onto it , or have the contents of every cell in a row be a separate hyperlink to the same destination , or do simple markup with savaged semantics .
We should n’t be forced into that choice .
It does n’t make sense for all elements , such as interactive elements like input and button , where the use of href would interfere with their normal function .
True enough .
So do n’t add it to those elements which would suffer , like input and button .
Or , alternatively , define behavior conflict resolution in those cases .
There might actually be good reasons to have button accept an href value as a fallback in cases where the normal function of the button fails in some manner .
Either way , the fact that adding href does n’t work in some cases is no reason to forgo its addition in all cases .
Browser vendors have reported that implementing it would be extremely complex .
I ’m always willing to hear why implementors think something is complex to implement , as they ’re often subtle and fascinating insights into web browser development .
Still , it seems to me that everything ubiquitous href attribution would imply can be recreated with a heavy dose of JavaScript event handlers and related code — ( on ) click for the sending you off to the target ( and any :active - style effects you wanted to bring in ) , ( on ) mouseover or plain old : hover for the interactive effects , et cetera , et cetera .
Are they really saying that it ’s more complex to support this sort of thing in markup than it is to support all the scripting and DOMiness that permits people to laboriously recreate it on their own ?
If so , why ?
I ’m really curious to know what would make this “ extremely complex ” , which sounds a good deal more dire than “ complex ” or just plain old “ difficult ” .
I ’m open to having my mind changed by strong evidence that this would be borderline impossible to implement , even though it can apparently be simulated via existing DOM / JS implementations .
Anything short of that , however , is n’t going to convince me that this should be dropped .
It was a good idea when it was in XHTML2 , and it should n’t be abandoned if there ’s any chance to save it .
Turning the Tables Citizen Issues Parking Ticket to Cop
A CITIZEN who watched a cop illegally park , then walk into an Asian restaurant to wait for his food , has issued the officer a series of citizen - initiated parking violations .
Eric Bryant says he was sitting in the SanSai Japanese Grill on NW 21st and Hoyt on March 7 when he witnessed Officer Chadd Stensgaard pull up and park his patrol car illegally , next to a " No Parking " sign .
Stensgaard walked into the restaurant wearing his police uniform , but did not make any arrests or citations .
Instead , he turned his attention to the basketball game on television , according to Bryant .
When Bryant asked Stensgaard about his vehicle , Stensgaard allegedly acknowledged being in a no-parking zone but asked Bryant , " If someone broke into your house , would you rather have the police be able to park in front of your house or have to park three blocks away and walk there ? "
Bryant returned to his seat , and says shortly afterward he watched a restaurant employee hand the officer a plastic bag before he left .
Unfortunately for Officer Stensgaard , Bryant had recently passed the Oregon bar exam , and decided to pursue the matter further .
" If he had acknowledged and corrected his error , we could have avoided this whole thing , " says Bryant .
" But instead , he kept watching basketball and told me he was n't doing anything wrong . "
Now , using ORS 153.058 , Bryant — as a private citizen — has initiated violation proceedings against Officer Stensgaard .
Bryant alleges Stensgaard was in violation of state statutes on illegal parking , illegal stopping , obeying parking restrictions on state highways , and illegal operation of an emergency vehicle or ambulance — the violations carry fines totaling $ 540 .
Officer Stensgaard has received a Multnomah County summons to appear in traffic court on May 23 .
Meanwhile Bryant denies he is just stirring up trouble .
" Citizens should be concerned that he used his status as an officer of the law as justification for breaking the law , " he says .
Stensgaard declined comment through the cops ' office of public information .
As expected , Yahoo has responded to Microsoft's 3 week ultimatum this morning .
The bottom line is pretty clear in a letter signed by Jerry Yang ( CEO ) and Roy Bostock ( chairman ) .
In the " Dear Steve " response to Ballmer they state , " we will not allow you or anyone else to acquire the company for anything less than its full value . "
They go on to state that , " We consider your threat to commence an unsolicited offer and proxy contest to displace our independent Board members to be counterproductive and inconsistent with your stated objective of a friendly transaction . "
Make no mistake about it , this is corporate war and will likely end with Yahoo's best engineers working for Google .
I was curious as to how the tank above , which took World Ranking 7 in the ADA aquascaping contest this year , created the waterfall illusion .
I had seen similar effects created by rising bubbles , but this seems to end before reaching the surface , meaning it is created using a different method ( or there was a good deal of Photoshopping involved ) .
However , an anonymous comment tipped me off to a website that explains exactly how it was created , and it is quite creative .
To start off , the illusion is created with falling sand , not rising bubbles .
However , bubbles still play an important role .
See the diagram below :
This is a cross section of the " waterfall . "
A tube and airstone blows bubbles up through a space behind the wall , and as a result , pulls water and tiny grains of sand ( blue dots ) from a sloped reservoir ( sloped so that gravity pulls the sand down and into the bubble stream ) up the narrow space .
Once the grains reach a second opening , they forced out the second opening with the water current and fall back down the front of the wall back into the reservoir .
Here 's a picture of what this looks like before any plants are added :
As you can see , very fine sand must be used for this to work .
Additionally , where the sand falls is affected greatly by other currents in the tank , and it will inevitably fall outside of the reservoir .
This means this effect is not the most practical for everyday use , as using it with a filter would probably blow the falling sand everywhere else in your tank .
I 'm sure much tweaking and adjusting is necessary to find the best type of sand suited for this application , and what size space behind the wall works best .
How the sand is ejected from the top of the bubble column is also probably a problem area that requires a lot of attention and adjustment .
It 's hard to tell from the diagram , but the bubble column space most likely extends above the water line .
This forces the water pulled up by the bubbles out the sand - ejection opening .
Otherwise , the sand would continue to follow the current of bubbles and water up and out the top of the column ( and you 'd have a messy volcano effect instead of a waterfall ! ) .
The final effect , if done correctly , looks absolutely stunning in pictures .
With enemies like these , who needs friends ?
-- Evolved Rationalist on creationists .
The closet YECs over at Uncommonly Dense are pissing in their pants over this article in Nature : A religious group has had its application to offer Master of Science degrees rejected by Texas authorities .
The Institute for Creation Research — which backs a literal interpretation of the Bible , including the creation of Earth in six days — was seeking a certificate to grant online degrees in science education in Texas ( see Nature 451 , 1030 ; 2008 ) .
But the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board voted unanimously last week not to grant the institute ’s request , following the recommendation of Raymund Paredes , the state ’s commissioner of higher education .
Okay , so far so good .
The Institute for Certified Retards ( ICR ) is a young - earth religious Babble - thumping ministry who tries to push unscientific , discredited bullshit on the public , and their application to infect the education system with their lies was rightfully rejected .
What the IDiotic goon over at UD said next made me almost bash my head on the desk in frustration : Religious belief is not science ?
Does Paredes feel that “ religious ” people can’t teach adequate science ?
He ’s right , “ religious belief is not science , ” but should creationists be barred from teaching / offering degrees because of their beliefs ?
EXPELLED !
Talk about missing the point completely .
Now , IDiot , you got it right when you admitted that religious belief is not science .
What you do n't seem to get is that nobody , not even those ' evil Darwinists ' you goons keep raving about think that religious people can't teach science .
Where the fuck did you even get that idea ?
The ICR was not barred from offering degrees because they were affiliated with Christianity .
They were not expelled .
They were flunked because their degrees did not meet the requirements of the board .
Again , they wanted to teach bullshit and offer degrees in bullshit , but their bullshit is not science and does not meet the requirements of the education board , so their bullshit was flunked out of the scientific arena .
Is that really so hard to understand ?
What happened to the ICR was exactly what would have happened if the Flat Earth Society started offering degrees in flat - earthism , or Scientologists started offering degrees in Xenu - science .
' Creation science ' or ' intelligent design ' or whatever the fuck they want to call it this time is not science and does not belong in science classrooms .
No matter how much the IDiots choose to lie about this issue , the simple fact is that nobody was barred from teaching science because of their religion .
ICR was not allowed to offer degrees not because their members were Christians , but because they were teaching bullshit .
We do n't see devout religious people like Kenneth Miller getting expelled from their positions , do we ?
If you think that episode of IDiotic failure is bad enough , the comments bring out the closet YEC IDiots who fit comfortably under the IDiotic ' big tent ' .
Scroll through the comments , and you will see blatant fundie Babble - thumping , god worshipping , YEC arguments and a truckload of massive fail .
If you want to be reminded yet again about why ID should not be taught in science classrooms , take a look at this comment by Salvador Cordova :
I personally hope the YEC enterprise succeeds .
But there are some days the problems for the hypothesis seem insurmountable .
I have tried to persist .
I hope God will help with evidential discoveries , especially in cosmology and plausible mechanisms for accelerated decay …
Wow .
Just wow .
That 's IDiot science for you , folks .
He admits that there are terrible problems with YEC , but he is trudging along because of his literal belief in the Bible and hopes and prays that god will help find evidence for YEC .
After failing to get any evidence for his YEC idiocy , all he can do now is to babble for his imaginary sky daddy to miraculously make it all fall into place .
If the IDiots had their way , scientists would be praying instead of making medical discoveries and we would hurtle back to the Dark Ages and .....
* shudder *
This is why ID is not science , was not science , and never will be science .
I had no plans whatever to write a Delegate Wars ( V ) .
But there is too much news right now to even skip a week .
The DW story is beginning to break in larger - circulation media , in combination with a second tale : McCain 's repeated inability , even as President Bush 's anointed successor , to consolidate support in his party .
As AOL pundit Tommy Christopher predicted last month , a narrative is beginning to build ; McCain 's hitherto “ free ride ” in the media is beginning to end .
The Boston Globe skillfully wove both narratives together in a May 9 feature that was carried verbatim by the Seattle Times the next day :
Senator John McCain is sailing toward his coronation as the Republican presidential nominee while the Democratic candidates battle fiercely .
But Republicans also are engaged in some tough infighting that could disrupt the national convention and make it more difficult for him to unite the party in the fall .
Across the country , at state and county GOP conventions , diehard supporters of maverick Ron Paul are staging uprisings in an effort to secure a role for Paul at the national convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul .
And in the four primaries since clinching the nomination in early March , McCain has yet to reach 80 percent of the vote , as Paul and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee continue to siphon away votes … .
The lingering anti-McCain sentiment among some voters and the continuing Paul insurgency suggest that McCain has not fully quelled hostility from some elements in his party .
For their part , McCain supporters are trying to whip the Party members into line with hysteria about cults and conspiracies .
As in this bit of scare - mongering from McCain blog Reality Bites :
It 's obvious that the Ron Paul organization is a top - down well - organized machine .
In the caucuses the Ron Paul supporters were told to stand up and say , “ He touched my heart , ” and so they all did .
The ground troops do what they are told .
They report back to the mothership as instructed ….
Normal citizens in Germany in the thirties thought Hitler and the Nazis were buffoons .
They did n't take them seriously and thought nothing would come from their antics .
It would be a mistake to think of the Ron Paul supporters the same way .
They are a cult .
And they are frightening .
Similar tales of conspiracy come from Nolan Chart 's own Dave Nalle , who gave readers of Blogcritics a thoroughly distorted account of the RPR 's goals and strategy :
Although John McCain is the presumptive nominee , as the various state conventions roll forward — largely in obscurity — conflict and chaos continue to be spread by Ron Paul 's enthusiastic followers who continue to try to storm the ramparts of the GOP establishment .
These efforts by libertarian - leaning Republicans , far - right John Birch Society agitators , and anarcho - socialist infiltrators looking to strike a blow against the dreaded neocons have met with some successes and some failures and a considerable and I think very undesirable backlash .
Their strategy , as demonstrated at district conventions around the country , is to show up in large numbers , use procedural motions to disrupt the convention , and if then if their forces are sufficient , force a vote to suspend the convention rules , remove the convention leadership , and start over again with their faction in control .
If they do n't have the numbers to pull that off , their goal is to disrupt the proceedings as much as possible so that little or no business can be conducted .
That theme is popping up in major media as well — like the Santa Fe Reporter , which seized on the “ uprising ” and “ chaos ” angles for its May 7 feature , adding an apocalyptic warning and even dragging in the dreaded 9/11 Truthers :
Ron Paul Uprising —
Will a GOP uprising take place at the Republican National Convention ?
As the mainstream media obsesses over the Democratic Party 's brewing civil war , supporters of Republican presidential candidate US Rep .
Ron Paul , R - Texas , are already staging their own quiet uprising at GOP conventions across the nation .
If , by a strange twist of fate , the Republicans ' presumptive nominee , US Sen .
John McCain , R - Ariz. , fails to win the first ballot at the national convention , “ all hell will break loose , ” one Santa Fe County delegate tells SFR … .
Already , hell is breaking loose at the county and state levels , especially in the Southwest .
YouTube video of the Nevada State Convention last week shows chaos and confusion after a super - majority coalition of state delegates , organized by Paul supporters , overturned party rules to allow new national delegates to be nominated from the convention floor …. .
Similar skirmishes have been reported in small - town newspapers from Maine to Texas .
Furthermore , much of Paul 's campaign is driven by the 9/11 Truth Movement , which has grown increasingly aggressive , staging disruptions at events ranging from HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher to public appearances by Bill Clinton .
The RPR has responded to all this by mainly lying low for the time being .
RPR sites are clamping down on information ( see Utah report ) , and would - be delegates turning to a stealth approach ..
Even the Paul campaign ( says the Reporter ) is advising : “ It is not recommended for any of the delegate candidates at this stage to ' fly the colors ' as Ron Paul supporters .
Delegates should simply represent themselves as interested , involved and committed Republicans . ”

Arizona
Reporting May 10 from the state convention in Mesa , blog Politicker .
AZ announced that “ only one Paul backer , Roy Miller in CD4 , will join the Arizona delegation to the RNC .
' He told me he 's going to sign the pledge ' to support McCain , said Randy Pullen , Chairman of the Arizona Republican Party . ”
( AZ 's delegates are bound to McCain , the primary winner , for one ballot . )
“ We just do n't have numbers in Arizona like we had in Nevada .
I mean , this is obviously John McCain 's home state , so what do you expect ? ” Jeff Greenspan , the campaign 's Southwest Regional Coordinator , told the blog .

New Mexico
For its May 7 feature , “ Ron Paul Uprising , ” the Santa Fe Reporter did some local investigation :
“ Last week , the local parties held their County Quadrennial Conventions to nominate delegates to the state convention , where the national delegates will be elected …..
[ A ] ccording to Paul 's New Mexico field coordinator , Jeff Wright , Paul 's delegate count looks good .
Wright tells SFR that 19 out of 25 of Santa Fe County 's delegates , seven out of nine of Lincoln County 's delegates and more than 50 of Bernalillo County 's 156 delegates , are Paul supporters .
“ At the state convention on June 14 , 29 delegates and 29 alternates will be elected for the September national convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minn . ”
Those delegates will be bound for the first ballot , proportional to the results of NM 's primary .
“ In New Mexico , Paul would need to collect 15 percent of the popular vote to win [ bound ] delegates to the national convention .
That 's exceedingly unlikely in New Mexico , ” adds the Reporter .
Maass , op cit .
Utah
The Salt Lake City Tribune reported May 9 that “ a number of Utah Ron Paul backers are trying to get elected Saturday as delegates to the Republican National Convention where , under a proposed rule change , they could be free to vote for whomever they want . ”
However , no figures are being reported , even on RPR sites .
When one Utah Paul National Delegate 's name was posted on The Daily Paul last week , the poster was advised by a reader to delete it because “ they are watching . ”
Utah 's National Delegates are bound to Mitt Romney for one ballot .
The motion to unbind them came from the McCain camp , who planned to follow up with a second resolution urging them to vote for McCain instead .
Paul 's state delegates opposed the move to unbind , their reasoning being that first - ballot votes for Romney are votes against McCain .
The motion , which needed a 2/3 ' supermajority , ' did not pass but did not fail either ; as reported by the Deseret News , it was “ postponed indefinitely . ”
Utah GOP vice - chairman Todd Weiler told the News : “ ' They 're bound to vote for Romney .
Whether they vote for Romney is another issue … .
I think there will be a lot of temptation ' to disregard party rules and vote for McCain ( maybe a few for Paul ) anyway .
When asked what would happen to a delegate who refused to vote for Romney , Weiler said , ' We 'll find out . ' ”
Minnesota ( update )
The controversial motion passed at Minnesota 's 6th Congressional District convention Apr. 6 , binding its 3 delegates ( two of them Paul supporters ) and 3 alternates ( all Paul backers ) to vote for John McCain has been thrown out as unconstitutional .
Chairman Mark Swanson advised the delegates and alternates that “ After consultation with our party leadership and a review of the appropriate documents , we have come to the conclusion that the motion does not pass constitutional muster ….
Delegates ( and alternates ) are not bound to vote for any particular candidate . ”
Craig Westover , “ Dispute over Ron Paul delegates may go into overtime , ” Minnpost.com , Apr. 23 , 2008 .

Oklahoma ( update )
At the state covention in Tulsa May 3 , “ The Liberty Coalition , made up of disgruntled supporters of Ron Paul and other unsuccessful Republican presidential candidates , attacked the state executive committee 's slate of at - large national convention delegates and alternates as insufficiently conservative and tried to force a roll call vote on its own slate of delegates … .
The faction did claim one victory — one of its members , former attorney general candidate James Dunn of Luther , edged out Steve Curry of Oklahoma City for national committeeman . ”
The national committeeman is an automatic National Delegate , or ' superdelegate . '
On May 5 , state party chairman Gary Jones told the Oklahoman that Mike Huckabee has released the 6 bound National Delegates he won in the Feb. 5 primary .
“ Jones said Monday he has contacted Huckabee 's delegates and all but one ' of them said they would vote for McCain .
The other delegate is going to vote for U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas . ”

Because of their portability , laptops are particularly vulnerable
Scientists have shown that it is possible to recover the key that unscrambles data from a PC 's memory .
It was previously thought that data held in so - called " volatile memory " was only retained for a few seconds after the machine was switched off .
But the team found that data including encryption keys could be held and retrieved for up to several minutes .
" It was widely believed that when you cut the power to the computer that the information in the volatile memory would disappear , and what we found was that was not the case , " Professor Edward Felten of the University of Princeton told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme .
Volatile memory is typically used in random access memory ( RAM ) , which is used as temporary storage for programs and data when the computer is switched on .
Deep sleep
Disc encryption is the main method by which companies and governments protect sensitive information .
" The key to making it work is to keep the encryption key secret , " explained Professor Felten .
Encryption has recently become a hot topic after a number of laptops containing personal records were lost or stolen .
Simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection
Edward Felten
" What we have found was that the encryption keys needed to access these encrypted files were available in the memory of laptops , " he said .
" The information was available for seconds or minutes . "
In theory , this is enough time for a hacker or attacker to retrieve the key from the memory chips .
" The real worry is that someone will get hold of your laptop either while it is turned on or while it is in sleeping or hibernation mode , " said Professor Felten .
In these modes the laptop is not running , but information is still stored in RAM to allow it to " wake up " quickly .
" The person will get the laptop , cut the power and then re-attach the power , and by doing that will get access to the contents of memory - including the critical encryption keys . "
Cool running
Switching the machine off and on is critical to any attack .
" When it comes out of sleep mode the operating system is there and it is trying to protect this data , " explained Professor Felten .
But a full power - down followed by a swift re-start removes this protection .
" By cutting the power and then bringing it back , the adversary can get rid of the operating system and get access directly to the memory . "
Professor Felten and his team found that cooling the laptop enhanced the retention of data in memory chips .
" The information stays in the memory for much longer - 10 minutes or more , " he said .
For example , where information stays in a computer for around 15 seconds under normal conditions , a laptop cooled to about - 50C will keep information in its memory for 10 minutes or more .
Professor Felten said that the best way to protect a computer was to shut it down fully several minutes before going into any situation in which the machine 's physical security could be compromised .
" Simply locking your screen or switching to ' suspend ' or ' hibernate ' mode will not provide adequate protection , " he added .
" It does cast some doubt on the value of encryption .
I think that over time the encryption products will adapt to this and they will find new ways of protecting information . "

Almost 300 planets have now been found outside our Solar System
Astronomers have discovered a planetary system orbiting a distant star which looks much like our own .
They found two planets that were close matches for Jupiter and Saturn orbiting a star about half the size of our Sun. Martin Dominik , from St Andrews University in the UK , said the finding suggested systems like our own could be much more common than we thought .
And he told a major meeting that astronomers were on the brink of finding many more of them .
The St Andrews researcher said this planetary system , and others like it , could host terrestrial planets like Earth .
It was just a matter of time before such worlds were detected , he explained .
Dr Dominik told BBC
News : " We found a system with two planets that take the roles of Jupiter and Saturn in our Solar System .
These two planets have a similar mass ratio and similar orbital radius and a similar orbital period .
" It looks like this may have formed in a similar way to our Solar System .
And if this is the case , it looks like [ our ]
Solar System cannot be unique in the Universe .
There should be other similar systems out there which could host terrestrial planets . "
Dr Dominik presented his work at the Royal Astronomical Society 's National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast .
Ultimate goal
The newfound planetary system , which orbits the star OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 109L , is more compact than our own and is about five thousand light - years away .
Although nearly 300 extrasolar planets have been identified , astronomers have consistently failed to find planetary systems which resemble our own .
Dr Dominik said only 10 % of systems discovered so far are known to host more than one planet .
But he explained that all the techniques currently used to find exoplanets were strongly biased towards detecting gas giant planets orbiting at short distances from their parent stars .
The OGLE planets were found using a technique called gravitational micro-lensing , in which light from the faraway planets is bent and magnified by the gravity of a foreground object , in this case a another star .
" It 's a kind of scaled - down version of our Solar System .
The star the planets are orbiting is half as massive as the Sun and they orbit half as distant to their host star as Jupiter and Saturn orbit around the Sun , " said Dr Dominik .
He said that the ultimate goal for exoplanet researchers was to find habitable Earth - like and Mars - like planets .
This aim was achievable , he said , because technology was improving all the time .
" I think it will happen quite soon , " he said , adding : " Micro- lensing can already go below Earth mass and it has detected more massive planets in the habitable zone .
So in the next few years , we will see something really exciting . "
Dr Dominik said there was competition between teams of astronomers using micro-lensing and those who favoured the transit technique , which seeks to detect new planets when , from our point of view , they pass directly in front of the parent star they are orbiting .
The planet blocks a tiny fraction of the star 's light , causing the star to periodically dim .
But he added that there was little chance to detect Earth - like worlds in OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 109L because the system was too distant for current techniques to resolve planets the size of our own .

What are these ?
The question of how to handle 404 pages and DNS redirects for things like mistyped URLs is becoming an increasingly important one .
For some time , some web developers have been creating their own custom 404 pages in an effort to offer useful tools and navigation links instead of just an ugly dead end .
But approaches to these problems from Google and Verizon — some of which can actually make revenue from mistyped URLs — are being met with mixed criticism and refreshed concerns over security and network neutrality .
Of mistyped URLs ...
Last year , Verizon began redirecting mistyped URLs from its FiOS customers to its own custom search pages — complete with advertisements — regardless of what a user 's default search settings .
This feature , which Verizon calls " Advanced Web Search , " requires the company to silently alter users ' DNS .
Consumer Affairs notes that Verizon allows users to opt out , but the company has still rolled it out to customers in the Midwest , Maryland , and Virginia .
While redirecting DNS for the purpose of making the best out of misspelled URLs may seem harmlessly appealing at face value , some are concerned over the functional and security risks involved .
Back in 2004 , ICANN smacked down VeriSign 's SiteFinder service , which redirected requests for unregistered domains to an ad - heavy search page .
Ars Technica spoke with Tim Wu , a Columbia Law School professor and network neutrality advocate , who has mixed feelings about Verizon 's DNS redirecting .
" I generally have no problem with good faith efforts by ISPs to help their customers , " Wu told Ars .
" It 's when they try and manipulate the system that I am troubled .
For example , obviously , if you typed in www.google.com and arrived at Verizon ’s web site , I think you could hardly be happy with that . "
Those concerned about this feature , however , are worried about the manipulation Wu mentioned .
If Verizon is righteously redirecting in the name of bad spelling now , what 's to stop it from beginning to bend the rules and alter search results or quietly insert its own affiliate ads into web sites ?
DNS redirects have also been known to cause problems with personal security software and custom DNS settings .
The fact that this feature was automatically switched on is unfortunate in these cases , Verizon does allow customers to opt out of the service .
... and 404 redirects
Google has also ventured into questionably helpful territory by introducing similar mistyped domain and 404 page redirects into its Google Toolbar product .
Available only in the version 5 beta for Internet Explorer for now , Google introduced a new feature that subverts 404 file not found errors with its own mixed solution .
Some mistyped URLs , such as microsofft.com , will yield a simplified Google 404 error with a suggested URL and a search box , while others , like aple.com , will redirect to a full Google search .
Typing in nonexistent subdirectories at various sites leads to mixed results .
Some end in a standard 404 error , while others present the redirected Google warning and search box .
When news of this broke , some feared that Google would be trumping custom 404 pages with this toolbar by displaying its own redirected search tools and advertisements , but our testing reveals that the company treads carefully .
It appears that any sites with custom 404 pages that present helpful navigation links or even simple warnings are left untouched by the Google Toolbar beta .
Ultimately , neither of these companies are showing irrefutable evidence of acting maliciously to alter search results or cause harm to the workings of the Internet .
Both companies will argue that they are providing a service to customers who mistype URLs and may not be able to find what they 're looking for .
Critics of automatic redirection will counter that the likes of Verizon and Google are offering ( and profiting from ) solutions in search of a problem .
London Heathrow airport 's latest building , Terminal 5 , launched last month after almost two decades of planning , $ 8.5 billion dollars in cost , and 100 million hours in manpower .
It is a glass and concrete and steel marvel , the largest free standing building in the UK , with over 10 miles in suitcase moving belts , and was supposed to be a cure for the Airport 's famous congestion by way of massive automation .
But on its opening day it just did not work right .
This week , British Airways ' plans to move its long haul operations from the crowded main terminal to the new terminal were pushed back til June .
Much of the press was quick to say that tech was the source of the failings in parking , luggage handling and check in , but here are the details I can find on what exactly caused endless lines and delay for so many passengers of Terminal 5 .

Parking
Road signs pointing to garages were said to be misleading , and some signs inside the garages were inaccurate .
Furthermore , there were complaints about problems paying for parking and exiting the structures .
Check In
On day one , check in counters were not open at 4 am , meaning some ticketholders had to start lining up , causing a backlog that certainly did n't help the launch .
By noon , 20 flights had been canceled because of baggage handling problems .
Baggage
Here 's the heart of the issue at Terminal 5's launch .
The luggage system was designed to be streamlined as a checkpoint for travelers , on the way to the plane .
BAA also enthuses about technology like the baggage drop , which hoists suitcases to an underfloor belt , enabling passengers to walk forward to departures rather than turning around .
" It 's on the way , not in the way , " quips Ms. Kearney .
Advertisement
The 10 miles of belts are capable of handling 12,000 items of luggage in an hour .
But on day one , workers , presumably understaffed , were unable to clear incoming luggage fast enough , causing + 2 hour delays at baggage claim .
On the other side of things , the system reported to handlers that flights that were awaiting luggage had already left .
Instead of loading suitcases on planes , they took them back to the terminal for the next flight .
So , a few planes took off with empty cargo holds .
Exaggerating all of this , the belt system jammed at one point .
Sometime on day one , the airlines had no choice but to only check in those without baggage .
Advertisement
To add insult to injury , the Terminal 5 system has also lost the luggage of a passenger who died traveling back from Hong Kong , who is a son of an ex British Airways employee .
He said , " To lose the luggage of a dead person is unforgivable . "
In the end , British Airways has claimed responsibility for 15,000 bags were stranded at Heathrow .
There is speculation that this number may have been has high as 20,000 .

Flight Control
Not much went wrong here .
Thank god .
Last I checked , there were weather related delays , but that 's not something you can plan to avoid .
But the problems with check ins , resulting from lines and baggage problems , did result in 34 flights being canceled on day one .
Security
" Twenty security lanes promise speedier passage , though domestic travelers will now be fingerprinted . "
Since people could n't get through check in and baggage handling issues , security was probably not taxed .
Testing
Being nerds , you'd be right to suspect that all of this could have been caught by beta testing .
Thorough runs of all systems , from the " toilets to check in and seating " took place over 6 months before opening , including 4 full scale runs , using 16,000 volunteers from September 2007 to March 2008 .
That leaves not much time at all to deal with major issues , since it launched that month .

Sending electrical shocks into the brain via a " brain pacemaker " has already led to dramatic breakthroughs like the revival of a man trapped in a vegetative state for six years , but new research may mean that the technique is soon a common treatment for disorders like depression and OCD .
Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic , Mass General , Harvard Medical School and Brown Medical School implanted the Medtronics brain pacemaker into 17 people suffering from depression and tracked them for a year , finding significant improvements in mood as well as social and occupational functioning , while 26 patients suffering from OCD were followed for three years and also showed " marked improvement . "
Findings will be presented to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons this week in Chicago , and clinical trials are scheduled for later this year -- in other news , sales of " The Terminal Man " to neurosurgeons recently skyrocketed for unknown reasons .
This month ’s edition of the psychology magazine Monitor has an amusing article about a psychometric scale designed in the 1930s for rating the quality of your wife .
It was designed by Dr George W. Crane in an attempt to give couples feedback on their marriages .
But although husbands or wives could fill in the scale to rate the wife ’s ‘ quality ’ , there is no mention of a similar rating scale that rated the husband ’s performance .
Apparently , the full scale had 50 merits and 50 demerits of differing value which were subtracted from each other to give the final score .
The Monitor has the first 12 items which are hugely amusing , although I note that an item mentioned in the article – “ reacts with pleasure and delight to marital congress ” – is not among them , but was apparently worth 10 ‘ merits ’ .
This is equal in value to “ Religious – sends children to Sunday school and goes herself ” .
Personally , I ca n’t believe that “ Puts her cold feet on husband at night to warm them ” is worth only one ‘ demerit ’ .
Surely this grievous violation of the sacred bond of marriage should have been looked on more strictly .
UPDATE :
The full scale is now available online , include one for husbands !

" Vote Fraud " is show business designed to fool the ignorant into continuing to believe in the system .
Only fools believe the problems with government result from who is in office .
The problem is government itself !
Welcome to reality .
For nearly 5 decades I have been hooted at , vilified , and derided by all kinds of political " know - it - alls " because I stated that the idea that voting could change anything was illogical .
In primitive societies tribal members believe that by cutting up animals their future can be assured .
In even MORE primitive societies tribal members believe that by placing marked papers in a box their future can be assured .
I ask you WHICH belief in black magic is MORE ignorant ???
Especially , when history shows that regardless of WHO is elected ( person , party , philosophy , etc. ) taxes increase ; laws become more oppressive ; more are killed in wars ; economic opportunity declines ; and life becomes more brutish and miserable .
Oh I know , somehow THIS time it will be different --- yeah right , and Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy are real too ... WAKE UP you idiots !

Faith in the touch screen voting machines is really " magical thinking : " that is I want to believe that will work , so I believe these work .
I deal with this type of thinking everyday in the business world , and I pity our democracy that have to depend on them to do us right .
It is critical thinking , not wishful thinking , that will show us the results .

This is not brain surgery .
Fair elections should not be so difficult to ensure .
People are not idiots .
Eventually they learn the truth about astroturfing .
They hear of Netvocates , the Bivings Group , the White House Iraq Group , that Kos Zuniga is pro-CIA and Ronald Reagan .
They learn of the Rendon Group and other propaganda outlets .
Is Mark Lindeman an astroturfer ?
Yes !
HudsonValleyMark Resist false dichotomies .
Daily Kos is not divided between the reality - based and the loony tunes .
Daily Kos is not divided between the brave warriors for democracy and their wicked and / or delusional persecutors .
My { SluggoJD} response to the fake Dems in this thread at DU OnTheOtherhand , aka Mark Lindeman , who has ties to the right wing via Rick Brady - why do you spend so much time at DU ?
You 're not even a Democrat ... you 're a right winger .
I 've often wondered if posting at DU is some sort of job for you - you spend all your time deflecting any and all questions regarding exit polls from 2004 .
At Kos , you suddenly popped in out of nowhere , not having posted for days and days , to defend NC Beach Girl ( aka RobP of Diebold ) and even now , you want people to believe that NC Beach Girl was some innocent person ?
Can anyone point me to any posts by Lindeman that have anything to do with getting rid of the corruption in politics ?
Anything antiwar ?
Anything remotely with depth about war crimes and the trashing of democracy ?
He has simply made thousands of posts attacking anyone who stands up to the Republican agenda of stealing elections .
He regularly attacks " annoying citizens on hobby horses " who supply evidence of electoral shenanigans and voice their concerns .
He goes after Brad , Bev , and others who represent all of us demanding exposure and accountability .
He does n't stop there .
He goes after other academics .
He tries to minimize the work of Bob Fitrakis .
He infers that Crispin Miller is a tinfoiler .
He acts as if political science is the be all , end all for spinning public opinion as regards to election fraud .
Here is why Lindeman does n't make it easy for people to know who he is .
The following thread is representative of why Lindeman does n't start threads at Democratic Underground .
Internet fakes can sometimes have a nice little run of influence .
But in the long run , is Lindeman really that much different from AnonymousArmy , Steven Hertzberg , David " Kelvin Mace " Allen , and all the other loudmouths who have been obfuscating this issue for years ?
No , he is n't !
Did Don Siegelman win in 2002 ?
probably not Some choice quotes : Election fraud allegations often polarize people very fast , which is a shame .
I favor election systems that make endless arguments about the past less likely .
This is the part he has been trying to script .
The noise , all those thousands of posts attacking Bev Harris could n't go on forever .
Lindeman was meant to be the soothing , fake resolution .
Jim Gundlach : Except the Magnolia springs story was just as much a lie as the story that the first error was caused by lightning striking the power lines .
As far as I can see you do n't know what you are talking about .
jim gundlach eschew obfuscation Glynn Wilson : Basing your claim that there was no theft of the 2002 election in Baldwin County on a simple refutation of one graph in the academic analysis seems quite inadequate in itself ...
Without the benefit of a recount , which we will never get now , we can never know for sure .
And that 's sort of the point , do n't you think ?
You have to ask yourself :
Who benefited from NOT investigating what really happened ?
Lindeman : excuse me , but did you read the diary ?
....
sorry , obviously you pushed a button ....
My problem is that some people , including Mark Crispin Miller , are saying without reservation that the election was stolen .
And while Gundlach may not be saying that * , he has said some other things that I do n't think stand up to scrutiny ( along with some that do , and some that I 'm not sure about ) .
We 'll let SluggoJD have the last word : Bev Harris , an American Hero - Part 4 , a Conspiracy to Malign Ignoring Bev 's initial ( edited ) objection , David Allen ( her publisher at the time , fired in 2004 , and now the overt leader of the " BASHBEV.COM " movement ) contacted Tom Flocco 's right - hand man , who set up this insecure site .
His name is Robert Mendenhall Jr. of Whitestar Website Design .
He only had a handful of clients .
Besides tomflocco.com , his only other claim to fame was this site for Vreeland crap .
Not coincidentally , Andy Stephenson was a regular at the Vreeland site , as well as moderator at the insecure temp site ...
Later this week , I will present additional evidence that IMO proves there is a coordinated effort to malign Bev Harris , in order to hamper real BBV research .
This conspiracy involves David Allen , Tom Flocco , Robert Mendenhall Jr , and others who shall be named .... This conspiracy could be the work of one entity ( the right wing ) , or the work of two entities ( the right wing , and far left LaRouchie - like conspiracy nuts ) with some shared agendas ... I 'm not sure yet , since some right wing trolls are quite clever at appearing to be on the left instead of the right .

I just found another strange tie between Andy Stephenson and the right woos left network of internet fakes .
People can search around .
They will find out that Stephenson was in contact with a Mike Vreeland .
With this next DU link , one can see that he was also in contact with " whitestar . "
WhiteStar seems to be none other than Robert Mendenhall Jr. of WhiteStar Web Hosting .
BBV : This is a great sign Andy to WhiteStar : Howdy Bud !!!!
I was trying to call you ... Wanted to see you while I was in New York ... but your a long way from there I imagine .
WhiteStar basically made a lot of posts at DU with copy , pastes , and links from Tom Flocco.com .
All of this talk of " conspiracy nutters " did n't evolve naturally .
Disinfo agents have been on the job for years muddying the internet waters .
Anyone ever hear of Willis Carto ?
What about Wayne Madsen ?
Does anyone sincerely believe that all the rubbish they and Tom Flocco types have been publishing over the years have n't been attempts to discredit the internet ?
Does anyone think it 's a coincidence that both Fintan Dunne and AnonymousArmy insinuated that Brad is a CIA plant ?
Does anyone think it 's a coincidence that " Dunne " has called Bev Harris a 9/11 CIA rat ?
God bless this Andy Stephenson for he cannot answer to these questions , but wtf was he doing involved with so much internet disinfo ?
I 'm also curious about a poster named RAM .
Was at Tom Flocco 's site today .
He is changing servers ( or something ) and a rough draft was posted by mistake .
" The rough working draft about a fired prosecutor should never have been placed online ... "
But he continues : " We apologize for this inaccuracy ; however , we still stand by our on - the record source Tom Heneghen and our story reporting that true bill indictments have been voted out by the Chicago grand jury against a host of Bush administration officials ... "
Still waiting for any other reports .
Is RAM Robert Mendenhall , the owner of WhiteStar which hosts Flocco 's website ?
Nothing personal here , if he says he is n't , then I 'll take his word for it .
Yet , anyone who would post about Tom Flocco without a disclaimer makes me wonder .
E-VOTING TRAIN WRECK 2006 RAM :
Here 's the way my suspicious mind sees November 8th :
The republicans will steal as many elections as possible ( in districts with slim poll differences ) .
In districts that the dems win , the investigation into Sequoia will suddenly burst out with information that Chavez sabotaged our election .
The thing about Brad Friedman is that he does n't make claims without evidence , like a Tom Flocco does .
It 's really crazy how much tinfoil dung has been thrown around over the years around concerning Bev Harris and Brad .
Those two were chugging along , doing their thing , yet all around them on the internet insidious efforts were being made to circumscribe themselves into a convoluted script .
Here 's one last link , to a guy named Stew Webb .
Hold your nose .
Here he tried to make it seem like he was throwing Mendenhall under the bus and protecting Bev Harris .
But in reality , he was just continuing to spin tinfoiltainment rabbit holes .

Researchers from NASA and the University of Illinois at Chicago atop the frozen surface of Wisconsin 's Lake Mendota this week are preparing for interplanetary exploration .
Below them , under a sheet of ice more than a foot ( 30 centimeters ) thick , the space agency 's new Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under - Ice Robotic Antarctic Explorer ( ENDURANCE ) maps the lake 's underwater terrain .
If this and subsequent voyages are successful , a similar vessel could be sent to navigate the suspected liquid water under the frozen surface of the ocean on Jupiter 's moon Europa by the year 2028 .
ENDURANCE , a $ 2.3 - million project funded by NASA 's Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets ( ASTEP ) program , is an autonomous vehicle designed to operate underwater below the ice .
Its mission : to gather environmental data ( such as samples of microbial life ) and create three - dimensional maps of undersea topography .
The Lake Mendota effort is a practice run for a month - long mission it is set to undertake later this year in Antarctica 's permanently frozen Lake Bonney , which is coated with up to 15 feet ( 4.5 meters ) of ice .
The lake , which is about 2.5 miles ( four kilometers ) long , one mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) wide , 130 feet ( 40 meters ) deep and located in the continent 's McMurdo Dry Valleys , was chosen because its extreme conditions are about as close as it gets on Earth to those ENDURANCE might encounter on Europa .
If this trip to Antarctica is successful , ENDURANCE will do a second mapping next year .
All data gathered from these expeditions will be sent to the University of Illinois 's Electronic Visualization Laboratory , where researchers will create 3 - D images , maps and data renderings of the lake .
ENDURANCE begins mapping from the melt hole through which it enters the water .
Using the GPS coordinates of the opening , the vehicle 's positions are determined data gleaned from sensors that measure temperature , light and the water 's chemistry .
During its eight - hour missions , gathered information is stored on board using flash disk memory for later recovery and analysis on the surface .
Workers cut a 10 - foot ( 3.1 - meter ) by 14 - foot ( 4.3 - meter ) rectangular dive hole with a chainsaw to prepare an entry point for ENDURANCE in Lake Mendota 's icy surface .
Because ENDURANCE enters and leaves its underwater habitats via ice holes , it is designed to be a compact vehicle — about 4.7 feet ( 1.4 meters ) long , 3.5 feet ( 1.1 meters ) wide , and 2.6 feet ( 0.8 meter ) high and weighing about 176 pounds ( 80 kilograms ) on land .
The propulsion chassis uses commercial components along with custom - designed flight electronics and thrust vector controllers .
Maximum vehicle speed is anticipated to be as much as five feet ( 1.5 meters ) per second .
Most of the onboard scientific instrumentation is fiber - optic - based and mounted along the wall of a flow - through tube that runs the entire interior length of the vehicle .
Chloride and conductivity probes sense the same flow stream at the rear of the vehicle .
A digital camera with lighting sits on the starboard bow ( located on the right , if you are facing the sub's front ) for capturing visible spectrum images within each volume pixel ( voxel ) as well as for taking bottom sediment images .
Three - dimensional images are composed of voxels in the same way that two - dimensional ones are built from pixels .
ENDURANCE , which runs on two lithium ion batteries , detects and avoids obstacles using sonar arrays mounted on the bow , port ( left ) and starboard sides that can alert the vessel about an object up to 328 feet ( 100 meters ) away .
The sonar 's detection range is expected to give ENDURANCE at least a minute before it reaches any obstacle .
An ultrashort baseline transceiver is lowered into the water once ENDURANCE submerges and emits signals that give the autonomous vessel a point of reference .
This aids the vessel 's mapping mission and also helps the researchers retrieve their robot sub .
A malfunction that might cause ENDURANCE to get lost or be unable to make its way back to the entry hole would be disastrous due to the harsh conditions in which it operates .
" When you put something in a lake in Antarctica , you do n't want to lose it , " says John Rummel , a NASA senior scientist for astrobiology .
ENDURANCE is a follow - up to the Deep Phreatic Thermal explorer ( DEPTHX ) , a NASA - funded project led by StoneAerospace , Inc. , a Del Valle , Tex. based maker of technology used to explore the ocean depths as well as deep space .
DEPTHX last year underwent extensive underwater field tests in Mexico , and its success has paved the way for ENDURANCE 's missions .
Whereas the DEPTHX was tested in waters that were a balmy 86 degrees Fahrenheit ( 30 degrees Celsius ) , ENDURANCE will encounter 32 - degree F ( 0 - degree C ) conditions in Lake Bonney , whose stratified waters contain both fresh - and salt - water .
Nearest its surface , Bonney has a layer of about 16 feet ( five meters ) of freshwater atop about 110 feet ( 33.5 meters ) of saltwater , the latter of which is three times as saline as normal seawater , Rummel says .
This increased saltiness will cause ENDURANCE 's sonar waves to behave differently , bouncing upward more than they would in fresh or less briny water .
NASA 's otherworldly aspirations for ENDURANCE include a trip to Europa , which Rummel says the agency hopes to pull off within in two decades .
ENDURANCE has to prove its mettle on Earth , however , before it is ready to dive under Europa 's ocean , which features up to 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) of ice atop water that could be around 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) deep .
Once there , ENDURANCE could play a very special role in space exploration , Rummel says , adding , " It could very well be the first vehicle to find extraterrestrial life . "

Radio emissions from the HLTau system show the planet ( top right )
An embryonic planet detected outside our Solar System could be less than 2,000 years old , astronomers say .
The ball of dust and gas , which is in the process of turning into a Jupiter - like giant , was detected around the star HL Tau , by a UK team .
Research leader Dr Jane Greaves said the planet 's growth may have been kickstarted when another young star passed the system 1,600 years ago .
Details were presented at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast .
The scientists studied a disc of gas and rocky particles around HL Tau , which is 520 light - years away in the constellation of Taurus and thought to be less than 100,000 years old .
It wasnt really what we were looking for .
And we were amazed when we found it
Jane Greaves
University of St Andrews
The disc is unusually massive and bright , making it an excellent place to search for signs of planets in the process of formation .
The researchers say their picture is one of a proto - planet still embedded in its birth material .
Dr Greaves , from the University of St Andrews , Scotland , said the discovery of a forming planet around such a young star was a major surprise .
" It was n't really what we were looking for .
And we were amazed when we found it , " she told BBC News .
" The next youngest planet confirmed is 10 million years old . "
If the proto - planet is assumed to be the same age as the star it orbits , this would be some one hundred times younger than the previous record holder .
' Record holder '
Growth of planet
But there is an intriguing suggestion that the gas giant , which is some 14 times the size of our Jupiter , could be even younger .
Using the Very Large Array ( VLA ) of radio telescopes in the US , the researchers studied the system at emission wavelengths specifically chosen to search for rocky particles about the size of pebbles .
The presence of these pebbles is a clue that rocky material is beginning to clump together to form planets .
In the UK , scientists used the Merlin radio telescopes based on Jodrell Bank in Cheshire to study the same system at longer wavelengths .
This allowed them to confirm the emissions were from rocks and not from other sources such as hot gas .
In addition to detecting super - large dust in the disc around HL Tau , they also saw an extra bright " clump " of material .
This confirmed a so - called " nebulosity " seen a few years earlier at about the same position , by a team led by Dr Jack Welch of the Berkeley - Illinois - Maryland Array , US .
Formation theories Dr Ken Rice , from the Institute of Astronomy in Edinburgh , said the discovery shed new light on theories of planet formation .
According to one model , planets form from the bottom up .
Under this scenario , particles of rocky material collide and " stick " to one another , forming a bigger and bigger object .
But he thinks the proto- planet in HL Tau formed relatively quickly when a region of the disc collapsed to form a self - contained structure .
This could occur because of gravitational instability in the disc itself .
Dr Rice said his computer simulations were such a good fit for the observations that it seemed the mechanism might really operate in nature .
Intriguingly , another young star in the same region called XZ Tau may have made a close pass of HL Tau about 1,600 years ago .
Although not required for planet formation , it is possible that this flyby perturbed the disc , making it unstable .
This would be a very recent event in astronomical terms .
" It 's possible it gave a ' yank ' to one side of the disc around HL Tau , making it unstable , and that this was a ' trigger ' for the planet to form , " Dr Greaves explained .
" If the planet formed in the last 1,600 years , that would be incredibly recent . "
The Royal Astronomical Society 's National Astronomy Meeting 2008 continues until Friday at Queens University Belfast .

UK space scientist Emeritus Professor Alan Wells discussed the breadth of international collaborations in new discoveries about gamma ray bursts obtained from the Swift satellite and coordinated observations from a global network of ground based telescopes at the AAAS annual meeting in Boston .
Gamma -ray bursts are short - lived events , lasting between a few milliseconds to a few minutes .
The brightest of them emit more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will emit in its whole 10 billion year lifetime .
Gamma ray bursts are occurring several times daily somewhere in the universe , fortunately at huge distances from our solar system .
These fleeting explosions are precursors to the births of black holes .
The Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer satellite is a NASA mission with substantial UK and Italian participation .
Swift was designed to solve the mystery of the origin of gamma ray bursts by pinpointing the burst and measuring the emissions from the huge fireball that occurs in the first few seconds of the burst 's lifetime .
Scientists at Leicester 's Space Research Centre are part of the international team working on the Swift , having had a major role in the development of the X - ray telescope , which has been responsible for many of the discoveries made by Swift .
Since its launch in 2004 , Swift has discovered over 292 gamma-ray bursts , and pin-pointed a further 320 bursts detected by other satellites .
Swift 's rapid response - it was named after the bird , which catches its prey " on the fly " - has been critical to understanding these titanic events .

Tax rebates fail to spark consumer spending
U.S. personal spending slowed in April after record fuel costs , a slump in home values and a deteriorating job market hammered consumer confidence .
The 0.2 percent gain in spending followed a 0.4 percent increase in March , the Commerce Department said today in Washington .
Incomes grew 0.2 percent , bolstered in part by the government 's tax rebates .
Separate reports showed business activity dropped for a fourth month in May and consumer sentiment decreased to the lowest level since 1980 .
Retailing stocks slumped after the figures reinforced forecasts for spending growth to slow this quarter to the weakest pace since 1991 .
J.Crew Group Inc. , the casual - clothing retailer , reduced its earnings forecast late yesterday , citing a nationwide drop in the number of shoppers visiting its stores .
" Consumers are spending cautiously , " said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York , who correctly forecast the gain in spending .
" The economy is in a grey area between recession and slow growth . "
Treasuries rallied , sending benchmark 10 - year note yields down to 4.03 percent at 9:55 a.m. in New York , from 4.08 percent late yesterday .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 retailing index dropped 0.8 percent to 401.27 .
The Federal Reserve 's preferred measure of inflation , which excludes food and fuel costs , slowed in April , today 's Commerce report showed .
The gauge rose 0.1 percent , compared with a 0.2 percent increase the previous month .
The Reuters / University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment decreased to 59.8 , the lowest level since June 1980 , from 62.6 in April .
The measure averaged 85.6 in 2007 .
Deteriorating confidence indicates that government tax rebates may only provide a temporary boost to economic growth in coming months .
Economists forecast consumer spending gains will slow to a 0.5 percent annual pace this quarter , the weakest since 1991 , from a 1 percent pace in the first three months of the year .
" Consumers are really very downbeat , " Richard Iley , senior economist at BNP Paribas SA in New York , said in an interview with Bloomberg Television .
Economists forecast spending would rise 0.2 percent , according to the median of 73 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey .
Incomes were forecast to rise 0.1 percent , according to the survey .
The increase masked the first drop in employee compensation since April 2007 .
The central bankers ' preferred gauge of prices was up 2.1 percent from April 2007 , matching the 12 - month increase in March .
Adjusted for inflation , the figures used in calculated gross domestic product , spending was unchanged after a 0.1 percent gain the prior month , the report showed .
Disposable income , or the money left over after taxes , increased 0.2 percent , after increasing 0.3 percent the previous month .
The economy grew at a 0.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter , more than previously estimated , as the trade deficit shrank to a five - year low , revised Commerce figures showed yesterday .
Consumer spending rose at a 1 percent pace last quarter , the smallest gain since the 2001 recession .
The surge in food and fuel expenses is causing Americans to become more budget conscious .
Wyndham Worldwide Corp. , the franchiser of Ramada and Super 8 hotels , said customers are taking advantage of discounts .
" People are probably wary of the economy , wary of food and gas prices being higher , and looking to economize , " Chief Executive Officer Stephen Holmes said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week .
Inflation - adjusted spending on durable goods , such as autos , furniture and other long - lasting items , dropped 0.2 percent after decreasing 1.3 percent .
Purchases of non-durable goods fell 0.2 percent after increasing 0.5 percent .
Spending on services , which account for almost 60 percent of all outlays , increased 0.1 percent for the second month .
The government is counting on its economic stimulus initiative to revive growth .
The Treasury last week said it sent $ 4.9 billion in tax rebates in the fourth week of the program , raising the total distributed so far to $ 45.7 billion .
The extra money may not bring much relief .
Households will spend about $ 90 billion more this year on gasoline if fuel prices remain at current levels , according to a forecast by economists at Credit Suisse Holdings in New York .
That will consume about 80 percent of the more than $ 110 billion in rebate checks being sent .
Tiffany & Co. , the world 's second - largest luxury - jewelry retailer , today forecast full - year earnings that may beat analysts ' estimates on a surge in jewelry sales abroad and foreign - tourist spending in the U.S .
First - quarter sales at U.S. stores open at least 12 months were unchanged from a year earlier , with a 4 percent decline at its locations outside the main store in New York .
Chief Executive Officer Michael Kowalski said in a statement that conditions were " challenging " in the U.S. and that he did n't expect an improvement until later this year .
Other companies , while seeing no indication of a rebound in spending , are also not seeing any further deterioration .
Estee Lauder Cos. , the maker of Clinique and Bobbi Brown cosmetics , said its full - year earnings will be higher than it estimated in February .
" We see no indication at the moment that consumer spending is improving , but we do n't see anything that it 's getting worse , " Chief Executive Officer William Lauder said in a May 6 phone interview .

It 's all over for Hillary .
Support for Clinton Wanes as Obama Sees Finish Line .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton struck a publicly defiant posture on Wednesday about continuing her presidential bid despite waning support from Democratic officials and donors .
Some of her advisers acknowledged privately that they remained unsure about the future of her candidacy .
In West Virginia on Wednesday afternoon , Mrs. Clinton said that it was “ still early ” — even though 50 of 56 nominating contests have concluded — and that the “ dynamic electoral environment ” could still swing the nomination her way .
“ I ’m staying in this race until there is a nominee , and obviously I ’m going to work as hard as I can to become that nominee , ” Mrs. Clinton said after an event in Shepherdstown , W.Va .
Political pressure on Mrs. Clinton to withdraw is growing .
A widely known supporter of Mrs. Clinton , former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota , the 1972 Democratic nominee , announced on Wednesday that he had switched his endorsement to Mr. Obama and believed that Mrs. Clinton should drop out because it was mathematically impossible for her to win the nomination .
The Obama campaign also announced four new superdelegate endorsements , those of Jerry Meek , chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party ; Jeanette Council , a member of the Democratic National Committee from North Carolina ; Inola Henry , a member of the national committee from California ; and Jennifer McClellan of the Virginia House of Delegates .
Ms. McClellan also switched from Mrs. Clinton ’s camp .

Intel Strike
May 9 , 2008
The Internet is now becoming a new front in the phony terror war .
Legislation like the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2007 that is in the forms of HR 1955 and S 1959 which seek to give the government powers to define thoughts and belief systems as homegrown terrorism , is on the brink of being pushed down our throats .
HR 1955 was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 404 - 6 and now it appears as if the U.S. Senate is attempting to justify its future passage .
The U.S. Senate homeland security committee lead by war mongering fascist Joesph Lieberman , investigated the so called growing threat of terrorists using the Internet for recruiting and training purposes .
In their report , they paint the Internet as a dangerous tool for terrorists and conclude that new laws need to be passed “ to prevent the spread of the ideology . ”
It is incredibly convenient that S 1959 provides the legislation that is called for in their report .
The true purpose of this report is to push for the passage of S 1959 which will give the government powers similar to what the government of Oceania used in George Orwell ’s book 1984 .
The Hartford Courant ran an article on this Senate homeland security committee report .
According to their article , the report hypes the threat of homegrown terrorism and how the Internet is playing a key role in spreading the message of so called terrorists .
Below is a blurb taken from the article .
A Senate homeland security committee report set for release Thursday details a growing threat from terrorists ’ use of the Internet as a recruiting and training tool .
The report concludes that the U.S. government should consider its own outreach program as a counter to the Web strategies of groups such as al - Qaida .
A draft of the staff - generated report obtained by The Courant says that “ radicalization is no longer confined to training camps in Afghanistan or other locations far from our shores ; it is also occurring right here in the United States . ”
The homeland security committee , led by Sen. Joseph Lieberman , has investigated “ the threat of homegrown terrorism ” in several hearings since last year .
This report paints Internet use by terrorists as having an unlimited reach , including into English - speaking communities in the United States .
Al - Qaida , it says , runs a “ a multi- tiered online media operation in which a number of production units associated with [ al - Qaida ] or allied violent Islamist organizations produce content consistent with the core terrorist enlistment message . ”
The “ thousands ” of terrorist - operated websites have become “ an effective distribution system for the core enlistment message and other content , ” the report contends .
There is no longer as much of a need , it suggests , for physical training camps .
First off , the threat of terrorist operated Internet sites is a complete fraud .
IntelCenter a CIA front group which supposedly finds all of these Al - Qaeda terrorist video and audio tapes on the Internet never provides the source of where they obtain the terrorist propaganda .
If these materials were real terrorist propaganda and they did n’t want to reveal the source , why have we not seen warrants served , the web servers seized and people questioned ?
Why is it that the terrorist video and audio tapes that are released by this so called terrorist organization always seems to indirectly help the Bush administration ?
Since no warrants have been served , no Internet servers seized , no people questioned and the propaganda always seems to help the Bush administration it is pretty obvious that IntelCenter is the one releasing this so called terrorist propaganda .
After all , the Bush administration and the military industrial complex have a great deal to gain by ensuring that this phony terror war continues .
In addition to this , if there were really thousands of these terrorist - operated Internet sites , how is it that a multi-billion dollar defense and intelligence apparatus is incapable of connecting the dots through these sites to track down these so called terrorist leaders like Osama Bin Laden , Ayman Al - Zawahri and Adam Gadahn ?
The answer is simple .
Al - Qaeda is a massive psychological warfare operation designed to make the American people believe that the war on terror is actually real .
The newly coined concept of homegrown terrorism is meant to target political dissidents and other individuals who do not like what the government is doing .
It is specifically meant to target American citizens .
There is no question that the alternative media which has flourished on the Internet is doing a great deal of damage to their psychological warfare operations .
Through S 1959 , the establishment wants to give the government a blank check to define homegrown terrorism as anything they want so they can eventually arrest people for having particular belief systems .
This legislation actually makes it legal for the government to arrest and prosecute people for thought crimes .
This would be a very handy tool for the government to use in cracking down on the alternative media which is increasingly speaking out against globalization .
It has nothing to do with the government keeping us safe from Al - Qaeda and groups affiliated with Al - Qaeda on the Internet .
After all , Al - Qaeda was originally created by the CIA in the late 1970s and they ’ve been controlled by them ever since .
Here ’s more from the Hartford Courant article detailing the report ’s conclusion on what needs to be done about terrorist activity on the Internet .
The report details four stages of developing a vulnerable person into a terrorist , as taught by New York Police Department specialists .
“ Left unchallenged , it is very possible that the core terrorist enlistment message espoused over the Internet will drive more individuals in the United States all the way through the four stages of the radicalization process , ” it says .
So , how would it be challenged ?
Right now “ there is no cohesive and comprehensive outreach and communications strategy in place to confront this threat , ” the report says .
Several agencies have existing , narrow missions , but the report argues for a more comprehensive approach .
“ We must isolate and discredit the violent Islamist ideology as a cause worth supporting . ”
According to the report , new laws should be considered “ to prevent the spread of the ideology . ”
And those looking for solutions need to act “ quickly and aggressively . ”
The report concludes : “ The safety of the American people depends on it . ”
Is n’t it interesting that S 1959 provides just the legislation that will achieve what this report concludes ?
How does the U.S. government think they can prevent the spread of so called terrorist ideology through a law ?
S 1959 is incredibly dangerous because it literally gives the government a blank check to constantly redefine what homegrown terrorism is .
This means they can change the belief system that constitutes the ideology of homegrown terrorism and violent radicalization whenever they want .
S 1959 will literally legalize much of what the corrupt regime in George Orwell ’s book 1984 utilized to keep control of their citizens .
Suffice to say , S 1959 is an unconstitutional piece of legislation , but that has n’t stopped the traitors in the Senate homeland security committee from endorsing its virtues through the findings in this report .
They claim that the safety of the American people depend on them passing more legislation that restricts and reduces freedom .
This is an absolute lie ; because anytime you give up liberty for security you do n’t get either one .
There is no doubt that the purpose of this report is to convince the American people that S 1959 has to be passed .
Undoubtedly , most Americans would prefer to face the terrorists than have the government pass legislation like S 1959 that they claim is designed to protect us .
The government failed to protect us on September 11th , 2001 because they engineered the attacks to justify a police state in America and wage perpetual war .
If we had a real war on terror , there would be mass arrests of U.S. government officials and intelligence officers in the CIA , British Intelligence and the Mossad .
We could temporarily house these terrorists in their nice little FEMA run concentration camps that they have already built .
It is a proven fact that the majority of real terrorism is sponsored by governments and their associated intelligence agencies .
With that in mind , there is no question that this report from the Senate homeland security committee is a big load of horse crap .

In the much anticipated Countdown interview with Scott McClellan , Keith Olberman , the progressive lefts chosen one , coos over McClellan ’s version white - washed White House , just like the complicit enablers McClellan talks about in his book .
Can we really be as stupid they think we are ?
“ To that point , there is , I think , actual poetry in here , and I do n‘t mean to vainly flatter you here .
But let me read something else : “ Although I did n‘t realize it at the time , we launched our campaign to sell the war , what drove Bush toward military confrontation more than anything else was an ambitious and idealistic post - 9/11 vision of transforming the Middle East through the spread of freedom . ”
Keith Olberman discussing McClellan ’s new book on Countdown .
That ’s right : it was all about “ the spread of freedom ” .
Not oil , not an imperial Pax Americana , but the deep - seated desire to spread “ freedom ” through - out the Middle East .
Now this is coming from the “ progressive ” messiah , Keith Olberman , who has recently called Bush a liar , war criminal , a war profiteer , and quite literally a traitor to this country .
And now , since the man who ’s job it was to lie on a daily basis for this administration , comes forward with this book that says absolutely nothing new , except that Bush really wanted in his heart of hearts to simply bring “ freedom ” to the Middle East , Olberman reads it ; parrots it ; and puts his “ progressive ” stamp of approval on it .
Just like the current administration wanted .
McClellan : ” Well certainly he saw it as an opportunity to look at the war on terror in broad way and to try to implement this idealistic vision that he had of spreading democracy throughout the Middle East . ”
“ Democracy in the Middle East ” ?
Is that what the Hydrocarbon Law is in Iraq ?
Is that what all those billions of dollars that went missing is for ?
Democracy ?
Is it the kind of “ democracy ” that we experienced in Nov. 2000 ?
How about Nov. 2004 ?
Is that what “ Shock and Awe ” is ?
Democracy ?
Why did n’t Olberman pounce on these statements from McClellan ?
McClellan : “ But in terms of the coercive democracy , that was - and you bring up a very good point about the oxymoron there - but that was always the strategy for going into Iraq in first place .
And I think that is what really drove the president ‘s motivation to push ahead and rush into this . ”
And that is ALWAYS McClellan ’s message : everywhere he goes .
To retell the given myth from this administration ; though it may have been handled sloppily , this administration had the best INTENTIONS at heart : to bring freedom and democracy to the people of the Middle East ( by killing hundreds of thousands of them , forcing them from their homes , walling them off from other sections of Iraq and controlling their everyday movements , restricting their electricity and basic human rights , by signing over huge amounts of oil revenue to Exxon Mobil and BP and other multinational oil companies , and by putting black bags over their heads and shipping them off to Gitmo and other black - sites , where they disappear without legal representation for years . )
And then , the money - shot .
Olberman lobes his final question to McClellan about what happened when Bush ALMOST picked a democrat to head the Department of Homeland Security .
“ And I sat there and I had this little flutter in my heart , and I thought , he ‘s actually going to do what Roosevelt did in the Second World War , to some degree what Lincoln did during the Civil War , he ‘s going to put a Democrat in the cabinet … .
… Would something like that have made that bipartisan dream a reality ? ”
The “ bipartisan dream ” ?
Is that OUR dream ? and did Keith just lump together Lincoln , Roosevelt , and Bush on national television ?

{ May 23 , 2008} state of the ZUI
another thing I ’ve been chipping away at for 4.1 is the ZUI .
it ’s far from complete , but it ’s at least becoming something I actually use now . :) keyboard shortcuts can be used to navigate it quickly ( see my previous post ) , clicking a containment will make it the active one ( barring the focus bugs mentioned in that post ) , and notmart has amazingly made the cashews actually show up in the right place ! :)
I also added an option in the contextmenu for removing activities .
right now you can only remove ones that are n’t active ( ie when you call up the dashboard you do n’t get that containment shown ) but it ’s pretty useful when you ’re playing around and add way more than you actually want . :)
Oh , and if you do n’t want to zoom out , you can use the keyboard shortcuts to switch containment instantly .
my extreme laziness leads to features like this . :)
There are some features I did n’t get to , though …
I wanted some kind of visual clue as to which containment is active , but seeing as I have n’t even started to think about how to implement that and soc starts monday , I doubt it ’ll happen for 4.1 .
I also wanted a way to change which plugin the current containment uses – kinda ‘ swap out ’ the containment under all its applets , so that you can go from defaultdesktop to blankdesktop to folderview at will .
At the same time , I wanted to kick the theme config out of the defaultdesktop config , because it really does n’t belong there – but there was really no time for that , and anyways , the other containment changes coming in 4.2 might mean someone else handles that :)
There are some rather obvious bugs in the ZUI right now – dashboard has issues with containment switching , and you ca n’t drag the view around while zoomed out any more – but I ’m confident those will be fixed for 4.1 :) so we should have something simple but useful .
with the keyboard shortcuts you do n’t have to keep moving your mouse to a toolbox and finding the buttons , and with a single click you can choose the containment you want , so hopefully I ’ll find myself making use of the ZUI more regularly from now on . :)
just … if you have two monitors … do n’t zoom out both at once .
trust me … just do n’t .
As for the future of the ZUI … there ’s still lots to be done .
some of the bugs I run into are making me think that there ’s a bigger problem .
I ’ll have to do some deep thinking about the design … what really belongs in the desktop toolbox ?
should we have some other tools elsewhere or something ?
what changes should be made to the fully - zoomed - out level ?
how do we handle multiple views without madness ?
I have a feeling there were other zoomy things I was pondering , but it ’s past my bedtime now .
I ’ve barely left the computer in over 12 hours :/ but I ’ll be out in that big blue room all day tomorrow , so I guess it balances out in the end ;)

Advertisement A Russian Soyuz spacecraft has returned to Earth , but came down more than 400 km ( 250 miles ) away from its planned touchdown point , say Russian officials .
The crew are safe , but were subjected to severe G - forces during re-entry , said a spokesman for mission control .
He said they were examined at the landing site by medical staff .
On board were Yi So-yeon , South Korea 's first astronaut , Yuri Malenchenko from Russia and American Peggy Whitson , who broke Nasa 's record for time in space .
AMERICA'S PEGGY WHITSON
First female commander of ISS Sets new US spaceflight record Served almost 185 days in 2002 Latest ISS flight lasted 192 377 total passes Michael Foale UK - born astronaut total : 374 The Russian capsule was returning from a mission to the International Space Station .
It touched down some 420 km away from its planned landing point in the Kazakh steppe , and some 20 minutes later than schedule .
" The main thing is that the crew is alive and healthy , " said Anatoly Perminov , head of the Russian federal space agency .
They underwent medical examinations after landing , having been subjected to high G - forces in the descent .
Mr Perminov said the craft followed the back - up landing plan , a so - called " ballistic re-entry " - a plunge with an uncontrollable , steep trajectory .
He said the crew missed the target because they changed their landing plan at the last minute without telling mission control .
In October , a crew returning from the International Space Station had a similar experience , touching down in Kazakhstan 200 km ( 120 miles ) from its intended landing site , in temperatures of 6C ( 43 F ) .
Ms Yi had spent 11 days conducting tests at the space station .
South Korea 's Yi So - yeon spent 11 days at the International Space Station South Korea , which paid Russia $ 20 m ( £ 10 m ) for her trip into space , is investing heavily in space technology and is due to launch its first rocket later this year .
Ms Whitson now holds the record for the cumulative length of time spent in space by an American at 377 days , the US space agency Nasa said earlier .
This was Yuri Malenchenko's third long - duration spaceflight .
He spent 126 days aboard space station Mir in 1994 , and 185 days on the ISS in 2006 .
He also flew on a 12 - day shuttle mission in 2000 .
He has accumulated 515 days in space during his four flights .
This is the ninth highest total of cumulative time .

What are these ?
If this is n't a question you 've been pondering on pasta night , do a little experiment with me .
Go to the kitchen , grab a piece of dried spaghetti and , one hand on each end , bend it until it breaks .
If you thought it was going to snap into two clean pieces , and you 're halfway through the box and it still has n't happened yet , you 're not alone .
A piece of uncooked spaghetti rarely breaks in half , and usually breaks into three or more pieces instead , with several small pieces flying from the middle ( my record is seven ) .
Beyond puzzling the average person in the kitchen , the question of why and how this happens has kept ( at least two ) great scientific minds awake at night .
Fortunately for us , Doctors Basile Audoly and SÃ©bastien Neukirch , both physicists from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris , did a lot of work ( and wasted a lot of noodles ) to find an answer .
Their research was published as " Fragmentation of Rods by Cascading Cracks : Why Spaghetti Does Not Break in Half , " in Physical Review Letters ( Volume 95 , No. 9 , August 26 , 2005 ) , and won them the 2006 Ig Nobel Prize for Physics .
After breaking strand after strand of spaghetti ( they used Barilla , in case you were wondering ) , taking high - speed images of the process and applying the Kirchhoff equation ( which relates to how waves travel through an object that 's put under stress ) , they concluded that spaghetti fragmentation is caused by flexural waves traveling through the pasta after the initial break .
Once the spaghetti is bent to a critical point , it breaks .
This causes a flexural wave to travel down each of the resulting pieces before they have time to relax from the strain and straighten out .
The wave causes these pieces curve more , which leads to more breaks .
Audoly and Neukirch refer to this whole ordeal as a " cascading failure mechanism , "  which makes a night of snapping spaghetti sound pretty exciting .
Ed Rendell and Mayor Nutter are good guys and the Pennsylvania Machine held up .
Barack erased more than half the gap between himself and Hillary Clinton , but there he stopped .
Nutter and Rendell smiled happily as Hillary , a consummate actress , sought to make the low road look like what America wants and needs .
She happily filched script from Barack and , with rank impunity , melded it with a reiteration of her fear politics ad .
Get comfy with it .
It squares with the foggy hypocrisy which is the penumbra of our benumbed lives under the sign of Clinton - Bush .
In Indiana , benumbed by a worse defeat than had been anticipated , Barack gave a stolid speech and we learned that the vaunted John Mellencamp was preparing to do another rally in Indiana -- for Clinton .
Nothing seemed right about this , unless we were willing to close our eyes and concede that we do n't really mind .
The jaws of hell have opened and just now we too are benumbed , yet again , to do more than sit and wonder if there remains any point in trying , still to combat the the demons .
The fracture in our consciousness is real , just as real as the consonance between Clinton and McCain and the prospect that the Obama Miracle will sink into a cesspool of manufactured and relentlessly processed instances of guilt by association .
It has worked in the past .
Why not now ?
Ironically , we still have everything we had before this deed got done .
What we have lost is the result of the machine win in Pennsylvania , of the willing complicity of Nutter and Rendell and the 100 mayors to deliver the extra ten points Clinton needed to declare a decisive win .
We have lost our confidence in the new reality we were seeking to launch .
Do Nutter and Rendell believe that Hillary means it when she says she will obliterate Iran in a Strangeloveian flourish , no less ominous than the militarism of the soft - spoken specter of John McCain in thrall to the Neo - Cons ?
To them it is all rock and roll .
The disjuncture is complete .
She does n't mean any of the things she says if they do not comport with the happy workings of the Pennsy Machine .
Meanwhile Murdoch is buying Newsday and the New York Times , which endorsed Hillary at the behest of their management , editorializes that Hillary ran a campaign in PA that was worse than the " mean , vacuous , desperate , pandering contests that preceded it . "
The editorial weakly concludes that Hillary has to " call off the dogs " .
It 's one of those , Is the Pope Catholic ?
moments .
Hillary has a snarfy smile - sneer that speaks volumes about whether she will call off the dogs .
She can no more do that than she could be gracious about Barack 's religious faith on 60 Minutes .
Hillary occupies the pantheon reserved for Dick Nixon -- these are politicians we know will somehow injure us , but , Hey that 's OK , because the alternative would be --
c h a n g e
This is the choice that is still available today .
But with no illusions about the challenge we face .
What we need is a MEASURED RESPONSE .
One that speaks the truth about Hillary but cannot be construed as an attack , even by the mentally - challenged media chorus .

Matthews slams radio host defending Bush ' appeasement ' jab Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday May 15 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Radio talk host Kevin James got a brutal , on - the - spot history lesson from Hardball 's Chris Matthews after James was unable to back up , with historical fact , his support of President Bush in what could be construed as a jab at presidential hopeful Sen.
Barack Obama for his stance on diplomacy .
Bush , as part of a speech to members of Israel 's Knesset this morning , compared such a stance to the appeasement of Hitler .
" Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , " the President said .
" We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is - the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
James had no doubt that Bush was personally targeting Obama : " I do n't know who he was talking about for sure , Chris , but if he was n't talking about Barack Obama , he should have been talking about Barack Obama . "
Obama , as the candidate " endorsed by Hamas " and with " questionable Israel policies " should be the one speaking in Israel , but to make amends , James insisted .
Matthews asked : " Why is Israel now the center of the Republican campaign -- what is Israel about here in this presidential campaign ? "
He pressed on : " Why is Israel becoming the new podium for political activity ? "
" We 're talking about Israel , " James responded , " because it 's the 60th anniversary of their independence and it's where President Bush happened to be today , talking about the Knesset , when he launched this ... blurb against Obama .
" I 'm glad he did it , " James went on .
" I wish the White House had been a little more forthcoming in saying ' You 'd better believe this is against Obama , ' because his policies are dangerous for this country , and they 're dangerous for Israel as well . "
" Since they 've run out of arguments , " said Air America 's Mark Green , " they engage in analogies .
It was bad enough when John McCain used this sleazy guilt - by - association of Obama and Hamas .
Now comes President Bush using guilt - by - analogy -- that somehow Obama is Chamberlain , and anybody who the Bush people do n't like is Hitler . "
Matthews put James on the defensive when he refused to let his question go unanswered : " What did Neville Chamberlain do wrong in 1939 ? "
( This was later corrected to 1938 . )
" It all goes back to appeasement , " James said .
" You have to answer this question , " Matthews insisted , losing patience .
" What did he do ? " James was unable to explain .
" You 're making a reference to the days before our involvement in World War II when the war in Europe began , " Matthews explained , before continuing his demand for an answer : " I want you to tell me now , as an expert : What did Chamberlain do wrong ? "
James continued to dodge the question , simply calling Chamberlain an " appeaser . "
Matthews charged : " Your problem , Kevin , is -- you do n't know what you 're talking about .
And you do n't understand that there 's a difference between talking to the enemy and appeasing . "
" He 's as bad as the White House Press Secretary that does n't even know what the Cuban Missile Crisis was , " he said to Green .
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , in 1938 , appeased Adolf Hitler by helping cede part of then - named Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany with his signing of the Munich Agreement , called the Munich Dictate by Czechs and Slovaks due to the fact that Czechoslovakia was not involved in the decision - making process .
Chamberlain would also give up Ireland 's Royal Navy ports .
He was forced to resign after Hitler 's invasion of Belgium , France and the Netherlands .

No matter how you feel about globalization or free trade , something seems a bit off about importing people .
Maybe it 's the whole slavery thing or the West 's history of colonization .
Here are a few websites that might pique your interest , and in turn , rack your soul with guilt .

These ladies from Kiev , Ukraine are seeking eligible bachelors for meaningful relationships ( i.e. visa sponsorships ) .
Like many international bride sites , Kiev Connections allows you to either make contact through a translated letter and / or by sending gifts , including flowers , chocolates and teddy bears .
All of which will be burnt for heat during the winter .

From the FAQ :
" Are n't there any decent men in Ukraine ? "
" Unfortunately , it is very difficult for a Ukrainian man to provide for his family .
There are few well - paying jobs in the Ukraine .
How can the men here take pride in themselves if they can not provide for their family [ ? ]
The result [ :]
Ukrainian men bend to peer pressure and drink and drink . "
Of the many , many things that cause men of the Ukraine to drink -- things like , say , their wife leaving them for a pock - marked IT guy from Kansas City -- they go with " peer pressure . "
Apparently , this devastated nation is just a few Saved by the Bell - message - episodes away from getting back on the right track .

Chances of Finding Everlasting Love :
A perusal of the profiles reveals that many of these women do n't speak English and are attracted to qualities like " independence , " " self - sufficiency " and " financial loaded - ness . "
If you 're rich and do n't mind spending months to years in an uncomfortable silence , and are not totally devastated by the stiflingly depressing idea of buying a poor man 's wife away from him , by all means give it a go .
The Minister for Defence , Joel Fitzgibbon , said the military was overstretched with its commitments in East Timor , Afghanistan and Iraq .
" Roughly half of our infantry and cavalry is somehow tied to those deployments , " he said .
" This is an unsustainable position . "
The Iraqis had not asked the Australian troops for help in 20 months , he said , and they were needed elsewhere .
The Howard government had cited several reasons for the war , including preventing more terrorist attacks , stopping Iraq giving weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) to terrorists , preventing other rogue states giving WMD to terrorists , and ending the crisis in Iraq .
" On every count , we on this side of the house rejected these arguments then as we continue to reject them now , " Mr Rudd said .
" Have further terrorist attacks been prevented ?
No they have not been .
Has any evidence of a link between WMD and the former Iraqi regime and terrorists been found ?
No .
" Have the actions of rogue states like Iran been moderated ?
No .
After five years , has the humanitarian crisis in Iraq been removed ?
No it has not . "
Mr Rudd 's attack riled the former foreign affairs minister , Alexander Downer .
" Ca n't you rise above this ? "
Mr Downer interjected from the back bench .
" You 're supposed to be the Prime Minister of Australia , not the Labor spokesman . "
Brendan Nelson , the Opposition Leader and the last defence minister in the Howard government , maintained that al - Qaeda 's attacks on the US on September 11 , 2001 , justified invading Iraq .
The world could not afford the risk that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , he said , and Iraq today was safer as a result .
He reminded the House that Mr Rudd , as opposition foreign affairs spokesman , said in 2002 there was " a significant threat of weapon of mass destruction from Iraq " .
Dr Nelson admitted errors had been made .
In hindsight , the Iraqi army should not have been dismantled and the civil service should not have been purged of all members of the pro-Saddam Baath Party .
Provision of basic services by Western contractors was also a mistake , he said .
Dr Nelson accepted that the role of the combat troops in Iraq was over but said Mr Rudd should have replaced them with trainers to help the Iraqi forces .
Mr Rudd said the Government would soon release a national security statement so war could not be waged in such a manner again .
" Our Government is committed to ensuring that our national security arrangements are focused , co-ordinated and effective , and that the actions of government are accountable , " he said .

The title sold a record 609,000 copies on its first day of release , generating an estimated £ 24.4 m ( $ 48.5 m ) .
The previous record holder was GTA : San Andreas , which sold 501,000 copies in 24 hours in October 2004 .
But despite its success the game has been hit by reports of software problems and crashes on some consoles .
" The cut scene at the office is freezing up ..
I get audio , but the video just freezes , " wrote one gamer on Sony 's PlayStation 3 forum .
The problem was originally thought to be confined to games running on the 60 GB version of the PlayStation 3 sold in the US .
However , other models running the game also seem to be affected .
In addition , gamers that have bought the version for the Xbox 360 have also reported problems .
" Is anyone else experiencing major freezing issues ?
I cant play the game for more than 10 mins without it freezing , " wrote one on the Xbox forums .
Record - breaker Rockstar , the makers of the GTA series , has acknowledged the problem and is reportedly working on a fix .
The developer experienced similar problems in March when it launched another title , Bully , on the Xbox 360 .
Rockstar eventually released a software patch to fix the problem .
The latest bout of crashes could cast a shadow over the record - breaking GTA IV title .
However , despite the problems , reviews have been almost been unanimous in their praise .
The game currently has an average review score of 98.7 % , according to Gamerankings.com , which amalgamates reviews from all publications .
UK - based games website Eurogamer called it " game of the year " and handed it a 10 out of 10 review score .
The title cost approximately $ 100 m to make but could quickly recoup the costs .
According to Chart Track it not only recorded the highest sales for any game in its first 24 hours , it also set new records for first day sales for any game on both the PS3 and the Xbox .
The title smashed the PS3 record by nearly 200,000 copies .
Previous record holder Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue sold just 80,000 copies .
However , it was a closer run race on the Xbox 360 .
Microsoft 's Halo 3 had previously notched up first day figures of 266,000 compared to GTA 's recorded 335,000 .
Rockstar will find out on Tuesday whether the title will also clinch records for first week sales .

The model updates the state of a node ( individual ) depending on the fraction of the states of its neighbors .
In this case , that fraction ( “ laggard parameter ” ) is 80 % .
In ( a ) , the central node keeps its original state .
In ( b ) , the central node is updated since 80 % of its neighbors are in the opposite state .

In large part , a society ’s image stems from its overall opinions – its political , religious , and ethical beliefs – and how much diversity it tolerates .
For example , how do some areas develop images of being either liberal or conservative , and , in others , liberals and conservatives live side by side ?
As a team of researchers explains , our individual opinions both influence and are influenced by our surroundings .
By following a set of rules , the researchers have modeled the opinion formation process in societies where individuals ’ opinions are strongly influenced by others they interact with .
The scientists found that , depending on two criteria – how strongly individuals are influenced by each other and how many connections individuals have – a society ’s overall state can exhibit either large segregated patches of consensus , or areas with closely intermingled opinions .
Peter Klimek from the Medical University of Vienna , Renaud Lambiotte from the University of Liege and the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium , and Stefan Thurner of the Medical University of Vienna and the Santa Fe Institute in the US have published their study in a recent issue of Europhysics Letters .
In their model , individuals are represented as nodes in a network .
The nodes are binary , and they display an individual ’s opinion on some subject , such as yes / no , liberal / conservative , Clinton / Obama , or any other choice .
Then , the society ’s overall stance on a subject can be determined for the future by evolving the system .
First , an algorithm checks the state of all nodes connected to the node in question .
If the fraction of the state of neighboring nodes exceeds a certain threshold ( which the researchers call the “ laggard parameter ” and must be above 50 % ) , then the central node adopts that state .
If not , the node remains in its original state .
This process is iterated several times , until it can no longer be updated , and the society freezes .
“ The original opinions of the individuals are ' a priori ' inclinations toward some subject , ” Thurner told PhysOrg.com .
“ To stay within the Clinton / Obama example , although most of my peers may be democrats , some of them may consider political experience to be more important , while others think that a fresh start is needed .
Given such individual initial dispositions , our work shows under which circumstances individuals will stick to them or change their mind . ”
Depending on the laggard parameter and the system ’s average connectivity , the model produces societies with different features .
For example , as the laggard parameter increases ( when individuals require a greater fraction of neighbors holding the opposite opinion in order to change their opinions ) , the regions of consensus shrink , and the society ’s diverse views intermingle .
In other words , individuals stubbornly hold on to their opinions , even if many of their neighbors have the opposite view .
But the more that people are influenced by others , the less likely it is that the society will ever reach such an intermixed state .
Secondly , changing the connectivity parameter affects how quickly the system transitions from the segregated state to the intermixed state .
For the same laggard parameter , a system with higher connectivity ( 10 or more connections in the model ) creates a sharper transition from a segregated society to a mixed society .
Systems with lower connectivity take longer to intermingle , and may never completely mix , as the system could stop evolving after fewer iterations .
Because social ties fluctuate , the researchers also modified their model by randomly rewiring the connections after the system reached its final update .
This rewiring represents how individuals lose and make new friends and acquaintances , resulting in a more realistic model .
Overall , the researchers explain that a society ’s public opinion can form one of two scenarios : segregated or coexistence of differences .
But , as the team explains , even segregated societies can be versatile , with clusters of different groups – just as long as they are n’t forced to interact too much .
“ Our model predicts that the formation of consensus depends on how actively an issue is under debate , especially if the original sets of opinions are balanced , i.e. there is roughly the same amount of people sharing each of the two opinions , ” Thurner explained .
“ This is , of course , the most interesting case .
In societies where debate is encouraged , a group of people is more likely to find consensus on a topic than , say , in a society where active discussions are not appreciated , suppressed or even forbidden . ”
As the researchers explain , the model could be used as a tool to make statistical predictions in real - life scenarios .
“ In principle , all our model parameters can be determined in real life , ” Thurner said .
“ Presently , large efforts are made by dozens of groups to map social networks .
The outcome of these efforts can be straight forwardly taken as an input to our model .
The nature of social influence that individuals exert on each other ( in the model this is the laggard parameter ) , can be assessed through polls , behavioral surveys , etc .
“ However , predictions of our model are of statistical nature , and results predict most likely outcomes , ” he added .
“ Predicting the outcome of a specific election can be compared to playing poker .
Just from knowing that I hold an above average hand there is no guarantee that I will actually win this round . ”

Online fraudsters who are n't highly skilled in the arts of cybercrime can now rent a service that offers an all - in - one hosting server with a built - in Zeus trojan administration panel and infecting tools , allowing them to create their own botnet .
EMC 's security division , the RSA Anti-Fraud Command Centre ( AFCC ) , cited an increase in the use of the Zeus trojan in attacks against financial institutions in its April online fraud report , claiming the trojan is " extremely user friendly and easy to operate . "
" Fraudsters who execute Zeus attacks simply need to take control of a compromised server or have their own back - end servers ; once they have a server in place , they merely need to install the Zeus administration panel , create a user name and password , and start launching their attacks , " the report stated .
But the AFCC recently traced a new service that does all of the above for would - be botnet barons .
The service offers access to a " bullet - proof hosting server with a built - in Zeus trojan administration panel and infection tools ... the service includes all of the required stages in a single package , meaning that all the fraudster now has to do is pay for the service , access the newly - hired Zeus trojan server , create infection points and start collecting data . "
RSA 's banking and finance specialist , Geoff Noble , said that those offering the Zeus package are mirroring what legitimate security vendors are offering -- security - as - a - service -- but in their case they are slinging malware - as - a - service .
" Phase one of online threats was stealing credit card numbers , buying stuff on the internet and selling it somewhere else to make a profit .
Phase two is this grabbing of user names and passwords online , phase two ' b ' is productizing that solution , and phase 2 'c ' is offering that solution as a service , " Noble said .
" What Zeus means is that you are buying a service with traditional software support and maintenance , so you can go about your business without updating and patching . "
RSA said that the exploit package allows fraudsters to easily infect users and grow a botnet of compromised machines , and boasts an easy to use Web hosting control panel that can be used by virtually anyone .
" The bottom line is that with such services , creating the infrastructure for Zeus attacks and actually implementing these attacks is now easier than ever before , " the report said .
" It makes it markedly easier because you do n't need to bring together the three components .
The challenge still remains -- how to get the cash out -- and that will likely be the constriction point getting in the [ fraudsters ] way ; it will be a lot easier to do on the attack front but the cash still needs to come out of the channel , " Noble said .
Victims receiving e-mails at home or work offering amazing deals to become the local financial outpost for a multinational company is just one of the ways the fraudsters are getting the cash out .
" People still get sucked into that , and that 's one of the variants of getting the cash out .
The fact that it 's too good to be true does n't always sink into everyone and people still become mules .
And we 're seeing a lot more specific approaches to people to become mules in tandem with the ease of use for non -tech spooks and fraudsters , " he said .
The Zeus trojan is designed to perform advanced key logging when infected users access specific Web pages .
The information it collects is encrypted when it is sent to the collection point , and can be communicated over SSL encryption .
The monthly AFCC report found that US banks continued to be the dominant target of cyber criminals with 62 percent of attacks , followed by the UK with 11 percent .
Australia and New Zealand made it into the list for the second month running as phishing in the Asia - Pacific region continues to grow .
The US also topped AFCC's April list of top hosting countries , with 51 percent of phishing attacks originating from there -- a 12 percent decrease from the previous month .
China came in second position with 19 percent of attacks , while Australia was responsible for 2 percent of threats .

Country Singer Gretchen Wilson Class of 08 Graduate
Country western singercan add high school graduate to her list of accomplishment .
The 34 year old musician studied for and passed her General Educational Development exam recently , which earns her a high school diploma .
Wilson sold 4.5 million copies of her hot single Redneck Woman and picked up a Grammy too but she was troubled by the fact that she dropped out of school when she was in ninth grade .
She became a cook and bartender in rural Illinois and sang in a couple of bar bands before moving to Nashville in 1996 .
Her breakthrough came in 2003 with Here for the Party .
The singer made it a priority to prove to her seven year old daughter Grace that education is essential in order to be truly successful .
She walked the talk and will don cap and gown and take part in a graduation ceremony on May 15th .
Well done Gretchen !

The day may be getting a little closer when robots will perform surgery on patients in dangerous situations or in remote locations , such as on the battlefield or in space , with minimal human guidance .
Engineers at Duke University believe that the results of feasibility studies conducted in their laboratory represent the first concrete steps toward achieving this space age vision of the future .
Also , on a more immediate level , the technology developed by the engineers could make certain contemporary medical procedures safer for patients , they said .
For their experiments , the engineers started with a rudimentary tabletop robot whose " eyes " used a novel 3 - D ultrasound technology developed in the Duke laboratories .
An artificial intelligence program served as the robot's " brain " by taking real - time 3 - D information , processing it , and giving the robot specific commands to perform .
" In a number of tasks , the computer was able to direct the robot 's actions , " said Stephen Smith , director of the Duke University Ultrasound Transducer Group and senior member of the research team .
" We believe that this is the first proof - of - concept for this approach .
Given that we achieved these early results with a rudimentary robot and a basic artificial intelligence program , the technology will advance to the point where robots -- without the guidance of the doctor -- can someday operate on people . "
The results of a series of experiments on the robot system directing catheters inside synthetic blood vessels was published online in the journal IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics , Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control .
A second study , published in April in the journal Ultrasonic Imaging , demonstrated that the autonomous robot system could successfully perform a simulated needle biopsy .
Advances in ultrasound technology have made these latest experiments possible , the researchers said , by generating detailed , 3 - D moving images in real - time .

The Duke laboratory has a long track record of modifying traditional 2 - D ultrasound -- like that used to image babies in utero -- into the more advanced 3 - D scans .
After inventing the technique in 1991 , the team also has shown its utility in developing specialized catheters and endoscopes for real - time imaging of blood vessels in the heart and brain .
In the latest experiment , the robot successfully performed its main task : directing a needle on the end of the robotic arm to touch the tip of another needle within a blood vessel graft .
The robot 's needle was guided by a tiny 3 - D ultrasound transducer , the " wand " that collects the 3 - D images , attached to a catheter commonly used in angioplasty procedures .
" The robot was able to accurately direct needle probes to target needles based on the information sent by the catheter transducer , " said John Whitman , a senior engineering student in Smith 's laboratory and first author on both papers .
" The ability of the robot to guide a probe within a vascular graft is a first step toward further testing the system in animal models . "
While the research will continue to refine the ability of robots to perform independent procedures , the new technology could also have more direct and immediate applications .
" Currently , cardiologists doing catheter - based procedures use fluoroscopy , which employs radiation , to guide their actions , " Smith said .
" Putting a 3 - D ultrasound transducer on the end of the catheter could provide clearer images to the physician and greatly reduce the need for patients to be exposed to radiation . "
In the earlier experiments , the tabletop robot arm successfully touched a needle on the arm to another needle in a water bath .
Then it performed a simulated biopsy of a cyst , fashioned out of a liquid - filled balloon in a medium designed to simulate tissue .
" These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous robots accomplishing simulated tasks under the guidance of 3 - D ultrasound , and we believe that it warrants additional study , " Whitman said .
The researchers said that adding this 3 - D capability to more powerful and sophisticated surgical robots already in use at many hospitals could hasten the development of autonomous robots that could perform complex procedures on humans .
The research in Smith 's lab is supported by the National Institutes of Health .
Other Duke members of the team were Matthew Fronheiser and Nikolas Ivancevich .
Liberal anger was palatable .
And revenge is oh so sweet – if not short lived and short sighted .
Hillary Clinton has said that “ if she knew then what she knew now she would n't have voted for the Iraq War Resolution ” .
Liberal translation --
She obviously was for the war from the get go .
Her judgment is suspect says Obama .
The fact that she has n't stood up and said she was wrong and apologized damns her in the eyes of the liberal wing of the party .
Clinton has tried to explain to the liberals that in times of crisis Presidents must be given power to make threats and , as a last resort , make those threats reality .
At the time of the Iraq War Vote , Congress and America did n't know that George Bush and Dick Cheney had begun drawing up Iraq
War strategy within in days of taking office .
We did n't know then that the Bush Administration was so intent on going to war that they 'd manipulate intelligence and sell America and the world , for that matter , a pile of horse manure .
At that time we did n't know that George Junior would actually go it alone and start a unilateral war of choice .
Surely .
Surely !
He was n't that stupid .
Surprise .
Does anybody honestly believe that if Hillary Clinton had been in the Whitehouse instead of George W. Bush that she would have taken this country to war ?
Is she really personally responsible for George W. Bush 's Iraq War ?
Liberal Democrats say yes .
And thus they denounce her at every opportunity .
And thus they support Barack Obama and trash Hillary Clinton .
Liberal Democrats are right about one thing -- Obama probably would n't have voted for the war .
After all he is the most liberal Senator in the Senate .
He did n't beat out Bernie Sanders ; the Senate 's first and only socialist , for that mantel by being moderate .
Would he have been right though in voting against the war if Bush had n't been a liar , full of hubris , and dumber than a rock ?
A vote against the war could have been just as disastrous as the Iraq War has turned out to be had the claims of mushroom clouds been true .
They were n't true and now liberals , with 20 - 20 hindsight , are extracting their revenge on the one person they can reach – Hillary Clinton .
In so doing the pendulum is swinging wildly to the left – from one extreme to another .
The problem is that fixing the mess that George Bush and the Republicans have created by their incompetence and their adherence to right wing ideological dogma wo n't come from jerking the wheel to the left as hard as possible .
The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is focused on doing just that .
They are in no mood to compromise .
It 's their way or the highway .
And … in the case of selecting the Democratic Party Presidential nominate , they apparently are unable to remember one of the biggest history lessons in the annuals of the Democratic Party – “ McGovernasque ” candidates can't win the general .
And so … the greatest opportunity in recent political history is being flushed down the toilet .
It is being sacrificed on the altar of liberal revenge .
There is still a chance to grab the wheel .
There are 10 more primaries left for moderates to drag the Democratic Party back towards the center before it self - destructs .
The real question though is can liberals be stopped from extracting their pound and a half of flesh for the good of the Party ?
A moderate will win in the fall .
The only question is whether it will be Hillary Clinton or John McCain .
If Liberal Democrats insist on nominating Obama then the answer is a no-brainer .

Last week we told you about the hard fought victory by the Pima County ( Tucson ) , Arizona , Democrats to finally gain access to the Diebold databases which include the tallies of how folks voted in elections going all the way back to 1998 .
The county had argued ( on Diebold 's behalf , natch ) that the database files were both proprietary , and a security risk should they be released .
The judge , finally , found that to be nonsense , and ordered the release of the files which the local Election Integrity advocates now hope to comb over for evidence of fraud and / or other malfeasance .
Now that they 've got all the info , they 're seeking a geek or two who may be able to help build a tool to make it a bit easier to go through the mountains of data they now finally have access to .
AZ 's Libertarian Election Integrity champ Jim March , whose been working closely with the Dems , sends us the following " Help Wanted " ad , seeking a programmer to help 'em make sense of " the world 's largest private collection of Diebold election data files anywhere . "
( Note : If someone could kindly Slashdot this item to maximize the number of coder geek eyeballs it gets in front of , it'd be much appreciated ! ) ...
The Pima Dems now have the world 's largest private collection of Diebold election data files anywhere - going back to 1998 .
The volume of data for each election is so enormous that only automated " sanity check " tools can have any hope of wading through this pile , plus the data ordered for future elections - never mind that the same data should be available elsewhere .
To help process this unruly mess , Pima Dems consultant Jim March ( footnote : who is actually a Libertarian but they forgive him ) has designed the " feature specs " for a test tool .
Now they need somebody to code it .
The spec sheet for the tool may be downloaded here [ PDF ] .
The " mark one " version can be very basic , command line driven and workable only with Diebold databases for now .
HELP WANTED : Computer programmer on this contract ( paid ) project with a donor already lined up .
Must be very competent in database programming in general , the Microsoft JET database engine in particular .
The project can be coordinated by EMail .
Note that the tool will be " open source " - free for download by ANYBODY , both running program and source code so anybody can see how it works and modify it as needed if we get election data files from any other vendor for instance .
I * know * there 's geeks reading Bradblog , folks .
Speak up !
And email me here if you 're interested , or have any questions .

SAN DIEGO ( AP )  California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says that if an initiative to ban gay marriage qualifies for the November ballot , he 's prepared to fight it .
California 's governor spoke Friday in San Diego at the convention of the Log Cabin Republicans , the nation 's largest gay Republican group .
He has previously vetoed bills that would have legalized gay marriage .
A Schwarzenegger spokeswoman did not say what prompted the governor to shift his position .
Schwarzenegger said he was confident a ban would never pass in California and called the effort " a waste of time . "

To academics , one of the best [ inverse ] indicators of a person 's place in a hierarchy is his tendency toward " perspective taking " --" stepping outside of one 's own experience and imagining the emotions , perceptions , and motivations of another individual ... "
An assistant is perspective taking when he gets the boss 's coffee before he asks for it ; when the boss forgets to pay the assistant back the $ 3.75 , he is not .
The hypothesis of the Psychological Science study was that the more power a person has , the less capacity he has to take another person 's perspective .
we hypothesized that power would decrease perspective taking .
either an experience where they had power over someone ( high power group ) , or
an experience where someone else had power over them ( low power group )
We used a procedure created by Hass ( 1984 ) in which participants are asked to draw an E on their foreheads .
One way to complete the task is to draw an E as though one is reading it oneself , which leads to a backward and illegible E from the perspective of another person .
The other way to approach the task is to draw the E as though another person is reading it , which leads to production of an E that is backward to oneself .
We predicted that participants in the high - power condition , compared with those in the low - power condition , would be more likely to draw the E in the self - oriented direction , indicating a lesser tendency to spontaneously adopt another person 's perspective .
( Or : B = - 1.51 , SE = 0.76 , prep = .88 . )
... recent views that power can lead to objectification , the tendency to view other people only in terms of qualities that serve one 's personal goals and interests , while failing to consider those features of others that define their humanity ... [ making ] it easier for a power holder to use them as tools in the service of his or her goals ...
the high - power individual 's self - concept remains more rigid ; individuals with more power in their marriages resist the identities imposed on them by their less powerful spouses , and when relationship partners become more emotionally similar , it is the lower - power partner who has done the majority of the adapting ...
The powerful , on the one hand , are less accurate than the powerless in estimating the interests and positions of other people and are more likely to make self - serving attributions .
People with more power form less complex interpersonal impressions than people without power , basing their impressions of others on expectancies and stereotypes .
Power is often defined as the capacity to influence other people ; it emerges from control over valuable resources and the ability to administer rewards and punishments .
He apparently was not demonstrating the " carryover effect , " by which a person who has been stripped of influence continues to behave as if he were still in power .
It seemed odd that , in a room full of powerful people , no one was acting the way powerful people are supposed to .
[ One of the authors of the PS paper ] attributed the anomalously unpowerful results of the Time 100 trial to the use of blue Post -its [ stuck to their foreheads , on which they drew the E ] .
" Blue creates a negative set of emotions , and when people are experiencing these emotions they think more deliberately , " he said .
" If you had used red , it would have gotten at their more spontaneous inclinations . "
I 've been a subscriber for almost thirty years , and I 'm always hopeful it wo n't again contain another Updike story or Hendrick Hertzberg screed , but inevitably disappointed am I .
I guess it 's hard to find different writers for a magazine that purports to be for the literate when it is really a middlebrow primer for an unsophisticated political bias .
If that bias catered to the liberal or leftward leaning affluent it would be at least worth the price of subscription , but it promotes a more general bias : power is bad .
Anything the powerful does is wrong .
To illustrate this , consider the latest issue containing an article , " Power Hour . "
It describes an impromptu experiment on the world 's powerful ( i.e. Paul Wolfowitz ) that unfortunately failed to show the intended result , namely , that he 's a jerk .
The fact that the experiment failed did n't stopfrom trying to portray Wolfowitz as a jerk anyway , even though his performance theoretically showed that he was not a jerk , by the outcome measure of the study .
They even commissioned a caricature of Wolfowitz to accompany the article , because , well , he 's a jerk , of course .
No matter what science says .
My own unscientific study suggestsreadership is especially those who believe that the little guy always gets trampled on by the powerful , but that they , the readers , are neither little nor powerful , they 're in the middle .
They are a select group that lacks power , but possesses wisdom .
They understand what 'sgoing on .
Coincidentally , this describes another overlapping group : academics .II .
This coincidence makes the second sentence of the article " Power Hour " so perfect :
The distinction may seem like the main point , but there 's a subtext : the boss is a jerk in both examples .
I 'm willing to bet real money that if you had to guess who reads , it would be the assistant .
III .
All of this is besides the point .
The point is how an amateur researcher redid an experiment published in 2006 in Psychological Science about the effects of being powerful , this time using attendees at Time 's 100 Most Influential People banquet .
I 'll describe the experiment in detail , but let me preface this with the observation that it seems not to have occurred to the researcher , nor anyone at , that " Most Influential " might be a different group than " Most Powerful .
"
Here 's the experiment : take powerful and not powerful people , and have them draw an E on their foreheads .
Powerful people , as it suggests above , have no interest in " perspective taking " and so will write it facing themselves , because they are self - oriented ; not - powerful people will write it facing out ( legible to observers ) because they will be better able to assume another 's perspective .
If this sounds like crap to you , you 're right .
But it gets worse .
writes : Which is exactly not what the hypothesis of the article inwas .
The actual hypothesis was : That gerund is extremely important .
The actual hypothesis does n't claim less , or less -- simply that itless .
It could happen out of lack of capacity , but also maybe because of lack of time , need to distance oneself from the cacophony of a myriad of individual perspectives , a blaring iPod , solar flares , alcoholism , etc .
How a powerful person writes an E tells you absolutely nothing about why he did it that way , if indeed it is even true that there is an association between being powerful and drawing an E .
Butwants it , wants it very badly , to be about a defect in ability .
In fairness to , the authors of the study themselves make this same mistake .
IV.
Start from the middle -- study design .
The subjects were not actually powerful : they were college students , age about 20 .
They werefor power by being asked to write an essay about
You can see that simply the ability to recollect such an experience is a huge confounding variable .
Imagine an actually powerful person trying to recall being powerless -- is this person now primed for powerlessness , or -- rage ?
Which is entirely different than the priming a powerless person asked to recollect being powerless might experience ( e.g. shame . )
It seems to me that a better priming method -- if you 're going to do it at all -- would simply be to have them pretend to be powerful or not ; a king , or a slave .
It 's also worth noting that 70 % of the college student subjects were women .
Discuss .
V. Next comes the drawing of the E .
You should probably sit down for this : Jean - Luc Picard on the left would be , therefore , in the high power condition , and Hendrick Hertzberg on the right would be low power .
Which is fine , except : why does the direction of an E have anything to do with being self - oriented ?
You 'll observe Picard is left handed , and Hertzberg is right handed .
Think about that .
Are there other reasons to think this E reflects self orientation and not , for example , the ability to write backwards ( " power - primed are more dexterous ? "
" Power primed people draw horizontal lines from left to right ? " ) or any of a billion other possibilities ?
In other words , just because the group is " high power , " does n't mean it has anything at all to do with power .
So while the results of the study were that the " high power group " was three times more likely to draw the E backwards , is there any conceivable way we can infer that actually powerful people do it , or that this has to do with power at all , or self - orientation ?
cleverly adds a distraction :
Unexplained , just sitting there , as if to say , " oh , look , we do n't understand all that nerdy stuff , just accept that science says it 's true .
" But is there any validity to it at all ?
No. and not just because it 's ludicrous .
The authors cite Hass as the originator of the method , and as evidence for the validity of the method .
Hass believed that people who were self - focused looked at themselves by occupying an external perspective , looking back .
Read that again .
In other words , a legible to the external observer E meant you wereself focused , not less .
It does n't measure the ability to adopt someone else 's perspective : it measures your ability to seeSo let 's review :
Hass has a theory that is entirely untestable , it is then used backwards into draw conclusions about something different , and then applied wrongly forAwesome .
Science is relative anyway , and the real point is Wolfowitz is still a jerk , right ?
VI . But let 's look not at the protocol , not even at the premises , but at theof the words .
Since the power level is hardly quantifiable , could the study be about something else -- that would make more sense of the results ?
I do n't know about power ; but it is definitionally narcissism .
Replace the word " power " with narcissist and it becomes clear :
The problem is the conflation of power with narcissism .
Not all -- not even the majority -- of narcissists are powerful .
And not all powerful people are narcissists .
You might think I 'm splitting hairs , but the authors themselves define power differently than they actually use it :
Oh well .
VII .
It should be obvious that Hass 's version is just as empty and meaningless as theversion .
Hass 's study is an experiment testing a hypothesis based on articles of faith , a slightly distorted version of the famous logical fallacy : witches floatLisa is a witchtherefore , Lisa should float .
Never mind that Lisa is really Arthur and he knows how to swim .
The authors of the Psychological Science study believe it , so let 's grant them their premises are indeed facts .
But they then go on to devise an experiment that actually tests the opposite of the ( preposterous ) hypothesis .
Published science this bad rarely happens by accident , it requires planning and execution and is thus inevitably associated with having an agenda .
A quick look at the authors ' bios reveals the agenda : power corrupts absolutely , and absolute power is worse .
VIII .
But back to Wolfowitz .
Let 's predict the outcome .
He 's probably self - focused ?
So according to Hass , he should draw the E legible to observers .
But according to , powerful Wolfowitz should write the E backwards to outside observers , because he does n't take other 's perspectives .
( Either way , it proves he 's a jerk . )
Before I tell you what he did , I 'll give youexplanation of the results , which includes the words " bar , " " alone , " " deposed , " " shaky , " and " hesitant " -- all in the same sentence ; followed by a completely made up explanation that allows you to be right even when you 're wrong : Thank God for science .
The pretense ofis that they , by virtue of not being powerful , must be smarter than Wolfowitz , who isan idiot .
Well , is it possible that Wolfowitz sees a set up ?
Maybe he 's more clever than you credit him ?
Wolfowitz drew his EIX .
Oh , I do n't know , given that there are so many things wrong with that sentence alone , it 's not so odd .
Got that ?
But Wolfowitz is still a jerk , right ?
1. President Bush has not abused his powers as president .
2. President Bush has abused his powers as president , but the abuses are not serious enough to warrant impeachment under the Constitution .
3. President Bush has abused his powers as president which rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the Constitution , but he should not be impeached .
4. President Bush has abused his powers as president which rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the Constitution and he should be impeached and removed from office .
A Brooklyn man was convicted of criminal copyright infringement Thursday for his role as part of the " Apocalypse Production Crew " – a piracy group that specialized in releasing yet - to - be- published music , movies , software and video games to downloaders .
Barry Gitarts , 25 , is the first accused internet music pirate to take his case to a criminal jury , according to the RIAA .
He was convicted by an Alexandria , Virginia jury following a trial that lasted less than three days .
" Music piracy is stealing and , unless you want to end up in a federal prison , do n't do it , " said U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg in a statement trumpeting the verdict .
The case was part of the Justice Department 's " Operation Fastlink " – an international effort that 's seen more that 200 search warrants executed in 15 countries .
Not withstanding the tough talk , the operation did not target casual downloaders .
Gitarts was convicted of conspiracy to violate the NET Act ( .pdf ) , which makes it a crime to infringe a copyright " for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain " ; to pirate $ 1,000 or more in music within 180 day period ; or to distribute any pirated content before its release date .
Under that law , Gitarts faces a maximum of five years in prison when he 's sentenced August 8th .
But Mark Shumaker , a co-conspirator who pleaded guilty to the same crime in 2003 , was sentenced to two years probation and a $ 100 fine .
" The crimes committed here – as well as the harm to the music community – are severe , " said Brad Buckles , an executive vice president at the RIAA , in a statement .
" And so are the consequences . "
I feel sorry for those folks who cannot decide which presidential candidate to vote for when the time comes to pull that lever , poke that chad or touch that screen .
Thanks to the infinite wisdom of USAToday â€ ” which has done my thinking for me â€ ” I now know which candidate righteously deserves my vote .
USAToday ‘s
Web site now sports the “ Candidate match game . ”
All you have to do is answer 11 multiple - choice questions â€ ” three on the Iraq war , two on immigration , two on health care , one on same - sex marriage and one each on tax reform , global warming and candidate experience .
And presto : Your presidential choice is revealed .
I ’m all set now .
Drum roll , please .
Wait for it , wait for it … I shall vote for …
… Dennis Kucinich ?
Eek !
Frankly , I ’m as shocked as you .
According to the game ’s results , my back - up choices are Bill Richardson followed by John Edwards .
But , because people tend to weight issues differently , USAToday has provided a “ slider ” bar that allows you to weight or unweight your answers .
If I unweight the same - sex marriage and experience questions , Rep. Kucinich remains my choice but Gov. Richardson drops out , replaced by Sen. Obama
But it ’s a survey .
Each question has limited responses .
You select the one that best suits your thinking â€ ” even if it ’s not quite on the mark .
And there may be issues that USAToday does not ask in this game that may been of keen interest to you â€ ” the size of the federal deficit , the practice of hiding earmarks , increasing ( or decreasing ) federal spending , unfunded mandates on the states , the sorry state of the federal government ’s willingness or ability to regulate enormously large industries , anti-terrorism measures in ports and harbors , inspection of food and food ingredient imports ( especially from China ) , federal and state support for measures that will fundamentally change how this country educates its children … it ’s a lengthy list .
USAToday only asked questions about those issues that the candidates wish to use to frame this election .
There ’s a world of questions I ’d like to ask the candidates that they probably do n’t want to answer .
Those are the questions USAToday ( and The Washington Post and The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times and network news and CNN and every newspaper and local TV news station in a primary or caucus state ) ought to be asking .
But they ’re not .
It ’s sad that USAToday devoted resources to a game instead of the rigorous reporting the electorate needs to deflect the messaging strategies of these candidates ’ high - priced consultants .
Meanwhile , I ’m sending a check to Rep. Kucinich !
There was this lady Hillybilly
Told Obama you look silly ,
With your policies so dumb ,
Just like your black bum ,
And your small black willy .
All Obama could do was have a big laugh and say “ How silly can you get Hilly ? ”

Bacteriophages : The Most Common Life - Like Form on Earth
Credit : Wikipedia ; Insert : Mike Jones
Explanation :
There are more bacteriophages on Earth than any other life - like form .
These small viruses are not clearly a form of life , since when not attached to bacteria they are completely dormant .
Bacteriophages attack and eat bacteria and have likely been doing so for over 3 billion years ago .
Although initially discovered early last century , the tremendous abundance of phages was realized more recently when it was found that a single drop of common seawater typically contains millions of them .
Extrapolating , phages are likely to be at least a billion billion ( sic ) times more numerous than humans .
Pictured above is an electron micrograph of over a dozen bacteriophages attached to a single bacterium .
Phages are very small -- it would take about a million of them laid end - to - end to span even one millimeter .
The ability to kill bacteria makes phages a potential ally against bacteria that cause human disease , although bacteriophages are not yet well enough understood to be in wide spread medical use .
The World from Berlin Germany 's New Right to Online Privacy
A ruling against government surveillance of personal computers , delivered this week by a German court , has set a precedent : Computer users have the right to trust their IT equipment .
What sounds wonkish could affect many aspects of life in the 21st century .
I 'm mad about spending my life looking for a parking space in the city , mad about paying breathtaking sums of money to parking garages , mad about my fellow Americans who dent my car on free - parking lots and drive away without leaving their insurance agent 's name .
I 'm mad about having to spend more for auto insurance per year than I spend for gasoline .
And how do I feel about knowing that every time I take the car out onto the highway I may be shot because a sniper wants to enjoy a bit of sport with his new gun , or because a testy , armed fellow motorist resents my being in his lane or despises me because my car radio is playing music not to his taste ?
How do I feel about that ?
Mad .
That 's how I feel .
I 'm even madder about being unable , unless you live in one of a few big cities , to travel anywhere anymore without having to drive from 30 to 3,000 miles , all the time burning that increasingly expensive gasoline and inviting snipers and cruising gunmen to shoot you , thus exposing you to hospital or mortuary bills compared with which the price of gasoline is nothing .
I 'm mad , too , about people who can't drive being rendered immobile by the national drive - or - else policy .
I 'm mad about having to do all the wretched , dull , dreary , miserable driving myself when one of these hopelessly immobilized Americans is the only person accompanying me on a journey of 1,000 miles .
I 'm mad about feeling hatred for these immobilized passengers , who are , after all , my fellow human beings and sometimes beloved relatives and should not be detested simply because American culture enables such persons to slumber peaceably in passengers ' seats while saps loyal to the auto ethic do all the driving .
I 'm mad about the neighbors and their children laughing at me because my car cannot go from 0 to 80 miles an hour in five seconds , and I 'm mad about caring enough to be mad about it because it suggests I have fallen in with the loathsome American habit of judging people 's character by the car they drive .
Now two other guests at the same dinner , given by the actress Candice Bergen , at her home in Beverly Hills , say they heard much the same thing as Ms. Huffington .
Both of them , the former “ West Wing ” actors Bradley Whitford and Richard Schiff , were asked by Ms. Huffington to speak to The New York Times .
Mr. Whitford said he would be supporting the Democratic nominee and had donated to Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama ; Mr. Schiff is supporting Mr. Obama .

Chester Higgins Jr./ The New York Times
Mr. Whitford , who played Josh Lyman , the deputy White House chief of staff on the NBC series , said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he was sitting across from Mr. McCain and next to Ms. Huffington at the small dinner and that he was startled to hear the senator sharply criticize Mr. Bush .
The senator has long blamed the Bush campaign for smear tactics against his family in the 2000 South Carolina primary , but by the end of the campaign Mr. McCain was publicly supporting his rival .
“ McCain was just sort of going off on how much he disliked Bush and the horrible things that the Bush campaign had done to his family in South Carolina , and his exasperation with Bush about his ridiculous tax cuts and he really wanted to talk to him about it , but he said the guy does n’t have the concentration , and you talk for 10 minutes and then the guy wants to talk about baseball , ” Mr. Whitford said .
Another guest then asked Mr. McCain , Mr. Whitford recalled , whether he had voted for Mr. Bush .
“ And he put his finger in front of his mouth and mouthed , ‘ No way , ’ ” Mr. Whitford said .
Mr. Schiff , who played Toby Ziegler , the White House communications director on “ The West Wing , ” said he was listening to Mr. McCain from the other of the two tables in the room .
McCain does n’t know how to ‘ distance himself ’ from Bush
A couple of weeks ago , the Politico ’s Jonathan Martin reported that a key aspect of John McCain ’s general - election strategy is to “ drive a triangulated contrast among himself , the Democratic nominee and President Bush . ”
Reuters reports today that we ’re starting to get a sense of what this strategy looks like in practice .
Slowly but surely , Republican presidential candidate John McCain is putting some distance between himself and unpopular President George W. Bush .
This week it was the ill - timed “ Mission Accomplished ” banner that the White House hung behind Bush five years ago when Bush declared major combat operations over in Iraq .
“ I thought it was wrong at the time , ” McCain said in Cleveland on Thursday , proceeding to criticize Vice President Dick Cheney ’s various comments over the years that the Iraqi insurgency was in its “ last throes ” with “ a few dead - enders ” all that was left .
Last week , McCain surprised some in the White House by declaring Bush ’s leadership “ disgraceful ” during the crisis over the 2005 Katrina hurricane that walloped New Orleans .
“ Never again , ” McCain declared .
The motivation is pretty obvious ; Bush is , after all , “ the most unpopular president in modern American history . ”
And the Republican Party is clearly sensitive about the Bush - McCain connection , as evidenced by Karl Rove and Fox News pushing back against it .
But in the end , it ’s going to take more than half - hearted criticism of Katrina and “ Mission Accomplished ” if this strategy is going to have an effect .
The inescapable point that the McCain campaign either a ) does n’t understand ; or b ) does n’t know how to fix is that subtle criticism is ultimately meaningless .
One cannot realistically “ triangulate ” against an incumbent president while running on that president ’s identical policy agenda .
For the McCain gang , this is about style , not substance .
McCain aides also want to paint their guy as different from an unpopular administration that prefers secrecy to transparency and friendly crowds to unpredictable ones .
“ Sen. McCain believes every American should participate in the arena , and that includes people that do n’t agree with him , ” Schmidt says , taking care to note that such unscripted exchanges have waned “ in the last decade . ”
Additionally , McCain and his advisers want to pursue voters that look different than the bare majority coalition that Bush put together twice .
“ We ’re running a campaign that is not designed to get 50 - plus - 1 percent of the vote , ” says Schmidt .
In other words , the pitch is relatively straightforward : “ Vote for John McCain — He ’s George W. Bush without The Bubble . ”
But I get the sense this is a fundamental misread of public opinion .
Bush is n’t the most unpopular president since the dawn of modern polling because Americans are mad over invitation - only rallies and misguided war banners .
They ’re desperate for change because Bush ’s policy agenda has been an abject failure .
And here ’s the kicker : McCain is running on Bush ’s policy agenda anyway .
On Iraq , the economy , homeland security , taxes , the federal judiciary , veterans ’ benefits , and as we saw this week , healthcare , McCain is Bush , only older and with slightly better grammar .
McCain was recently asked to name the issues where he ’s different from Bush .
After hemming and hawing a bit , McCain could point to exactly one issue : “ [ W ] hat ‘s an area of disagreement ?
Climate change .
I believe that climate change is real .
I think we have to act . ”
Shortly thereafter , would n’t you know it , Bush said he believes climate change is real and we have to act — removing the one subject on which Bush and McCain allegedly disagreed .
Reuters reported that McCain is “ putting some distance ” between himself and Bush .
In every way that counts , that ’s just not the case .

Barack Obama recently took heat for his comments to fundraisers in San Francisco .
Those remarks , for some reason , were never interpreted with a bit more cynicism and much less conventional wisdom : why ca n’t we just speculate that Sen .
Obama was simply pandering to what a particular , rich , liberal constituency wanted to hear ( the rubes do n’t really believe that … religion and guns are simply symbolic painkillers to stop the sting of the economic Real ) ?
It was the same pandering process that all the candidates have done , and must do , in order to get elected ( see also : Senator Clinton and boilermakers ; Senator McCain and John Hagee ) .
Sen .
Obama ’s statements were construed as some sort of lazy ( to his opponents on the left … “ elitist ” to his detractors on the right ) allusion to Marx - cum - Gramsci base / superstructure theory masked in Thomas Frank jargon .
So the talking points became simple : Obama ’s an elitist and a Marxist … oh my !
So at the expense of betraying my “ Marxist ” sympathies ( and hopefully some of yours , too ! ) , I had a great time laughing at the news of Miley Cyrus ’ spread in Vanity Fair .
Annie Liebovitz ’s portrait hit Drudge and at 7 am Monday morning Hannah Montana went from “ tweenie - bopper ” to “ tworn - star . ”
And that ’s precisely the point where some of that basic , good , old - fashioned Marxist thinking about the “ commodity ” is helpful and can explain what the hell happened .
This dust - up points to the fact that Miley Cyrus ’ body is a commodity that is controlled by two different sets of interests and agendas : those of Disney and those of her family .
Disney has an interest in making sure Miley Cyrus ’ body remains “ Hannah Montana , ” franchise par excellence , for as long as possible .
I can only imagine the intense and numerous aneurisms felt throughout the Magic Kingdom when they saw this issue of Vanity Fair .
They ’re very aware that this sort of thing happens often in our paparazzi - and - tabloid information age : the slippery slope of slut .
Brittney and Lindsay went from bankable faces to disheveled snatch - shots .
And now another golden - goose franchise is approaching the point where the Disney execs must awkwardly peek into the abyss and see the advent of their leading lady ’s libido .
Based on recent trends , this ca n’t be good ( ahem : paging Jamie Lynn Spears ) .
They must now contemplate the uncomfortable : how do you reconcile this development with the inconvenient truth that the Hannah Montana demographic , statistically speaking , has yet to even have their first period ?
If you ’re Disney , you make sure that your lawyers and a battalion of PR reps quash this disaster , ASAP .
On the other hand , the Cyrus family has an interest in maintaining the 15 year - old ’s body as “ Hannah Montana ” in the near and intermediate future , but from there they obviously need to be more flexible and shrewd .
They must make sure that Ms. Cyrus can still work her moneymaker when this HM gig runs its course .
The “ Hannah Montana ” empire has to make the delicate transition to the “ Miley Cyrus ” career .
And ( pace Simpson , Lohan , Spears ) that task is a bitch .
Yet , since womanhood is inevitable , the Cyrus family handlers made the ( mis ) calculation that Miley should begin some sort of long - term transition via the lens of the esteemed Annie Liebovitz .
But if you ’re feeling bad for Miley at this point , you may be expending too much sentiment for her , and not enough for your own kid .
After all , the Mouse and Mr. Achy - Breaky - Heart would n’t be doing any of this if they were n’t trying to grab your cash .
Hanna Rosin , writing in Slate , made several points worthy of consideration while explaining her feeling of violation at the sight of Miley ’s bare back .
In particular , though , I want to pay special attention to her remarks on the fact that it is , indeed , a hard call to judge the effects of the content of franchises like High School Musical and Hannah Montana on the attitudes of a / her tween audience .
Specifically , her concern is :
Now there are shows we all consider clean : Hannah Montana and High School Musical , for example .
And by any watchdog ’s standards they are : no sex , no exposed flesh , no cursing .
This ensures that children as young as 6 or 7 ( such as my daughter ) will know all about them and love them .
She does n’t see anything bad .
She just listens to lots of teenagers sing and dance and go on and on about who ’s dating whom and who ’s in love and who broke up , etc .
They are innocent and knowing at the same time .
I ca n’t easily say to her :
Do n’t watch that , you do n’t want to be like that underage sexpot , do you ?
Because the actors look as cute and innocent as the Teletubbies .
But something about all this sanitized high school chatter leaves me uneasy .
Why does a 6 - year old need to know so much about dating and breaking up ?
Now I recognize that I may be a tad too reactionary and live with a post - Culture Wars hangover , but Hanna ’s suspicion seems correct .
The sanitized , uncomplicated , and relationship - centric storylines of these TV shows are vehicles for mega- advertising dollars .
In this case , the tween revenue stream is up for grabs and ( surprise , surprise ) the content of the shows prepare 8 - 10 year olds to recognize that adolescence , in general , and dating and breaking - up , in particular , are properly understood as consumer events that they will soon experience .
Relationships are n’t complicated interactions between human beings ( how “ silly ” ) , but occasions to buy / wear the right clothes , conform to specific cliques , and spend the ‘ rents money on dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and dates to the multiplex .
And let ’s not forget how these easy , chaste plots are good training for future consumption habits : if you keep the tweens around long enough with HSM and HM , then eventually they ’ll switch to Desperate Housewives and Grey ’s Anatomy when melodrama with a character singing her “ own ” songs just does n’t compare to ABC - approved bands soundtracking the hijinks of those crazy “ adults . ”
All I can do is shudder .
Obviously , my response is a consequence of me not having kids .
When I do have kids , I ’ll realize that life ’s not just abstracted , continual analyses of which commodities are better to support when one is given a limited set of possibilities from which to choose .
Additionally , I ’ll find out , first - hand , how it sucks to have to be a responsible parent and strike a balance between letting your kid stay informed of the pop culture they share with their peers and , at the same time , help them develop a sense of ironic detachment from the incessant attacks from advertisers .
But while I ’m able to have the luxury of watching this from the sidelines , I ’m content to talk snark at the commodification of Miley Cyrus and the exploitation of the tween demographic .
After all , they ’re targeting 8 year - olds , dude .
TEHRAN ( Press TV ) --
The London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) has affirmed in a report that Israel has a ' sizeable ' nuclear arsenal .
The report stated that Israel was considered to be a “ de facto nuclear power with an advanced and sizeable arsenal , ” even though the regime had never itself acknowledged openly its nuclear - weapons status , DPA reported .
“ The fundamentals of Israel 's nuclear capabilities and policies , though never officially confirmed , are accepted as fact throughout the world , ” the IISS stated .
Israel is widely beleived to have more than 200 nuclear warheads .
The report shows that in the 11 months between February 2006 and January 2007 , at least 13 countries in the Middle East announced new or revived plans to pursue or explore civilian nuclear energy .
Would you recognize a legislative push for Creationism if you saw one ?
After decades of failed legal strategies to overtly ban evolution or make equal time for Creationism in public schools , the latest tack used by the opponents of evolution is to have ' academic freedom ' bills that encourage school teachers to include supposed evidence against evolution , or the presentation of ' both sides ' of a controversial issue in science class .
If you support the integrity of science education , you should oppose bills like this , both because they are redundant when it comes to good science ( teachers already can teach both scientific sides of a legitimate scientific debate ) , and because the Creationist legislators pushing them are up to no good .
But are we reaching a point where Creationism is defining itself out of existence ?
Are they creating a legal loophole too small for their anti-evolutionary propaganda to fit through ?
Religiously motivated strategies to oppose evolution in schools started out with efforts to ban the teaching of evolution .
When that approach was struck down by the Supreme Court , Creationists took to arguing that ' Creation Science ' was as scientifically legitimate as evolutionary biology , and therefore the two subjects should get equal space in the school curriculum .
The Supreme Court did n't buy that either , nor did a federal judge when ' Creation Science ' was relabeled as Intelligent Design .
With these options seemingly exhausted , opponents of evolution are attempting a new approach , although in substance it is not very different from the old one .
While essentially all of evolutionary biology 's opponents are motivated by religion or ideology , they pin their legal hopes on portraying evolution as scientifically controversial .
They have to limit their claims to scientific controversy , because this is how they avoid running up against the U.S. Constitutional barrier prohibiting religious advocacy in the public school curriculum - this is the barrier , upheld in every evolution case so far , which Creationists have unsuccessfully tried to burrow under .
Since it appears unlikely that Intelligent Design will ever be viewed by a federal court as a real scientific competitor of evolution , Creationists are now pushing legislation that specifically encourages schools to teach ' evidence against evolution ' .
Let 's take a look at some excerpts from one recent bill , introduced in Missouri , HB 2554 ( emphasis added ) :
1. ...[ Educators ] shall endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions , learn about scientific evidence , develop critical thinking skills , and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues , including such subjects as the teaching of biological and chemical evolution .
Such educational authorities in this state shall also endeavor to assist teachers to find more effective ways to present the science curriculum where it addresses scientific controversies .
Toward this end , teachers shall be permitted to help students understand , analyze , critique , and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological and chemical evolution .
2 . Neither the state board of education , nor any public elementary or secondary school governing authority , superintendent of schools , or school system administrator , nor any public elementary or secondary school principal or administrator shall prohibit any teacher in a public school system of this state from helping students understand , analyze , critique , and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological or chemical evolution .
What could sound more fair and rational than that ?
As a scientist , I think it 's critical for people to understand the strengths and weaknesses of any scientific theory .
How could anyone object to this innocuous language ?
The problem is this : Creationists , who are the only people introducing these sorts of bills , intend to use this language as a loophole to get their own spurious ' evidence against evolution ' into the science curriculum .
There is no need for a bill like this for legitimate scientific controversies : teachers are already free to discuss these , and no interest group is trying to stop them .
The language in these bills may be different from the previous overt attempts to push Creationism , but the strategy is not new : much of the ' evidence ' for Intelligent Design ( and Creation Science before that ) consisted of negative claims against evolution , and not positive evidence for a particular theory of Creation .
Creationists famously think they can win by default ; knock down evolution and Creation is the only option left standing , or so we 're told .
The same is true of Intelligent Design , whose advocates primarily argue that evolution could not have produced the bacterial flagellum , specified information , or the Cambrian ' explosion ' , leaving an incredibly powerful designer as the only explanation .
So the ' evidence against evolution ' which some state legislators want taught in public schools is not a debate taken from professional scientific journals , nor is it sound educational material developed by actual working scientists and science teachers .
It is just the same old spurious knocks against evolution made by Intelligent Design advocates and other Creationists in their mass market pop science books and public lecture tours .
But here is where Creationists are going to run into a problem : this recycled Creationist material , their ' evidence against evolution ' , has already been rejected in multiple courts as non-scientific .
They have had several opportunities to present their claims of of a real scientific controversy in court , most obviously in the recent Kitzmiller case .
Each time they have failed to persuade the judge that they have any scientific substance , and there is no reason to believe that these ' evidence against evolution ' bills will change that .
Creationists can't stop tinkering with the law , but this time , they may be trying to create a loophole too small to squeeze through .
Nevertheless , the legislative looniness goes on , and those who care about good science education should be on the alert for these bills , which crop up frequently , and not just in the Southern US .
So here are some tips for spotting these ' evidence against evolution bills :
1 . They are often called bills for ' academic freedom ' or ' freedom to teach ' " objective " evidence both for and against a particular scientific subject .
2 . They single out evolution over all other potentially controversial topics .
Notice that in the Missouri bill , the only topic mentioned is biological and ' chemical ' evolution .
( The bill 's author got wise to the fact that theories of the ' origins of life ' are not the same thing as the more well - established evolutionary biology - hence language including biological and chemical evolution ) .
3 . They explicitly state that they are not opening a loophole for religion - all in the hopes of avoiding a First Amendment challenge .
For example , the Missouri bill states : " This section only protects the teaching of scientific information and this section shall not be construed to promote any religious or nonreligious doctrine ... "
( In their attempts to make the bill First Amendment - challenge - proof , Creationists are shutting the door to any material so far produced by Creation Science or Intelligent Design . )
4 . The sponsor of the bill usually introduced a more explicit form of Creationism in an earlier bill , giving the game away .
In the case of this Missouri bill , the sponsor is Rep. Robert Wayne Cooper , who in 2004 sponsored HB 911 , which " Requires the equal treatment of science instruction regarding evolution and intelligent design " , and includes such classic anti-evolutionary gems as
" The lack of significant transitional forms between diverse species existing today and in the fossil record implies all original species were completed at inception rather than by a step - by - step development from other species ... "
( You want transitional forms ?
I 've recently reviewed evolutionary biologist Neil Shubin 's great book that deals with many transitional forms . )
Bills like this will never go away , but they are now , after decades of legal decisions against creationism , useless vestiges of what Creationists once hoped would be a very functional strategy .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Back in 2001 when the International Olympic Committee chose Beijing as the site of this summer 's games , the event was meant to mark China 's debut as a player on the global economic stage .
But a recent study by the economist Angus Maddison projects that China will become the world 's dominant economic superpower much sooner than expected - not in 2050 , but in 2015 .
While short - term investors are already cashing in on China 's growth by playing the global commodities boom , smart long - term thinkers are contemplating what happens when China matures from an exporter of cheap goods to a competitor in sectors where the U.S. is dominant - technology , brand building , finance .
China has almost wiped U.S. makers of low - value items like toys and socks , but by 2015 it may threaten Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , J.P. Morgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , and Procter & Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) .
It will increasingly influence the S&P 500 and the mutual funds in our 401 ( k ) s .
So it 's worth looking at how that will happen , what it means , and what anyone can do in the seven years before the baton is passed .
Just using the exchange rate to convert China 's GDP into dollars is n't helpful in comparing the two economies , because China controls its exchange rate ; by that method , China 's economy might not pass America 's for decades .
Exchange rates apply only to tradable products and services ; they are n't very useful in valuing nontradable goods in a country like China that is much poorer than the United States .
So we need some way to compare the real value of China 's economic output with America's , and economists have developed one .
It is called purchasing power parity .
For example , Chinese construction workers earn a whole lot less than Americans do , yet they can still build top - quality buildings .
If we used the exchange rate , the value of a new skyscraper in Shanghai would count much less toward China 's GDP than an identical building in Chicago would count toward America's , which makes no sense .
Purchasing power parity corrects the problem .
Will China take the crown ?
Angus Maddison 's forecast ( which uses purchasing power parity ) is n't built on outlandish assumptions .
He assumes China 's growth will slow way down year by year , and America 's will average about 2.6 % annually , which seems reasonable .
But because China has grown so stupendously during the past decade , it should still be able to take the crown in just seven more years .
If that happens , America will close out a 125 - year run as the No. 1 economy .
We assumed the title in 1890 from - guess who .
Britain ?
France ?
No .
The world 's largest economy until 1890 was China's .
That 's why Maddison says he expects China to " resume its natural role as the world 's largest economy by 2015 . "
That scenario makes sense .
China was the largest economy for centuries because everyone had the same type of economy - subsistence - and so the country with the most people would be economically biggest .
Then the Industrial Revolution sent the West on a more prosperous path .
Now the world is returning to a common economy , this time technology - and information - based , so once again population triumphs .
So how should we make the most of our seven - year grace period ?
For companies : Focus on getting better at your highest - value activities .
Just because the Chinese will be fighting you in the same industries does n't mean you 'll lose .
( Investors , remember that China bought $ 3 billion of Blackstone ( BX ) at the IPO price of $ 31 last summer , and the firm is now trading at $ 19 . )
It only means you 'll have to work harder to win .
For individuals :
You can avoid competition with Chinese workers by doing place - based work , which ranges in value from highly skilled ( emergency - room surgery ) to menial ( pouring concrete ) .
But the many people who do information - based work , which is most subject to competition , will have to get dramatically better to be worth what they cost .
For government leaders : Improve U.S. education above all .
Those are the issues in China 's becoming No. 1 that we most need to focus on .
And as with so much else in China 's recent history , we 'll need to worry about them much sooner than we expected .
PORTLAND , Ore. -- Tom and Betty West committed their mentally disabled son to a state institution .
His name was Richard , and he was three years old .
It was 1959 .
The massive complex was remote and family ties not encouraged .
The state eventually moved Richard to a different facility without informing the Wests of the location .
Four decades passed without a family member laying eyes on Richard .
As they entered their 80s , the Wests thought increasingly about Richard , the fifth of their eight children .
How was he ?
Where did he ...
In a discussion with Scientific American Mind executive editor Mariette DiChristina , three noted experts on creativity , each with a very different perspective and background , reveal powerful ways to unleash your creat­ive self .
WHEN General Motors ( GM ) launched the EV1 , a sleek electric vehicle , with much fanfare in 1996 , it was supposed to herald a revolution : the start of the modern mass - production of electric cars .
At the heart of the two - seater sat a massive 533 kg lead - acid battery , providing the EV1 with a range of about 110 km ( 70 miles ) .
Many people who leased the car were enthusiastic , but its limited range , and the fact that it took many hours to recharge , among other reasons , convinced GM and other carmakers that had launched all - electric models to abandon their efforts a few years later .
Yet today about a dozen firms are once again developing all - electric or plug - in hybrid vehicles capable of running on batteries for short trips ( and , in the case of plug - in hybrids , firing up an internal - combustion engine for longer trips ) .
Toyota 's popular Prius hybrid , by contrast , can travel less than a mile on battery power alone .
Tesla Motors of San Carlos , California , recently delivered its first Roadster , an all - electric two - seater with a 450 kg battery pack and a range of 350 km ( 220 miles ) between charges .
And both Toyota and GM hope to start selling plug - in hybrids as soon as 2010 .
So what has changed ?
Aside from growing concern about climate change and a surge in the oil price , the big difference is that battery technology is getting a lot better .
Rechargeable lithium - ion batteries , which helped to make the mobile - phone revolution possible in the past decade , are now expected to power the increasing electrification of the car .
“ They are clearly the next step , ” says Mary Ann Wright , the boss of Johnson Controls - Saft Advanced Power Solutions , a joint venture that recently opened a factory in France to produce lithium - ion batteries for hybrid vehicles .
According to Menahem Anderman , a consultant based in California who specialises in the automotive - battery market , more money is being spent on research into lithium - ion batteries than all other battery chemistries combined .
A big market awaits the firms that manage to adapt lithium - ion batteries for cars .
Between now and 2015 , Dr Anderman estimates , the worldwide market for hybrid - vehicle batteries will more than triple , to $ 2.3 billion .
Lithium-ion batteries , the first of which should appear in hybrid cars in 2009 , could make up as much as half of that , he predicts .
Compared with other types of rechargeable - battery chemistry , the lithium - ion approach has many advantages .
Besides being light , it does not suffer from any memory effect , which is the loss in capacity when a battery is recharged without being fully depleted .
Once in mass production , large - scale lithium - ion technology is expected to become cheaper than its closest rival , the nickel - metal - hydride battery , which is found in the Prius and most other hybrid cars .
Still , the success of the lithium - ion battery is not assured .
Its biggest weakness is probably its tendency to become unstable if it is overheated , overcharged or punctured .
In 2006 Sony , a Japanese electronics giant , had to recall several million laptop batteries because of a manufacturing defect that caused some batteries to burst into flames .
A faulty car battery which contains many times more stored energy could trigger a huge explosion — something no car company could afford .
Performance , durability and tight costs for cars are also much more stringent than for small electronic devices .
So the quest is under way for the refinements and improvements that will bring lithium - ion batteries up to scratch — and lead to their presence in millions of cars .
Alessandro Volta , an Italian physicist , invented the first battery in 1800 .
Since then a lot of new types have been developed , though all are based on the same principle : they exploit chemical reactions between different materials to store and deliver electrical energy .
Back to battery basics
A battery is made up of one or more cells .
Each cell consists of a negative electrode and a positive electrode kept apart by a separator soaked in a conductive electrolyte that allows ions , but not electrons , to travel between them .
When a battery is connected to a load , a chemical reaction begins .
As positively charged ions travel from the negative to the positive electrode through the electrolyte , a proportional number of negatively charged electrons must make the same journey through an external circuit , resulting in an electric current that does useful work .
“ Compared with computer chips , battery technology has improved very slowly over the years . ”
Some batteries are based on an underlying chemical reaction that can be reversed .
Such rechargeable batteries have an advantage , because they can be restored to their charged state by reversing the direction of the current flow that occurred during discharging .
They can thus be reused hundreds or thousands of times .
According to Joe Iorillo , an analyst at the Freedonia Group , rechargeable batteries make up almost two - thirds of the world 's $ 56 billion battery market .
Four different chemical reactions dominate the industry — each of which has pros and cons when it comes to utility , durability , cost , safety and performance .
The first rechargeable battery , the lead - acid battery , was invented in 1859 by Gaston Planté , a French physicist .
The electrification of Europe and America in the late 19th century sparked the use of storage batteries for telegraphy , portable electric - lighting systems and back - up power .
But the biggest market was probably electric cars .
At the turn of the century battery - powered vehicles were a common sight on city streets , because they were quiet and did not emit any noxious fumes .
But electric cars could not compete on range .
In 1912 the electric self - starter , which replaced cranking by hand , meant that cars with internal - combustion engines left electric cars in the dust .
Nickel - cadmium cells came along around 1900 and were used in situations where more power was needed .
As with lead - acid batteries , nickel - cadmium cells had a tendency to produce gases while in use , especially when being overcharged .
In the late 1940s Georg Neumann , a German engineer , succeeded in fine - tuning the battery 's chemistry to avoid this problem , making a sealed version possible .
It started to become more widely available in the 1960s , powering devices such as electric razors and toothbrushes .
For most of the 20th century lead - acid and nickel - cadmium cells dominated the rechargeable - battery market , and both are still in use today .
Although they cannot store as much energy for a given weight or volume as newer technologies , they can be extremely cost - effective .
Small lead - acid battery packs provide short bursts of power to starter motors in virtually all cars ; they are also used in large back - up power systems , and make up about half of the worldwide rechargeable - battery market .
Nickel - cadmium batteries are used to provide emergency back - up power on planes and trains .
Time to change the batteries
In the past two decades two new rechargeable - battery types made their commercial debuts .
Storing about twice as much energy as a lead - acid battery for a given weight , the nickel - metal - hydride battery appeared on the market in 1989 .
For much of the 1990s it was the battery of choice for powering portable electronic devices , displacing nickel - cadmium batteries in many applications .
Toyota picked nickel - metal - hydride batteries for the new hybrid petrol - electric car it launched in 1997 , the Prius .
Nickel - metal - hydride batteries evolved from the nickel - hydrogen batteries used to power satellites .
Such batteries are expensive and bulky , since they require high - pressure hydrogen - storage tanks , but they offer high energy - density and last a long time , which makes them well suited for use in space .
Nickel - metal - hydride batteries emerged as researchers looked for ways to store hydrogen in a more convenient form : within a hydrogen - absorbing metal alloy .
Eventually Stanford Ovshinsky , an American inventor , and his company , now known as ECD Ovonics , succeeded in creating metal - hydride alloys with a disordered structure that improved performance .
Adapting the nickel - metal - hydride battery to the automotive environment was no small feat , since the way batteries have to work in hybrid cars is very different from the way they work in portable devices .
Batteries in laptops and mobile phones are engineered to be discharged over the course of several hours or days , and they only need to last a couple of years .
Hybrid - car batteries , on the other hand , are expected to work for eight to ten years and must endure hundreds of thousands of partial charge and discharge cycles as they absorb energy from regenerative braking or supply short bursts of power to aid in acceleration .
Lithium-ion batteries evolved from non-rechargeable lithium batteries , such as those used in watches and hearing aids .
One reason lithium is particularly suitable for batteries is that it is the lightest metal , which means a lithium battery of a given weight can store more energy than one based on another metal ( such as lead or nickel ) .
Early rechargeable lithium batteries used pure lithium metal as the negative - electrode material , and an “ intercalation ” compound — a material with a lattice structure that could absorb lithium ions — as the positive electrode .
The problem with this design was that during recharging , the metallic lithium reformed unevenly at the negative electrode , creating spiky structures called “ dendrites ” that are unstable and reactive , and can pierce the separator and cause an explosion .
So today 's rechargeable lithium - ion batteries do not contain lithium in metallic form .
Instead they use materials with lattice structures for both positive and negative electrodes .
As the battery discharges , the lithium ions swim from the negative - electrode lattice to the positive one ; during recharging , they swim back again .
This to - and - fro approach is called a “ rocking chair ” design .
The first commercial lithium - ion battery , launched by Sony in 1991 , was a rocking - chair design that used cobalt oxide for the positive electrode , and graphite ( carbon ) for the negative one .
In the early 1990s , such batteries had an energy density of about 100 watt - hours per litre .
Since then engineers have worked out ways to squeeze more than twice as much energy into a battery of the same size , in particular by reducing the width of the separator and increasing the amount of active electrode materials .
The high energy - density of lithium - ion batteries makes them the best technology for portable devices .
According to Christophe Pillot of Avicenne Développement , a market - research firm based in Paris , they account for 70 % of the $ 7 billion market for portable , rechargeable batteries .
But not all lithium - ion batteries are alike .
The host structures that accept lithium ions can be made using a variety of materials , explains Venkat Srinivasan , a scientist at America 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
The combination of materials determines the characteristics of the battery , including its energy and power density , safety , longevity and cost .
Because of this flexibility , researchers hope to develop new electrode materials that can increase the energy density of lithium - ion batteries by a factor of two or more in the future .
Hooked on lithium
The batteries commonly used in today 's mobile phones and laptops still use cobalt oxide as the positive electrode .
Such batteries are also starting to appear in cars , such as Tesla 's Roadster .
But since cobalt oxide is so reactive and costly , most experts deem it unsuitable for widespread use in hybrid or electric vehicles .
So researchers are trying other approaches .
Some firms , such as Compact Power , based in Troy , Michigan , are developing batteries in which the cobalt is replaced by manganese , a material that is less expensive and more stable at high temperatures .
Unfortunately , batteries with manganese - based electrodes store slightly less energy than cobalt - based ones , and also tend to have a shorter life , as manganese starts to dissolve into the electrolyte .
But blending manganese with other elements , such as nickel and cobalt , can reduce these problems , says Michael Thackeray , a senior scientist at America 's Argonne National Laboratory who holds several patents in this area .
In 1997 John Goodenough and his colleagues at the University of Texas published a paper in which they suggested using a new material for the positive electrode : iron phosphate .
It promised to be cheaper , safer and more environmentally friendly than cobalt oxide .
There were just two problems : it had a lower energy - density than cobalt oxide and suffered from low conductivity , limiting the rate at which energy could be delivered and stored by the battery .
So when Yet - Ming Chiang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues published a paper in 2002 in which they claimed to have dramatically boosted the material 's conductivity by doping it with aluminium , niobium and zirconium , other researchers were impressed — though the exact mechanism that causes the increase in performance has since become the subject of a heated debate .
Dr Chiang 's team published another paper in 2004 in which they described a way to increase performance further .
Using iron - phosphate particles less than 100 nanometres across — about 100 times smaller than usual — increases the surface area of the electrode and improves the battery 's ability to store and deliver energy .
But again , the exact mechanism involved is somewhat controversial .
The iron - phosphate technology is being commercialised by several companies , including A123 Systems , co-founded by Dr Chiang , and Phostech Lithium , a Canadian firm that has been granted exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the material based on Dr Goodenough 's patents .
At the moment the two rivals are competing in the market , but their fate may be decided in court , since they are fighting a patent - infringement battle .
The quest for the perfect battery
Johnson Controls and Saft , which launched a joint venture in 2006 , are taking a different approach , in which the positive electrode is made using a nickel - cobalt - aluminium - oxide .
John Searle , the company 's boss , says batteries made using its approach can last about 15 years .
In 2007 Saft announced that Daimler had selected its batteries for use in a hybrid Mercedes saloon , due to go on sale in 2009 .
Other materials being investigated for use in future lithium - ion batteries include tin alloys and silicon .
Corbis
Look , no exhaust pipe
At this point , it is hard to say which lithium - ion variation will prevail .
Toyota , which is pursuing its own battery development with Matsushita , will not say which chemistry it favours .
GM is also hedging its bets .
The company is testing battery packs from both A123 Systems and Compact Power for the Chevy Volt ( pictured ) , a forthcoming plug - in hybrid that will have an all - electric range of 40 miles and a small internal - combustion engine to recharge its battery when necessary .
To ensure that the Volt 's battery can always supply enough power and meet its targeted 10 - year life - span , it will be kept between 30 % and 80 % charged at all times , says Roland Matthe of GM 's energy - storage systems group .
GM hopes to start mass - production of the Volt in late 2010 .
That is ambitious , since the Volt 's viability is dependent on the availability of a suitable battery technology .
“ It 's either going to be a tremendous victory , or a terrible defeat , ” says James George , a battery expert based in New Hampshire who has followed the industry for 45 years .
“ We 've still got a long way to go in terms of getting the ultimate battery , ” says Dr Thackeray .
Compared with computer chips , which have doubled in performance roughly every two years for decades , batteries have improved very slowly over their 200 - year history .
But high oil prices and concern over climate change mean there is now more of an incentive than ever for researchers to join the quest for better battery technologies .
“ It 's going to be a journey ” , says Ms Wright , “ where we 're going to be using the gas engine less and less . ”
Tasting Wine
All About Wine Tasting
There ’s more to tasting a glass of wine than throwing it down your gullet .
We ’ll start slow .
Colour
Hold the glass over a white background , like a napkin or tablecloth .
Colour varies with age , varietal ( i.e. Chardonnay is darker than Riesling ) and time spent in the barrel .
White wines range from almost clear to pale yellow - green , straw / yellow , light gold , gold or old gold , to maderized brown .
Reds can be magenta , purple , ruby red , red , eggplant , brick red or orange , red brown and finally , brown .
( If you ’re not drinking Sherry or Madeira , brown is not a good thing . )
Swirl
Swirl the wine to aerate it .
This releases ethers , esters and aldehydes that combine with oxygen to bring you the wine ’s aroma or bouquet .
It does n’t take much practice , but if you ’re just learning , start with a white or dress down .
Nose
Follow yours .
First : the flaws .
If there ’s a moldy , wet cardboard aroma it may be “ corky ” or tainted .
Drink not , or suffer the consequences .
Sulfur ( burnt match ) aromas may dissipate with a little air time or may not even bother you too much , but too much sulfur dioxide is a problem .
If your wine smells like Sherry but is n’t , that ’s a problem .
Likewise for vinegar .
If a wine smells clean , fresh , and ripe to you , get out of the embarrassing tasting spotlight and motion for the waiter to pour .
Only cigar smokers swish and contemplate the “ legs ” of a wine .
The “ nose ” should also be faithful to the grape ’s variety , which is something you have to learn over time .
Taste
Skip the sip .
Soak your taste buds by taking a decent mouthful and rolling it around .
Sweetness is detected at the tip of the tongue , so you ’ll be aware of residual sugar right away .
Varietal characteristics are picked up in the middle of the tongue ; tannin ( in most reds and wood - aged white ) starts there .
Acidity hits the sides of the tongue , the cheeks and the back of the throat .
Oak — despite all the faux connoisseurs waxing poetic about a Chardonnay ’s “ complex oakiness , ” the presence of oak is usually a negative attribute .
Many delicious wines are appropriately aged in oak barrels , a process that enhances a wine ’s body and viscosity .
Many domestic whites under $ 15 are not just aged in oak but also oak - fermented — that is , artificially sweetened with oak chips , powders , and essences .
The process disguises the natural flavour of the grape varietal with what is all too often the rough - hewn sweetness of , say , burnt caramel popcorn .
Too much of any one flavour almost always means it ’s out of whack .
Aftertaste is what lingers after you swallow .
A long pleasing aftertaste with a nice balance of the other components is the sign of a high quality wine .
Finish
What was the body of the wine like ?
Light ( like skim milk ) , medium ( like whole ) , or full bodied ( like cream ) ?
If it was a white wine , how was the acidity ?
Too little and flat ?
Just right , crispy , fresh and pleasing , or too high and burning your mouth ?
For a red wine , tannins are a big factor .
Light tannins make for a soft wine .
They can be present , ripe and pleasing , or too high , leaving a dry mouth feeling that may indicate some cellar time is needed to chill out .
How long did the “ finish ” last ?
A couple of seconds , or much longer , as great wines tend to ?
Is it ready to drink ?
Are all of these components appealing to you ?
Is it worth the price ?
Can you think of a food it might go well with ?
And most important : was it good for you ?
With Food
Remember , red wine is not necessarily more sophisticated than white , and not necessarily the only choice with meat .
In fact , because whites are generally lighter in weight than reds , they lend themselves more easily to a wider range of foods .
While there are any number of great sipping wines , light - to medium - bodied wines that are high in acidity and sugar and low in alcohol tend to be the most flexible and complimentary to our lighter , more dynamic diets .
Food - friendly whites include Riesling , Pinot Gris , Sauvignon Blanc ; the best choices among the reds are Cabernet Franc , Barbera , Gamay , Pinot Noir .
By Region
Regional wine qualities tend to reflect the specifics of regional cuisines .
So picking a region to tour often means choosing what kind of food you want to eat for ten days straight .
Here are some top wine picks in Europe :
Northern Italy : Piemonte and the Veneto are greatly influenced by the rich subtelty of their butter - worshipping French and Swiss neighbors .
Whites : From Piemonte , Pinot Bianco , Soave , Pinot Grigio with shellfish and fish ; the sparkling Prosecco from the Veneto .
Reds : Franciacorta Rosso ( Cabernet Franc , Barbera , and Merlot ) with meat ; Amarone ( Molinara , Rodinella and Corvina ) , Barbera , and young Nebbiolo with lamb and game .
Central Italy : Trendy cuisine from Tuscany and Chianti favors lighter pastas , vegetables and seafood .
Whites : Verdicchio , Orvieto ( Trebbiano and Garbanega ) , Vernaccia di San Gimignano .
Reds : Sangiovese , Morellino , Rosso di Montalcino , Chiantis , Vino Nobile di Montepulciano , Brunello di Montalcino .
For tricky - to - pair cured hams and cheeses , fruitier reds are a good choice : Valpolicella ( Corvina , Molinara , Rodinella ) , Barbera , Dolcetto , Ruffina .
Sicily and the South : Campagna and Sardegna — land of hard sheep ’s milk cheese , salty fish , tomatoes and plenty of garlic — favor sweeter , prunier wines like Greco and Fiano from Campagna and Vermentino from Sardegna .
Northern and Central France : Delicate butter and cream sauces paired with exquisite veal stock reductions and tarragon call for great big wines that have high acidity .
For fish or vegetables in light cream sauces , escargot , and oysters : Loire Chenins ( Vouvray and Montlouis ) , Loire Sauvignons ( Sancerre and Pouilly - Fumé ) , and Champagne .
For veal , pork , and white meat birds : Loire Cabernet Francs ( Saumur , Chinon , Bourgueil ) and the Gamay wines of Beaujolais .
For red meat and game : Bordeaux and red Burgundies .
Provence and Southwestern France : Like Southern
Italy , salty fish , tomato sauces , peppers , olive oil , and herbs go well with the regions many rosés and Ugni Blanc from Cascogne .
With light meats and heavy seafood , Viognier , Roussanne , Marsanne , Côtes - du - Rhône Blanc , Condrieu , and Hermitage Blanc .
Heavy goose liver pâté and duck can take heavy black wines like Cahors ( Malbec ) , Madiran ( Tannat ) , Bandol ( Mourvèdre ) , and Syrah - Grenache ( blends from Châteauneauf du Pape , Gigondas , Côtes de Roussillon , CÔtes de Lubéron , Corbieres , St. Chinian , and Minervois ) and northern Rhône Syrahs like Cornas , Côte - Rôtie , and Hermitage .
Alsace :
For the cuisine of this region , which is heavily influenced by its potato- , goose - , and sauerkraut - eating German neighbors , heavy aromatic whites are in order : Alsace Pinot Blanc , Tokay - Pinot Gris and the flowery and fruity Gewürztraminer .
Germany : Wines that are high in acid provide a necessary counterbalance to the fatty , bland , carb - and - meat - centric northern European diet .
The Mosel Rieslings are citrusy , whereas Rhine River wines tend to smell vaguely of peaches .
Nahe River wines are a combination of the two .
Rheinhessen wines tend to have smoky undertones to their fruity flavour .
Wines from the Rheingau region are dry .
The increasingly popular Rheinpfaltz ( or just “ Pfaltz ” ) style is both full and fruity and includes Gewürztraminer , Scheurebe , Spatburgunder ( Pinot Noir ) , and Chardonnay .
Editor ’s note :
We ’re pleased to welcome Max Gladwell , of MaxGladwell.com , as a regular guest writer on sustainablog .
Max Gladwell covers the nexus of social media and green living .
We feel that these two trends and technological developments hold tremendous promise for improving the quality of life for everyone on the planet .
If you ’re reading this blog , then you ’re on board with social media .
There ’s a good chance you belong to social networks like Facebook or MySpace .
It ’s likely that you Digg stories and even possible that you Twitter .
These technologies and services , together with a growing number of others , make up the social web .
It ’s much like the regular web , but more interactive .
More …social .
It invites and even demands active participation from everyone .
It has a global reach with viral capacity , and yet it ’s bringing local communities closer together .
It enables people to connect , organize , and make a difference as never before .
Indeed , social media is a powerful force , one that the world ’s CEOs are starting to acknowledge and take seriously .
Many entrepreneurs , activists , and marketers are leveraging the social web for positive change .
In the process and by its very nature , they are giving each of us the tools to change the world and make it a better place .
There are thousands of examples , which is precisely why Max Gladwell exists .
Here are 10 worth exploring .
1. Do-Good Widgets :
If you ’re Facebook page was a car , these would be your bumper stickers .
Only these do more than spread the message .
Widgets are standalone web applications that can run inside any web page .
They take many forms , ranging from the absurd to the truly useful and socially valuable .
The best ones engage us in ways that lead to action , awareness , and even fund - raising .
Facebook was the first to offer them , and MySpace recently followed .
Other social networks offer widgets , but these two have a scale that gives them unrivaled potential .
Causes is the 800 - pound gorilla in the do - good widget space with millions of daily active users on Facebook alone .
If you support a cause , chances are you can find it in Causes .
We support 14 ranging from “ Recycle not Waste ” to “ Ride Bikes ” and “ GREEN “ .
Each Cause enables you to recruit others and make donations .
A new suite of widgets from Dank Apps called Social Change offers widgets for three main initiatives : Stop Climate Change Now , which raises funds for The Nature Conservancy ; Earn For AIDS , which raises funds for the Clinton HIV / AIDS Initiative ; and Earn for Breast Cancer , which raises funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation .
Each of these allows you to send karma points to friends and play games , all of which generate donations from sponsors .
I ’m sure I ’d get hate comments if I did n’t also mention Lil Green Patch , which has helped to save over 20 million square feet of rainforest .
2. Get a Green Job :
The business networking space is currently dominated by LinkedIn , but JustMeans has a new social media platform that “ rallies both companies and individuals around social responsibility . ”
As you make your way through the registration and profile - building gauntlet , you are posed with two unique questions :
What kind of change do you want to create in the world over the next 12 months ?
How do you plan on creating this positive change ?
The site encourages networking between members by recommending matches based on shared interests .
Plus , you can network with companies themselves as “ stakeholders ” .
Companies as well as nonprofits set up their own profiles , similar to Facebook Pages , where they can post content about initiatives and CSR efforts .
An entire section of the site is dedicated to job listings .
This is business networking with a purpose .
3. Greenstream : Twitter is a way to stay in touch with friends and keep up with breaking news .
It is a source of both cutting - edge news and unchecked banality .
It all depends on how you want to use it .
You can follow CNN , BBC , GreenOptions , and MaxGladwell as “ micro- blogs ” , where you receive bits of news and links in 140 characters or less .
Or you can track the musings of iJustine and Aubs for pure entertainment value .
Recently , we started a new Twitter channel called the “ greenstream . ”
Whereas Twitter asks , “ What are you doing ” , this adds “ that is green ? ”
So if you ’re shopping at a farmer ’s market , drinking organic fair trade coffee* , or carpooling to work , these qualify as Tweets for the greenstream .
Just tag your
Tweet with “ # greenstream ” , and it will be indexed for viewing by all .
Alternately , if you want to Twitter a green tip , just enter “ #greentip ” and check the index page for those .
4. Hugg a Story : Hugg.com is the green counterpart to the wildly popular Digg.com .
These are social news sites that enable users to vote and comment on what ’s important ( and what ’s not ) .
This process places the power in the hands of real people who , collectively , determine which issues get attention , rather than leaving it up to the major news organizations to tell us what ’s important .
The great thing about them , though , is that they get better and more accurate as more people participate .
So it ’s your civic and social duty to Hugg and Digg stories that matter to you .
5. Join the “ Make The Difference Network “ : Actress Jessica Biel , in a collaboration with her father and brother , just launched a social network that connects people and businesses with charitable organizations .
Make
The Difference Network already has a number of prominent celebrities signed up as members , complete with their favorite causes .
Each of the site ’s constituencies has a profile platform , and it ’s free for all to participate .
The “ Find Your Wish ” section gives people some direction in matching their personal interests or passions with charities ranging from addiction and animals to labor and literacy .
6. Go Shopping : Your purchasing decisions matter .
Though presidential elections come once every four years , you vote with your wallet every day .
Combined with the tools of social media , you get social shopping .
Alonovo describes this as “ the power of millions of informed , aware and caring people acting in concert .
For a better world . ”
The company provides a platform in which to interact with fellow conscious consumers , to research products based on a range of social and environmental criteria , and ultimately make informed purchases through Amazon.com .
You choose a charitable benefactor , and 50 - 100 % of the commission paid to Alonovo is donated on your behalf .
OsoEco , which is currently in private beta , takes a different tact .
Using a bookmark feature for the Firefox browser , you can pull products from any retail site and import them into OsoEco with one click .
It ’s much like a wiki in this way ( more below ) .
Then you review the product for others to see and rate .
According to the company , they “ created OsoEco to answer our own questions about what ’s green , what ’s sustainable , and what kinds of things we should buy and do that are good for our communities and , not to sound completely cheesy and cliche , our world . ”
7. Contribute to a Wiki : Most are familiar with Wikipedia .
It ’s a fantastic resource for information and an even more incredible phenomenon of collaborative creation on a global scale .
What ’s incredible to consider , though , is that it ’s just the beginning .
As author Clay Shirky points out , it ’s a drop in the well compared to the untapped potential of our cognitive surplus .
PlayGreen.org is one example of how wikis are being built for specific topic areas .
Anyone can contribute or edit articles such as How to build a green PC and RecycleBank .
Imagine an entire Wikipedia of knowledge and human experience dedicated to specific issues like global warming , cancer , autism , and renewable energy .
That ’s where we ’re headed .
8. Start Your Own Social Network : Ning has made starting a social network as easy as signing up for an email address .
For an example , see the Max Gladwell network or any one of more than 100 networks tagged with “ green ” .
The platform guides you through the customization process , where you can add features like a blog , news feed , videos , calendar , and assorted gadgets ( widgets ) to give it more utility .
This is perfect for organizations on a tight budget that want a place to aggregate information , organize , and keep its members connected .

10 . Broadcast Your Message :
The cost of web broadcasting ( webcasting ) has effectively dropped to zero .
A number of new technologies are making it possible for anyone to have their own live online TV channel .
Indeed , signing up for Ustream.tv is like renting your own production studio .
While you ’re broadcasting live , can communicate with you and other viewers through a chat interface , and you can even add a co-host .
Your “ shows ” can be archived for later playback , and you can post them to YouTube or your personal pages for further distribution .
Ustream also provides a social networking platform and a number of ways to promote your shows , such as through Twitter alerts .
Seesmic has a much different approach with “ video conversations ” .
It ’s similar to Twitter in many ways , only instead of posting text entries you record video clips .
Other users respond , which forms a thread of video clips that become a video conversation .
These clips can be embeded anywhere you want , such as your MySpace page or blog .
In fact , Seesmic offers a plugin feature for blogs where you can leave video comments .
While there ’s nothing particularly green about these video technologies , they represent a next step in communications and an efficient means for producing and distributing green messages .

Update : Please visit the Windows UX Taskforce website to submit your entries .
Most of us who use Windows Vista have probably come across a couple of user - interface quirks during our times – some of which irritate you more than others , some are more obvious than others .
With the development of Windows 7 speeding full - steam ahead , I thought this might be an opportunity as good as ever to make these problems known to Microsoft and hopefully get them all resolved .
Instead of going at it alone , I thought this is the perfect opportunity to harness the wisdom of the crowd .
Therefore I ’m asking you to submit any UI quirks you know of in Vista and I ’ll help compile a list of them together , including but not limited to legacy icons , legacy styles and malformed layouts .
Include with it a brief description of the problem ( and possible alternative if appropriate ) .
I can’t promise you that all bugs will be fixed but I will push them to someone at Microsoft who has been said to “ get things done ” .
Without a further ado , I ’ll kick it off with a couple of examples .

During a weather - related power outage , though , that can be difficult .
Still , there are steps you can take to make the most of the situation during a power outage in the middle of winter .
The good news is that you ’ve come to the right place by reading this article .
Detailed below is everything you need to know about what to do during a power outage in winter .
There are plenty of valid reasons to get prepared in the unfortunate event of a power outage in your area this winter .
Consider the following statistic regarding power outages throughout the United States .
It indicates that since the year 2003 , the number of power outages in the country has doubled .
Make sure you and your family are properly prepared .
Keep reading to handle a potential upcoming power outage with finesse .
Stock up on Essentials Before the Winter
One of the first things to consider about a power outage is that of what you have on hand .
As winter approaches , it ’s in your best interest to stock up on essential supplies that could make a potential power outage more comfortable .
Not only should this include items for sustenance like nonperishable food and beverages .
In addition , you ’ll need other basic supplies such as candles and batteries on hand .
If you have electric or traditional lanterns , these can also be useful to see around the house when it ’s dark outside .
Plus , make sure your family members all have enough mittens , socks , ad gloves to stay warm during the power outage .
Blankets are also a good idea since living without the modern convenience of central heat can be quite shocking .
If you have a working fireplace , keep plenty of fuel throughout the winter , too .
When the days start getting shorter and colder , take the time to go shopping for some of these essential items .
You and your family will be grateful you did so when you ’re prepared during an unfortunate power outage .
What to Do During a Power Outage with Pets
Throughout most of the year , it ’s understandable to keep your dogs outside on a consistent basis .
After all , you ’ve provided them with adequate shelters and doghouses to keep them safe from the elements .
You might even have an outdoor cat to consider .
In those particularly cold months , though , you might want to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the cold .
This can already be a bit of a challenge before a power outage .
Once there is a power outage , do n’t forget to ensure your pets are staying warm enough , too .
They might also need some extra blankets in their beds .
It ’s also smart to keep a close eye on them during power outages , by the way .
You do n’t want them to knock over any candles or lanterns with burning fuel .
It ’s Worthwhile to Invest in a High - Quality Generator
One of the best things you can have during a power outage in winter is that of a reliable generator .
That way , you really do n’t have to live without power for too long .
Shop around in your local area and online for the best deals when it comes to generators you and your family can rely on .
The sooner you invest in one , the better .
For a specific example , check out this generator for the home .
Remember , you do n’t want to wait until the last minute to buy your generator .
If you do so once the power outage already hits your local community , a ton of other people will be shopping for generators in the store , too .
Buy one well in advance to ensure you ’ll have back - up electricity in the event of a power outage .
Keep the Faucets Throughout the Home Dripping a Little Bit
If you ’ve never gone through a serious power outage during winter before , you might not think about the possibility of your pipes freezing .
When our home is n’t generating any heat throughout it , though , the water within the pipes can freeze before you know it .
Soon enough , you do n’t have any access to water in the entire home .
For that reason , it ’s in your best interest to keep the faucets running during the event of a power outage with freezing temperatures outside .
Of course , it does n’t have to be a full - blown running sink and bathtub .
Rather , leave a light trickle of water running that wo n’t ruin your water bill at the end of the month .
Even just a few drops of running water can keep your pipes from freezing altogether .
Do n’t Take Risks Driving During a Power Outage
The last key tip to remember during a power outage is to prioritize your safety at all times .
Do n’t take the chance of driving in the middle of a terrible storm .
If your community is experiencing a power outage , it ’s likely that the street lights are not one , which can present a real danger when you ’re driving .
That ’s yet another reason it ’s important to stock up on essentials so you do n’t have to leave the home in a winter power outage .
Continue Protecting Your Family , Home , and Overall Quality of Life
At this point in the article , you have a thorough understanding of what to do during a power outage in the middle of winter .
There ’s no need to cut corners when it comes to ensuring you and your family are well - cared for .
That ’s why you ’ll take the above suggestions seriously .
Going through a power outage can at least bring you closer together as a family .
It ’s a chance to make the most of the experience and develop some quality family time .
Doing so can even help you increase your overall happiness and quality of life .
In fact , it can be in your best interest to continue investing in that happiness and security for your family .
That ’s where this website can perhaps come into play .
For that reason , we encourage you to browse through the rest of our blog articles today .
You ’ll find the latest and greatest trends in home living and lifestyle habits .
To start , comment below this article about how it inspired you and your family to prepare for this upcoming winter season .
Not can a " smart person " be president , but an intellectual .
There 's a difference .
Bill Clinton attended Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar , but no one would have pegged the McDonald 's - munching Clinton as an ivory - tower egghead .
George W. Bush attended both Harvard and Yale , but I think we 're safe in saying that the word " intellectual " could not be attached to him with all the barbed wire in Texas .
Flipping backwards through the list of presidential candidates , the last guy who had the sign " intellectual " hanging from his neck was probably Adlai Stevenson .
Kennedy probably deserved it , but I 'm assured that the " dreamy " factor offset any tendency toward sustained Latin discourse .
But after several rounds of selecting presidents by the beer test , can we instead vote for a candidate who does n't hide her / his smarts ?
Megan Daum has a discussion of the downtrodden intellectual in her LA Times column .
With political discourse reduced to screaming contests and actual news eclipsed by exclusive and shocking footage of celebrities without makeup , we 've become not only impatient with but downright opposed to the kinds of ideas that can't be reduced to a line on a screen crawl or a two - sentence blog entry .
What 's more , a lot of people who harbor an intolerance for complexity see it not as a character flaw but a cognitive virtue .
That 's because they 've fallen into the trap of believing that complicated ideas ( " complicated " now constituting anything that requires reading , watching or listening to in its entirety ) are the purview of the " elite . "
Most of the vitriol being levied at Obama these days boils down to his shocking refusal to mouth the standard phrases all politicians are supposed to say , the ones that seem to make up 110 % of John McCain 's vocabulary .
Listening to Obama requires that you engage more than political cruise control and actually think about what he 's saying .
Can we put up with that ?
But even if Obama is not an intellectual in the classic sense , there 's no doubt that he 's absorbed the trappings of erudite rhetoric .
He offers up ideas that do n't lend themselves to sound bites but require some sustained attention .
And according to the media and the political spin machine , that 's proof he 's snobby and out of touch .
One of the things that strikes people who 've spent any time in Europe is that Europeans tend to be almost universally bookish .
By that I do n't mean they travel around with a copy of Proust tucked under one arm , but if they 've read past the cover page of Remembrance of Things Past they 're not afraid to toss their own two euros into the discussion .
That does n't mean for a moment that Europeans are one neuron smarter than Americans , only that they do n't seem convinced that knowledge is something you should feel bad about .
America suffers from a national schizophrenia on education .
Everybody thinks it 's a good idea to get an education , but displaying that education is looked on as a sin .
Knowing how to do a better job for the country and explaining it with clear and thorough reasoning , rather than offering up ignorance spiced with tired stock phrases and pithy platitudes , may ultimately turn out to be disqualifying .
Fortunately this is n't true at Daily Kos .
Intellectuals are n't afraid to show their light here .
For example , within five minutes , someone will be along to explain how I misused schizophrenia .
During adulthood , our bodies tightly regulate the number of fat cells , which could explain why it seems easy to gain back lost weight .
Want to get rid of some fat cells as you age ?
Fat chance .
You 're stuck with the number of fat cells you have acquired by about age 20 , a new study finds .
Researchers have known that people gain and lose weight at least in part by changing how much fat is in their fat cells .
The new finding is particularly important for obese people , who the researchers say can have twice as many fat cells as their lean counterparts .
The finding also suggests that obesity in adulthood is at least partly determined by diet and exercise in childhood .
Strange study
To determine the age of fat cells in 35 subjects , researchers focused on a marker found in fat cells — radioactive carbon from above - ground nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and 60s .
More of a naturally occurring but rare type of carbon , called carbon - 14 , was produced during the testing .
Bruce Buchholz , a chemist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , Calif. , explained how his team used this marker to make their discovery .
Our bodies incorporate carbon - 14 from the food we eat , along with the vastly more abundant types called carbon - 12 and 13 .
Since carbon - 14 from the testing is decreasing with time as it mixes with the oceans , the amount of rare carbon - 14 that a cell has taken up is like a timestamp for when the cell formed , Buchholz said .
The researchers knew that cells were dying and being replaced over time , because people born before the nuclear testing had fat cells that were created after the testing .
The scientists also found that about 10 percent of fat cells were replaced every year whether or not a person was obese .
Despite that replacement rate , another aspect of the study with a larger sample of people revealed that the total number of fat cells per person remained relatively constant over time .
Even extreme weight - loss strategies , such as bariatric surgery , did not reduce the number of fat cells in study subjects .
Aha !
The tightly regulated number of fat cells in adulthood may explain why it seems easy to gain back lost weight , Buchholz said .
If you already have more fat cells from adolescence than other people , " it 's harder to become thin , " Buchholz told LiveScience .
The study raises a new mystery : Something tells the body to make a new fat cell when another dies , Buchholz said .
In the future , if scientists could interfere with this turnover , they might actually reduce fat - cell number in adults , he said .
The findings , detailed in the May 4 online issue of the journal Nature , suggest that the focus for controlling obesity should be on children , said Dr. Jeffrey Gimble , who studies fat stem cells at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge and was not involved in the research .
The idea is that if the number of fat cells is capped by age 20 , then the smart approach is to prevent their formation in children .
Obesity prevention in the early years could have " a lifetime impact , " Gimble said .
ほとんどのHDD暗号化を解いてしまうというデモ
「 Lest We Remember : Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys ( 概要 ) 」 という発表がありました。 「 Full Research Paper 」 も公開されています。 プリンストン大学での研究発表です。
世の中にある非常に多くのハードディスク暗号化は突破できると書いてありました。
RAM (メモリ)に残った秘密鍵を読み込んでしまえば暗号を複合できるという発想です。 電源を切るとRAMに入った情報は直ぐに消えてしまうわけではなく、時間と共に徐々に消えて行きます。 そのRAMに含まれる暗号の秘密鍵を読み出してしまえというわけです。
いきなり電源を切って直ぐに冷却材などで急速に冷却するという手法を使うと、RAMからデータが消失するまでの時間を飛躍的に延ばす事も可能であると研究では述べています。
今回の研究者達 はTrueCrypt、Apple FileVault 、Linux dm-crypt、に対して攻撃プログラムを実行してみたそうです。
また、似たような物は殆ど危険と今回の研究者達は考えているようです。
サスペンド状態やパスワード待ちスクリーンセーバー状態の時にPCを丸ごと盗まれると、暗号を破る事が可能であると主張しています。
Windows VISTA BitLocker も 「電源を切ったように見えるけど実は切っていない状態」では脆弱な場合もあるそうです。
うーん。 これが本当だとすると、非常に怖いですね。。。 暗号化 がHDD に施されていても、盗まれるタイミングによってはアウトという事になってしまいますね。
現在、企業セキュリティ規定に「サスペンド禁止」と書いてあるものは少ない気がします。 今後、「パスワード待ちスクリーンセーバー禁止」や「サスペンド禁止」がセキュリティの基本になるのでしょうか。。。
かなり衝撃的な内容でした。

A Christian group is suing Google over the internet giant 's refusal to take its anti-abortion adverts .
The Christian Institute , a " non-denominational Christian charity " , wanted to pay Google so that whenever the word " abortion " was typed into the popular search engine , its link would appear on the side of the screen .
The link would have read : " UK abortion law - news and views on abortion from the Christian Institute .
www.christian.org.uk. "
But Google refused the advert because it said it had a policy of declining sites which mixed the issue of abortion with religious views .
Its Dublin - based advertising team replied : " At this time , Google policy does not permit the advertisement of websites that contain ' abortion and religion - related content ' . "
Google does , however , accept adverts for abortion clinics , secular pro-abortion sites and secularist sites which attack religion .
The Christian Institute has now started legal proceedings against Google on the grounds that it is infringing the Equality Act 2006 by discriminating against Christian groups .
It is seeking damages , costs and the permission to publish its advertisement .
Mike Judge , Christian Institute spokesman , said : " For many people , Google is the doorway to the internet .
" If there is to be a free exchange of ideas then Google cannot give special free speech rights to secular groups whilst censoring religious views .
" To say that religious sites with material on abortion are ' unacceptable content ' ( while ) advertising pornography is ridiculous . "
The group was supported by the Christian former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe , who said : " It does seem to me to be the most appalling and blatant case of religious discrimination and also to be a very silly attempt to stifle due debate . "
The institute sought to promote its online articles on abortion ahead of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill arriving in the House of Commons next month .
The Bill will provide the first opportunities in 18 years for MPs to vote on the upper time limit for abortions : currently 24 weeks .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The browser , that porthole onto the broad horizon of the Web , is about to get some fancy new window dressing .
Next month , after three years of development and six months of public testing , Mozilla , the insurgent browser developer that rose from the ashes of Netscape , will release Firefox 3.0 .
It will feature a few tricks that could change the way people organize and find the sites they visit most frequently .
Not to be outdone , Microsoft recently took the wraps off the first public test version of the latest edition of Internet Explorer , which is used by about 75 percent of all computer owners , according to Net Applications , a market share tracking firm .
The finished version of Internet Explorer 8 could be released by the end of the year and is expected to have additional features .
Even Apple , which once politely kept its Safari browser within the confines of its own devices , is making a somewhat controversial push to get it onto the computers of people who use Windows PCs .

about this card
On Wednesdays I post a link to an older card and then spend the rest of my day working as a volunteer on a street corner , raising awareness about how annoying people can be when they stand on the street corners raising awareness about things .
Happy Wednesday !
Too funny .
You gotta appreciate this guy ‘s honesty in a forum on the Answers in Genesis ( Creationist ) website .
He asks a question that deserves a proper , honest answer .
But this is AiG , so he ’s not going to get one .
HELP !
It is distressing to me when I buy Creationist materials , learn something , post it in a forum , only to be told , what I have been told is not true .
Here is an example of someone “ correcting ” a statement made by a Creationist in a forum , saying that mutations DO add beneficial information to an organism .
He refers to a specific experiment I have no knowledge of . :
“ We have observed mutation adding information to a genome .
We have observed mutation adding useful information to a genome .
A clonal culture of bacteria was grown over 1000 generations , and monitored throughout .
It turns out , the bacteria ’s DNA mutated , and the variation was then acted upon by natural selection .
Even though the bacteria started out as clonal ( no variation ) , it developed variation in its phenotype , and then responded to natural selection . ”
My son wrote a paper using information from Mike Riddle , yet his geology teacher said it was full of “ inaccuracies . ”
I was very embarrassed .
Need help refuting .

The response from Dr. Georgia Purdom is a lot of what - you ’d - expect babble :
So , then , whose ideas about the past ( historical science ) are truth ?
God ’s Word / God ’s Truth or human reasoning / man ’s truth ?
It appears that you have taken what scientists who do not believe in God or the authority of the Bible believe as truth rather than what scientists who do believe in God and the authority of the Bible see as truth .
Ylooshi takes apart the rest of her response much more thoroughly .
If only these well - intentioned people would go to the science experts from the beginning instead of relying on the ignorant wannabes .

The White House last week issued a long - awaited policy on “ controlled unclassified information ” ( CUI ) to provide a uniform government - wide system for safeguarding unclassified information that is deemed sensitive .
The CUI framework is supposed to replace the numerous individual agency control markings — “ sensitive but unclassified , ” “ for official use only , ” and over a hundred other designations — and thereby to overcome barriers to information sharing within the government .
But the new policy will do nothing to restore public access to government records that have been improperly withheld .
Development of the CUI policy began with a December 16 , 2005 memo from the President directing agencies to “ standardize procedures for sensitive but unclassified information . ”
Despite the passage of two and a half years , however , little progress has been made in defining the terms of the new policy .
It establishes a single CUI framework , with three graduated levels of sensitivity and security .
But the definition of what information may qualify as CUI , which includes anything that “ under law or policy ” requires protection from unauthorized disclosure , is vague and expansive .
To put it another way , the CUI policy does not exclude anything that is currently controlled as Sensitive But Unclassified .
This is a disappointment in light of previous suggestions that wholesale disclosures of currently controlled unclassified information might ensue .
“ The great majority of the information which is now controlled can be put in a simple unclassified , uncontrolled category , it seems to me , ” said Amb .
Thomas McNamara , program manage of the ODNI Information Sharing Environment , in 2006 testimony ( pdf ) before Congress .
But under the new Bush policy , “ the great majority of the information ” that Amb.
McNamara said should be uncontrolled will remain controlled and unavailable to the public .
The CUI policy properly notes that the new policy does not modify the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act process : “ CUI markings may inform but do not control the decision of whether to disclose or release the information to the public , such as in response to a request made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act . ”
But despite the passage of years since the policy was proposed , many of the hard decisions involved have been deferred to the implementation phase .
Which , if any , of the more than 100 existing control categories will be canceled , rather than absorbed into the new CUI category ?
The new policy does not say .
At what point , if any , does the CUI designation expire ?
There ’s no way to tell .
What enforcement mechanisms are established to ensure compliance with the new policy ?
To be determined .
Update : Smintheus at Daily Kos has more .
My Windows laptop refused to boot into Windows .
The ominous error message was :
Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt : \windows\system32\config\system
A quick Google suggested that the registry had been corrupted .
I tried various things to recover the OS , including using the XP recovery console to manually restore a backup of the registry .
It did n’t work .
No problem .
I have a fairly paranoid back - up regime .
All the important information on my laptop is also stored on my subversion server .
I could just reformat the laptop , reinstall the applications ( including subversion ) and check out all the files again .
Except that I had n’t thought to include my wife ’s files on the laptop in my back - up plans .
Oops .
After hours of making no progress recovering the data .
I tried Knoppix .
I got access to the data in not much longer than it took to download Knoppix .
Knoppix is a Linux distribution that can run from a CD ( i.e. it does n’t require installation on your harddisk ) .
It is also capable of understanding Windows file systems .
To use it :
Download the latest Knoppix CD .iso file ( approx 700 MB ) .
Note – The DVD version is much larger .
Burn the .iso to a CD , for example using the free Active ISO Burner .
Boot the stricken machine from the Knoppix CD .
You may need to change your system to BIOS to boot from the CD first .
How you access the BIOS varies between machines .
On my Toshiba laptop you press F2 as the system boots .
Drag and drop data from the stricken machine to a USB harddisk or memory stick .
Or copy to another machine using FTP from Knoppix .
The Knoppix user interface is easy enough to use , even if you have n’t used Linux before .
Note that you do n’t have to enter your Windows password to recover the files .
This brings homw how easy it is to get data off a password protected Windows machine , if you have physical access to the machine .
Another good reason to encrypt sensitive data on your laptop , for example using the free Truecrypt .
Thanks Knoppix !
I ’ve added you to my mental list of worthy software causes to make a small donation to one day .
Obviously you need access to a functioning machine to do the above .
So why not make a Knoppix CD now , while everything is fine ?
You never know when you might need it .

Is there any doubt that Universal and Paramount will transfer all their HD DVDs to Blu-ray discs ?
They will just be HD DVDs Copied to Blu-ray Discs .
Mpeg 2 and VC - 1 are both antiquated relics from the old DVD format which should be discontinued .
Companies still using them should stop as VC 1 is exactly the same as Mpeg2 except for 1 minor change Microsoft made to make it theirs .
They both have fixed bit rates which are half of the Blu-ray AVC - Mpeg4 codec .
I dont know about you but I was in the Format fight because of all Blu-ray had to offer , and no one said anything about , if Blu-ray wins , we 'll just copy our HD DVD 's onto Blu-ray Disc 's and sell them that .
If we give up now on the quality , these guy 's will sell us HD DVD copied to Blu-ray Disc 's if it will save them a dime and resell us the same movie again in two or three years remastered in AVC Special Editions with DTS Master HD or LPCM audio .
Let 's not be complete Muppets this time around .
Blu-ray should impose AVC Mpeg 4 as the Standard for Blu-ray like Mpeg 2 was for DVD .
Let 's see if Sony was serious about quality and not just using AVC to win the format war then do what ever they want afterwards .
I notice that Sony has released several movies with Dolby True HD Sound tracks which is inferior to LPCM and DTS Master HD so I 'd say if we say Nothing were up the creep with out a paddle .
Be patient ; do n't just jump because they put some good titles in front of you .
That 's what these guy 's do to take the suckers out first .
When HD DVD brought out these same titles on HD DVD I did n't just go buy a HD DVD player and in the end the better format won .
The same goes here .
We should hold out for quality so we do n't get sucked in again .
If these guy 's want to sell movies in the future they will have to make new ones and not just sell us the same movies over and over again .
And for heaven sakes speak up and make yourselves heard or theyll think you dont care .
They counting on you doing nothing , so do or say something .
Get involved , and have a say .
That s what this forum is for .
It s not the shopping channel , or the everything is ok as long as its on a Blu-ray disc club .
Buy the way I was one of the guys that told you not to buy HD DVD , was I right ?

Miami Wakes Up To Zombie Attack
An average Saturday night turned into a nightmare for MacArthur Causeway when he was attacked by 31 year old Rudy Eugene .
The attacker was naked and was in a “ Zombie like ” state when he attacked Causeway , biting off parts of his face .
Causeway was rescued by the police who had to shoot Eugene dead to get the victim out of his grip .
“ Bath Salts ” are the suspected here for the zombie like behavior of Rudy Eugene .
These Bath Salts are different from what you would use in your everyday bath tub , and the name “ Bath Salts ” is just a disguise for a dangerous drug which is known to contain amphetamine like chemicals .
This new LSD like drug is illicitly available on the streets and is the culprit behind many such attacks that have occurred around the country lately .
The victim of the Zombie like attack is known to have lost around 85 % of his face and will take a sometime to recover and get his life back to normal .

The first Tesla Roadster has rolled off the company 's production line , less than two years since the first prototype of the all - electric sports car was unveiled .
The $ 98,000 Lotus - engineered car is claimed to be the world 's first zero emissions electric vehicle in production .
Last month Tesla secured $ 40 m ( £ 20 m ) in extra funding to sort out problems with the transmissions that delayed the car by six months , and to get the car in production after a management change .
It also had to cut staff .
The 2008 model year is sold out , and Tesla is taking orders for 2009 production .
However , there are no plans to sell the car in the UK , despite that fact that it is built by Lotus engineering at its
Hethel factory in Norfolk .
Tesla is now working on a five - seat four - door saloon for production in 2010 .
Known as the White Star , the car will be built in the US .

LOS ANGELES 
A hedge fund manager and art collector from New York testified under immunity Tuesday that Anthony Pellicano , the Hollywood private detective accused of wiretapping and racketeering , had once offered to have a movie producer killed for him .
Adam D. Sender , the owner of Exis Capital , a hedge fund that at one point had more than $ 1 billion in assets , said in Federal District Court here that he had paid Mr. Pellicano about $ 500,000 to investigate Aaron Russo , a producer and onetime talent manager whose film credits included “ Trading Places . ”
Mr. Russo died of cancer last year .
In 1999 , Mr. Sender invested $ 1.1 million with Mr. Russo .
Later , Mr. Sender sued Mr. Russo , accusing him of pocketing the money .
Mr. Russo dodged process servers for more than a year , until Mr. Pellicano was brought into the case at the urging of Mr. Sender ’s new lawyer , Bert Fields .
( Mr. Sender said he paid Mr. Fields ’s firm about $ 300,000 , but recovered only $ 25,000 from Mr. Russo . )
Mr. Sender testified Tuesday that Mr. Pellicano had wiretapped Mr. Russo for a year and had played recordings of Mr. Russo ’s intercepted phone calls for him 10 or 15 times .
But Mr. Pellicano grew sick of listening to Mr. Russo , Mr. Sender said .
And , in a “ frightening ” moment in the garden of Mr. Sender ’s mansion in Bel - Air , he said , Mr. Pellicano suggested killing Mr. Russo .

Rogers has not determined the price of the 3G device for non-qualified upgrades .
All customers will be required to sign a 3 - year agreement .
There will not be a " no commitment " price or a 2 - year agreement for the iPhone 3G .

Things to Do In Asia When You ’re Dead
If you find your well - preserved remains on display in a transparent viewing case as part of some guided tour for dignitaries , you might just be one of these former heads of state .
Ho Chi Minh , the former prime minister and president of North Vietnam , wished to be cremated with his ashes buried in the north , center , and south of Vietnam .
Instead , upon his death in 1969 , his body was embalmed , with a little help from the Soviet Union , and encased in a crystal coffin .
Visitors can see â€ œUncle Hoâ€ everyday at his mausoleum in Hanoi .
Mao Zedong , former leader of the People ’s Republic of China , also had aspirations of cremation - bliss .
But after his death in 1976 , contrary to his wishes , his mortal coil was preserved and put on display as a public attraction .
The Mao mausoleum stands in the center of Tiananmen Square in Bejing
Kim Il- sung , the North Korea founder and former leader ’s death in 1994 met with a shock wave of public grief , bordering on pandemonium , from North Korean citizens .
As befitting a â€ œGreat Leaderâ€  his immortal shell was blanketed in red and enshrined inside a clear sarcophagus .
He is viewable to the public at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang .
He is only available to foreign visitors via official government tours .
Ferdinand Marcos , former president of the Philippines , died in 1989 as an exile in Hawaii .
His corpse was refused admittance into the Philippines until 2001 ; even then his burial â€œanywhere in the Philippinesâ€ was met with vehement protest .
His cadaver is interned in a glass - viewing casket inside a refrigerated crypt at the Marco ’s family mausoleum in Batac until he can be buried with full military honors .

Returning the Golan Heights to Syria is not a popular concept in Israel Israel has passed a message to Syria that it would withdraw from the Golan Heights in return for peace , according to a Syrian government minister .
The expatriates minister , Buthaina Shaaban , said the message had been passed on by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
She said Mr Erdogan had informed the Syrian President Bashar Assad of the offer by telephone on Tuesday morning .
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has declined to comment .
Israel and Syria remain technically at war although both sides have recently spoken of their desire for peace .
The Syrian government has insisted that peace talks can be resumed only on the basis of Israel returning the Golan Heights , which it seized in 1967 .
Israeli authorities , for their part , have demanded that Syria abandon its support for Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups before any agreement .
The last peace talks between the two countries broke down in 2000 .
' Friendly parties '
In an interview with Al - Jazeera television , Ms Shaaban said the offer had come from the Israeli prime minister .
" Olmert is ready for peace with Syria on the grounds of international conditions , on the grounds of the return of the Golan Heights in full to Syria , " she said .
The Syrian newspaper , al - Watan , carried similar news on its website on Wednesday .
Mr Erdogan is due to visit the Syrian capital , Damascus , this weekend to attend the opening of the first Syrian - Turkish economic forum .
Mr Olmert 's office did not deny the Syrian reports , choosing only to state that they " refuse to comment on the matter " .
In June 2007 , Israel 's deputy prime minister confirmed his government had sent secret messages to Syria about the possibility of resuming peace negotiations through third - parties , one of whom was widely believed to be Turkey .
The Syrian reports also came only days after the President Assad told the Central Committee of the Baath Party that " friendly parties were making efforts to organise contacts between Syria and Israel " .
" Syria is in favour of a just and lasting peace .
Syria rejects any secret negotiations or contacts with Israel .
Any action taken by Syria in this area will be revealed to the public , " he said on Sunday .
' Expectations '
On Thursday , Mr Olmert told Israel 's Channel 10 television that he was interested in peace with Syria , and that both sides knew what the other wanted .
" Very clearly we want peace with the Syrians and we are taking all manner of actions to this end , " he said .
" President Bashar al - Assad knows precisely what our expectations are and we know his .
I wo n't say more . "
Mr Erdogan is due to visit the Syrian capital , Damascus , this weekend The former US President , Jimmy Carter , who held talks with the Syrian leader recently has said he believes " about 85 % " of the differences between Israel and Syria have already been resolved , including borders , water rights , the establishment of a security zone and on the presence of international forces .
" [ Mr Assad said ] the only major difference in starting good - faith talks was that Israel insisted that there will be no public acknowledgment that the talks were going on when Syria insisted that the talks would not be a secret , " Mr Carter said earlier this week .
Mr Carter said it was now " just a matter of reconvening the talks and concluding an agreement " between the neighbouring countries .
The Syrian reports on Wednesday have sparked outrage in the Israeli parliament , however , where several MPs said they would seek to accelerate the passage of a bill requiring any withdrawal from the Golan to be dependent on a referendum .
" Olmert 's readiness to withdraw from the Golan represents an unprecedented political and national abandon , " Yuval Steinitz of Likud told the Haaretz newspaper .
Correspondents say returning the Golan to Syria is not a popular concept in Israel , and the details of a possible Israeli withdrawal have bedevilled past negotiations between the two countries .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Elderly people who took commonly prescribed drugs for incontinence , allergy or high blood pressure walked more slowly and were less able to take care of themselves than others not taking the drugs , U.S. researchers said on Saturday .

They said people who took drugs that block acetylcholine -- a chemical messenger in the nervous system critical for memory -- functioned less well than their peers .
“ These results were true even in older adults who have normal memory and thinking abilities , ” said Dr. Kaycee Sink of Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina , who led the study of 3,000 people of whom 40 percent were taking more than one anticholinergic drug .
“ The effect is essentially that of a three - to four - year increase in age .
So someone who is 75 in our study and taking at least one moderately anticholinergic medication is at a similar functional level to a 78 to 79 - year - old , ” Sink said in an e-mail .
Sink ’s findings , presented at American Geriatrics Society Meeting in Washington , add to a growing body of research that suggests these so - called anticholinergic medications can hasten functional and cognitive declines in elderly people .
Some of the most common such drugs in the study included the blood pressure drug nifedipine ( sold as Adalat or Procardia ) , the stomach antacid ranitidine or Zantac , both with mild or moderate anticholinergic properties , and Pfizer Inc ’s incontinence drug tolterodine or Detrol , which is highly anticholinergic .
“ The tricky part ... is that many useful drugs from many different classes of medications have anticholinergic properties , ” Sink said .
She said in many cases newer drugs are available that do not have these effects and said doctors should look out for them for elderly patients .
MEMORY DECLINE
Dr. Jack Tsao , a neurologist with the U.S. Navy , reported last month at a American Academy of Neurology meeting that elderly people who took anticholinergic drugs had a 50 percent greater rate of memory decline than people in a long - term study who did not take the drugs .
Sink studied the effects of taking multiple anticholinergic drugs on walking speed , basic activities such as dressing , eating , taking care of personal hygiene , grooming , and harder activities like shopping , cooking and managing money on her test subjects whose average age was 78 .
The researchers found that the more anticholinergic drugs people had in their systems , the worse their physical function , based on reports from people in the study and on independent measures of their performance .
In a separate study this month in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society , Sink found that older nursing home residents who took drugs for dementia and incontinence at the same time had a 50 percent faster decline in function than those treated only for dementia .
“ I would encourage patients to bring in a list of everything they take ( even over - the - counter medications ) to their doctor and have them review it at least yearly , ” Sink said .
“ Physicians should try to decrease anticholinergic burden whenever possible . ”
This is a guest post by Roni of GreenLiteBites .
Roni has developed a successful online community , BlogToLose , to support her weight loss blog WeightWatchen .
In 2005 , I started a blog to track my weight loss progress after joining Weight Watchers .
Initially , the site was a very egocentric attempt to be accountable on my weight loss journey .
However , as I started to get some regular visitors my blog began to change .
In addition to reaching my own goals , my focus turned to helping others reach theirs .
I polled my readers , asking if they ’d be interesting in connecting with one another if I gave them a space to blog .
The response I received was and astounding “ YES ! ” .
My initial solution was WordPress MU .
If you do n’t know , MU is the multi-user version of the famous WordPress blogging platform .
Installing it was a cinch , but customizing it and managing it was a bit of a different story .
Despite the problems and time commitment , my idea worked !
I built a community of about 1600 people ( 600 blogs ) interesting in communicating , sharing experiences , changing their eating habits and losing weight .
Consequently , the traffic and popularity of my blog grew as I now had a community of people supporting it . ,
However , after a year of managing the users , the site and the SPAM , I sought out another solution .
MU was great and some of my users loved the control they had on their blogs , but overall my novice users felt intimidated and overwhelmed and I was getting burnt out supporting it all on my own .
Then , a few months ago , a friend asked if I heard of NING .
NING allows you to easily develop a robust network ( community ) with minimal or no programming .
Unlike MU there is no installation involved .
There is absolutely no upfront development to get off the ground .
A few clicks of the mouse and you have an online community shell with forums , user blogs , templates , etc .
I successfully launched the NING community 3 weeks ago and with 485 users it ’s growing faster then I ever imagined .
As suspected , my novice users are ecstatic about the easy to use interface .
However , my advanced users are a bit discontent about the loss of control on the new site .
Currently , I ’m running and managing both the orignal MU community and the new NING social network .
Both have thier pros and cons …
WordPress MU NING Installation & Set up
Need your own server space , php , mySQL Complete hosted solution with no cost for the basics User Tools Nothing beyond the base WordPress admin , unless you install or program them yourself Comes with base tool set , RSS feeds , forums , ability to create groups , user profile page with comment wall , etc. Customization Full access to open source code but must know how to program Drag and drop customization for basics but can request access to code for more advanced control Message boards
Not integrated but can install BBpress and share user database for integration .
Included but can not customize unless you request access to code Chat Not integrated Not integrated without 3rd party widget User Pages Users have control over blog and can add posts as well as pages Users have no ability to add their own pages Friends Feature Not integrated Included in basic solution Community Messaging Not Integrated Included in basic solution
Ad integration Easily include ads in community pages and user templates
Must pay monthly fee for ability to include ads SPAM control Hard to mange without installing plugins for captcha and comment spam control Integrated captcha for new user sign up Privacy Options Nothing beyond basic flag for “ I would like my blog to be visible ” Community control over access level for non-members and individual user control for thier own blogs .
Support Large user base and therefore a lot of online support and user generated plug ins .
Not as many users but online support is growing .
Overall , both solutions offer a great start for building an online community to support your blog .
MU is a great solution for those who have programming knowledge or access to programmers while NING offers a nice base of community features for those with minimal programming experience .

HANOI ( Reuters ) -
An unidentified flying object exploded in mid-air over a southern Vietnamese island , state media said Wednesday , a day after Cambodia ’s air force retracted a report of a mysterious plane crash .
The Vietnam News Agency said residents of Phu Quoc island , 10 km ( 6 miles ) off the coast of the Cambodian province of Kampot , found shards of grey metal , including one 1.5 meters ( 1.5 yards ) long .
“ The explosion happened at about 8 km ( 5 miles ) above the ground , and perhaps it was a plane , but authorities could not identify whether it was a civil or military aircraft , ” VNA said in a report headlined “ UFO explodes over Phu Quoc Island . ”
Soldiers were sent out to look for wreckage and survivors , and local authorities contacted airlines in Vietnam , Cambodia and Thailand , but received no reports of missing aircraft , the official state news agency added .
Villagers in Kampot said Tuesday that they had heard a loud explosion .
Wednesday they told Reuters they had found small chunks of metal near the coastline .
Kung Mony , deputy commander of Cambodia ’s Air Force , said Tuesday he had been told of a foreign plane crashing in Kampot province , but later backed off his claims of an aircraft accident .
Sergeant First Class William H. Ruth III contemplates his current duty in a barren landscape in Afghanistan , and says he ’s willing to lead a human mission to Mars .
An article published on Universe Today back in March of this year detailing former NASA engineer Jim McLane ’s idea for on a one - way , one - person mission to Mars generated a lot of interest .
The many comments on the subject posted here on UT and numerous other websites such as ABC News ranged from full support to complete disbelief of the idea .
McLane ’s concept has literally gone around the world , and a journalist from Spain , Javier Yanes who writes for the newspaper Publico shared with me his correspondence with a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan , who says that battle - hardened soldiers would be the perfect choice to send on a mission of no return to a new world .
SFC William H. Ruth III says he and the men in the 101st Airborne Division are ready and willing to go .
SFC Ruth wrote , “ While reading Jim McLane and Nancy Atkinson ’s thoughts on Space Colonization , I started to realize that we ALL have lost our way .
We have become so consumed by petty differences and dislikes of others that we all have forgotten our pre destiny of something better . ”
And what is the ‘ something better ’ that Ruth envisions ?
Military personnel from different countries joining together to make “ the ultimate sacrifice ” of forging the way to establish an outpost on another world , like Mars .
“ Here is an ‘ out of the box ’ idea , ” Ruth writes .
“ Let the heroes of all our countries , for once , risk the ultimate sacrifice for something greater than one man ’s idea .
Maybe once let these men and woman that rise every morning and say â€˜today I will stand for something and say ‘ evil will not prevail , not on my watch . ’
For once let them volunteer for us all , you never know , mankind , the human race .
It might just catch on if we let it . ”
Ruth continues , “ Will we falter at a hint of death or danger ?
Or will we do now what so many in all of the world ’s history has done before us .
NASA of all thinking societies should understand this .
Would there even be an America or NASA if a man named Columbus had not pursued a dangerous and possibly deadly voyage to a new world ?
He certainly had to consider whether or not he would ever return home to see all those he loved so dearly .
But what of those aboard his ships , those that left Spain knowing that they would never return .
Those few that willingly risked all for the chance at a new world and a new future , could they have possibly known what effects they would have had on the future due to their sacrifices ?
Now can we have enough vision to see our destiny , can we , for a moment , see past our petty differences of race and religion to see peace , prosperity and possibly a new world . ”
3rd Platoon at Fire Base Ter - Wa , April 2008 .
SFC Ruth is first on the left .
Ruth says 15 years in the military has prepared him for such a mission .
“ So I am no fool and I am no stranger to what some might call high risks , ” he says .
“ Hundreds of thousands of fighting men and woman from around this world have walked , rode , swam and even jumped into what some would call a high risk situation .
Some even considered suicide missions , ones with low probability of success .
And why , what did they risk all for ?
Each and every one of us , even those throughout this earth that has made that choice , risk all for what we believed would make our world better . ”
Ruth first began pondering such a mission after reading a quote by Stephen Hawking on Space.com :
“ The discovery of the New World made a profound difference on the old , ” Hawking said .
“ Spreading out into space will have an even greater effect .
It will completely change the future of the human race , and maybe determine whether we have any future at all . ”
Ruth sent an email to Space.com ’s Anthony Duignan - Cabrera , which was posted on the LiveScience blog : “ Here is an idea : Send battle - hardened , strong - minded soldiers and marines on the long trips into space .
We are conditioned to live with the bare minimal ( of ) life ’s necessities and are trained to be prepared for the worst conditions that any environment could throw at us .
Hell , me and my men will go , set up a colony somewhere and await colonists to arrive . ”
Javier Yanes read Ruth ’s proposition and contacted him , sending him the link to the Universe Today article with McLane ’s idea .
Ruth responded by sending Yanes a written statement called “ A Soldier ’s Perspective ; , ” Yanes wrote an article about Ruth in Publico , and shared Ruth ’s proposal and pictures with me .
Ruth does n’t agree with McLane ’s idea of a one - person mission to Mars , but supports the one - way idea .
“ I fully agree with NASA and others that it is completely dangerous and potentially deadly for anyone who sets out on this voyage , ” he wrote .
“ But since when has that ever stopped anyone ?
A one way trip is the way to go about this , it is a proven fact of human history that when the human species is thrown into a no alternative situation , that they will prevail and survive .
The military would never send someone out alone , and Ruth thinks a multiple ship mission is the way to proceed , with three to four smaller vessels , with four to six crew members each .
Ruth admits that other might see sending soldiers into space as more like an invasion or occupation than exploration .
“ To those who share this concern , consider this for a moment and ask yourself , who else ? ” Ruth asked .
“ Who else has the mentality to volunteer to face certain danger and possibly death , thousands of miles away from their homes ?
I could think of a few hundred thousand that do it everyday across this planet . ”
Ruth says that getting the worlds militarys involved with something other than making war with each other could change humanity ’s future for the better .
“ I wonder who will be the first to extend the hand of complete partnership , representing the whole human species ? ”
Ruth asks .
“ Could this be the answer that so many have searched for ?
Could this one thing unite humanity in a new era of global cooperation and a new planetary respect for human life , unlike we know it today ?
My answer is ask me again when I ’ve reached the new world ! ”
From the man who has sent an occupation force to another country with no feasible exit - strategy and thus its own budgetary concerns , comes this gem of a quote ; “ I urge the Congress to be very careful about running up enormous costs for future generations of Americans . ”
George W. Bush – as if you had n’t guessed that already – continued by saying that “ We ’ll work with the Congress , but the idea of a huge spending bill fueled by tax increases is n’t the right way to proceed . ”
This hypocritical posturing by a man , who is now less than a lame - duck president , comes in response to a bill that will be up for debate much of this week in the US Senate .
The bill calls for legislation that will cut carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by approximately 70 % by 2050 , from power plants , refineries and transportation .
And though no one really expects the bill to look the same by the end of this week , compared to its introductory stage , both Democrats and Republicans are eager to debate the issue of climate change .
Not surprisingly , outside opposition is already stirring , with news agencies once again looking to the petition created by the late Frederick Seitz in response to the Kyoto Protocol , and reissued in 2007 by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine .
So far , according to the petition ’s website , there are over 31,000 American scientists that have signed the petition .
They are agreeing to the statement that ‘ The proposed limits on greenhouse gases [ proposed by the Kyoto protocol ] would harm the environment , hinder the advance of science and technology , and damage the health and welfare of mankind . ’
It goes on to state ;
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earth ’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth ’s climate .
Moreover , there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth . ’
This petition always creates a lot of news , based on the amount of people that have signed the petition .
However we have already seen in the past that not everyone who is listed as having signed a petition has actually done so .
Nor can we validate the signees , what their specialty is or anything .
For all we know there could be a group of dentists who dislike global warming .
Either way , anyone who claims that there is a consensus of opinion or information on humans creating the current warming climate , is definitely pushing an agenda .
THE subject of this Essay is not the so - called Liberty of the Will , so unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Necessity ; but Civil , or Social Liberty : the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual .
A question seldom stated , and hardly ever discussed , in general terms , but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence , and is likely soon to make itself recognized as the vital question of the future .
It is so far from being new , that , in a certain sense , it has divided mankind , almost from the remotest ages , but in the stage of progress into which the more civilized portions of the species have now entered , it presents itself under new conditions , and requires a different and more fundamental treatment .
The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar , particularly in that of Greece , Rome , and England .
But in old times this contest was between subjects , or some classes of subjects , and the government .
By liberty , was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers .
The rulers were conceived ( except in some of the popular governments of Greece ) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled .
They consisted of a governing One , or a governing tribe or caste , who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest ; who , at all events , did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed , and whose supremacy men did not venture , perhaps did not desire , to contest , whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise .
Their power was regarded as necessary , but also as highly dangerous ; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects , no less than against external enemies .
To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures , it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest , commissioned to keep them down .
But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying upon the flock than any of the minor harpies , it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws .
The aim , therefore , of patriots , was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community ; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty .
It was attempted in two ways .
First , by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities , called political liberties or rights , which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe , and which , if he did infringe , specific resistance , or general rebellion , was held to be justifiable .
A second , and generally a later expedient , was the establishment of constitutional checks ; by which the consent of the community , or of a body of some sort supposed to represent its interests , was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power .
To the first of these modes of limitation , the ruling power , in most European countries , was compelled , more or less , to submit .
It was not so with the second ; and to attain this , or when already in some degree possessed , to attain it more completely , became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty .
And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another , and to be ruled by a master , on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny , they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point .
A time , however , came in the progress of human affairs , when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an independent power , opposed in interest to themselves .
It appeared to them much better that the various magistrates of the State should be their tenants or delegates , revocable at their pleasure .
In that way alone , it seemed , could they have complete security that the powers of government would never be abused to their disadvantage .
By degrees , this new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object of the exertions of the popular party , wherever any such party existed ; and superseded , to a considerable extent , the previous efforts to limit the power of rulers .
As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled , some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself .
That ( it might seem ) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people .
What was now wanted was , that the rulers should be identified with the people ; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation .
The nation did not need to be protected against its own will .
There was no fear of its tyrannizing over itself .
Let the rulers be effectually responsible to it , promptly removable by it , and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made .
Their power was but the nation 's own power , concentrated , and in a form convenient for exercise .
This mode of thought , or rather perhaps of feeling , was common among the last generation of European liberalism , in the Continental section of which , it still apparently predominates .
Those who admit any limit to what a government may do , except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist , stand out as brilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the Continent .
A similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country , if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it had continued unaltered .
But , in political and philosophical theories , as well as in persons , success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from observation .
The notion , that the people have no need to limit their power over themselves , might seem axiomatic , when popular government was a thing only dreamed about , or read of as having existed at some distant period of the past .
Neither was that notion necessarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the French Revolution , the worst of which were the work of an usurping few , and which , in any case , belonged , not to the permanent working of popular institutions , but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchical and aristocratic despotism .
In time , however , a democratic republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth 's surface , and made itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations ; and elective and responsible government became subject to the observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact .
It was now perceived that such phrases as " self - government , " and " the power of the people over themselves , " do not express the true state of the case .
The " people " who exercise the power , are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised , and the " self - government " spoken of , is not the government of each by himself , but of each by all the rest .
The will of the people , moreover , practically means , the will of the most numerous or the most active part of the people ; the majority , or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority ; the people , consequently , may desire to oppress a part of their number ; and precautions are as much needed against this , as against any other abuse of power .
The limitation , therefore , of the power of government over individuals , loses none of its importance when the holders of power are regularly accountable to the community , that is , to the strongest party therein .
This view of things , recommending itself equally to the intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse , has had no difficulty in establishing itself ; and in political speculations " the tyranny of the majority " is now generally included among the evils against which society requires to be on its guard .
Like other tyrannies , the tyranny of the majority was at first , and is still vulgarly , held in dread , chiefly as operating through the acts of the public authorities .
But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyran -- society collectively , over the separate individuals who compose it -- its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries .
Society can and does execute its own mandates : and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right , or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle , it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression , since , though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties , it leaves fewer means of escape , penetrating much more deeply into the details of life , and enslaving the soul itself .
Protection , therefore , against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough ; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling ; against the tendency of society to impose , by other means than civil penalties , its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them ; to fetter the development , and , if possible , prevent the formation , of any individuality not in harmony with its ways , and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own .
There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence ; and to find that limit , and maintain it against encroachment , is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs , as protection against political despotism .
But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general terms , the practical question , where to place the limit -- how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control -- is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done .
All that makes existence valuable to any one , depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people .
Some rules of conduct , therefore , must be imposed , by law in the first place , and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law .
What these rules should be , is the principal question in human affairs ; but if we except a few of the most obvious cases , it is one of those which least progress has been made in resolving .
No two ages , and scarcely any two countries , have decided it alike ; and the decision of one age or country is a wonder to another .
Yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it , than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed .
The rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self - evident and self - justifying .
This all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom , which is not only , as the proverb says a second nature , but is continually mistaken for the first .
The effect of custom , in preventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on one another , is all the more complete because the subject is one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be given , either by one person to others , or by each to himself .
People are accustomed to believe and have been encouraged in the belief by some who aspire to the character of philosophers , that their feelings , on subjects of this nature , are better than reasons , and render reasons unnecessary .
The practical principle which guides them to their opinions on the regulation of human conduct , is the feeling in each person 's mind that everybody should be required to act as he , and those with whom he sympathizes , would like them to act .
No one , indeed , acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking ; but an opinion on a point of conduct , not supported by reasons , can only count as one person 's preference ; and if the reasons , when given , are a mere appeal to a similar preference felt by other people , it is still only many people 's liking instead of one .
To an ordinary man , however , his own preference , thus supported , is not only a perfectly satisfactory reason , but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality , taste , or propriety , which are not expressly written in his religious creed ; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that .
Men 's opinions , accordingly , on what is laudable or blamable , are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others , and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject .
Sometimes their reason -- at other times their prejudices or superstitions : often their social affections , not seldom their anti-social ones , their envy or jealousy , their arrogance or contemptuousness : but most commonly , their desires or fears for themselves -- their legitimate or illegitimate self - interest .
Wherever there is an ascendant class , a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests , and its feelings of class superiority .
The morality between Spartans and Helots , between planters and negroes , between princes and subjects , between nobles and roturiers , between men and women , has been for the most part the creation of these class interests and feelings : and the sentiments thus generated , react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class , in their relations among themselves .
Where , on the other hand , a class , formerly ascendant , has lost its ascendency , or where its ascendency is unpopular , the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority .
Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct , both in act and forbearance which have been enforced by law or opinion , has been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters , or of their gods .
This servility though essentially selfish , is not hypocrisy ; it gives rise to perfectly genuine sentiments of abhorrence ; it made men burn magicians and heretics .
Among so many baser influences , the general and obvious interests of society have of course had a share , and a large one , in the direction of the moral sentiments : less , however , as a matter of reason , and on their own account , than as a consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out of them : and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society , have made themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great force .
The likings and dislikings of society , or of some powerful portion of it , are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules laid down for general observance , under the penalties of law or opinion .
And in general , those who have been in advance of society in thought and feeling , have left this condition of things unassailed in principle , however they may have come into conflict with it in some of its details .
They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what things society ought to like or dislike , than in questioning whether its likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals .
They preferred endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points on which they were themselves heretical , rather than make common cause in defence of freedom , with heretics generally .
The only case in which the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with consistency , by any but an individual here and there , is that of religious belief : a case instructive in many ways , and not least so as forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called the moral sense : for the odium theologicum , in a sincere bigot , is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling .
Those who first broke the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church , were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself .
But when the heat of the conflict was over , without giving a complete victory to any party , and each church or sect was reduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already occupied ; minorities , seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities , were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they could not convert , for permission to differ .
It is accordingly on this battle - field , almost solely , that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle , and the claim of society to exercise authority over dissentients openly controverted .
The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses , have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right , and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religious belief .
Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in whatever they really care about , that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practically realized , except where religious indifference , which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels , has added its weight to the scale .
In the minds of almost all religious persons , even in the most tolerant countries , the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves .
One person will bear with dissent in matters of church government , but not of dogma ; another can tolerate everybody , short of a Papist or an Unitarian ; another , every one who believes in revealed religion ; a few extend their charity a little further , but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state .
Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense , it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed .
In England , from the peculiar circumstances of our political history , though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier , that of law is lighter , than in most other countries of Europe ; and there is considerable jealousy of direct interference , by the legislative or the executive power with private conduct ; not so much from any just regard for the independence of the individual , as from the still subsisting habit of looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the public .
The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government their power , or its opinions their opinions .
When they do so , individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government , as it already is from public opinion .
But , as yet , there is a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it ; and this with very little discrimination as to whether the matter is , or is not , within the legitimate sphere of legal control ; insomuch that the feeling , highly salutary on the whole , is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particular instances of its application .
There is , in fact , no recognized principle by which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is customarily tested .
People decide according to their personal preferences .
Some , whenever they see any good to be done , or evil to be remedied , would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business ; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil , rather than add one to the departments of human interests amenable to governmental control .
And men range themselves on one or the other side in any particular case , according to this general direction of their sentiments ; or according to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the government should do ; or according to the belief they entertain that the government would , or would not , do it in the manner they prefer ; but very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere , as to what things are fit to be done by a government .
And it seems to me that , in consequence of this absence of rule or principle , one side is at present as often wrong as the other ; the interference of government is , with about equal frequency , improperly invoked and improperly condemned .
The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle , as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control , whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties , or the moral coercion of public opinion .
That principle is , that the sole end for which mankind are warranted , individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number , is self - protection .
That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others .
His own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant .
He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so , because it will make him happier , because , in the opinions of others , to do so would be wise , or even right .
These are good reasons for remonstrating with him , or reasoning with him , or persuading him , or entreating him , but not for compelling him , or visiting him with any evil , in case he do otherwise .
To justify that , the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else .
The only part of the conduct of any one , for which he is amenable to society , is that which concerns others .
In the part which merely concerns himself , his independence is , of right , absolute .
Over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign .
It is , perhaps , hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties .
We are not speaking of children , or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood .
Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others , must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury .
For the same reason , we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage .
The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great , that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them ; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end , perhaps otherwise unattainable .
Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians , provided the end be their improvement , and the means justified by actually effecting that end .
Liberty , as a principle , has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion .
Until then , there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne , if they are so fortunate as to find one .
But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion ( a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves ) , compulsion , either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance , is no longer admissible as a means to their own good , and justifiable only for the security of others .
It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing independent of utility .
I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions ; but it must be utility in the largest sense , grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being .
Those interests , I contend , authorize the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control , only in respect to those actions of each , which concern the interest of other people .
If any one does an act hurtful to others , there is a prima facie case for punishing him , by law , or , where legal penalties are not safely applicable , by general disapprobation .
There are also many positive acts for the benefit of others , which he may rightfully be compelled to perform ; such as , to give evidence in a court of justice ; to bear his fair share in the common defence , or in any other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection ; and to perform certain acts of individual beneficence , such as saving a fellow - creature 's life , or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill - usage , things which whenever it is obviously a man 's duty to do , he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing .
A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction , and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury .
The latter case , it is true , requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former .
To make any one answerable for doing evil to others , is the rule ; to make him answerable for not preventing evil , is , comparatively speaking , the exception .
Yet there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception .
In all things which regard the external relations of the individual , he is de jure amenable to those whose interests are concerned , and if need be , to society as their protector .
There are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility ; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case : either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act better , when left to his own discretion , than when controlled in any way in which society have it in their power to control him ; or because the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils , greater than those which it would prevent .
When such reasons as these preclude the enforcement of responsibility , the conscience of the agent himself should step into the vacant judgment - seat , and protect those interests of others which have no external protection ; judging himself all the more rigidly , because the case does not admit of his being made accountable to the judgment of his fellow - creatures .
But there is a sphere of action in which society , as distinguished from the individual , has , if any , only an indirect interest ; comprehending all that portion of a person 's life and conduct which affects only himself , or , if it also affects others , only with their free , voluntary , and undeceived consent and participation .
When I say only himself , I mean directly , and in the first instance : for whatever affects himself , may affect others through himself ; and the objection which may be grounded on this contingency , will receive consideration in the sequel .
This , then , is the appropriate region of human liberty .
It comprises , first , the inward domain of consciousness ; demanding liberty of conscience , in the most comprehensive sense ; liberty of thought and feeling ; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects , practical or speculative , scientific , moral , or theological .
The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle , since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people ; but , being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself , and resting in great part on the same reasons , is practically inseparable from it .
Secondly , the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits ; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character ; of doing as we like , subject to such consequences as may follow ; without impediment from our fellow - creatures , so long as what we do does not harm them even though they should think our conduct foolish , perverse , or wrong .
Thirdly , from this liberty of each individual , follows the liberty , within the same limits , of combination among individuals ; freedom to unite , for any purpose not involving harm to others : the persons combining being supposed to be of full age , and not forced or deceived .
No society in which these liberties are not , on the whole , respected , is free , whatever may be its form of government ; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified .
The only freedom which deserves the name , is that of pursuing our own good in our own way , so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs , or impede their efforts to obtain it .
Each is the proper guardian of his own health , whether bodily , or mental or spiritual .
Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves , than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest .
Though this doctrine is anything but new , and , to some persons , may have the air of a truism , there is no doctrine which stands more directly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice .
Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt ( according to its lights ) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal , as of social excellence .
The ancient commonwealths thought themselves entitled to practise , and the ancient philosophers countenanced , the regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority , on the ground that the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens , a mode of thinking which may have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies , in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion , and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self - command might so easily be fatal , that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom .
In the modern world , the greater size of political communities , and above all , the separation between the spiritual and temporal authority ( which placed the direction of men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldly affairs ) , prevented so great an interference by law in the details of private life ; but the engines of moral repression have been wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self - regarding , than even in social matters ; religion , the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling , having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy , seeking control over every department of human conduct , or by the spirit of Puritanism .
And some of those modern reformers who have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past , have been nowhere behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right of spiritual domination : M. Compte , in particular , whose social system , as unfolded in his Trait de Politique Positive , aims at establishing ( though by moral more than by legal appliances ) a despotism of society over the individual , surpassing anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers .
Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers , there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual , both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation : and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society , and diminish the power of the individual , this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear , but , on the contrary , to grow more and more formidable .
The disposition of mankind , whether as rulers or as fellow - citizens , to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others , is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature , that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power ; and as the power is not declining , but growing , unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief , we must expect , in the present circumstances of the world , to see it increase .
It will be convenient for the argument , if , instead of at once entering upon the general thesis , we confine ourselves in the first instance to a single branch of it , on which the principle here stated is , if not fully , yet to a certain point , recognized by the current opinions .
This one branch is the Liberty of Thought : from which it is impossible to separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing .
Although these liberties , to some considerable amount , form part of the political morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free institutions , the grounds , both philosophical and practical , on which they rest , are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind , nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion , as might have been expected .
Those grounds , when rightly understood , are of much wider application than to only one division of the subject , and a thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the best introduction to the remainder .
Those to whom nothing which I am about to say will be new , may therefore , I hope , excuse me , if on a subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed , I venture on one discussion more .

GLOSSARY

The NBA announced to its teams this week at its annual pre-draft camp that fines will be imposed on players starting next season for clear cases of " flopping , " ESPN.com has learned .
The league office has yet to determine exact fine amounts for offending flops and how fines might escalate for repeat offenders , but in - game arena observers and video reviewers will be instructed to report instances of theatrical flopping for potential punishment as part of postgame reports on officiating and other matters .
The league 's pledge to crack down on flopping was conveyed to team representatives at Tuesday 's competition committee meeting in Orlando .
NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Stu Jackson confirmed the new policy Wednesday night saying : " What was clearly expressed to the committee is that we would begin imposing fines next season for the most egregious type of flops .
When players are taking a dive , for lack of a better term . "
The Cavs' Anderson Varejao , left , may be fined next season if his actions are found to be a clear case of flopping .

Because a precise penalty system has not yet been structured , it is not yet known whether serial floppers will be subject to possible suspensions after a certain number of fines for flopping , as seen with the league 's protocol on technical fouls .
Players who accrue 16 technicals during the regular season are hit with a one - game suspension when they get to No. 16 -- the limit is seven technicals during the playoffs -- and receive one - game suspensions for every other technical thereafter ( No. 18 , 20 , etc . ) .
Detroit's Rasheed Wallace , a player who has 15 technicals this season and has been suspended in the past for being over the limit for technicals , gave his opinion of floppers to ESPN after the Pistons ' 106 - 102 loss to the Boston Celtics in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals on Wednesday .
" All that bull [ expletive ] - ass calls they had out there .
With Mike [ Callahan ] and Kenny [ Mauer ] -- you 've all seen that [ expletive ] , " Wallace said .
" You saw them calls .
The cats are flopping all over the floor and they 're calling that [ expletive ] .
That [ expletive ] ai n't basketball out there .
It 's all [ expletive ] entertainment .
You all should know that [ expletive ] .
It 's all [ expletive ] entertainment . "
In other Orlando business :
• The competition committee considered changes to both the current playoff seeding format as well as the format for the draft lottery but ruled against recommending alterations to either .
Both subjects will be discussed again at the next board of governors meeting in October , but changes typically are n't made by team owners at those meetings without a prior recommendation from the competition committee .
After another season of great imbalance between teams in the West and East , league officials agreed in April to consider changes that could be implemented in time for next season 's playoffs .
But NBA commissioner David Stern said from the start that " it 's unlikely anything will happen . "
The current system sends the top eight teams in each conference to the postseason .
That excluded No. 9 Golden State in the West in spite of the Warriors ' 48 - win season and forced two 55 - win perennial powers -- San Antonio and Phoenix -- to meet in the first round .
The West 's dominance -- and the fact that only three teams in the East ( Boston , Detroit and Orlando ) had a higher win total than Golden State -- led to a new round of calls for re-seeding after each round of the playoffs , as seen in other major professional team sports , or even sending the teams with the best 16 records to the playoffs irrespective of conference .
But Stern has long maintained that re-seeding is " very difficult when you have the television obligations that we have " because the league 's TV partners ( ESPN and TNT ) would then be required " to wait for every series that can affect the re-seeding to be over . "
The commissioner has also said that he 's comfortable with the idea of a lower seed inheriting the playoff path of a higher seed if it can win a seven - game series .
There is also naturally considerable opposition from teams in the East to sending the clubs with the 16 best records to the playoffs .
The current format enabled several sub -.500 teams this season -- such as Indiana , New Jersey and Chicago -- to stay in playoff contention well into April , giving them something to sell to their fan bases in spite of subpar records and constant reminders from the media about the West 's superior depth .
Making overall record its primary playoff consideration would also likely force the league to change the format of its entire regular - season schedule .
West teams would have a valid complaint if the 16 - team playoff field was determined strictly by record and East teams retained the advantage of playing 52 games against other East teams and only 30 against West teams .
There was likewise no consensus reached by committee members on tweaking the draft lottery .
Grumblings about the current system have grown louder with Chicago ( ninth - worst record in the league ) and Portland ( sixth - worst record in 2006 - 07 ) winning the past two lotteries , but Stern is said to be strongly against any lottery changes .
• As Stern promised earlier this month , changes were considered by the committee to the league 's rules regarding intentional fouling away from the ball , which is more commonly known as the Hack - A - Shaq strategy .
Yet it appears that Hack - A - Shaq will be back next season , too .
Stern himself has said he does n't like " the idea that [ players can say ] , ' Hey , look at me , I 'm going to hit this guy as soon as the ball goes into play , even though he 's standing under the other basket . ' "
San Antonio made extensive use of the Hack - A - Shaq tactic in its first - round series with Phoenix after Spurs coach Gregg Popovich had shunned the strategy for years .
The Suns later conceded that the strategy not only took advantage of Shaquille O'Neal 's poor foul shooting -- he missed half of his 64 free - throw attempts in the series -- but also frequently interrupted their offensive flow .
Such intentional fouling is legal until the final two minutes of regulation or any overtime , when intentional fouls result in one free throw and the team whose player was fouled retaining possession .
" We had a pretty spirited discussion on the subject and we talked prospectively about how we might change it , " Jackson said , declining to elaborate on the potential alterations .
" But in the end , there was n't enough support to change it .
There was a feeling that by changing the rule you would be essentially rewarding a player for a lack of skill by allowing him to stay in the game . "
• The committee had extensive discussions about expanding the use of instant replay for next season and voted to recommend a proposal which calls for the use of replay to assist referees in determining whether a basket or a shot on which a player is fouled is taken from behind the 3 - point line .
The committee , as expected , is also backing the league 's wish to use instant replay to resolve discrepancies on clock malfunctions , after a major clock issue during the Detroit - Orlando series in the second round .
The league was forced to admit earlier this month that a 3 - pointer made by the Pistons ' Chauncey Billups at the end of the third quarter of Game 2 against Orlando should not have counted .
There were 5.1 seconds remaining in the quarter when the ball was inbounded , but the clock froze at 4.8 seconds as Billups dribbled into the frontcourt .
The whole play actually consumed 5.7 seconds , meaning that the buzzer should have sounded before Billups ' shot went up , but the play was not reviewable under current rules .
Referees are presently allowed to use instant replay only to rule whether a shot goes in before the end - of - quarter clock expires .
" We still need to refine the procedures involved , but it 's expected that board of governors will vote on those proposals [ in October ] , " Jackson said .

KUN WAN , Myanmar 
They paddle for hours on the stormy river , or carry their sick parents on their backs through the mud and rain , traveling for miles to reach the one source of help they can rely on : Buddhist monks .
At a makeshift clinic in this village near Bogale , an Irrawaddy Delta town 75 miles southwest of Yangon , hundreds of villagers left destitute by Cyclone Nargis arrive each day seeking the assistance they have not received from the government or international aid workers .
Since the cyclone , the Burmese have been growing even closer to the monks while their alienation from the junta grows .
This development bodes ill for the government , which brutally cracked down on thousands of monks who took to the streets last September appealing to the ruling generals to improve conditions for the people .
The May 3 cyclone left more than 134,000 dead or missing and 2.4 million survivors grappling with hunger and homelessness .
This week , some of them who had taken shelter at monasteries or gathered on roadsides were being displaced again , this time by the junta , which wants them to stop being an embarrassment to the government and return to their villages “ for reconstruction . ”
On Friday , United Nations officials said that refugees were also being evicted from government - run camps .

What 's sixteen feet tall and 9,550 years old ?
It ’s the world 's oldest tree .
The worn and weathered spruce grows in Sweden 's windswept tundra .
But , until recently , well , recent to the tree at least , it barely resembled a tree at all .
Before this last warm century , the spruce grew more like a shrub to survive the harsh conditions of its cold landscape .
But rising temperatures convinced the tree to give up its shabby lifestyle , shed the majority of its needles and go with the single - trunk look .
Researchers from Sweden 's Umea University found the tree growing amid the remains of four generations of spruce dating from 375 to well over 9,000 years old .
Spruce trees can clone themselves by sending new trees up through the ground from established roots .
When the scientists tested the current tree , they found it was genetically identical with the remains of all four previous generations .
Researchers are excited about having a 10,000 - year - long case study of how past climate changes affected plant growth and productivity .
It ’s a finding sure to spruce up all of botany .

Veterans for Peace — 16 May 2008 — by Elliott Adams —
“ History shows that nearly every impeachment effort at the federal level has taken less time than what still remains in George Bush ’s term of office .
Will history also show that the House Committee on the Judiciary did its duty to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies , foreign and domestic ? ” — ST .
LOUIS — IN A STRONGLY WORDED LETTER TO HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN JOHN CONYERS , THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION , VETERANS FOR PEACE , CHALLENGED CONGRESS to do its duty to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
Accompanying Elliott Adams ’ letter were petitions signed by over 10,000 people , plus substantial documentation of the myriad impeach offenses of the Bush administration .
“ Our petition focuses on what veterans are understandably concerned about : violations of the Geneva Conventions , the U.N. Charter and resolutions , the Nuremberg Principles , and the Laws and Customs of War on Land , which limit the conduct of military forces towards each other and civilian populations . ”
NEW DELHI : For the first time ever , Islamic seminary Darul - Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa against terrorism on Saturday , stating Islam had come to wipe out all kinds of terrorism and to spread the message of global peace .
The Darul - Uloom had denounced terrorism for the first time in February , but had not issued a fatwa so far .
)
Saturday���s fatwa , signed by Darul - Uloom���s grand mufti Habibur Rehman , asserts that " Islam rejects all kinds of unjust violence , breach of peace , bloodshed , murder and plunder and does not allow it in any form " .
Citing the " sinister campaign " to malign " Islamic faith ... by linking terrorism with Islam and distorting the meanings of Quranic Verses and Prophet traditions " , Mahmood Asad Madani , leader of Jamiat Ulema - e - Hind , had wanted Deoband to spell out the stand of Islam on world peace .
The fatwa , issued before a huge gathering of Muslims in Delhi���s Ramlila Ground for the Anti-Terrorism and Global Peace Conference , went on to say , " It is proved from clear guidelines provided in the Holy Quran that allegations of terrorism against a religion which preaches and guarantees world peace is nothing but a lie .
The religion of Islam has come to wipe out all kinds of terrorism and to spread the message of global peace .
Allah knows the best . "
The conference was addressed by Jamiat chief and Darul - Uloom���s deputy rector Hazrat Maulana Qari Sayed Mohammed Usman .
He called the conference historic as Muslims of different sects and ideologies ��� including Nadwatul Ulama Lucknow , Jamaat - e - Islami Hind and All India Muslim Personal Law Board ��� ratified the fatwa against terrorism .
The exclusively - male turnout that read an " oath of allegiance " to the fatwa cheered most lustily as speakers attacked the US .
Jamiat Ulema-e - Hind leader Madani , an MP , stated that the fatwa should be welcomed by the entire Islamic world .
" Killing of innocent people is not compatible with Islam .
The biggest challenge faced by us today is terrorism ( which ) threatens to strike at the very root of the secular structure of our society besides causing irreparable loss , " stated Madani .
Notwithstanding the caveats like " unjust " and " innocent " , which may make it appear falling short of an
unequivocal condemnation of terrorism , the fatwa is viewed by many as a significant step forward towards rallying the public opinion against terrorism .
Coming after the February 25 denunciation , it is seen as reflective of the growing recognition on the part of clerics to counter misgivings about interpretations of scriptures .
Deoband has lately been under intense focus because many of the terrorist groups ��� from Taliban to Jaish and Harkat ��� are widely perceived to be Deobandi in orientation .
However , it was when the deputy rector of Deoband , Usman , came down heavily on " the dual policy of America " that the massive crowds cheered the most .
" Whenever Christian and American interests are hurt in any part of the world , they take prompt action to set things right even at the cost of human lives .
They maintain silence though when Muslims are the victims , " he said , further criticizing the US for its support to Israel .
According to Usman , Jamiat recently held a series of conferences and meetings with madrassas in Lucknow , Ahmedabad , Hyderabad , Kanpur , Surat , Varanasi and Kolkata to carry forward the anti-terror movement which was initiated at Deoband in February .
Usman said that many people , especially in the West , were carrying out a propaganda that terrorism was synonymous with jehad .
He said that while terrorism is destructive , jehad is constructive .
" Terrorism is the gravest crime as held by Quran and Islam .
We are not prepared to tolerate terrorism in any form and we are ready to cooperate with all responsible people , " he said .
Figure 1 : Cars are represented by the black dots and travel clockwise around the track .
The ith vehicle follows the ( i+1 ) th vehicle and the nth car follows the 1st .
Traffic jams often occur for seemingly no reason , especially when you are going somewhere in a hurry .
It is a common occurrence on busy roads to be brought to a stand - still when there is no ostensible cause for the delay .
Mathematicians from the Universities of Exeter , Bristol and Budapest have developed a model of traffic behaviour that explains how an unexpected event as simple as a car changing lanes , or a van braking suddenly , can bring traffic to a grinding halt kilometres behind the incident .
They have recently published their work in Proceedings of the Royal Society .
Their model suggests that when reacting to an unexpected event , drivers may slow down to below a critical speed , which then forces the car behind it to slow down further still .
Eventually , cars further back in the queue must stop .
This produces a wave travelling backwards from the point of disturbance .
The modelling is based on bifurcation theory , which studies how and when mathematical problems change from having only one possible solution to having many .
Parameter values at which this change occurs are known as bifurcation points .
In the traffic example , the important parameter is the average headway between cars on the road : if this value is large , then small incidents do not cause the system to change significantly .
However , if it is too small , the cars do not have enough time to react to an incident and a stop - and - go wave can develop throughout the traffic .
The model uses a circular road of length L , around which n cars travel .
The group suggests that this could be interpreted as traffic on a circular road around a large city such as the M25 around London .
The cars and drivers are assumed to be identical , the ith vehicle follows the ( i+1 ) th vehicle and the nth car follows the 1st .
This can be seen in Figure 1 .
The model uses a differential equation that relates the motion of the cars to the headway :
whereis the position of caris the length of the track , andare the time derivatives of — velocity and acceleration — andis a known sensitivity factor .is the knownand depends on the headway between carand the one in front : .
As the cars are travelling in a circle ,
The team considered solutions for car position and velocity with regard to the headway parameter , and identified parameter values at which bifurcations occurred .
Some variation in traffic speed can be absorbed by the system to maintain smooth traffic flow , however if the average headway is too small , the system no longer has the single steady flow solution in which the velocity of the cars remains smooth and above zero , but two solutions : a steady flow solution and one in which the traffic is stop - start and vehicle velocities periodically drop to zero .
This second solution produces a stop - and - go wave .
Such a backward travelling wave can die out by itself , or get worse , ending up as a persistent stop - and - go wave that travels around the whole circle .
The group predicts this behaviour on busy highways with more than 15 cars per kilometre .
Heavy traffic does not automatically lead to congestion , but the model suggests , as every driving instructor teaches , that drivers should give themselves enough headway to react to an unforeseen event so that they do not have to slow down too suddenly .
The authors suggest that overhead gantries on freeways could display temporary and variable speed limits that , if followed by the traffic , would overcome jams and return the traffic to uniform flow .
The MIDAS system installed on the M25 motorway around London is currently able to provide this information to drivers .
The team now plans to expand on the model and incorporate cars fitted with new electronic devices that increase reaction time and so cut down on over - braking .
As chief executive officer of Microsoft , William H. ( Bill ) Gates is considered one of the driving forces behind today ’s personal computing and office automation industry .
Gates started his career in computer software at a young age .
Both Gates and Microsoft co-founder , Paul Allen , worked as programming consultants while attending high school in Seattle , Washington .
In 1974 , Gates , then an undergraduate at Harvard University , worked with Allen to develop a BASIC programming language for the first commercial microcomputer , the MITS Altair .
After the successful completion of this project , the two formed Microsoft to develop and market software for the emerging microcomputer marketplace .
Microsoft has set standards for the software industry in languages , operating systems , and application software .
Gates has provided the vision for the company ’s new product ideas and technologies .
He also provides hands - on guidance to the technology groups that develop new products , devoting his time to reviewing and refining the software that Microsoft sells .
Gates is a native of the Seattle , Washington area and resides there today .
He was born in 1955 .
INTERVIEWER :
You obviously have a lot of responsibilities as chief executive officer of Microsoft .
Do you still program ?
GATES : No , I do n’t .
I still help design algorithms and basic approaches , and sometimes I look at code .
But since I worked on the IBM PC BASIC and the Model 100 , I have n’t had a chance to actually create a program myself .
INTERVIEWER :
What kind of role do you play in the development of programs at Microsoft ?
GATES : I do two key things .
One is to choose features to put into programs .
To do that , you have to have a reasonable understanding of what ’s easy and what ’s not easy to do .
You also have to understand what sort of product “ family ” strategy you ’re pursuing , and what ’s happening with the hardware .
I also work on the best way to implement that new feature , so that it will be small and fast .
For example , I wrote a memo about how to design and implement a feature we used on Excel to make the program recalculate the formulas every time the screen changes .
In the first four years of the company , there was no Microsoft program that I was n’t involved in actually writing and designing .
In all those initial products , whether it was BASIC , FORTRAN , BASIC 6800 , or BASIC 6502 , not a line of code went out that I did n’t look over .
But now we have about 160 programmers , so I mostly do reviews of products and algorithms .
INTERVIEWER :
What do you consider your greatest achievement ever in programming ?
GATES : I ’d have to say BASIC for the 8080 , because of the effect it ’s had , and because of how appropriate it was at the time , and because we managed to get it so small .
It was the original program we wrote when we decided to start Microsoft .
Three of us knew that original program by heart .
We got a chance to completely rewrite it one summer down in Albuquerque , and I thought we could save a few bytes and tighten things up .
We just tuned the program very , very carefully , and ended up with a 4 K BASIC interpreter .
When you know a program that well , you feel that nobody can look at the code and say , “ There ’s a better way to do this . ”
That feeling ’s really nice , and the fact that the program was used on a lot of machines makes it an exciting program to have written .
I also feel really good about the software on the Model 100 , especially about how we squeezed in a very useful small editor .
I worked with Jey Suzuki , a Japanese programmer , to put that together .
We had very limited time to finish the project .
When you do software that gets burned into ROM , you do n’t get an opportunity to make mistakes .
INTERVIEWER :
What do you consider the most difficult part of computer programming ?
GATES : The hardest part is deciding what the algorithms are , and then simplifying them as much as you can .
It ’s difficult to get things down to their simplest forms .
You have to simulate in your mind how the program ’s going to work , and you have to have a complete grasp of how the various pieces of the program work together .
The finest pieces of software are those where one individual has a complete sense of exactly how the program works .
To have that , you have to really love the program and concentrate on keeping it simple , to an incredible degree .
INTERVIEWER : With computers increasing so much in power and memory , are programs becoming more complex , or just sloppier ?
How is that affecting the way people write programs ?
GATES : We ’re no longer in the days where every program is super well crafted .
But at the heart of the programs that make it to the top , you ’ll find that the key internal code was done by a few people who really knew what they were doing .
It ’s not quite as important now to squeeze things down into a 4 K memory area .
You ’re seeing a lot more cases where people can afford to use C , instead of using assembly language .
Unfortunately , many programs are so big that there is no one individual who really knows all the pieces , and so the amount of code sharing you get is n’t as great .
Also , the opportunity to go back and really rewrite something is n’t quite as great , because there ’s always a new set of features that you ’re adding on to the same program .
The worst programs are the ones where the programmers doing the original work do n’t lay a solid foundation , and then they ’re not involved in the program in the future .
Working with those programs gets to the point that I call “ experimental programming . ”
The programmers understand so little about those programs that they can’t understand how changes might affect speed , for instance .
They might use code that already exists , or they might not understand what dependencies will break if they change something .
So they add new code , and then they run it and they say , “ Oh look , it does n’t work that way . ”
That ’s a very , very inefficient way to deal with a program , but a lot of projects end up exactly like that .
INTERVIEWER :
In a company like Microsoft , where you have 160 programmers , how do you go about creating an environment where you can develop successful programs ?
GATES : One way is to have small project teams , typically four or five people , and one of those people has to have the proven ability to really absorb a program .
And when that lead person is uncertain about something , he or she should be able discuss it with even more experienced programmers .
Part of our strategy is getting the programmers to think everything through before they go to the coding phase .
Writing the design documents is crucial , because a lot of simplification comes when you see problems expressed as algorithms .
They ’re kind of in the smallest form then , where you can see what the overlap is .
Another important element is code review , making sure that you look through the code and see if senior people can provide hints about how to do something better .
And you have to review similar projects that have gone super , super well ; programmers can look at how those other people performed previously , and get ideas from the other project about how to improve their own program .
INTERVIEWER :
Where do the ideas for programs come from ?
GATES : Well , there ’s no formal process , that ’s for sure .
At Microsoft , there ’s usually a brainstorming session at night or on the weekends .
Everybody has a general idea , like , we want to do the world ’s best word processor .
And we want it to allow a technical publications department to do everything they want to do .
We ’ll sit and talk .
Well , how could we make it really fast ?
Could we put a drawing capability in , or could we do kerning without making the program super slow ?
A variety of problems will get talked through and some neat ideas will come up .
INTERVIEWER : Basically it ’s a group effort ?
GATES : In terms of deciding what programs are going to do , a fairly large group makes suggestions .
Then there ’s a filtering process .
Eventually I ’ll decide which of the ideas makes sense , and I ’ll make sure we have champions who are personally involved in making that product succeed .
We decide to do very , very few projects because it takes incredible focusing on a lot of resources to get a product out there and set a new world - class standard .
INTERVIEWER :
There ’s a lot of talk about how large software companies find it difficult to attract talented people who can produce great software , because these mavericks are so independent that they want to work on their own .
How do you attract and keep good people at Microsoft ?
GATES : Great programmers are critical to create software products .
But we do n’t believe in a prima donna approach , where just because somebody ’s good we let him not comment his code , or not communicate with other people , or impose his beliefs on everyone else .
We want people who really respect each other .
I think most great programmers like to be around other great programmers .
When they think up an incredible algorithm , they like having peers who can appreciate the cleverness that went into it , because when you ’re creating something like that and you have that model in your mind , it ’s a lonely thing .
If you thought a process had to be complicated , and then you figure out a way to make it simpler , that makes you feel great .
But you want to get some feedback from other people .
Once you get a few great people , then others come .
The old rule used to be that a manager of a programmer was always a better programmer , and there were no what we called “ technical inversions , ” where a programmer works for somebody who does n’t know how to program .
We still follow that philosophy :
At certain levels we ’ve got business managers , but we do n’t have non-programmers really managing programming projects .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you think there are any particular rules for creating a good program ?
GATES : Some people just jump in and start coding , and others think it all through before they sit down , but I think you ’d find that the programmers who sit down and code at the beginning are only using that as a scratch pad .
It ’s what ’s going on in their heads that ’s most important .
You ’ve got to have somebody who ’s super smart .
A great programmer thinks about the program on a constant basis , whether driving or eating .
That method takes an incredible amount of mental energy .
INTERVIEWER : How would you describe your style of programming ?
GATES : I like to think the whole program through at a design level before I sit down and write any of the code .
And once I write the code , I like to go back and rewrite it entirely one time .
The most important part of writing a program is designing the data structures .
The second most important part is breaking the various code pieces down .
Until you really get in there and write it out , you do n’t have the keenest sense of what the common subroutines should be .
The really great programs I ’ve written have all been ones that I have thought about for a huge amount of time before I ever wrote them .
I wrote a BASIC interpreter for a minicomputer in high school .
I made massive mistakes in that program , and then I got to look at some other BASIC interpreters .
So by the time I sat down to do Microsoft BASIC in 1975 , it was n’t a question of whether I could write the program , but rather a question of whether I could squeeze it into 4 K and make it super fast .
I was on edge the whole time thinking , “ Will this thing be fast enough ?
Will somebody come along and do it faster ? ”
I have an image in my head of this person named Norton that I met at TRW .
He always showed me when I was n’t doing super well .
So if I ’m sloppy or lazy , I always imagine that he ’s going to walk up , look at the program , and tell me , “ Look , here ’s a better way to do that . ”
Little inefficiencies can slip into the program along the way , and if you want to really feel good about it , you ’ve got to maintain the thought that you ’re not going to let that stuff creep in .
That ’s why it ’s kind of painful sometimes if you have somebody else working on the project .
They never code stuff exactly the way you like to see it coded .
I remember when we were working on BASIC , I ’d go back and recode other people ’s sections of code , without making any dramatic improvement .
That bothers people when you go in and do that , but sometimes you just feel like you have to do it .
INTERVIEWER :
When you were working with a group , were you always the design lead ?
GATES : Yeah , on all the programs I ’ve been directly involved with , I was the design lead .
On the original BASIC , I scribbled out the design on pieces of paper .
Paul Allen , who is a co-author , designed an implemented all the development tools .
Before I sit down to code something , most of the instructions have already run through my head .
It ’s not all laid out perfectly , and I do find myself making changes , but all the good ideas have occurred to me before I actually write the program .
And if there is a bug in the thing , I feel pretty bad , because if there ’s one bug , it says your mental simulation is imperfect .
And once your mental simulation is imperfect , there might be thousands of bugs in the program .
I really hate it when I watch some people program and I do n’t see them thinking .
One of the most fun programming experiences I ever had was when we were doing BASIC .
I had done the 8080 BASIC , and then I had about two weeks allocated to work with Mark Chamberlain on the 6809 version of BASIC .
I read the instruction set at the start of those two weeks , and I wrote about three or four programs .
And I looked at some other programs to see how people used the instruction set .
It was great fun to take a problem I understood and map it onto this new instruction set , and see how tightly we could put the thing together .
Programs today get very fat ; the enhancements tend to slow the program down because people put in special checks .
When they want to add some feature , they ’ll just stick in these checks without thinking about how they might slow the thing down .
You have to have a programmer who knows the program inside out to guard against that .
In the case of our BASIC , after I and the other original people moved away from it , we went through a period of about three years when we did n’t do anything innovative .
It ’s only in the last year and a half that we ’ve gotten people in who feel total ownership and total understanding of our BASIC and can say , “ Oh , yeah , putting subroutines in and getting rid of line numbers is easy . ”
We ’ve always had those goals , but until you ’ve got that person who knows how to go into the middle of the parts or the statement analyzer and not just tack things on , you do n’t feel comfortable fiddling with it .
It ’s true that we ’re going to allow programs to be a little fatter than they have been .
But in terms of speed , it ’s just laziness not to allow something to be as fast as possible , because users , even though they might not be able to say so explicitly , notice programs that are really , really fast .
In the most successful programs , the speed of execution is just wonderful .
INTERVIEWER : How do you decide on the trade - offs between speed and performance ?
GATES : Sometimes it ’s a trade - off between adding features and executing really fast , but there are ways of having lots and lots of features and still making things fast .
Basically you want to decide what the common cases are in a program , and make sure that they go straight through , that they do n’t get bogged down with all these special case checks .
If your main interactive loop has all sorts of checks in it , then your program is going to be slower than somebody else ’s .
INTERVIEWER :
When you come up with an idea to do the greatest word processor in the world , what do you do ?
How do you design it ?
Do you look at all the other word processors that are out there ?
GATES : Yeah , feature - wise , you look at all the other word processors out there and you say , “ Does anybody do kerning on the screen , or do they show you exactly what the printed page is going to look like ?
How fast do they do it ? ”
Usually , at the top of the product line , there ’s somebody who took very , very expensive hardware and used brute force to solve a problem .
We ca n’t do that ; the computer we ’re working with has very finite speed .
A lot of things we do have been done on more powerful computers ; we ’re just trying to make it reasonable to do them on the machine that there are millions of .
You can do an amazing number of tricks inside of a product .
You build up your feature list at the same time you ’re trying to answer the question , “ Why will our algorithms be better than anybody else ’s ? ”
Features are kind of crummy in a way , because the more features you have , the bigger the manual is .
And features are only beneficial if people take the time to use them , whereas speed–if you can print the pages faster , or show it on the screen faster , or recalc it faster –that ’s worth an incredible amount .
If you can give the users a few simple commands and make the program efficient enough to do what they want with those few commands , then you ’re much better off
One sign of very good programs is that even internally they follow that philosophy of simplicity .
If they want to do something complex , they call the code with simple operations internally , rather than doing the complex operation from scratch .
INTERVIEWER : How important is the end user ?
How do you know what the database manager out there really needs or wants in his database or in his spreadsheet ?
GATES : Well , some programmers do n’t pretend to have any intuition for exactly what end users want , and they ’re still world - class programmers .
But that knowledge of the market is important , especially in the applications group , so we have full - time people who just show customers the code , or look at other specifications , and things of that nature .
When Microsoft first started , we did only systems programs .
We knew what programmers wanted , because we ’re programmers .
So we wrote BASIC .
INTERVIEWER : What was the most innovative aspect of BASIC ?
GATES : The way we allowed the person to get at the full power of the machine .
We put in PEEK and POKE , where you can read and write the machine status .
We put in tracing routines called TRON and TROFE .
We still let the users , even though they were up in this high - level language , get at all the crazy little things they might want to add onto the machine .
And they can understand how memory is used without BASIC .
We let them feel like they are in control of their machines .
To fit BASIC into 4 K , we used a scheme called a single - representation interpreter .
It was a very good choice .
I ’d never seen an interpreter done that way before .
It was kind of risky to do it that way , but I felt incredible confidence in the scheme .
I ’d run it through in my head and felt good about it .
INTERVIEWER :
When you were writing it , did you have any idea it would be as successful as it was ?
GATES : No , no way .
Paul Allen had brought me the magazine with the Altair on it , and we thought , “ Geez , we ’d better get going , because we know these machines are going to be popular . ”
And that ’s when I stopped going to classes and we just worked around the clock .
The initial program was written in about three and a half weeks .
We ended up spending about eight weeks before I had it fully polished the way that I really liked it .
And then I later went back and rewrote it .
No great programmer is sitting there saying , “ I ’m going to make a bunch of money , ” or , “ I ’m going to sell a hundred thousand copies . ”
Because that kind of thought gives you no guidance about the problems .
A great programmer is thinking : Should I rewrite this whole subroutine so that four people , instead of three , could call it ?
Should I make this program 10 percent faster ?
Should I really think through what the common case in here is so I know how to order this check ?
If you ’re a great programmer , you make all the routines depend on each other , so little mistakes can really hurt you .
That ’s why you have to have such fine judgment , and be willing to back up and change things .
INTERVIEWER :
When more than one person works on a program , how can you make sure all the different elements are working together property ?
GATES : Well , first of all , the programming team has got to be made up of people who respect each other , because the work is really intimate ; it ’s like being in the same play together .
So much judgment and creativity goes into a programming project .
Some of the great programmers can’t work on teams ; they just like to work on their own .
But I think there ’s an element of greatness that comes in learning how to work with other people and teach them .
I really get satisfaction from somebody else on the team becoming a great programmer .
Not quite as much as I do from writing the program myself , but that is really a positive event .
The way I make someone else a great programmer is to sit and talk with him a lot , and I show him my code .
In a team project , you make the code everybody ’s code .
INTERVIEWER : Did this kind of process just evolve here or was it through deliberate implementation ?
GATES : Before Paul and I started the company , we had been involved in some large - scale software projects that were real disasters .
They just kept pouring people in , and nobody really knew how they were going to stabilize the project .
We swore to ourselves that we would do better .
So the idea of spending a lot of time on structuring groups has always been very important .
The best ideas are the obvious ones :
Keep the group small , make sure everybody in the group is super smart , give them great tools , and have a common terminology so everybody can communicate very effectively .
And outside the small groups , have some very experienced senior people around who can give advice on problems .
There is an amazing commonality in the types of difficulties you run into .
In design reviews , I really enjoy being able to provide advice , based on programs that I have done .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you think there will ever be a radical change in the way people go about programming , or in the way computers operate ?
GATES : Software tools are getting so much better .
It is possible that we will eventually be able to take just specifications and a description of what the machine is efficient at , and then have some super high - level compiler do a lot of the work that programmers do now .
People still get great satisfaction out of the fact that a compiler , like the C compiler , still ca n’t write code as well as a human being .
But we may mechanize some parts of the process quite a bit over the next three or four years .
People will still design algorithms , but a lot of the implementation could be done by machines .
I think that within the next five years we ’ll have tools that will be able to do as good a job as a human programmer .
INTERVIEWER : You mentioned mathematics earlier .
What ’s the relationship between computer science and mathematics ?
GATES : Math really affects computer science .
Most great programmers have some mathematical background , because it helps to have studied the purity of proving theorems , where you do n’t make soft statements , you only make precise statements .
In mathematics , you develop complete characterizations , and you have to combine theorems in very non-obvious ways .
You often try to prove that a problem can be solved in less time .
Math relates very directly to programming , maybe more so in my mind than in other people ’s minds , because that ’s the angle that I came from .
I think there ’s a very natural relationship between the two .
INTERVIEWER : Is computer science really a science ?
GATES : It will be .
See , it ’s such a new thing .
People used to get Ph.D. theses for doing work that we now expect programmers to do as part of their jobs .
Computer science is developing very quickly , but unlike math , where they ’ve had 300 years of geniuses developing mathematical theory , we just have our 20 or so years of the people who decided to get involved .
Really brilliant people are getting involved and contributing ; programming is much more of a mainstream activity now .
The fact that people are getting exposed to computers at such young ages now will help change the thinking in the field .
A lot of great programmers programmed when they were in their teens , when the way you think about things is perhaps more flexible .
In the past , it was n’t considered enough just to be a wonderful programmer ; you had to manage people or go do other things .
Fortunately , that ’s changing .
Now people realize that it ’s a science that is worth sticking to and teaching other people .
INTERVIEWER : Does accumulating experience through the years necessarily make programming easier ?
GATES : No .
I think after the first three or four years , it ’s pretty cast in concrete whether you ’re a good programmer or not .
After a few years , you may know more about managing large projects and personalities , but after three or four years , it ’s clear what you ’re going to be .
There ’s no one at Microsoft who was just kind of mediocre for a couple of years , and then just out of the blue started optimizing everything in sight .
I can talk to somebody about a program that he ’s written and know right away whether he ’s really a good programmer .
If he ’s really good , he ’ll have everything at the tip of his tongue .
Its like people who play cress .
When you ’re really into playing chess , it ’s easy to memorize every move in ten chess games , because you ’re involved in it .
Other people look at that recall in chess players , or in programmers , and they think it ’s like some freak show .
But it ’s completely natural .
To this day , I can go to the blackboard and write out huge slabs of source code from the Microsoft BASIC that I wrote ten years ago .
INTERVIEWER :
What does it feel like when you are programming ?
GATES : When I compile something and it starts computing the right results , I really feel great .
I ’m not kidding , there is some emotion in all great things , and this is no exception .
It ’s tempting to just start typing the code in , but there ’s nothing worse than typing in a routine just to get the results , and then realizing that all the hard stuff still has to be written .
Because if that ’s true , you ’re going to have to change what you ’ve already done .
I like to wait and really build the foundation before I let myself have the enjoyment of coding it and seeing it run .
It ’s like saving the best thing on my plate for last .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you see a difference between the way young programmers go about programming and the way older programmers do ?
GATES : Programmers just starting out today never had to squeeze , so it ’s a little harder for them to get the right religion because they always think of resources as being immediately available .
Ten years ago every programmer ran into resource limitations , so the older programmers are always thinking about those things .
Programming takes an incredible amount of energy , so most programmers are fairly young .
And that can be a problem , because programming requires so much discipline .
When you ’re young , your goals are n’t as stable ; you may get distracted by one thing or another .
Young programmers should stick with it , though , and they ’ll get better .
I think I improved dramatically as a programmer between 1975 and 1980 .
In ’75 , I would have said , “ Hey , watch out , I can do anything . ”
I really thought I could , because I had read so much code , and I never found a piece of code that I could n’t read very quickly .
I still think that one of the finest tests of programming ability is to hand the programmer about 30 pages of code and see how quickly he can read through and understand it .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you think that ’s a talent ?
GATES : It ’s a talent , you bet .
It ’s kind of like pure I.Q .
You have to just concentrate on the code and relate back to programs you ’ve written .
A lot of people would say , “ I want days and days to read this . ”
A really good programmer would say , “ Let me take that home with me .
I ’ll just spend an hour tonight and go through the whole thing . ”
The difference of ability there is vast .
INTERVIEWER :
Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to be a programmer ?
GATES : No , the best way to prepare is to write programs , and to study great programs that other people have written .
In my case , I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating system .
You ’ve got to be willing to read other people ’s code , then write your own , then have other people review your code .
You ’ve got to want to be in this incredible feedback loop where you get the world - class people to tell you what you ’re doing wrong .
You ca n’t let little idiosyncrasies get in the way of getting that feedback .
Some of the world - class people will harp on some purely idiosyncratic detail , like how you comment the program .
You have to cut through all that stuff , because in a way , they ’re trying to create programmers in their own image ; they ’re trying to get you to do arbitrary things the same way they do .
And it may not relate to pure quality issues .
If you ever talk to a great programmer , you ’ll find he knows his tools like an artist knows his paintbrushes .
It ’s amazing to see how much great programmers have in common in the way they developed –how they got their feedback , and how they developed such a refined sense of discipline about what ’s sloppy and what ’s not sloppy .
When you get those people to look at a certain piece of code , you get a very , very common reaction .
INTERVIEWER : Has anyone in particular influenced you in the way you write code ?
GATES : Everybody who wrote the PDP operating system influenced me .
And John Norton from TRW , who wrote memos about people ’s code–I ’d never seen anything like that before .
I started trying to do that with other people ’s code myself .
There ’s been a mixing of ideas between Paul Allen and me , because so much of the programming we ’ve done , we ’ve done together .
It is nice to have somebody who ’s up to speed to talk to when you ’re debugging code or you are n’t sure about some particular trade - off .
In a sense , it ’s a way of taking a break , relieving the intensity without having to switch topics , just going in and discussing it with somebody .
In the creative process , it ’s good to have the pressure off a little bit and yet still have your attention focused .
Paul and I learned how to work together in an effective way .
You do n’t find too many partnerships like that .
He ’s had a huge influence on me .
And then , in the Microsoft period , Charles Simonyi and some of the other people here have influenced me , too .
INTERVIEWER :
What do you think is in store for software ?
Are we just going to keep doing another great word processor or another great spreadsheet ?
Or will computers branch out into areas we do n’t even dream of today ?
GATES : We ’re just moving down the spectrum of more and more thinking on the part of the computer .
I ’ve coined the term “ softer software . ”
That refers to a program that molds itself to the user ’s needs and the user ’s interests over time .
There are going to be more great word processors and spreadsheets , and we ’ll use networking and graphics and new architectures .
And there ’ll be massive storage with compact disks ( CDs ) , where you can store encyclopedias .
What ’s going to really be different is rule - based programming .
It ’s different , because instead of just writing the program and saying : “ If this happens , do this and if this happens , do this , ” which is the way programs work now , you ’ll write rules , and then you have this little reasoning engine that looks at the current set of facts and the rules .
Then it tries to derive new facts and act appropriately .
For example , the program might have rules about gravity , and if something falls off the table , the program knows that if it ’s glass , it might break .
So the program generates results in a very non-obvious fashion , compared to normal - type programming .
This is the technique on which so - called expert systems are built .
Rule - based programming is the idea of having the derivations done through a proving machine , not just laid out explicitly in the program .
Perhaps these techniques wo n’t have an impact for four or five more years .
A young programmer who wants to make his mark might be smart to focus on this new type of programming .
INTERVIEWER : Can rule - based programming handle disparate information more effectively than traditional programming ?
GATES : Well , it ’s somewhat hard to explain .
Let ’s say you have a program that figures out how to build bridges .
It ’s got all this stuff about stress and bending and the properties of metal .
Embedded into that program is knowledge about engineering and materials and things of that nature .
If you come along and say , “ We want to build bridges out of plastic , ” to that program , that ’s as massive a change as to say , “ I want to build bridges on Mars . ”
In rule - based programming at its extreme , all the physical principles embodied in how much stress metal can take , and how gravity works , would be stated explicitly as rules .
And all the deductions would come from examining those rules and working them through .
Today we do n’t have good enough rule - proving engines ; it is unbelievably inefficient to try to do things this way .
But this is one of the techniques we are making progress in , and it is on the horizon as something that might change programming .
That , and another idea : that we might have hundreds of computers all running in parallel at the same time .
In fact , that might help us to run this rule - based stuff efficiently .
That sort of major architectural change might influence how people program or how they think about programming .
The scariest thing to programmers is that compilers will get so good or computers will get so fast that programmers wo n’t count any more .
I used to always have the fear that when I chose to specialize in something , its importance might diminish over time .
INTERVIEWER : Microsoft is a broadly based company and the industry as a whole is changing rapidly .
How do you keep up with everything ?
GATES : Well , I do n’t keep up with everything .
I ’m working with the top people at IBM , at Apple , at DEC , and in Japan .
I have to know what ’s going to happen ; I ca n’t waste a lot of time guessing .
When I fly somewhere with somebody from Microsoft , we talk about what ’s happening .
And the E - Mail system at Microsoft is an efficient vehicle that helps me keep up .
One way to keep up is to use personal computers , and to make sure that I ’ve read the manuals and used the top ten software products .
Those products do n’t change so often that I ca n’t be very familiar with each of them .
If you really give a darn about personal computing , you will have used every one , and know something about them and think about how you could do better than those packages .
In a sense , personal computers have become simpler .
Now we have just the two architectures : the PC and the Mac .
Back in the good old days we had thirty or forty different machines that were totally incompatible , and there were a whole bunch of languages that people were messing around with .
Because we ’ve brought millions and millions of people in , we ’ve had to make it more homogeneous , more standardized , so that they can get some sense of what ’s going on .
A lot of what goes on in the industry does n’t really advance the state of the art .
I like to concentrate on networking or graphics , because what we ’re going to do there might have something to do with the state of the art , instead of concentrating on did this retail chain go bankrupt , did this guy bribe that guy , or did this company give this guy enough stock ?
Who cares ?
The really smart people here are focused on their areas ; they bring me anything they think is of significance , any project that ’s going to have real impact .
INTERVIEWER : :
Where do you see Microsoft in ten years ?
GATES : Our goals are very simple .
We ’re going to create the software that puts a computer on every desk and in every home .
I do n’t know if that ’ll take ten years – that ’s not my expertise , guessing those exact time frames .
Microsoft also wants to participate in helping to make sure those machines are good machines , building the system software into them , and then doing a lot of the important applications they ’ll use .
And even though there ’ll be more and more machines , our present thinking is that we wo n’t have to increase the size of our development groups , because we ’ll simply be making programs that sell in larger quantities .
We can get a very large amount of software revenue and still keep the company not dramatically larger than what we have today .
That means we can know everybody and talk and share tools and maintain a high level of quality .
One of the new areas we ’re focusing on at Microsoft is compact - disk applications .
CD ROM is the technology we ’re going to use to get personal computers into the home .
INTERVIEWER ::
Why do you think it will succeed in the home when other things have n’t ?
GATES : Today , if you buy a computer , and then go buy an educational program , you ’ll find the process is not very educational .
The number of responses , the variety , and the way that the program simulates real life is just nothing .
With the massive storage of the CD , we can create a situation you can directly relate to , where the amount of information , the variety of responses , the involvement you feel in it , will be just so dramatic .
It ’s a competitive world .
With educational software , we ’re competing with newspapers , books , and TV .
The software programs we put out today just are n’t competitive .
Unless you ’re just trying to save your kid from being dumb or something , then there ’s no real reason to buy the machine ; it does n’t engage you .
It does n’t engage a non-computer person .
INTERVIEWER ::
Do you think the new CD ROM applications will compete with television ?
GATES : Television is passive entertainment .
We ’re betting that people want to interact , choose different paths , and get feedback from the machine about what they ’ve really learned .
They can look up something specific that they ’re interested in .
It ’s the interactive nature of the device that differentiates CD ROM from just turning on a TV and watching something .
INTERVIEWER : :
Will you apply a lot of the same principles that go into designing your applications to CD ROM software products ?
GATES : CD ROM is totally different .
We hope with CD ROM you ’ll be able to look at a map of the United States , point somewhere , click , zoom in and say , “ Hey , what hotels are around here ? ”
And the program will tell you .
And if you ’re in the encyclopedia and you point to one of Beethoven ’s symphonies , the computer will play the song .
It ’s a new interface ; it ’s got nothing to do with productivity tools like word processors or spreadsheets .
CD ROM programs will solve totally different problems .
Like any new media , it ’ll be incredibly competitive .
How can we use programming skills to make a better CD ROM application than somebody else ?
That requires some very profound thinking .
It ’s not another market for programs we have already done .
It ’s a market where we hope our intelligence will allow us to create something new and appropriate .
INTERVIEWER ::
So it ’s not so simple as taking a bunch of newspapers and putting them on a CD ROM and writing a retrieval program ?
GATES : Well , some people will do that , but we wo n’t ; that ’s not exciting .
We really believe we ’re going to have CD ROM machines in every car and in every house .
And when you go to a new area of the country , you ’re going to stick that little disk in there and pan around and have it show you routes , and have it tell you about points of interest .
Take an area like sports .
You ’ll have a sports disk that you push in and you ’ll get records and pictures of the guys .
You ’ll be able to look at the old games , and you ’ll be able to look up rules .
Every single disk will have lessons to teach you an area you want to learn about .
Every single disk will have quizzes , like , “ Hey , you think you ’re so smart about baseball .
Well , who was this guy , or what did he do ? ”
Every disk will have interactive games on it ; on the sports disk that ’s pretty obvious .
On the music disk , the game will be “ Name That Tune , ” and you ’ll be able to look at scores , look up people who wrote music , and hear how different instruments sound .
You ’ll sit there and type in your own little scores .
And if you ’re a pilot , you ’ll probably be interested in pictures of airports and planes , and stuff like that ; we ’ll have it on a disk for you .
INTERVIEWER : : Will these CD ROM applications be sold in bookstores ?
GATES : Eventually .
In the bootstrap period , we are trying to decide which channels we appeal to .
Specifically , is there a role for the specialty computer retail store ?
I personally do n’t think so , but it ’s hard to say .
Some CD applications sound like a fantasy .
But how often is a new media invented ?
Almost never .
Videotape ’s not a new media , it ’s just delayed broadcast to TV ; there ’s nothing different about videotapes .
Interactive video disk had a chance to be a new media , but it did n’t reach critical mass .
It did n’t get enough material , low - cost players , convenience ; it did n’t get absorbed into the culture .
Compact disks are a superset of interactive video , but we ’ll have to do even better .
The changes that CDs cause will be great .
I just do n’t see parts catalogs being issued in print form ever again .
For anything that ’s reference oriented , where you do n’t want to just turn pages , but want to look up the information and manipulate it and see it in different ways , this electronic form is just far , far superior to most other forms .
Our toughest competition is clearly books .
We ’re not going to really hurt the book market , but CDs will substitute for catalogs and certain types of reference materials .
INTERVIEWER ::
Do you think a culture is going to grow out of this , like the television culture ?
GATES : I do n’t know what a culture is , but CDs are more interactive than television .
The CD is n’t just specific to programming like personal computing is today .
And yet it has the same sort of addictive , involved - type attributes .
You ’re going to be involved , you ’re going to be quizzed , you ’re going to say , “ I ’m a superstar , let me try this out . ”
We ’ll do the quiz so you can have multiple people involved in picking a question for the other person to answer .
If a kid is addicted to a personal computer , I think that ’s far better than watching TV , because at least his mind is making choices .
I ’m not one of these npeople who hates TV , but I do n’t think it exercises your mind much .
I do n’t happen to own one .
INTERVIEWER ::
Do you think that the development of CD ROM could be crippled if different standards are used ?
GATES : There is massive political maneuvering on the part of Microsoft and companies hundreds of times our size , to establish standards in this area .
There is the potential for two , or even three , incompatible viewers .
And given the cost to create the software for this stuff , that would be unfortunate .
So that ’s where a lot of our focus and attention goes .
We ’re trying to make sure that our standard is the standard .
That ’s going to be hard ; it ’s going to be a challenge .
We have to move very , very quickly to get all the activity focused around one standard , and we have to make sure it ’s a decent standard .
A viewer like this could n’t be done if it was n’t for the semiconductor industry .
It ’s the unbelievable low cost of memory and high - speed processors , video chips and audio chips , that allows us to make computers a multi-media thing .
The semiconductor industry is performing the miracle .
It ’s only over the last two years that all the components have been purchased in incredibly high volume for other uses , and therefore have been driven to an attractive lower price .
INTERVIEWER : Do you see CD ROMs merging with expert systems ?
GATES : No , the two do n’t rely on each other .
Eventually you may distribute the data for expert systems on a CD , because you can put quite a large database on it .
But neither one requires the other .
They both have their own difficult challenges to face .
The mix of skills required to do the world ’s best CD is pretty intimidating , because it ’s video , it ’s audio , it ’s programming , and it ’s interactive .
It ’s hard , just like any new media .
When people were first on TV , they felt they were so much better than people on radio , but they ’d just stand there .
It took a long time to invent the colorful peacock , all the action , the three - dimensional padding , and the special effects that you see on TV today .
Just like TV , CDs will get better as we get more experienced with the media .
I can sit here and tell you all the mistakes we wo n’t make , and five years from now , I could sit here and tell you all the mistakes that we did make .
As creative as we are , we wo n’t be able to exploit the media to its absolute fullest right away .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you ever wish you were back programming on your own again ?
GATES : Oh , sure , absolutely .
Then you control everything .
There ’s no compromise .
Every line is yours and you feel good about every line .
It ’s kind of selfish , but it ’s like being allowed to do pure mathematics , and yet you have the feedback of making something really work .
I sometimes envy my colleagues who get to focus just on the program they ’re writing .

Despite the dire need for better health care , more electricity and clean water , a functioning sewage system and other services , the accountability office has previously estimated that Iraq spent only 22 percent of the oil money set aside for reconstruction in 2006 .
And in January , the office , which is charged with overseeing the Iraqi government ’s finances , reported that Iraq had spent a meager 4.4 percent of its 2007 reconstruction budget by August of that year , the most recent figures available at the time .
As a result , the letter from the Armed Services Committee says , “ we believe that it has been overwhelmingly U.S. taxpayer money that has funded Iraq reconstruction over the last five years , despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue over that time period that have ended up in non-Iraqi banks . ”
The letter was signed by Senator Carl Levin , the Michigan Democrat who is the committee chairman , and Senator John W. Warner , a Virginia Republican who is a former chairman .
Senator John McCain of Arizona , the ranking Republican on the committee and the presumptive Republican nominee for president , did not sign the letter .
Iraqi officials say they face many obstacles in what might seem to be a straightforward task : spending their plentiful money .
Workers are attacked , engineers and contracting experts have fled government ministries , construction companies refuse to take jobs in risky areas and building materials are not available .
And if all of those factors were not daunting enough , the various Iraqi and American government entities involved cannot even agree on how much the notoriously opaque Iraqi bureaucracy has in fact spent on reconstruction .

U.S. citizenship to be checked in storm evacuations U.S. citizenship to be checked in event of a storm
Agents to watch those in the Valley who board buses to flee a hurricane
BROWNSVILLE —
Ending speculation about the fate of the Rio Grande Valley 's undocumented immigrants during a hurricane evacuation , U.S. Customs and Border Protection has confirmed it will check the citizenship both of people boarding buses to leave the Valley and at inland traffic checkpoints .
Those determined to be in the country illegally will be taken to detention centers away from the hurricane 's path and later processed for deportation .
" It 's business as usual at the checkpoints , " said Dan Doty , spokesman for CBP 's Rio Grande Valley sector .
" We 'll still check everybody . "
Locals responded with predictions of humanitarian disaster .
" We can't wait to see the helicopter photos of us sitting on roofs , " said the Rev. Mike Seifert , a priest and activist based in a colonia outside Brownsville .
The many area families with one or more undocumented members would just refuse to evacuate , he said .
" Imagine , " Seifert said .
" We 're all in an uproar , everybody 's in an enormous hurry , there 's just a narrow window of opportunity and you get to the place with the buses and the Border Patrol 's checking people .
You 're not going to go . "
In the disastrous wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 , officials in the Valley have pondered the politics of mass evacuation , illegal immigration and the checkpoints that filter northbound traffic every day .
After Hurricane Rita threatened the Houston area , clogging highways for miles , drying up gas pumps and creating chaos , emergency management officials set out to improve planning .
State Director of Homeland Security Steve McCraw in 2006 said the highway checkpoints should be closed if the Valley needed to evacuate .
U.S. 77 parallels the coast and could be underwater once hurricane rains or flooding hit .
Even if all the lanes on U.S. 281 are dedicated for northbound traffic , that 's the main route for a population that now tops a million people .
Krista Piferrer , a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry , said Thursday the state 's stand on the issue had not changed .
" The governor 's office prefers that the Border Patrol not use checkpoints during times of evacuation for obvious reasons , " she said .
" It will slow down traffic and create problems .
...
During times of emergency our priority No. 1 is safety and we continue to hold on to the same belief . "
At a recent discussion with reporters , Hidalgo County Judge J.D. Salinas said he did n't expect the Border Patrol to publicize a policy on the checkpoints for fear of inviting a free - for - all for illegal traffic .
The unofficial word , he said , was that agents recognized they'd have to be more lax amid a disaster .
But Tuesday , a reporter photographing a mock evacuation for the Rio Grande Guardian Web site saw Border Patrol agents rehearsing citizenship document checks of people boarding buses .
CBP 's
Doty confirmed this was the planned procedure and said those determined to be undocumented immigrants would be taken to separate shelters , likely detention centers in Laredo or San Antonio .
He said the highway checkpoints would stay open .
Document checks are not mandatory at the checkpoints ; it 's up to an agent to assess travelers and determine whether to ask for papers .
Doty said that even with the checks , 120,000 people could be evacuated within 80 hours .
" Our agents , they do it so often , they know what to look for , " he said .
Doty could not say what would happen if children in a vehicle were citizens but parents were not , or if everybody but an elderly grandparent had a green card .
" We try to keep families together , but I can't put a U.S. citizen in a detention center , " he said .
Cameron County Judge Carlos Cascos said locals would have to work with federal directives , but said document checks would hamper an evacuation .

The light echo of an X - ray flare from the nucleus of a galaxy has been observed .
The flare almost certainly originates from a single star being gravitationally ripped apart by a supermassive black hole in the galactic core .
As the star was being pulled into the black hole , its material was injected into the black hole accretion disk , causing a sudden burst of radiation .
The resulting X - ray flare emission was observed as it hit local stellar gases , producing the light echo .
This event gives us a better insight to how stars are eaten by supermassive black holes and provides a method to map the structure of galactic nuclei .
Scientists now believe they have observational evidence for the elusive molecular torus that is thought to surround active supermassive black holes .
Light echoes from distant galaxies have been observed before .
The echoes from a supernova that occurred 400 years ago ( that is now observed as the supernova remnant SNR 0509 - 67.5 ) were only just observed here on Earth , after the supernova emissions bounced off galactic matter .
This is the first time however that the energetic emissions from a sudden influx of matter into a supermassive black hole accretion disk has been observed echoing off gases within galactic nuclei .
This is a major step toward understanding how stars are consumed by supermassive black holes .
Additionally , the echo acts like a searchlight , highlighting the dark stellar matter between the stars , revealing a structure we have never seen before .
This new research was carried out by an international team led by Stefanie Komossa from the Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany , using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Komossa likens this observation to illuminating a dark city with a firework burst :
“ To study the core of a normal galaxy is like looking at the New York skyline at night during a power failure :
You ca n’t learn much about the buildings , roads and parks .
The situation changes , for example , during a fireworks display .
It ’s exactly the same when a sudden burst of high - energy radiation illuminates a galaxy . ”
– Stefanie Komossa
A strong X - ray burst such as this can be very hard to observe as they are short - lived emissions , but a huge amount of information can be gained by seeing such an event if astronomers are quick enough .
By analysing the degree of ionization and velocity data in the spectroscopic emission lines of the echoed light , the Max Planck physicists were able to deduce the flare location .
Held within the emission lines are the cosmic “ fingerprints ” of the atoms at the source of the emission , leading them to the galactic core where a supermassive black hole is believed to live .
The standard model for galactic nuclei ( a.k.a. unified model of active galaxies ) predict a “ molecular torus ” surrounding the black hole accretion disk .
These new observations of the galaxy named SDSSJ0952+2143 appear to show the X - ray flare was reflected by the galactic molecular torus ( with strong iron emission lines ) .
This is the first time the presence of a possible torus has been seen , and if confirmed , astrophysicists will have their observational evidence of this theoretical possibility , strengthening the standard model .
What ’s more , using accretion disk flares may aid scientists when attempting to map the structure of other molecular toruses .
Strengthening the observation of echoed X - ray emission from the torus is the possibility of seeing variable infrared emissions .
This emission signifies a “ last call for help ” by the dusty cloud being rapidly heated by the incident X - rays .
The dust will have been vaporized soon after .
But how do they know it was a star that fell into the accretion disk ?
In addition to the strong iron lines , there are strange hydrogen emission lines which have never been seen before .
This is a strong piece of evidence that it is the debris from a star that came too close to the black hole , stripping away its hydrogen fuel .
Although the X - ray flare has subsided , the galaxy continues to be observed by the X - ray satellite Chandra .
Faint but measurable X - ray emissions are being observed perhaps signifying that the star is still being fed to the accretion disk .
It seems possible that measuring this faint emission may also be of use , allowing researchers to continue to map the molecular torus long after the initial strong X - ray emission has ended .

Seven weeks ago , when we first reported Vista was causing many machines to stall indefinitely while deleting , copying and moving files , we were sure the problem was caused by a bug that would be fixed relatively quickly .
After all , Vista is Microsoft 's flagship product .
It 's also an operating system .
And everyone knows deleting , copying and moving files are among the most basic tasks any operating system can set out to do .
Now we do n't know what to think .
Vista 's Long Goodbye , as we 've come to call this bizarre phenomenon , continues unabated .
No amount of diagnosing by the untold number of confounded sysadmins sheds any light on the problem 's cause , and Microsoft has yet to acknowledge its full extent .
" I just wanted to say ... that I have tried everything ... in this section .. till yesterday ( May 13 2007 ) and none of it worked , " a user who goes by the name SR_1976 posted today in a Microsoft TechNet forum discussing the glitch .
" I have tried my best to work with Vista .... did not work ... so , gone back to XP ... and all my problems are gone .
Vista was more stable than XP ( for me ...) and does have some good features ... but enough is enough .. "
( The discussion , by the way , is the longest TechNet thread we 've ever seen . )
Another posting made today relates the experience of a certain groden , who spent four hours trying to copy 3.8GB of data off a Windows 2003 server using a Sony Vaio with 2GB of RAM .
It took him a couple of minutes to copy the same files using a similar set up that was running XP .
To recap , an untold number of Vista users are unable to delete , copy and move files without interminable waits , in which the OS appears to be calculating the time the job will take .
While most vexing for people working with files on a remote server , the glitch is also present when working with local files .
Microsoft issued a hotfix , but it appears it was designed to repair a problem other than the one at hand .
Or at least we hope , because it sure has n't fixed Vista 's Long Goodbye .
We asked Microsoft for an interview with a product manager who could shed some light on the difficulty that 's vexing so many of the company 's most important customers .
What we got was an emailed statement that gave no new information .
It read :
Finding the root cause of issues like this and identifying a solution is of the utmost priority for Microsoft .
That said , crafting a fix and fully testing it - to be sure we are not introducing other problems - takes time .
This is why Microsoft makes hot fixes available , and while we understand that hot fixes are not a perfect solution , they can help people get by while we perfect the long term solution .
We will keep you updated with specific plans to this issue as soon as we have confirmation .
Microsoft 's inability to fix a defect in such a basic feature has led to its share of conspiracy theories that would be quickly dismissed as kooky , were it not for the company 's steadfast refusal to provide any details about what 's causing the problem .
The top contender :
The inability to copy files without stalling is n't a bug at all , but rather the result of a digital rights management feature designed to protect Hollywood ( even if the rest of us have to cuss our way through four hours deleting a few gigs worth of crap ) .
To prove the point , one user found the problem went away when he ran an XP Pro Virtual Machine that was running on top of Vista .
Mysteriously , it took him about eight seconds to delete the 23GB of files he wanted to get rid of .
Using Vista on the same machine took him more than 25 minutes .
Hmm , maybe the DRM conspiracists are right after all . ®
Hillary Clinton 's chief campaign strategist met with Colombia 's ambassador to the U.S. on Monday to discuss a bilateral free - trade agreement , a pact the presidential candidate opposes .
Attendance by the adviser , Mark Penn , was confirmed by two Colombian officials .
He was n't there in his campaign role , but in his separate job as chief executive of Burson - Marsteller Worldwide , an international communications and lobbying firm .
The firm has a contract with the South American nation to promote congressional approval of the trade ...
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday June 15 2008
The article below refers to failed impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton and attempts to impeach him .
We should make it clear that Mr Clinton was successfully impeached by the House of Representatives but later cleared by the Senate .
From the beginning , it was Hillary who took charge .
' Look , ' she told the future President of the United States in a wood - panelled reading room at the Yale Law School library , 'if you 're going to keep staring at me , and I 'm going to keep staring back , we should at least introduce ourselves .
I'm Hillary Rodham .'
The year was 1970 , and Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham had just embarked on a lifetime of cinematic personal and public highs and lows .
As she did that flirty afternoon in New Haven , Connecticut , Hillary played a dominant role , one greater than many Clinton watchers ever realised .
With her discipline and determination and his almost supernatural charm , they made for a seemingly unconquerable couple - their marriage vows as resistant to scandal as their power was to political enemies .
But now , in the closing days of the 2008 Democratic presidential race , the Clintons ' luck is running out .
Blindsided by Obamamania , Hillary is almost certain to concede defeat in the weeks to come , abandoning her dream of a restoration , of returning to a White House the Clintons clearly assumed would be theirs again some day .
Indeed , the long - reigning royals of the Democratic Party must contemplate their greatest defeat with disbelief .
Their lifetime in politics has often been an absurd high - wire act , a constant defiance of natural political gravity .
Time and again they seemed beaten , broken , shamed - and each time they bounced back stronger than before .
The question now , in the twilight of Hillary 's campaign , is whether they can mount one last comeback , or whether the curtain has fallen at last on the Clinton era .
They were always an unlikely pair .
He was a rural Arkansas boy raised in a turbulent household .
She came from an upright middle - class Chicago suburb , raised by stern Methodist parents .
But their shared brilliance and a passion for politics bonded them , not least against Bill 's taste for a less cerebral brand of woman .
After law school , Hillary followed her love down to the alien terrain of Arkansas .
Even then , Bill was a minor legend , a Rhodes Scholar with irresistible charm and endless potential .
Though they were always equals in private , Hillary was content to subordinate herself publicly to his ambitions - although she may have simply been biding her time .
Last year , Her Way , a Clinton biography by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr , claimed the couple had a ' secret pact of ambition ' , a written 20 - year plan to make each of them president .
The Clintons deny it .
Elected Arkansas governor at just 32 , Bill suffered an early disaster - many more awaited him - when voters rejected him after one term .
Undaunted , he campaigned his way right back into the job in the next election .
Safely re-ensconced , Bill made his name with a rare combination of personal appeal and policy wonkery .
Hillary , who worked as a lawyer and focused on children 's advocacy , was a more awkward fit .
To accommodate Southern social mores , she adjusted her north - eastern feminist style of dress , hairdos , and even her name ( she would grudgingly trade in Rodham for Clinton ) - the first of countless image adjustments she would resent even as she perfected them .
Behind the scenes , however , she brought discipline and order to his unruly habits .
And as he came of political age in the Eighties , Bill 's timing was perfect .
The Democratic party was suffering a crisis of leadership .
Though now derided by some Democrats as a relic , even a reactionary , back then Bill was - much like Barack Obama today - a bold reformer .
The humiliating routs of Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 convinced Democratic elders that the party had to shake its image of northern liberalism , which was driving working - class white voters into the arms of the Republicans .
With his Southern drawl and moderate ' New Democrat ' philosophy Bill Clinton offered an ideal new face .
' The New Democrats saw themselves as reformers who ran against the entrenched interests of the Washington Democratic party and thought it was out of step with the rest of America , ' says Kenneth Baer , editor of the policy journal Democracy and author of a book about the New Democrats .
Thus in 1992 Bill Clinton was strongly pro-trade and argued that Democrats must embrace big business ( in contrast to the gritty anti-trade , anti-Wall Street populism of Hillary today ) .
But his signature issue was welfare reform that would require the poor to work for their benefits - an idea with intellectual merit that also signalled to white voters that Clinton would no longer blindly throw their tax dollars at the inner city .
( Clinton also defied black political leaders .
In 1992 , he enraged Jesse Jackson by denouncing the rapper Sister Souljah as racist , at a conference hosted by Jackson . )
While Clinton did have a populist bent of his own - he supported middle - class tax cuts and universal health care , and his slogan called for ' Putting People First ' - his goal was to recast Democrats in a more moderate image .
In a preview of the Clintons ' future , Bill 's 1992 presidential campaign was nearly snuffed out by personal scandal .
Longtime whispers of Clinton 's womanising grew louder when a sultry blonde named Gennifer Flowers went public , claiming to have had a long - term affair with him .
That forced Bill and Hillary to sit for a famous national television interview in which Bill pleaded contritely to ' causing pain in my marriage ' .
Then came the punishing revelation that Clinton had evaded the Vietnam War as a young man .
But after plummeting in the polls , he rebounded to finish a strong second in the critical New Hampshire primary , a result celebrated as tantamount to victory , and which propelled him to the nomination .
He was famously branded ' The Comeback Kid ' , a taste of things to come .
It was the start of America 's long and wearying acquaintance with Clintonian drama - as well as a growing obsession with Hillary 's role in their marriage .
During the Gennifer Flowers scandal , Hillary argued that , while she understood Bill 's flaws , she was n't just ' sitting here as some little woman " standing by my man " like Tammy Wynette ' .
The truth is that Hillary seemed to have committed herself to both a marriage and a political partnership with Bill , with all the flaws that entailed .
But the line sounded like a sneer at the millions of ' little women ' apparently less enlightened than Hillary .
Soon after , Hillary would defend her role as a working mother ( she was a white - shoe Arkansas lawyer ) by saying , ' I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas . '
Hillary had thus introduced herself as a snobby careerist with seeming disdain for middle American women .
It is an image she has spent 16 years working to shed , perhaps finally succeeding only in these waning days of her own presidential campaign .
In many ways , Barack Obama 's campaign has eerily echoed Bill Clinton 's 1992 candidacy .
Bill , too , campaigned on the themes of change and hope .
( He was even ' the Man from Hope ' . )
Clinton promised to cure a national malaise ( in 1992 a recession was under way - prompting the famous Clinton slogan , ' It 's the economy , stupid ' ) .
And like Obama , Bill contrasted his youth and freshness against an entrenched Washington insider : George HW Bush , father of the current president .
Clinton was elected by a comfortable margin .
On his inauguration day , he was just 46 years old - a year younger than Obama is today .
The Clinton era began , fittingly , in a state of chaos .
New to Washington , the Clintons were disorganised and error - prone , thanks in part to an inexperienced staff and Bill 's own lack of discipline .
They mishandled cabinet appointments .
US forays into Somalia and Haiti became fiascos .
Clinton dithered as war raged through the Balkans .
And a clumsily - executed bid to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military enraged generals and even some Democrats .
( Bill did push through a landmark economic plan , raising taxes on the wealthy to start reducing a huge budget deficit . )
And the scandals kept coming .
A conservative magazine reported new tales of Bill 's sexual adventures in Arkansas , including the claim by a former state employee named Paula Jones that Bill had invited her to a hotel room in 1991 and exposed himself , asking for sex .
The New York Times probed the Clintons ' investment in a failed real estate venture known as Whitewater , and whether Bill had improperly intervened with regulators .
( Years later the two stories would conjoin and explode , with the unwitting aid of a young White House intern . )
The Clintons ' lawyer and longtime friend , Vincent Foster , buckled under the strain and shot himself .
It was indicative of the passions the Clintons stirred that conspiracy - mongers claimed Hillary was having an affair with Foster , and perhaps had him killed .
( One right - wing congressman even re-enacted Foster 's death by shooting a melon in his back yard . )
Things were complicated by Hillary 's remarkable influence .
White House aides understood that she was effectively a co-president , particularly after Bill granted her an office in the West Wing .
The media was sceptical of this unprecedented role for a First Lady .
It did n't help when - in a fit of spirituality she has long since kept under wraps - she issued a grandiose call for a new ' politics of meaning ' to waken America from ' a sleeping sickness of the soul ' and help people find ' some core level meaning in our individual lives and meaning collectively ' .
( One disdainful profile in the New York Times dubbed her ' Saint Hillary ' . )
But nothing compared with the debacle of Hillary 's attempt to reform the US health care system .
At times Hillary showed herself a deft politician as she charmed congressional barons at committee hearings and in back rooms .
But ultimately her effort was defined by alleged secrecy , arrogance , and micro-management .
A fierce and demagogic campaign by business groups and partisan Republicans wrecked the grand project when it reached Congress in mid-1994 .
Hillary hatred reached new heights .
' Clinton entered the political scene as the first First Lady to offer herself up as an equal partner to the presidency , ' The New Republic 's Jonathan Chait recently noted in the Los Angeles Times .
' Tens of millions of Americans , mostly men , developed an irrational hatred for her ...
She simply represented the strong woman to them , and they hated her for it . '
Led by the firebrand Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich , conservatives stoked white working - class voters into a rage at a White House that seemed clueless , liberal , and run by a woman , for God 's sake !
In the 1994 midterm elections Republicans seized control of both Houses of Congress for the first time in four decades , with plans to severely trim the size and scope of the government .
At a press conference soon afterward , Bill Clinton was pathetically reduced to declaring , ' The president is still relevant here . '
Few in Washington believed it .
Indeed , for much of Clinton 's first term , he appeared destined for a one - term presidency that history would record as a grand failure .
It was an act of terror that kickstarted the next Clinton comeback .
On 19 April 1995 , a truck bomb devastated a federal government building in Oklahoma City , killing 168 people .
The bombing , perpetrated by domestic right - wing radicals , was Bill Clinton 's first chance to play the great protector - healer during a moment of national trauma .
' The president grew a foot taller as he began to fulfil his new role on the American stage , ' biographer Nigel Hamilton has written .
Clinton also benefited from the overreach of his legitimate political rivals - the egomaniacal Gingrich , speaker of the new Republican House of Representatives , and Gingrich 's ineffectual Senate counterpart , Bob Dole , who was to challenge Clinton 's re-election in 1996 .
Gingrich and Dole pressed for large budget cuts that Clinton spun as an assault on health , education and environmental spending .
When Republicans forced a brief budget shutdown over the dispute in late 1995 , Clinton cast them as scary radicals - and the public agreed .
Meanwhile , Clinton asserted himself abroad , finally using air power to quieten the Balkans and brokering new Middle East peace talks ( though he failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda ) .
He also enlisted the Machiavellian pollster Dick Morris to help him chart a centrist course between the Gingrich - Dole Republicans and his party 's left wing .
In the summer of 1996 , Clinton signed a Republican welfare reform plan that he felt was too harsh on the poor after Morris warned him that rejecting the bill would cost Clinton his re-election that autumn .
On the back of a humming economy and peaceful world , Clinton coasted past the 73 - year - old Republican candidate Bob Dole , who seemed a slightly doddering relic from another era , by a nine - point margin .
' Do you know who I am ? '
Clinton asked Gingrich during one of their contentious budget negotiation meetings , as it was dawning on the Republican that the president was still relevant after all .
' I 'm the big rubber clown doll you had as a kid .
And every time you hit it , it bounces back .
That 's me - the harder you hit me , the faster I come back up . '
Boing , boing , boing .
In the wake of the health care debacle , Hillary had suffered an extreme crisis of self - confidence .
She turned to self - help gurus , including the spiritual adviser Jean Houston , who encouraged Hillary to conduct imaginary conversations ( some branded them séances ) with the late Eleanor Roosevelt .
She lamented a media culture that glorified scandal over policy , for which she had a passion , publicly deriding those who ' believe that being negative is clever , being cynical is fashionable ' .
Yet she also understood political reality .
Her public foray away from the ceremonial role of First Lady had been a disaster , and the smartest response was simply to lay low .
By the time Bill 's second term began in 1997 , Hillary had taken on a soft - focus role , writing a book about children 's welfare ( It Takes a Village ) and travelling abroad to promote women 's rights .
Behind the scenes , however , she was still her husband 's most important adviser .
She quietly urged him to sign the welfare bill , and pressed him to choose her close friend Madeleine Albright as secretary of state , which in turn enhanced her influence over foreign policy .
At the start of Bill Clinton 's second term he seemed to be operating almost on autopilot .
The stock market was booming and the world was calm .
Republicans were humbled by their 1996 electoral defeat .
Bill had grown into the presidency .
Was it possible that the Clintonian drama had plateaued at last ?
No .
Just before dawn on Wednesday , 21 January 1998 , Bill Clinton shook his wife awake .
' You 're not going to believe this , but ...
There 's something in today 's papers . '
That ' something ' was the news that , from 1995 to 1996 , Clinton had carried on an affair with a former White House intern named Monica Lewinsky .
Like stars colliding to form a horrendous black hole , the Clinton scandals had finally converged .
Lewinsky had been discovered - thanks to her treacherous ' friend ' Linda Tripp - by lawyers for Paula Jones , who was pressing a sexual harassment lawsuit against the president ( which he had foolishly refused to settle ) .
Soon , word reached Kenneth Starr , a conservative judge leading an official investigation into Whitewater .
Starr began examining whether Clinton had obstructed justice by telling Lewinsky to lie to Jones 's lawyers .
His resulting ' Starr Report ' , in September 1998 , chronicled the affair in pornographic detail , right down to the president 's erotic use of a cigar .
Bill almost did n't make it .
Many pundits declared that if his initial denials - ' I did not have sexual relations with that woman ' - proved false , he would be finished .
Clinton 's lie ( repeated to Starr under oath ) was exposed by the semen - stained dress Lewinsky had once worn on one of the many days she ' serviced ' the president , including while he was on the telephone to congressmen and world leaders .
With Clinton exposed by DNA evidence and Republicans preparing impeachment proceedings , top Democrats privately discussed forcing out the president , so Al Gore could claim the office in time to erase the Lewinsky stain , as it were , for his 2000 presidential bid .
Once again , the Clintons were blessed by useful enemies .
Starr and the leaders of the Republican impeachment proceedings overplayed their hands , and came across as puritanical zealots .
The economy continued to thrive : incomes were rising , poverty was falling , and the Internet boom was minting huge amounts of new stock market wealth .
Americans disapproved of Clinton 's character , but his job approval ratings rarely dipped below a commanding 60 per cent .
And perhaps most critically , Hillary Clinton again chose to stand by her man .
Though disgusted with her husband 's libido , she fought harder than ever for his political fate .
She lobbied Democratic congressmen not to abandon Bill , telling one , ' I 'm the field general of this operation . '
And she fumed at a media establishment the Clintons felt had always hated them .
The real story of impeachment , Hillary claimed , was ' this vast , right - wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president ' .
Impeachment was a failure .
Clinton was acquitted by the Senate .
And in the 1998 midterm elections , Republicans lost several seats in Congress .
Boing .
Impeachment unexpectedly drove Hillary Clinton 's popularity to unprecedented levels , and while many Americans still despised her , she clearly had the support base for an independent political career .
In early 1999 she began plotting a run for Senate from New York .
Although Hillary had no ties to the state she was popular there , and , according to Her Way , she felt that New Yorkers ' were savvy enough to reject the media - fed stereotype of her and instead accept her on her own terms ' .
She announced her candidacy a year later , taking centre stage at last - and the first step towards an eventual run for president .
Hillary 's 2000 Senate campaign would foreshadow her 2008 presidential bid .
After years of suffering Bill 's chaos , she managed her own operation in highly methodical fashion .
She travelled the state endlessly , hoping to re-introduce herself to the public as a genial and moderate woman , not the imperious leftist she had seemed before .
She fanatically controlled the media , keeping reporters at a distance and perfecting the art of saying nothing interesting .
Bill aided her by staying out of the way .
His final months as president were defined by foreign affairs , including the Kosovo bombing campaign , brinkmanship with Saddam Hussein , and a last - ditch Middle East peace push .
The Clintons did leave office in January 2001 on a disgraceful note , after a last - minute rush of presidential pardons that appeared tied to money and favouritism .
But by that time Hillary had comfortably defeated her Republican rival and was an elected official in her own right .
In the Senate , Hillary continued her reinvention .
Long gone was the ' politics of meaning ' and grand ambitions like universal health care .
Now Hillary was an incrementalist , a humble workhorse .
She attended obscure committee hearings and never grandstanded .
Battling her lingering image as a fierce partisan , she worked with conservative Republicans , even those who had tried to impeach Bill .
Everything seemed to be going according to plan .
Conventional wisdom settled around the idea - which several years earlier would have seemed ludicrous - that Hillary was a president - in - waiting .
But something unpredictable would prove her undoing : the war in Iraq .
As president , Bill Clinton had promoted an assertive foreign policy , in the belief that the world 's lone superpower had important interests and obligations abroad .
Hillary shared that philosophy , supporting her husband 's bombing campaigns in the Balkans and his repeated missile strikes against Saddam Hussein .
In a little - noted speech during her Senate campaign she cautioned against thinking ' that we should intervene with force only when we face splendid little wars that we surely can win , preferably by overwhelming force in a relatively short period of time .
To those who believe we should become involved only if it is easy to do , I think we have to say that America has never and should not ever shy away from the hard task if it is the right one . '
Iraq in particular had bedevilled Bill Clinton , who was convinced Saddam did possess WMD stockpiles .
But many Democratic strategists , including the Clintons ' new favourite pollster , Mark Penn , argued that only by demonstrating their ' toughness ' on national security could Democrats win elections in the post - 9/11 world .
Moreover , as a woman hoping to be commander in chief , Hillary was no doubt reluctant to appear ' weak ' .
And so , in October 2002 , she voted to authorise war in Iraq .
When John Kerry succumbed to George Bush in 2004 , the 2008 Democratic nomination seemed to be Hillary 's for the taking .
The Clintons had developed a massive political , intellectual and fundraising network .
Hillary was loved by many Democrats ; there was sympathy not least for the humiliations Bill had heaped upon her , combined with real respect for her formidable political acumen .
At the same time , Bill had disinfected his own reputation , running a foundation which addressed global challenges like Aids and climate change , and achieving a kind of supra-political statesman status .
Their personal drama also seemed to be receding , as Bill and Hillary developed independent lives - she spent most of her time in Washington , while he travelled or stayed at home in Chappaqua , in New York state .
Though some questioned her broader electability , Hillary initially seemed a good bet for her party 's nomination .
Kerry would not run again ( to the relief of many Democrats ) , nor would the newly - rehabilitated Al Gore .
Democratic contenders like John Edwards , Joe Biden and Bill Richardson all seemed slight in comparison .
As the Iraq war descended into a catastrophe , Hillary was castigated by liberals for her war vote .
Yet her subsequent critiques of the war seemed to insulate her .
As late as 2006 , after all , she faced no significant Democrat who had openly opposed the war from the start .
By that time , an electric buzz had grown around the young Senator from Illinois , Barack Obama .
Obama had dazzled the Democratic Party with a stirring speech at the party 's summer 2004 national convention .
Obama was especially appealing to Democratic activists because he had opposed the Iraq war .
Still , the notion that a first - term Senator could simply plunge into a presidential race seemed ludicrous - or so the Clintons felt .
In hindsight , it seems clear that Hillary was too complacent about the challenge Obama presented .
She dismissed him as a lightweight , and imagined that the hype around his speeches would inevitably fade .
What 's more , one suspects that Hillary had developed a sense of entitlement .
She and Bill had become Democratic royalty , and felt that in some sense the nomination belonged to her .
Certainly this newcomer , who had paid no dues , shed no blood and tears , could n't possibly snatch it away .
But like so many entrenched politicians , Hillary made the mistake of misjudging the public mood .
She spent too long harping on her ' experience ' , underscoring her roots in Washington at a time when furious voters wanted to see the Capitol flushed out .
( In one recent national poll , 85 per cent of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the direction of the country . )
She also argued repeatedly that she had been ' tested ' in the fires of American politics .
' I 've been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for about 16 years now .
And I 'm still here , ' she told one interviewer .
Clinton aides made it known they could fight as ruthlessly as any Republican , and would never , ever allow Hillary to be caricatured and maligned as John Kerry and Al Gore had been .
But Obama turned these points against her .
It was time to ' turn the page ' , he argued , and move on from the ' divisive ' battles of the past .
Experience ' was n't the bar that mattered , ' says one senior party strategist .
' What [ Obama ] offers matters more to voters . '
And every point Obama made about change and a new direction was buttressed by the fact that , around the time Hillary was supporting the Iraq war , Obama had spoken out publicly against it .
It did n't help that , after a few years of dormancy , the bad old Bill returned .
As Obama ascended , Bill Clinton seemed unable to stand the indignity .
( He may also have been madly jealous that Obama was supplanting him as the most beloved Democrat in the land . )
Bill began to stray off - message , and to lash out at enemies real and imagined .
He churlishly sought to diminish Obama 's opposition to the Iraq war as ' a fairly tale ' , and clumsily downplayed his own supportive words for the invasion .
He repeatedly scolded reporters about their coverage in made - for - TV fits of pique .
And most devastating , he sealed the stampede of black support to Obama when , before the important South Carolina primary on 26 January , Bill sought to diminish Obama 's impending win there by reminding people that Jesse Jackson had carried the state as well .
To many Democrats , it appeared perilously close to race - baiting , an effort to marginalise Obama as a ' black candidate ' with limited appeal .
Meanwhile , the presidential trail exposed the limitations of Hillary 's political skill .
She was a mechanical speaker , all the more so compared with her husband .
Role reversal had put both Clintons in an uncomfortable spot .
' Bill had great difficulty playing the role of supporter and advocate for her , which she always played for him quite effectively , ' says Sally Bedell Smith , author of For Love of Politics , a study of the Clintons .
' And she struggled because she 's not the natural politician that he is . '
Many other things went wrong for Hillary .
Her strategists failed her by not crafting a plan for an extended nomination fight , which allowed Obama to scoop up critical delegates in states she never really contested .
And she refused to apologise for her Iraq vote , defending her rationale when voters probably just would have preferred an admission of error .
As her campaign sank , Hillary found an unexpected new image .
Shedding her longtime image of a cultural elitist , she styled herself as a populist .
Suddenly Obama was the snooty elitist , and Hillary the tribune of the working - class Americans who had long been suspicious of her .
Where she was once the ultimate policy wonk , a paragon of educated expertise , she was now deriding economists who mocked her gimmicky and demagogic proposal for a gas tax holiday as out of touch with working America .
And a woman who felt constant resentment at the national obsession with her gender began talking constantly about her gender , claiming that she had been the victim of ' sexism ' in the campaign .
And although her campaign had long been predicated on a carefully constructed image of strength , when she got in trouble Hillary increasingly played a damsel - in - distress card , as when she complained that the men onstage at debates were ganging up on her .
Or , most famously , when she welled up at a public event on the eve of the New Hampshire primary , apparently sending droves of sympathetic women to the polls to rescue her .
It was not enough to save her .
Although , at the time of going to press , Hillary has not officially conceded , her chances of overtaking Obama are close to nil .
This campaign , then , will be the most resounding defeat the Clintons have faced .
Their reputations and influence will have been diminished .
But few who follow them closely believe this is the end .
' Politics is the rocket fuel that runs the two of them , ' says Bedell Smith .
' And I just can't imagine that they 're not already thinking about the next campaign . '
That could mean a vice presidential bid on Obama 's ticket , though it 's difficult to see that as anything but a deeply awkward and fraught marriage for all involved .
Or maybe a Hillary bid for governor of New York , or perhaps leader of a Democratic Senate .
Or maybe something more .
Those close to the Clintons say they truly believe that Obama - due to his inexperience , his race , his infamous Chicago pastor - cannot defeat John McCain this autumn .
And should that happen , the Clintons will waste no time in proclaiming that they told us so .
Reeling from a horrid defeat , Democrats may even listen .
' They think he 's going to get destroyed , ' says a Democratic insider , ' and the party 's theirs again . '
No one who has witnessed the fantastical saga of Bill and Hillary Clinton could call that impossible .

This image often accompanies the " strawberry meth " warning
The warning said that the drug was being given to children outside their school gates .
At least 80 schools in west Oxfordshire received an e-mail warning , leading to some holding special assemblies .
Thames Valley Police said the error was down to an officer new in his post who had received an e-mail internally and had acted in good faith .
The force sent out a retraction after discovering it had been the victim of a hoax , and said no such incidents had taken place .
The officer should have double checked
Ch Insp Dennis Evernden
Ch Insp Dennis Evernden , of Thames Valley Police , said : " We would like to apologise for any unnecessary concern that we may have caused to schools or parents by sending this warning out about a drug that proved to be a hoax .
" One of our officers , who is new to his post , received the e-mail internally in good faith and forwarded it on to the schools in West Oxfordshire to warn them .
" But after checking its veracity , it was found to be a hoax and a retraction was issued the next day .
" The officer should have double checked before taking this action , which he did take with the best intentions , and we will be making sure this sort of thing does not happen again . "
Last year , the charity DrugScope said it believed the hoax e-mail originated in the United States .
It said there was no evidence to suggest that crystal meth - an illegal drug - flavoured with strawberries was circulating in the UK .
A Thames Valley Police spokeswoman said the force would not be holding an internal inquiry over the incident but , instead , it would be reminding its staff of necessary procedures .

There has been lots of discussion on the Haskell mailing lists about the speed of Haskell .
There are many conflicting opinions , and lots of different advice .
Some of the information on Haskell 's performance is written as a sales pitch , some is based on outdated knowledge .
Since I 've been working on optimisation for a while , I thought I 'd try and give a snapshot of Haskell performance .
Most of the following is personal opinion , and others could quite validly disagree .
Since GHC is the best performing Haskell compiler , I have used Haskell to mean GHC with the - O2 flag throughout .
If you write Haskell in a standard manner , it is unlikely to perform as fast as C .
In most cases , linked - lists are slower than arrays .
Laziness is more expensive than strictness .
The Haskell code will almost always be shorter , and more concise , since it will abstract over low - level detail .
But by writing that low - level detail in the C code , you are likely to produce faster code .
If you use GHC , with unboxed operations , written in a low - level style , you can obtain similar performance to C .
The Haskell wo n't be as nice as it was before , but will still probably express fewer details than the C code .
Writing in such a low - level manner requires more knowledge of Haskell , and is probably something that a beginner should not be attempting .
However , for a critical inner loop , low - level Haskell is a very attractive option .
The back end assembly generator in GHC is a weak link , but improvements are being carried out .
After this work has been finished , it is likely that low - level Haskell will be able to produce nearly identical assembly code to C.Some of the central Haskell libraries have functions which are badly optimised .
For example , the MTL library is known to be poorly performing .
Theandfunctions in the base library are n't very good .
These issues are being addressed over time , the Binary and ByteString libraries have fixed two holes .
A new implementation ofhas been contributed .
Over time , more issues will be identified and fixed , improving the speed of all code .
A lot of clever people have done a lot of clever work on making multi- threaded programming in Haskell both simple and fast .
While low - level speed matters for general programming , for multi- threaded programming there are lots of much higher - level performance considerations .
Haskell supports better abstraction , and can better optimise at this level , outperforming C.A standard advice to people trying to optimise Haskell is to read the Core - the low - level functional language used as an intermediate form in the compiler .
While Core provides much useful information about what optimisations were performed , it is n't easy to read , and takes a lot of practice .
Some effort has been done to make reading Core easier , but I still would n't recommend it for beginners .
People often want to make programs run faster .
In general , this activity is a waste of time .
I recently wrote a program for the HCI group at my university , which takes 10 minutes to run , and requires 4 Gb of RAM , on a very expensive machine .
I have n't even bothered to profile the program , because I have better things to do .
Unless the speed of something actually makes a difference , you should not be spending excessive effort on optimisation .
If you have determined that the program in question is running too slowly , then profile .
After profiling , you can usually identify some small part of the program that needs optimisation .
Too often there is a focus on speeding up something that is not slow enough to make a difference .
As time goes buy , higher - level programs keep getting faster and faster .
The ByteString work allows programmers to write high - level programs that are competitive with C. Performance enhancements are being made to the compiler regularly , pointer tagging , constructor specialisation etc. are all helping to improve things .
More long term projects such as Supero and NDP are showing some nice results .
Optimisation is a difficult problem , but progress is being made , allowing programs to be written in a higher - level .
My goal is that one day Haskell programs will be written in a very declarative , high - level style - and outperform C at the same time .
I think this goal is obtainable , albeit some way in the future .
April consumer confidence slumps to 26 - year low
U.S. consumer confidence fell to its lowest in more than a quarter century in early April , diving deeper into recessionary territory on heightened worries over inflation and jobs , a survey showed on Friday .
The Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index of confidence fell to 63.2 in April from 69.5 in March , well below economists ' median expectation of a slight fall to 69.0 , according to a Reuters poll .
The April result is the lowest since March 1982's level of 62.0 , when the " stagflationary " period of low growth and high inflation was still fresh in the memory of many Americans .
Near - term inflation expectations measured by the survey jumped to the highest since the turmoil following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait in late 1990 , which caused oil prices to rise sharply .
" It 's really bad , " Carl Lantz , interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York , said about the report .
" It confirms what we already know now that we are in a consumer - led recession , and it 's going to be a pretty protracted one . "
On Wall Street , stocks .
DJI .IXIC .SPX extended their losses and the dollar fell further versus the yen .
Government bond prices , which generally benefit from weak economic data , briefly extended their gains .
The report 's reading of one - year inflation expectations jumped to 4.8 percent -- the highest since a similar reading in October 1990 -- from 4.3 percent in March .
Five - year inflation expectations rose to 3.1 percent -- the highest since December 2007 -- from 2.9 percent in March .
The index of expectations for personal finances fell to 97 , the lowest since April 1980 when it was 94 , from 112 in March .
The index of current personal finances fell to 87 , its lowest since November 1982 , when it was 85 , from 93 in March .
" The April loss was due to rising inflation and shrinking income gains , " the Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said in a statement .
" There have only been a dozen other surveys that have recorded a lower level of consumer sentiment in the more than 50 - year history of the survey . "
On the small , remote island of Diego Garcia , in the Indian Ocean halfway between Africa and Indonesia , the United States has one of the most secretive military bases in the world .
From its position almost 10,000 miles closer to the Persian Gulf than the east coast of the United States , this huge U.S. air and naval base has been a major , if little known , launch pad for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In the past year , the Bush administration has made improvements that point toward its use in a possible attack on Iran .
The administration recently admitted what it had long denied and what journalists , human rights investigators , and others had long suspected :
The island has also been part of the CIA ’s secret " rendition " program for captured terrorist suspects .
While few know about the base on Diego Garcia  it has long been off - limits to all non-military personnel  even fewer know how it came into being .
To create the base , the United States , with the help of Great Britain , exiled all the indigenous people of Diego Garcia and the surrounding Chagos Archipelago .
Between 1968 and 1973 , U.S. and U.K. officials forcibly removed around 2,000 people , called Chagossians , 1,200 miles away to islands in the western Indian Ocean .
Left on the docks of Mauritius and the Seychelles with no resettlement assistance , the Chagossians , whose ancestry in Chagos dated to the 18th century , have grown deeply impoverished in exile .
Diego Garcia has become another Guantánamo in more ways than one :
The product of years of deception and lies , a far more secretive detention facility than the Cuban prison , the cause of immense suffering and pain for an entire people , Diego Garcia has become mark of shame for the United States that must be repaired .
Creating a Base , Expelling a People
The Chagossians ’ ancestors first settled the previously uninhabited Chagos Archipelago in the late 18th century when their ancestors were brought from Africa and India as enslaved and indentured laborers to build and work on coconut plantations run by Franco - Mauritians .
Over nearly two centuries , this diverse group developed into a distinct , emancipated society and a people known initially as the Ilois  the Islanders .
While far from luxurious , their life by the mid-20th century was secure , generally free of want , and featured universal employment and numerous social benefits , including regular if small salaries , land , free housing , education , pensions , burial services , and basic health care in islands described by many as " idyllic . "
That is until the late 1950s , when U.S. military officials identified Diego Garcia as a perfect location for a base .
In many ways , the original idea for Diego Garcia presaged the " lily pad " basing strategy of today : Facing a wave of decolonization , national security officials worried about rising local opposition to overseas U.S. bases and the threat of eviction posed by local governments .
At the same time , officials increasingly wanted to introduce U.S. military forces into the Indian Ocean as a way to exert control over the Middle East and surrounding areas of the decolonizing world .
Their solution was what the U.S. Navy called the " Strategic Island Concept , " a plan to identify small strategically located islands with small local populations that the United States or its western allies could acquire as future base sites and that would be insulated from any local threats .
Quickly Diego Garcia emerged as a prime target for acquisition given its relative proximity to potential conflict zones from the Persian Gulf to southern Africa and southern Asia , space for harboring an armada of ships and an airstrip , and a small , little known population whose removal would generate little attention .
In 1960 , the U.S. Navy began secret conversations with the British Government about Diego Garcia .
Over the next several years , U.S. officials secured British agreement to turn the island into a military colony , called the British Indian Ocean Territory , and , as classified documents show , to provide " exclusive control " of Diego Garcia " without local inhabitants . "
The two governments finalized the deal with a 1966 " exchange of notes " that in key respects resembles the recent " declaration of principles " on the future U.S. military presence in Iraq signed by the Bush administration and the Iraqi cabinet : it effectively created a treaty but circumvented all congressional and parliamentary oversight .
Separate secret agreements provided for $ 14 million in undisclosed U.S. payments to allow Britain to create the territory and to take those " administrative measures " necessary to deport the Chagossians .
Those " administrative measures " meant that beginning in 1968 , islanders leaving Chagos for vacations or medical treatment on the island of Mauritius were barred from returning to their homes and marooned 1,200 miles away .
British officials next began restricting supplies to the islands , and by the turn of the decade more Chagossians were leaving as food and medicines dwindled .
In cooperation with U.S. officials , the British meanwhile designed a public relations plan aimed at , as one official put it , " maintaining the fiction " that the Chagossians were transient contract workers rather than people with roots in Chagos for five generations or more .
In 1971 , the U.S. Navy began construction on Diego Garcia and ordered the British to complete the removals .
First , U.K. agents and U.S. soldiers on Diego Garcia herded up the Chagossians ’ pet dogs and gassed and burned them in front of their traumatized owners .
Then , British agents forced the people to board overcrowded cargo ships and left them on the docks in Mauritius and the Seychelles .
Upon arrival , the Chagossians received no resettlement assistance and soon found themselves living in what a 1975 Washington Post article called " abject poverty . "
Numbering around 5,000 today and still in exile , most remain deeply impoverished .
Wars for Oil and Global Dominance
While the Chagossians were being exiled , the Pentagon sold Diego Garcia to Congress as an " austere " communications facility .
As its planners had always envisioned , however , it soon expanded dramatically .
It was pressed into service almost immediately as a base for reconnaissance planes in the 1973 Israeli - Arab war .
In the years that followed , the base played a central role in the first large - scale thrust of U.S. military strength into the Middle East .
After the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 , Presidents Carter and Reagan developed a " Rapid Deployment Force " ( RDF ) at bases in the region to respond to any future threats to U.S. and western oil supplies .
As a main hub for the RDF , Diego Garcia saw the " most dramatic build - up of any location since the Vietnam War . "
Subsequently , the RDF transformed into the U.S. Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , which came to lead three wars in Iraq and Afghanistan directly related to securing U.S. and global oil supplies and maintaining the regional and global dominance of the United States .
Diego Garcia played a critical role in each war .
During the first Gulf War , Diego Garcia sent 18 prepositioned ships from its lagoon loaded with weaponry and supplies to outfit thousands of marines massing in Saudi Arabia while serving as a launch pad for long - range bombers attacking Iraqi forces .
After the 1991 war , the military began transforming the island into one of a handful of major " forward operating bases " as part of a shift of U.S. forces eastward away from European bases .
The dream for many in the military became the ability to strike any location on the planet from Barksdale Air Base in Louisiana , Guam in the Pacific , or Diego Garcia .
Following the September 2001 attacks on the United States , the base has assumed even more importance in the eyes of military officials .
Within weeks of September 11 , the Pentagon added 2,000 Air Force personnel at a new 30 - acre housing facility called " Camp Justice . "
In the 2001 war , B - 1 , B - 2 , and B - 52 bomber flights originating on Diego Garcia dropped more ordnance on Afghanistan than any other units .
Leading up to the invasion of Iraq , weaponry and supplies prepositioned in the lagoon were again among the first to arrive at staging areas near Iraq ’s borders .
The once - secret 2002 " Downing Street " memorandum showed that U.S. war planners considered basing access on Diego Garcia " critical " to the invasion .
Bombers from the island ultimately helped launch the Bush administration ’s tragic war that has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and thousands of U.S. troops .
In early 2007 , as the Bush administration was upping the tenor of its rhetoric against Iran and threatening another invasion , the Defense Department awarded a $ 31.9 million contract to build a new submarine base on the island .
The subs can launch Tomahawk cruise missiles and ferry Navy SEALs for amphibious missions behind enemy lines .
Around the same time , the military began shipping extra fuel supplies to Diego Garcia for possible wartime use .
Long off limits to reporters , the Red Cross , and all other international observers and far more secretive than Guantánamo Bay , many long suspected the island was a clandestine CIA " black site " for high - profile detainees .
Journalist Stephen Grey ’s 2006 book Ghost Plane documented the presence on the island of a CIA - chartered plane used for rendition flights .
On two occasions former U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey publicly named Diego Garcia as a detention facility .
A Council of Europe report named the atoll , along with those in Poland and Romania , as a secret prison .
For more than six years U.S. and U.K. officials adamantly denied the allegations .
This February , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband announced to Parliament : " Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia has not been used for rendition flights , recent U.S. investigations have now revealed two occasions , both in 2002 , when this had in fact occurred . "
A representative for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Rice called Miliband to express regret over the " administrative error . "
The State Department ’s chief legal adviser said CIA officials were " as confident as they can be " that no other detainees had been held on the island , and CIA Director Michael Hayden continues to deny the existence of a CIA prison on the island .
Within days , UN special investigator Manfred Novak announced new evidence that others had been imprisoned on the island .
Many suspect the United States may hold detainees on secret prison ships in Diego Garcia ’s lagoon or elsewhere in the waters of Chagos .
Resistance and Remedy
Since their expulsion , the Chagossians have protested in the streets , petitioned , and held hunger strikes to regain the right to return to their homeland and win proper compensation for their expulsion .
In recent years , they have taken the U.S. and U.K. governments as well as former U.S. government officials and military contractors to court over their claims .
To date , U.S. courts have found no wrongdoing on the part of the government , its officials , or contractors for what one judge described as the " improper misplacement of the plaintiffs . "
The government has consistently denied all responsibility for the Chagossians .
In Britain , by contrast , the islanders have won three major victories over the British government .
Three times  in 2000 , 2006 , and 2007  the High Court in London has ruled the islanders ’ expulsion illegal under U.K. law .
In June , the people will head to the House of Lords , Britain ’s highest court , for the government ’s final appeal over the right to return .
Another victory could finally open the way for a return to Chagos .
With support for the Chagossians ’ struggle growing in both the United States and Britain at the same time that revelations about a secret CIA prison are spreading , the United States must finally act to remedy the damage done by another Guantánamo damaging too many lives and undermining its international legitimacy .
The United States must allow the Chagossians to return and assist Britain in paying them proper compensation ; the United States must close the detention facilities and open Diego Garcia to international investigators ; the United States must end the painful irony that is a base the military calls the " Footprint of Freedom . "
He took me right into his office , and I told him what you said , and he 'll be ready for you at two o'clock .
Might not the same history be told of much that is believed ?
" I told him high altitudes and high livin ' would do any man — "
Again he was silent .
Yes , dearest Philothea ; but not till she had first told me of her own marriage with Geta .
They gently raised him , bolstered him with pillows , and told him he had long been ill .
Eudora 's countenance kindled with indignation , as she listened to what Milza had told .
Is that brother of hers you told me about still makin ' up to that party ?
" I told your father that this morning , " and he resumed his writing .
I told Coplen to offer her a million cash for everything rather 'n have any fuss .
Which was very ugly in me , and I cried afterwards and told her how sorry I was .
Buy a Mac , get TextMate !
Update : Please no more letters asking for free licenses !
I get a fair number of letters asking me to port TextMate to other platforms ( not to mention that “ textmate for windows ” is now in the top 5 of search phrases I receive hits for ) — mostly I politely reply that I am presently not interested in doing a port ( from now on though , I will just send a link to this post ) .
Occasionally I write a bit more , as was the case with Chris Campbell .
He sent me back the image below where you can see part of the conversation ( click to enlarge ) .
I love how Chris took the time to set this up and email me the picture .
It deserves to be preserved in the form of a blog post :)
It also made me look into setting up a dedicated program for “ buy a Mac , get TextMate for free ” ( in a way where I would still get some revenue ) .
Unfortunately Amazon ’s operating agreement for their affiliate program says :
In addition , you may not : ( a ) directly or indirectly offer any person or entity any consideration or incentive ( including , without limitation , payment of money ( including any rebate ) , or granting of any discount or other benefit ) for using Special Links on your site to access the Amazon.com Site ( e.g. , by implementing any “ rewards ” program for persons or entities who use Special Links on your site to access the Amazon.com Site ) ;
That is no good .
At Apple I can only find a .
Mac affiliate program .
So does anyone have an idea about how to handle this ?
And preferably in a way where it could be fully automated .
General
Executive function has big implications for the design of domestic violence programs .
It is important to know the subtypes of batterers because different subtypes have different needs for treatment , and different levels of intervention that are necessary to ensure safety .
I ’ll refer to some very recent studies that address domestic violence and executive function problems .
Research on domestic violence and cognitive problems largely centers around executive function that is known to be managed in the frontal cortex of the brain .
Footballs have no frontal cortex at all , and will hit anyone .
But you knew that .
One of the key aspects of executive function deficits is impulsivity .
However , as with all neat categories that we are learning vast amounts of information about , impulsivity is a multidimensional construct .
Neuropsychological testing does not do a lot to help us assess impulsivity , especially in our efforts to prevent violence .
The best way to assess it , is to look at the person ’s behavior in real - life situations .
For therapists , social programs , and physicians , that means that it is folly to think that you have assessed a person suspected of domestic violence by talking to them , in so far as impulsivity is concerned .
Getting collateral information ( talking to family members , looking at arrest record and other background information ) is essential .
There is even a study that is encouraging for assessing impulsivity in clinical settings for some people .
A key question about impulsivity is how much the problem is a matter of impaired restraint , as opposed to how much the strength of the impulse is the problem .
Is it the intensity of the drive to act , or is it a poor ability to exercise “ free wo n’t ” by resisting an urge ( a failure of inhibitory control ) .
Or is it both ?
In one study of violent offenders , time pressure reduced inhibition of errors , supporting the idea of frontal cortical deficits because the violent offenders in the test only performed poorly under time pressure conditions in which they had less ability to exercise conscious control .
This suggests that inhibitory control may play a larger role .
It suggests that batterers do n’t need to be more emotionally aroused prior to being violent so much as that many are impaired in exercising control .
The study of suicide is an allied area , because it is a violent act and can be associated with violence against others in various ways .
A recent study showed executive dyscontrol in actively suicidal people .
The researchers believed that there was a state - dependent component .
This is a subject for another post , but dissociation and triggers of behavior and emotion are very important here .
In this study , impaired decision making was the strongest feature .
Suicidal ideation without a strong impulse to act , says the article , was more likely to have rigid thinking behind it .
However , both ( thinkers and those at higher risk ) had higher levels of aggression .
We need to look at every angle on how to improve treatment and sentencing , because the rates of recidivism are high .
This is especially true for people with criminal lifestyles .
Those who were prone to using weapons in violence , who engaged in other crimes , and who used drugs were very likely to batter , abuse drugs , or engage in other criminal activity over ten years following arraignment ( when the study began ) .
The first year , rates were roughly half of the full duration .
This dynamic gives the impression that arrests , programs , restraining orders , and other measures are more effective than they actually are , because many studies do not look beyond a year .

For those of you who do n’t know me personally , let me explain something about myself .
I ’m a smart guy who is socially retarded .
I can explain calculus to people who do n’t know math .
I own at trivia .
I have a capacity to remember all sorts of stuff that most people , rightfully so , would never bother to remember .
Sometimes it ’s spooky .
However , I will also probably forget your name if I meet you and there is a good chance I ’ll make a very bad first impression , probably inadvertently saying something offensive .
( I was told at my going away party I yelled at someone telling them that “ BORNEO ISN ’T A COUNTRY .
IT ’S AN ISLAND ! ” )
.. anyway , I digress .
The reason I bring that up is because I noticed something today that I am probably one of only a small handful of people who would have noticed and been in a position to notice .
I visited the Solomon Islands national museum on Wednesday .
The National Museum is n’t really anything to write home about .
It ’s surrounded by a rusty fence .
The one building with exhibits is pretty old and grungy .
I was the only visitor there and they had to open up the gift shop just for me .
So I suppose that ’s the first thing …. most people who visit the Solomons ( and there are n’t many ) do n’t bother to go to the museum .
In the museum , they had all sorts of carved sculptures , artwork , photos and artifacts from the Solomon Islands .
It was n’t the level of a display you might expect at a western museum , but that should n’t be expected .
It got the job done and the lady working at museum was very nice and informative .
While wandering around all the Melanesian artwork and artifacts I came across something which was very out of place .
It was an engraved plaque .
It was an engraved plaque with the Apollo XVII mission patch on it .
On the plaque was a small acrylic sphere with a tiny piece of rock in the middle .
A moon rock .
It was collected in the Taurus - Littrow Highlands of the moon , and it was sitting in a exhibit of Melanesian artifacts in Honoria .
The plaque said it was given to the people of the Solomon Islands by President Carter on July 7 , 1978 on the occasion of their independence .
Most people would have noticed the moon rock .
There is nothing special in that .
I however knew something else .
There have been several hundred moon rocks given as goodwill gifts by the United States .
About half of them are missing .
They might be sitting in a cabinet somewhere or might be in the home of some bureaucrat who was in a position to take the moon rock home 30 years ago .
However , many of them have been flat out stolen and sold on the black market to collectors .
On a per gram basis , moon rocks might very well be one of the most valuable things on Earth .
One recent case in the news ( where I read about all of this ) had someone trying to sell the stolen moon rock given to Malta for $ 5,000,000 !!!
In public auctions , pieces of the moon have sold for $ 400,000 for tiny fragments .
It was that knowledge that had my heart racing when I noticed something else …..
the glass display case had no lock … .
the glass display case was wide open …..
I was alone in the room …..
I ’d be lying if I did n’t say there was a moment of temptation .
I , and I alone it would seem , was the only person who had laid eyes on this thing in years who probably knew the real value of it to collectors .
No one probably would have noticed it missing for months if not years .
( If I had replaced it with a fake , maybe even longer )
Five million dollars in the size of a big marble just sitting there unprotected .
With my warped values however , I figured it would make for a better blog post that it would selling it .
Besides , I ’d really be a shitty human beings if I stole from the poorest country in the world .
I mentioned going to the museum later in the day to the guy at the travel agency who booked my tickets through to Honolulu .
He mentioned that there had been several break - ins at the museum .
What was stolen you ask ???
Shell and feather money which is still used as currency on some of the islands .
If you want an example of the different values other cultures have , I can think of no better example .
They broke in to steal the pacific equivalent of wampum and left the $ 5 m moon rock .
Anyway , having decided not to turn to a life of crime , what to do next ?
Given how these things have disappeared over time around the world , it is probably just a matter of time until someone steals it .
( It may have been stolen before during the civil unrest here in 2000 ) If I tell someone who works at the museum about the value of it , there is a good chance they might just take it .
I have no clue who to talk to in a position of authority and , honestly , I do n’t think the security of moon rocks is very high on the agenda of the government of the Solomon Islands .
I figured the best thing to do was to make it public and hope that someone will pass this along to someone in NASA or the State Department who might be able to suggest to the Solomon Government they put it away .
Also , by making it public , if it disappears , it is going to make it very obvious that is it stolen and at least give and indication of when and where it happened .
( I suppose there is a risk of someone reading this , taking the first flight to the Solomons and stealing it , but I think that is slim , and moreover , having made this public , it would make it much harder to sell ) .
I will probably also stop by the US Consulate today because the office is in the same building as DHL and I need to send a package home .
So if anyone reading this knows someone in some position to do something , please pass this along .
It would be a shame to lose another one of these rocks to thieves .

Animal Torture Causes Wave of Anger
It seems no matter where you go in the world , people find it funny to torture and hurt innocent animals .
However , when Mrs. Chang discovered a cat covered in yellow paint on the roadside in Ban - Chiao , Taiwan , it caused a wave of condemnation and anger .
When Mrs. Chang brought the cat to the animal hospital emergency room , it was almost completely covered in Yellow paint .
The toxic Formalin has corroded it ’s body , causing it to vomit uncontrollably .
Dr. Liao , worried about the cats toxicity level , being 90 % covered in paint , decided not to try to think the paint with rosin spirit or paint thinners .
He instead added some water to kitty - litter and rubbed it over the paint covered area to soak up the paint and reduce the toxins entering the cat .
The vet gave the cat some liver medicine in hopes to help it process the toxins , but with all their efforts the are of coverage was just too large and the cat had already taken in too many toxins .
The staff was forced to watch as the cat gradually died in pain .
The animal hospital ’s staff indicated that this was not the first time they have seen animal pranks go to far .
Mrs. Chang was appalled that such cruel prank could be performed on animals and Dr. Liao added :
â€ œI ’ve run the hospital for over 20 years , this is the first â€˜paint - cat ’ case I ’ve seen that is of this gravity .
The skin , fur and paint all adhered together , there was no way to separate them.â€ 
This latest animal torture case has caused a lot of discussion and anger amongst the community and local officials in Taiwan .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass .--MIT engineers have improved the power output of one type of fuel cell by more than 50 percent through technology that could help these environmentally friendly energy storage devices find a much broader market , particularly in portable electronics .
The new material key to the work is also considerably less expensive than its conventional industrial counterpart , among other advantages .
" Our goal is to replace traditional fuel - cell membranes with these cost - effective , highly tunable and better - performing materials , " said Paula T. Hammond , Bayer Professor of Chemical Engineering and leader of the research team .
She noted that the new material also has potential for use in other electrochemical systems such as batteries .
The work was reported in a recent issue of Advanced Materials by Hammond , Avni A. Argun and J. Nathan Ashcraft .
Argun is a postdoctoral associate in chemical engineering ; Ashcraft is a graduate student in the same department .
Like a battery , a fuel cell has three principal parts : two electrodes ( a cathode and anode ) separated by an electrolyte .
Chemical reactions at the electrodes produce an electronic current that can be made to flow through an appliance connected to the battery or fuel cell .
The principal difference between the two "
Fuel cells get their energy from an external source of hydrogen fuel , while conventional batteries draw from a finite source in a contained system .
The MIT team focused on direct methanol fuel cells ( DMFCs ) , in which the methanol is directly used as the fuel and reforming of alcohol down to hydrogen is not required .
Such a fuel cell is attractive because the only waste products are water and carbon dioxide ( the latter produced in small quantities ) .
Also , because methanol is a liquid , it is easier to store and transport than hydrogen gas , and is safer ( it wo n't explode ) .
Methanol also has a high energy density - a little goes a long way , making it especially interesting for portable devices .
The DMFCs currently on the market , however , have limitations .
For example , the material currently used for the electrolyte sandwiched between the electrodes is expensive .
Even more important : that material , known as Nafion , is permeable to methanol , allowing some of the fuel to seep across the center of the fuel cell .
Among other disadvantages , this wastes fuel - and lowers the efficiency of the cell - because the fuel is n't available for the reactions that generate electricity .
Using a relatively new technique known as layer - by - layer assembly , the MIT researchers created an alternative to Nafion .
" We were able to tune the structure of [ our ] film a few nanometers at a time , " Hammond said , getting around some of the problems associated with other approaches .
The result is a thin film that is two orders of magnitude less permeable to methanol but compares favorably to Nafion in proton conductivity .
To test their creation , the engineers coated a Nafion membrane with the new film and incorporated the whole into a direct methanol fuel cell .
The result was an increase in power output of more than 50 percent .
The team is now exploring whether the new film could be used by itself , completely replacing Nafion .
To that end , they have been generating thin films that stand alone , with a consistency much like plastic wrap .
This work was supported by the DuPont - MIT Alliance through 2007 .
It is currently supported by the National Science Foundation .
In addition , Hammond and colleagues have begun exploring the new material 's potential use in photovoltaics .
That work is funded by the MIT Energy Initiative .
This Institute - wide initiative includes research , education , campus energy management and outreach activities , an interdisciplinary approach that covers all areas of energy supply and demand , security and environmental impact .

TEGUCIGALPA , April 24 ( Reuters ) - Masked gunmen killed the leader of Honduras ' largest union group in an attack authorities said was a robbery attempt , but fellow unionists said she was targeted because of her job .
Rosa Fuentes , the head of the country 's largest labor federation , was shot late on Wednesday after a carful of six armed men wearing ski-masks smashed into the back of her car , police spokesman Hector Mejia told Reuters .
Fuentes and the driver of the car died at the scene and another union leader died en route to the hospital .
Police said the attack was an attempted robbery by gang members .
The attackers fled when another car pulled up , leaving without some $ 4,000 Fuentes had with her .
But fellow union members said Fuentes , whose CTH federation groups manufacturing unions with banana workers and civil servants , was killed because of her work .
" This was done by enemies of the labor movement , by hired killers , " said Rigoberto Duron , No. 2 at the CTH .
Honduras is part of a regional free trade deal with the United States that has been criticized for its lax labor controls in Central American countries .
In neighboring Guatemala , five labor leaders were murdered last year .
That case prompted the AFL - CIO labor federation to file a complaint with the U.S. labor department saying the government had failed to seriously investigate , violating provisions of the trade pact .
The Bush administration has been pushing Congress in recent days to approve a free trade agreement with Colombia .
U.S. labor groups oppose the pact , saying Bogota has done too little to curb violence against trade union members .

Australian football players have been banned from reading blogs as reading blogs causes depression , according to the Australian Football League Players Association ( AFLPA ) .
The AFLPA contends that blogs do n’t provide any decent feedback , and are racist , carry sexual overtones , are a form of bullying and only provide titillation .
The AFLPA is also calling on people to boycott fan sites due to the criticism of players dished out .
Pippa Grange , AFLPA :
“ I would n’t encourage any players to use them .
I think it ’s for bloggers , and I think it ’s mostly for titillation rather any decent feedback … I would n’t encourage any players to use them .
I think it ’s for bloggers , and I think it ’s mostly for titillation rather any decent feedback , ” There ’s no restriction of what people are able to do with the internet … blogging on websites about players is a form of bullying , it ’s public bullying of people in celebrity positions .
And even worse is the huge plague of fake footballers :
More serious , she said , were players ’ identities being taken by bloggers .
“ The biggest thing I ’ve encountered in my role where it ’s been a problem is where people take the identity of the player and claim to be making comments on behalf of the player , ” she said .
“ They get obviously quite upset about that . ”
Lets break down what the AFLPA is saying here : fans should n’t express a negative opinion about a player , this should only be the role of the mainstream media .
People should boycott fan sites and definitely never pretend to be a footballer .
It ’s like 2002 called and they want their retarded child back .
The notion that all blogs are bad on the basis that some are is similar to someone saying all footballers are bad because some take drugs , beat up women and regularly get drunk .
Blogs have long since moved on from personal playthings and are even the basis for multi-million dollar businesses .
Would Grange call for a boycott of the mainstream media because they criticize a player ?
Calling for a boycott of fan sites is even stranger again ; fandom encourages participation in the sport .
In calling for a boycott of fan sites Grange is calling for a boycott of fandom itself .
Do football clubs want less members , less people through the gate on the weekend , and less people watching the game on TV ?
When did criticism of a football player become bullying ?
Does Grange expect the public to only think positive thoughts about players and never express a negative thought ?
The celebrity angle is interesting as well ; Grange argues that as celebrities they should be left alone , but does n’t the very exposure lead to negative as well as positive coverage ?
If they do n’t want the coverage , get out of the game .
A sad attempt at censorship from people who should know better .

Truth or Neo-Consequences
An obscure academic dispute – over whether Israeli archeology sought to obscure the land ’s last two millennia of history and promote a continual Jewish claim of ownership – has shown again how tensions in the Middle East can reverberate in unlikely ways in the United States .
Bookmark
Digg Email

The dispute centered on whether Barnard College should grant tenure to Nadia Abu El - Haj , an American - born scholar of anthropology who , in the 1990s , challenged the scientific integrity of what she saw as the Israeli use of archeology in a politically motivated way to justify Jewish settlements on territory that had belonged to Palestinians .
Although the controversy was n’t new – it had been argued out within archeological circles in Israel for years – El - Haj became a lightning rod because she was the first academic of Palestinian descent to publicize the debate in a 2001 book , Facts on the Ground : Archeological Practice and Territorial Self - Fashioning in Israeli Society .
This academic debate boiled over the past two years when El - Haj – who had been a professor at Barnard College since 2002 – applied for tenure in 2006 and became a target of neoconservative attack groups determined to punish her for undermining Israel ’s claims to the Holy Land .
On Aug. 7 , 2007 , a petition entitled “ Deny Nadia Abu El - Haj Tenure ” was posted on petitionline.com , describing her as a scholar of “ demonstrably inferior caliber ” who had unfairly assailed the methodology of Israeli archeological digs .
The petition – prepared by Paula Stern , a 1982 graduate of Barnard and a resident of the occupied West Bank – also accused El - Haj of calling the ancient Israelite kingdoms a “ pure political fabrication ” and of lacking basic skills to undertake her studies , including an ability to “ speak or read Hebrew . ”
The petition said , “ We fail to understand how a scholar can pretend to study the attitudes of a people whose language she does not know . ”
The petition became a hot topic among American neoconservatives .
Campus Watch , a right - wing organization that monitors the teaching of Middle Eastern studies in the United States , joined in the attacks on El - Haj .
Campus Watch was founded in 2002 by Daniel Pipes , a prominent neoconservative and son of Richard Pipes , a key figure in the Cold War-era Committee on the Present Danger .
A blog of pro-Israeli professors known as Scholars for Peace in the Middle East also joined in the anti-tenure campaign .
Stern ’s petition eventually attracted about 2,500 signatures including many alumni from Barnard and its affiliate , Columbia University in New York City .
Errors Admitted However , two months after Stern posted the petition , she acknowledged to The Jewish Week that some of the petition ’s criticisms of El - Haj and her book were inaccurate .
Stern “ incorrectly quotes from Abu El - Haj ’s book in charging she is grossly ignorant of Jerusalem geography , ” according to The Jewish Week article by Larry Cohler - Esses .
“ Stern also conceded attributing to Abu El - Haj a viewpoint that Abu El - Haj does not voice as her own in her book .
The petition does so by taking a quote fragment from a section in which Abu El - Haj describes others as having the opposite viewpoint . ”
The article also noted that the petition ignored references in El - Haj ’s book to Hebrew language sources and an acknowledgement to her Hebrew tutor .
[ The Jewish Week , Oct. 25 , 2007 ]
Despite its inaccuracies , the petition – and the anti-tenure campaign – threatened to exact a price from Barnard and Columbia for granting tenure to El - Haj ; the schools would stand to suffer financial harm from offended alumni withholding contributions .
This pattern of ugly controversies whenever a Muslim or an Arab - American criticizes Israel or is seen as promoting some Islamic agenda has become more and more common , with influential neoconservative groups now operating in a concerted way to destroy careers and livelihoods .
Often the strategy succeeds , as the New York Times reported on April 28 in connection with the forced resignation of Debbie Almontaser , the founder of New York ’s Khalil Gibran International Academy , which had a goal of teaching Arabic to children of various ethnicities , including Arab - Americans .
Almontaser , who had a reputation as a Muslim moderate , stepped down after confronting a campaign that labeled her a “ radical , ” a “ jihadist ” and a “ 9/11 denier . ”
The Times reported that the campaign was part of “ a growing and organized movement to stop Muslim citizens who are seeking an expanded role in American public life . ”
Some of the leaders of the battle against Almontaser – such as Daniel Pipes – also participated in the anti-tenure campaign at Barnard against El - Haj , reflecting how these activists view the marginalizing of Muslims as a coordinated national struggle .
“ It ’s a battle that ’s really just begun , ” Pipes told the Times , claiming that this new enemy – “ lawful Islamists ” – must be stopped before they made enough inroads to enable them to impose sharia law from the Koran on Americans .
“ It is hard to see how violence , how terrorism will lead to the implementation of sharia , ” Pipes said .
“ It is much easier to see how , working through the system – the school system , the media , the religious organizations , the government , businesses and the like – you can promote radical Islam . ”
[ NYT , April 28 , 2008 ]
So , this strategy holds that Muslims and their non-Muslim allies especially in academia must be marginalized and denied legitimacy .
To achieve these ends , neoconservatives and sympathetic media outlets often turn small issues into huge controversies that create enormous pressure on mainstream politicians to distance themselves from the targets .
That was the case with Almontaser when Rupert Murdoch ’s neoconservative New York Post linked the school principal to a group that lent office space to an Arab - American organization that promoted t- shirts reading “ Intifada NYC . ”
Amid the furor , the mayor ’s office of New York City pushed Almontaser into resigning , although federal judges have since agreed that the Post “ inaccurately reported ” her words .
Barnard ’s El - Haj tenure struggle followed a similar pattern , with key roles played by some of the same activists .
In both cases , the battle involved neoconservatives who distorted the words of their targets in order to build a public hysteria strong enough to overwhelm the principle of academic freedom .
The Barnard Battle El - Haj was born in New York , the daughter of a mother of French - Norwegian descent and a Palestinian father , who had received his Doctorate in Economics from Columbia in the late 1950s .
In 1975 , her family lived in Teheran , where her father was employed by the United Nations and where she learned Farsi .
A few years later , the family moved to Lebanon where she became fluent in Arabic .
Her family frequently visited her father ’s relatives in East Jerusalem .
In 1980 , she undertook her undergraduate education at Bryn Mawr .
In 1990 , as a graduate student at Duke University , she decided on a project in epistemology , “ to examine knowledge in a social context , connected to time , place , politics and identity . ”
Wanting to find a place where that identity was in dispute , she chose Israel / Palestine .
She then spent months in Israel learning Hebrew and examining Israeli archeology ’s role in the creation of , and establishment of , the State of Israel .
Israeli archeology , from the founding of Israel in 1948 , claimed to have uncovered evidence supporting an ancient and continuous Hebrew presence , which in turn provided legitimacy to Israeli government claims that Palestinian land should be part of the modern state of Israel .
After achieving her Doctorate in 1995 , she adapted her doctoral thesis into a book , Facts on the Ground , published by the University of Chicago Press in 2001 .
.
The book examined the role of Israeli archeology in what was essentially a political context .
El - Haj traced the history of how archeological discoveries – pottery , ancient stones , even human remains – were used in a manipulative way to establish the legitimacy of Israeli claims to Palestinian land .
El - Haj questioned the veracity of some Israeli claims , saying the science of archeology had been exploited in the " formation and enactment of [ Israel ’s ] colonial - national historical imagination and ... the substantiation of its territorial claims . "
Her book cites the example of an archeological dig in Jezreel , in the Galilee region .
El - Haj said British and Israeli archeologists used bulldozers “ to get down to the earlier strata , which are saturated with national significance , as quickly as possible . "
Bulldozing a site – or using large shovels – to a specific depth of an archaeological dig , where one could expect to find remnants of an ancient Hebrew settlement , or not excavating to lower levels eliminates the possibility of finding evidence that other civilizations preceded or followed the Hebrews .
Israeli archeologist David Ussiskin of the University of Tel Aviv denied that bulldozers at the site were used in the fashion alleged by El - Haj ’s book or that evidence of more recent strata had been damaged .
Despite a spirited debate about her book , El - Haj ’s academic career continued to advance .
She taught at the University of Chicago before moving to Barnard College in 2002 and sought tenure in April 2006 .
That ’s when El - Haj was caught up in the surging neoconservative campaign to keep Islam – and criticism of Israel – as far out of mainstream American thought as possible .
In this case , however , the neocons did not prevail .
El - Haj was awarded tenure on Nov. 1 , 2007 , representing at least one moment when free speech and academic freedom won out over the sophisticated political pressure that neoconservatives have made their hallmark .
[ For more on the El - Haj controversy , see The New Yorker 's edition of April 14 , 2008 . ]

Edward Keith Stoddard Jr. really likes his PlayStation 3 .
So much , in fact , that if you were to touch his PS3 , he may just kill you .
Such was the fate of his neighbor , Douglas F. Abrams , who Stoddard believed had taken his console .
During an argument over the missing system , police say Stoddard shot Abrams , fatally wounding him .
When cops showed up on the scene , Stoddard surrendered and was taken to Land O'Lakes jail ( no , really ) in Dade County , Florida .
It 's okay to love your console , people -- just do n't get jealous if it drops by the neighbor 's house for some tea .

People love their plants .
They grow them , take care of them , talk to them , and even show their true feelings if their loved plant is not looking so good .
I also love having plants around my house , but since I get so busy and overwhelmed , I forget to water them many times .
If only they could show us how they truly feel .
The Pet Plant is a neat new concept designed by Junyi Heo that does n’t tell you how it feels , but actually shows it on its LCD display .
This new Pot Plant concept measures how the plant is doing by the condition of the soil , humidity and temperature surroundings , and also water levels .
Based on its needs , the plant pot will display you if it needs tending to by different facial emotions .
In addition , its system will drain it a bit if it has been over - watered .
Since it is combines Technology with nature , it charges by USB and is also able to sync plant information and emotions to your computer .
Although it is just a concept for now , it would be great if my plants will just show me that they are angry with me , in case I have not paid enough attention to them .

Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader sent a letter to House Judiciary Chair John Conyers today urging that the option of impeachment be placed back on the table for President Bush .
“ No other president has committed more systemic , repeated impeachable offenses , with such serious consequences to this country , its people , to Iraq , its people and the security of this nation before , than George W. Bush ” , wrote Nader in his letter to Rep .
Conyers , adding that , “ James Madison , Thomas Jefferson and their colleagues had just these kinds of monarchical abuses and violations in their framework of anticipation . ”
Nader wrote , “ In addition to a criminal war of aggression in Iraq , in violation of our constitution , statutes and treaties , there are the arrests of thousands of Americans and their imprisonment without charges , the spying on Americans without juridical warrant , systematic torture , and the unprecedented wholesale , defiant signing statements declaring that the President , in his unbridled discretion , is the law . ”
He urged Congress to enforce the Constitution .
“ It is never too late to enforce the Constitution .
It is never too late to uphold the rule of law .
It is never too late to awaken the Congress to its sworn duties under the Constitution .
But it will soon be too late to avoid the searing verdict of history when on January 21 , 2009 , George W. Bush becomes a fugitive from a justice that was never invoked by those in Congress so solely authorized to hold the President accountable . ”

Nader concluded by asking two questions , “ Is this the massive Bush precedent you and your colleagues wish to convey to presidential successors who may be similarly tempted to establish themselves above and beyond the rule of law ?
Is this the way you and your colleagues wish to be remembered by the American people ? ”
The problem for those who want to impeach Bush is that there is no evidence that would stand up during an impeachment trial .
Much of what they have done in Iraq appears born out of ineptitude , not illegality .
The second problem is that even in the area of domestic spying where it can be argued that impeachable offenses were committed , Democrats do n’t have the stomach for impeachment .
They fear a public and voter backlash against them , were they to pursue impeachment .
They worry that trying to impeach Bush would strengthen the GOP , just when they have them on the run .
Plus , a lot of prominent Democrats voted for the war in Iraq , and the Patriot Act .
These are mistakes that they would rather voters forgot .
I think it is too late to impeach President Bush , but there was certainly a time when a solid case could be made .
Unfortunately for Nader , that time was a few years ago .
Nader ’s Letter :

In my second professional programming job , I had a really interesting boss .
When we had a design meeting , we would all sit around a whiteboard , and as Roger ( my boss ) threw out things we needed to accomplish , the other programmers and I would propose solutions , and Roger would say , “ Really ?
What if you just did X ? ” , where X was some absurdly , ridiculously , jaw - droppingly simple thing .
Of course , X would n’t always work ; oftentimes one of us would find a hole in his idea .
We ’d all then try to fix the hole , but at some point the idea started to become too complicated for Roger ’s taste .
“ How about Y ? ” Still ridiculously simple , and tantalizingly close to working .
Oftentimes , he “ cheated ” , by redefining the problem itself to make it a simpler problem to solve , or forcing the problem to fit some existing available solution .
We would continue in this vein until the solution was so simple it hardly seemed like any work to actually implement , or it became absolutely clear that the problem would not yield to simplicity .
In which case we simply packed it in for the day on trying to solve that problem , and we ’d hit it again on another day .
I think that sometimes people think I ’m into complexity for its own sake , but that ’s really not true .
If you see me delving into complexity , it ’s only when I ’m after the simplicity that sometimes lies on the far side .
Sometimes , the differences in things that a program needs to do can mask their underlying secret symmetry , and if you can tease that symmetry out into the open , you can improve the design by simplifying it on both the inside and the outside .
The most innovative software products are often not those that merely add new features , but those that discover a new way to approach a problem : one that makes it simpler , such that fewer features are needed in the first place .
Insofar as I can use Roger ’s work as a minor example , he had designed a real estate referral tracking package with a field called “ Follow - up Date ” .
He had intentionally chosen this name , because he noticed that people had two different ways of thinking about when to follow up with someone about a referral .
One way was to plan ahead by scheduling the next date to follow up , and the other was to follow up with people who had n’t been contacted a while .
With a couple of tweaks to the name , he was able to get it to be what he called “ clearly ambiguous ” .
This meant that people who think in terms of scheduling would conclude that “ Follow - up Date ” obviously meant the date they planned to follow up , while at the same time , people who think in terms of keeping contacts fresh would think it clearly meant the date you ’d last followed up .
Since the software was only used by one person in a given real estate office , ( most could only afford one computer at those days ’ prices ) the ambiguity did n’t cause any “ tastes great / less filling ” debates within an office , but the benefits we gained were many .
First , since the target machines were dual - floppy TRS - 80 ’s with 48 K of RAM , having to have only one field was really important from a technical perspective ; it could have significantly reduced the software ’s processing capacity to have another field .
Second , being able to do things the way the user thought about them was good for sales .
During a presentation , you ’d just elicit whichever way they did their follow - up , and then you just presented the right way to do it with the software .
But back in those days , I did n’t yet understand the virtue of simplicity .
One of my first projects for the company was to port that software and several other products from the TRS - 80 to the new IBM PC .
At the time , I was 17 and had just discovered the idea of program generators : programs that write programs .
So naturally I thought it was the ideal way to go about porting ; load up the database schema and generate PC programs from them .
Roger , however , had wanted me to write a PC version of the database runtime ( ProFile ) they used on the TRS - 80 .
But I thought that I could do “ better ” .
In hindsight gained long after , I realized that Roger ’s approach had been simpler , and also that simplicity is not so easy to judge .
The long - term effect of my approach was that we could n’t just prototype new products on a PC - based database runtime , as we could have if I ’d done as he asked .
I had n’t yet learned to think of the spinoffs and secondary effects of my design choices .
It took many years of study under Roger ’s keen eye before I began to develop the ability to “ see ” those consequences and effects .
I say , “ began to ” , because you never really stop , and because at first all you really need to know is how to tell when you ’ve done something wrong .
( Which is surprisingly hard to tell , sometimes .
How do you know you ’re not still writing with a brick tied to your pencil , after all ?
Comparing to your colleagues does n’t help ; they might be writing with bricks too ! )
Sometimes , a minor tweak to a system produces great benefits ; the difference of an inch can be the difference , as Twain put it , betweeen “ lightning ” and “ lightning bug ” .
If you compare the complexity of the mainframe financial software that VisiCalc replaced , with the simple spreadsheet that replaced it , well , that ’s where you ’ll find that simplicity on the far side of complexity , and it makes all the difference in the world .
Roger , by the way , was not a programmer by trade .
He was a teacher , mostly of learning disabled children .
Patience , simplicity – and doing whatever it takes , no matter how absurd – were his watchwords .
I owe him a lot for the things he taught me , but today I especially give thanks for the gift of simplicity , and for the courage to ask “ What if we just did X ?
Would that work ?
Would it be simpler ?
What else might we gain ? ” .

To recap , I ’ve written lately about middle - class piracy and how it affects the software industry .
My friend , the pirate , a really nice guy who ’s kind of lazy , is a prime example .
He could buy stuff but often does n’t because DRM and badly - done copy protections make it more convenient for him to just be a thief .
Last time I was in the middle of the software industry ’s situation .
As promised , here ’s the present situation as I ( and my friend , the pirate ) see it :
Present - day customer fuckery
Today ’s copy protections are just as shitty as those I described last time .
I personally wo n’t buy anything that has copy protection , because of the way they do things – just look at the problems surrounding Starforce .
Other issues with copy protections are playability on newer systems .
I own Lord of the Realms 2 , but I can not play it without a crack .
Same with Need For Speed : High Stakes .
Same with countless others .
The hardware they were written for is nothing like today ’s hardware , so they just freak out on me .
Makes it easier to just pirate the software that I legally own at this point .
Worse still are the idiot developers like Iron Lore Entertainment who abuse the hell out of copy protection and then bitch when it bites them in the ass :
One guy went so far as to say he ’d bought the retail game and it was having the exact same crashes , so it must be the game itself .
This was one of the most vocal detractors , and we got into it a little bit .
He swore up and down that he ’d done everything above - board , installed it on a clean machine , updated everything , still getting the same crashes .
It was our fault , we were stupid , our programmers did n’t know how to make games – some other guy asked “ do they code with their feet ? ” .
About a week later , he realized that he ’d forgotten to re-install his BIOS update after he wiped the machine .
He fixed that , all his crashes went away .
At least he was man enough to admit it .
Wow , it ’s a customer ’s fault that your shitty protection caused crashing without explanation because of a lack of BIOS updating ?
( Also , how does wiping a machine cause a need to reinstall a BIOS update ? )
Iron Lore made their copy protection break in many ways to try and stop piracy .
End result :
Legitimate users with a system that is n’t happy with copy protection crashed for no obvious reason , and Iron Lore apparently treated them like shit when they ( very appropriately ) complained .
Pirates ignored this game .
Sorry , but it was n’t big enough to get hit with a ton of piracy – most piracy was due to curiosity , not people saying to themselves , “ MAN I GOTS TA HAVE THIS SHIZ - NIT ! ” I know a lot of pirates , at least in an online capacity ( yes , as I said , I have no real friends ) , and none of them were interested in yet another D2 clone .
And now for something completely the same
The sad truth is that Iron Lore is n’t unusual .
Their methods for copy protection have been done in many ways since software was first being protected .
They used well - known methodologies based on the belief that security can only be obtained by assuming any little anomaly is the customer trying to steal from you .
Bury your copy protections deep in the code .
Make calls to check validity in every place you can .
Do n’t let the user know it ’s a copy - protection - related crash .
So Iron Lore and other software developers actually suffer .
They are stupid enough to pay for software protection systems that are n’t 100 % stable .
They are gullible enough to think it ’ll stop piracy .
They are arrogant enough to believe the customer is to blame for their problems in a game that was never interesting to begin with .
That ’s right !
If your game does n’t suck , you wo n’t go under , regardless of piracy … read on .
The good news ?
Yes , there is good news in the software industry .
It is Stardock .
Steam is a very close second , only losing points due to the default requirement of an internet connection .
But both companies avoid copy protection in a traditional sense .
Stardock in particular has always been strongly against copy protection , a trait that my friend , the pirate , has valued greatly — not because he can easily steal , but because he sees a lot of value in buying their games .
He never has to worry about a bad copy protection .
He gets software very fast after purchase .
They update the hell out of their games with new features , not just bug fixes .
They update regularly , making piracy annoying – new update comes out , wait for it to be posted on some warez site , download it , find out it ’s actually the German version , rinse and repeat .
Or just buy the games online for and instant download , and get all that stuff with no hassles .
Just perfect for those middle - class pirates .
And Stardock ’s sales ?
Damned good .
Galactic Civilizations 2 has been better than budget by a pretty good amount ( I believe Brad said sales for GC2 and the Dark Avatar expansion fully funded the Twilight expansion so they did n’t have to worry about Twilight ’s budget at all ) .
Sins of a Solar Empire , published by Stardock , sold over 200,000 units in its first month .
With no copy protection .
Piracy has some impact , but clearly it is not the sole force in success of a game .
Stardock knows this and says , “ meh ” to copy protection .
End result :
Legitimate users get a great experience , “ instant ” downloads ( depending on connection speed , mind you ) , optional CD shipped ( at least , Stardock does this with a lot of their stuff – not sure about Steam ) , and NO worries about yet another badly implemented copy protection system .
worries about yet another badly implemented copy protection system .
Pirates have it good , too , no doubt about it .
But for some reason , they have n’t totally destroyed Stardock .
Makes me wonder if maybe the anti-piracy vocalists are exaggerating just a little tiny bit … ?
For people who do n’t get it about copy protection being the debbil
It is .
Copy protection was invented by Satan in an effort to get people to pirate shit :
Copy protection is not cheap .
To get copy protection on a game is to increase the cost to the consumer by a not - insignificant amount !
No software is bug - free without an unlimited budget ( such as building real - time military software , where money does n’t matter when it comes to precision and reliability ) .
Copy protection is no different .
Put those two together – you increase costs to your consumer and decrease stability .
DO THE MATH , SIRS .
Stardock gets it – it ’s just not worth the hassle .
Piracy will happen with all but the best copy protections , and the “ best ” are often the least stable .
Let the pirates be assholes , you ca n’t stop that .
So long as your legitimate customers see a lot of value in the purchase , they will make the purchase .
GC2 and Sins are both excellent examples of this .
Both have very good sales figures , and no copy protection .
None .
My friend , the pirate , has bought maybe 15 - 20 games over the last 5 years .
4 of them are from Stardock .
Another 7 or so were bought off of Steam .
One was store - bought ( impulse - buy ) and still has not been opened .
( “ I will play it soon .
I just do n’t want to deal with the DVDs …. ” )
Stay tuned !
Next time I ’ll discuss the movie and TV aspects of piracy , including the very exciting topics of Netflix and hulu.com .
UPDATED 5/30 , 8:45 AM
After I wrote about Google ’s spat with an advertising trade group over the company ’s refusal to put a link to its privacy policy on the home page of Google.com , I discovered that there is actually a California law on the subject .
The California Online Privacy Protection
Act of 2003 requires the operator of a commercial Web site that collects personal information about users to “ conspicuously post its privacy policy on its Web site . ”
How conspicuously ?
The site needs to link to the policy “ located on the homepage or first significant page after entering the Web site . ”
And the law has some rules for how prominent the link must be .
Google certainly knows about the law .
Just before it took effect in 2004 , the Mountain View , Calif . - based company expanded the disclosures in its privacy policy in order to comply , according to a report by CNet .
Google , which wants to keep its home page very simple , puts a link to its privacy policy on a page called “ About Google , ” to which it links from its home page .
Steve Langdon , a Google spokesman , said in an e-mail message that Google interprets the law as allowing the company to use other methods to provide notice of its privacy policy :
By having a link to our privacy policy one click from our home page , and because the privacy policy is easily found by using the search box on the home page , we comply with this statute .
I do n’t see any discussion of any alternatives to a home - page privacy link in published analyses of the law .
For example , a 2004 analysis by the law firm Cooley Godward Kronish does n’t list any other option for conspicuous notice other than placing the privacy policy itself or a link to it on a site ’s home page .
And the California Office of Information Security and Data Protection offers this recommendation to Web sites :
Use a conspicuous link on your home page containing the word “ privacy . ”
Make the link conspicuous by using larger type than the surrounding text , contrasting color , or symbols that call attention to it .
I ’ve left a phone message for and sent an e-mail message to Joanne McNabb , the chief of California ’s Office of Privacy Protection , seeking more clarification of the law .
I ’ll post her response if I hear from her .
Does Google ’s decision to do something different really matter ?
Google argues that anyone who is curious about its privacy policy can simply search Google to find it .
Moreover , privacy policies are more about fine print and legal mumbo jumbo than information that is really useful to people .
Also , it ’s worth noting that Google says it makes far less use of the data it collects about its users than many other big Web companies .
Yahoo and AOL , for example , display advertising based both on information provided by users and on the users ’ online surfing behavior .
Google does n’t .
On the other hand , it does n’t seem like it would be that hard for Google to put a single seven - letter word somewhere on its home page to help those who want to know more about its privacy practices .
Privacy experts say Google is under the microscope because it collects and retains so much information about so many people .
“ It would n’t be a big privacy issue if it was n’t Google saying everyone else may be doing this but we do n’t need to , ” said Marc Rotenberg , the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
UPDATE ( For those who like legal details ) :
I had asked Chris Hoofnagle , a senior fellow with the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology , to help me understand Google ’s argument .
The company pointed out that the law presents some options that include placing the link to the privacy policy on the “ first significant page ” after the home page .
And it allows more flexibility to “ online services ” than to Web sites .
Here is what Mr Hoofnagle wrote back :
Google may be behind one of the complaints against eBay Australia for its decision to accept only PayPal payments in the country .
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission posts PDFs of its correspondences online , but it had not posted the name of the previously anonymous party .
However , a curious reader did some digging into the metadata attached to the PDF , and discovered what appears to be Google 's tie - in to the complaint .
But before we get into the Google connection , let 's back up for a minute .
Earlier this month , eBay announced that it would require all payments made through the popular auction site in Australia to be done through PayPal beginning June 17 .
This created a bit of an uproar , since not everyone likes being tied into a single payment system ( that just so happens to be owned by eBay ) .
It 's not just users who were up in arms , either .
Banks and other online payment services were unhappy with the move , saying that it would reduce competition and force users to either agree to the new terms or leave the market altogether .
eBay responded by saying that going PayPal - only will make transactions safer , and that users are free to go elsewhere if they do n't want to use PayPal .
A rather long list of individuals and organizations have already submitted their concerns to the ACCC , but Google 's possible involvement makes the case that much juicier .
As an eagle - eyed Auction Bytes reader ( via Valleywag ) discovered , the PDF was created from a Word document , the original title of which was " ACCC Submission by Google re eBay Public 2.DOC . "
The file was removed from the ACCC web site and then reposted , presumably to stuff the cat back into the bag and remove the Google reference .
The 38 - page document ( PDF ) alleges that eBay 's only purpose with the new policy is to " substantially lessen competition " by preventing others from competing with PayPal .
" eBay 's proposed conduct will result in significant public detriments including a reduction in consumer choice and a reduction in the overall quality of online payment processing services in Australia , " reads the complaint .
Google 's objection comes as no huge surprise , as it operates PayPal competitor Google Checkout .
Although Google Checkout is not quite as ubiquitous as PayPal , it has grown in popularity since launch and is often offered as one of the major alternatives to PayPal .
The ACCC said earlier this week that it plans to rule on the PayPal - only policy sometime in mid-June , before eBay Australia turns into a pumpkin on June 17 .
: I 'm here with Dr. Russell Blaylock , and I 'd like to explore some of the more advanced aspects of some of the things you are working on .
Dr. Blaylock , I think readers know the basics of both MSG and aspartame , but can you review what you 've already written about excitotoxins ?
Dr. Russell Blaylock : I have three books .
The first one is the excitotoxin book , " Excitotoxins : The Taste That Kills , " and the latest one is " Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life . "
The third one is " Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients , " which is directed at nutritional treatments for cancer .
It contains some material about aspartame and MSG .
Excitotoxins have been found to dramatically promote cancer growth and metastasis .
In fact , one aspartame researcher noticed that , when cancer cells were exposed to aspartame , they became more mobile , and you see the same effect with MSG .
It also causes a cancer cell to become more mobile , and that enhances metastasis , or spread .
These MSG - exposed cancer cells developed all of these pseudopodians and started moving through tissues , which is one of the earlier observations from cancer .
When you increase the glutamate level , cancer just grows like wildfire , and then when you block glutamate , it dramatically slows the growth of the cancer .
Researchers have done some experiments in which they looked at using glutamate blockers in combination with conventional drugs , like chemotherapy , and it worked very well .
It significantly enhanced the effectiveness of these cancer drugs .
Mike :
Was n't there some research that came out recently that supports all this by establishing a correlation between leukemia and aspartame ?
Dr. Blaylock : Yes .
This Italian study was very well done .
It was a lifetime study , which is very important with these toxins .
They fed animals aspartame throughout their lives and let them die a natural death .
They found a dramatic and statistically significant increase in the related cancers of lymphoma and leukemia , along with several histological types of lymphomas , which is of interest because H.J. Roberts had written an article saying that there was a significant increase in the primary lymphoma of the brain .
When you look it up in the neurosurgical literature , there is a rather significant rise in the incidents of what used to be a rare tumor .
We 're seeing a lot more of the primary lymphoma of the brain , which is a little different than lymphomas you see elsewhere .
When you look back at the original studies done by the G.D. Searle company , they found lymphomas as well as primary brain tumors and tumors of multiple organs .
All of this correlation shows that we 've got a powerful carcinogenic substance here .
It is either acting as a co-carcinogen or a primary carcinogen .
Most likely , it 's the formaldehyde breakdown product .
What the Italian study found is that if you take these same animals and expose them to formaldehyde in the same doses , they developed the same leukemias and lymphomas .
If you look back at the Troker Study conducted in Spain a couple of years ago , what they found was when they radiolabeled the aspartame , they could actually see formaldehyde binding to the DNA , and it produced both single and double strand DNA breakage .
We know that when formaldehyde binds to DNA , it 's very difficult to remove it .
It will stay there for long periods of time .
What that means is if you just drink a single diet cola today , or sweeten something with NutraSweet , you 're accumulating damage every day .
Eventually , you 're going to produce this necessary pattern of DNA damage to initiate the cancer , and once you develop the cancer , the aspartic acid component of aspartame will make the cancer grow very rapidly .
You 've got a double effect ; it 's causing the cancer , and it 's making the cancer move very rapidly .
Mike : Given all this evidence , how has the industry managed to suppress this information and keep this chemical legal in the food supply ?
Dr. Blaylock : Donald Rumsfeld was the one who pushed a lot of this through , when he was in the chairmanship of the G.D. Searle company , NutraSweet .
He got it approved through the regulatory process , but once it was approved , the government did n't want to admit that they had made a mistake .
They just continued to cover it up , like the fluoride thing and the milk industry .
You 're not going to criticize milk in the media , because they are smart enough to advertise in newspapers , magazines , health magazines and journals .
They have all the media outlets covered .
The only place that they do n't have covered is talk radio and the internet .
The health blogs can tell the truth .
No matter how much a newspaper wants to tell the truth , they 're not going to do it .
This is the kind of pressure these people are under .
Even if you have a good writer who wants to write the story , his editor is going to override him and prevent it or water it down considerably .
You see this in journals like the Journal of Clinical Nutrition or College Nutrition .
Look at who funds them :
The Monsanto Company , and they used to be sponsored by G.D. Searle .
They 're not going to want to put articles in their journal that will infuriate their primary source of income .
Even medical and nutrition journals are controlled by these people .
Mike :
It 's the unholy alliance between the scientific community and big business .
Dr. Blaylock : Right .
Another big scandal concerning the research is something new we found .
We discovered that outside of the brain , there are numerous glutamate receptors in all organs and tissues .
The entire GI tract , from the esophagus to the colon , has numerous glutamate receptors .
The entire electrical conducting system of a heart is replete with all sorts of glutamate receptors .
The lungs , the ovaries , all the reproductive systems and sperm itself , adrenal glands , bones and even calcification are all controlled by glutamate receptors .
They act and operate exactly like the glutamate receptors in the brain .
So , when you 're consuming MSG , the level of glutamate in the blood can rise as high as 20 - fold .
You get very high glutamate levels in the blood after eating a meal containing MSG .
You 're stimulating all of the glutamate receptors .
That 's why some people get explosive diarrhea , because it stimulates the receptors in the esophagus and small bowel .
Others may develop irritable bowel , or if they have irritable bowel , it makes it a lot worse .
If they have reflux , it makes that a lot worse .
The thing about the cardiac conduction system glutamate receptors is this may explain the rise in sudden cardiac death .
What you see in almost all these cases is low magnesium .
When the magnesium level is low , the glutamate receptors become hypersensitive , and so people -- athletes in particular , if they are not supplementing with magnesium -- are prone to sudden cardiac death , because of the glutamate receptors .
If they eat a meal or something that contains glutamate or drink a diet cola before practice , it will produce such intense cardiac irritability , they 'll die of sudden cardiac death .
We know the sudden cardiac death is due to two things :
Most commonly arrhythmia and cardio artery spasm .
Both of which can be produced by glutamate .
Mike :
Of course , that death certificate does n't say they died from MSG .
Dr. Blaylock : No , and it's not going to , because the admitting physician does n't know the first thing about any of this research .
They 've never heard of it .
In fact , most cardiologists I 've spoken with have never heard of this .
They did n't know there were glutamate receptors throughout the electrical conduction system and in the heart muscle itself .
You have a million patients in this country with arrhythmias that are life - threatening , and no one 's telling them to avoid MSG and aspartame , yet it 's a major source of cardiac irritability .
Mike :
It 's absolutely astounding .
Now , did n't baby food manufacturers voluntarily remove this ingredient in the '70s ?
Dr. Blaylock :
They said they would , but they did n't .
What they did is take out pure MSG and substitute it with hydrolyzed protein and caseinate .
If you look at most toddler foods , they all have caseinate hydrolyzed protein broth , a significant source of glutamate .
Mike :
We 're destroying the nervous systems of these babies .
Dr. Blaylock : Exactly .
Now , one of the things we 're hearing a lot about is childhood obesity .
One early observation with exitotoxicity is it makes animals grossly obese .
Mike :
If they banned MSG , the drug companies would lose billions .
Think about how much money they make treating all of these symptoms .
Dr. Blaylock :
Here the government has all these big plans for controlling carbohydrate intake and controlling cereals and sugar and all that .
Those things add to the problem , because what we find in MSG - exposed animals is that they prefer carbohydrates and sugars over protein - rich foods .
That was one of the characteristics of this type of obesity .
It 's very difficult to exercise the weight off and almost impossible to diet it off .
The appetite is out of control , but the metabolism is also out of control .
They have metabolic syndrome on top of obesity , and so then you have a leptin insensitivity .
In terms of obesity , they have a leptin insensitivity .
It has been shown that you can produce leptin insensitivity very easily with MSG .
Mike :
Is there any hope , in your view , that the world may wake up to this , and some day these ingredients may be banned ?
Dr. Blaylock :
It 's possible , but you know , it 's only going to be by public exposure , through the blogs and sites like yours .
Once the public gets wind of it and is convinced that this is real , then there 'll be an uproar over it .
There 's just a deception .
The average consumer looks at it and goes , " Well , it says that it contains no MSG , so it must be okay . "
Mike : I find a lot of the vegetarian foods , or so - called health foods , use yeast extracts .
Dr. Blaylock :
The worst of the things they 're doing are the soy extracts .
Soybeans , naturally , have one of the highest glutamate levels of any of the plant products .
When you hydrolyze it , you release the glutamate , and the soy protein isolates .
The glutamate levels are higher than a lot of what you 'll find in MSG products , yet the vegetarians are just eating it like it 's the healthiest thing in the world .
There was a 25 - year study done , which looked at people who consumed the most soy products , and they followed them for 25 years and did serial CT scans .
They found out that the people who consumed the most soybean products had the greatest incidence of dementia and brain atrophy .
These people are destroying their nervous system , and I talked to a lot of them who complained of severe migraine headaches .
I said , " Get off the soy , " and they do , and that migraine headache goes away .
In addition , you have very high manganese levels , which is toxic to the very same part of the brain that produces Parkinson's .
You 've got a mixture of toxins with soy products , and the people think they are eating a healthy , nutritious product .
It 's destroying their nervous system , as well as other organs .
Mike :
In this whole debate of soy versus cow 's milk , we find misinformation in both camps .
Dr. Blaylock : I would n't recommend either one .
If you 're obsessed with milk , use goat 's milk .
It 's closer to human milk , but I would n't recommend cow 's milk or soy milk .
I think people ought to avoid soy products as if they were poison .
Mike :
Have you taken a lot of heat from NutraSweet or any of these other companies ?
I mean , have you been threatened with lawsuits or anything for going public with this information ?
Dr. Blaylock :
No , they leave me alone .
I know too much .
They 've never bothered me .
When I wrote the book , George Schwartz warned me , " Are you sure you want to write this book ?
If you do , they 're just going to hound you to death . "
I said , " Yes , I want to write the book . "
So , I wrote it with one thing in mind : that they would not be able to refute it .
I researched every kind of way you can research and proved the toxicity of glutamate .
They know I know that , because I had exchanged this in writing letters to some of their biggest defenders .
They all realized that they could n't answer my arguments .
So they leave me alone .
They 're afraid that if it comes to a big standoff between me and them , they 're going to lose .
Mike :
They do n't want this information going on the public record .
Dr. Blaylock :
No , they do n't want that .
What they 're doing is the old ploy of just ignoring and hoping it will go away .
Of course , they put pressure on magazines , journals and newspapers not to interview me .
They are trying to keep me in the shadows where they hope most people do n't hear anything I have to say .
It only works for so long .
Since I first wrote the book in 1995 , proof supporting my viewpoint has increased enormously .
The new material on peripheral glutamate receptors absolutely killed these people .
They have no defense against that .
The new information on the dramatic increase in cancer aggressiveness is something that they are terrified of .
Mike :
Now you find these receptors outside the brain .
Dr. Blaylock : Right .
Now , see , I proved it can enter the brain and that all that was a lie .
What they 've shown is that there are glutamate receptors on both sides of the blood brain barrier and that when you expose these receptors to glutamate , it opens up the blood brain barrier .
So , the glutamate itself can open the barrier , and I list all these conditions .
For instance , as you get older , your barrier becomes less competent .
Almost all Alzheimer 's patients have incompetent barriers .
Heat stroke , seizures , autoimmune disorder and multiple sclerosis all are related with this active blood brain barrier .
You 're talking about tens of millions of people , and they are out there gobbling up aspartame , MSG and other excitotoxins , and no one is telling them they are making their neurological conditions infinitely worse .
I do n't know how many seizure patients I 've gotten off their medicines by just getting them off MSG and giving them magnesium .
They quit having seizures .
They were on maximum dosages of medications and still having seizures .
Most neurologists and neurosurgeons that treat seizures are not aware of this .
Mike :
It 's not profitable to teach people how to avoid these ingredients .
Dr. Blaylock :
If you look at the neuroscience literature , you can't pick up an article that 's not about excitotoxicity .
The hottest topic in neurosciences is glutamate receptors and excitotoxins .
Mike :
Are they talking about it in the food or just as a chemical ?
Dr. Blaylock :
They wo n't mention food , but they talk about the glutamate receptor and what happens when you activate it .
Mike :
What about the argument from food companies ?
I actually got into a debate with a veggie burger manufacturer , because I wrote an article that said their product had yeast extract in it , and yet the front label said , " 100 percent all - natural ingredients . "
They said , " Well , glutamate appears naturally in other foods , like tomatoes and seaweed . "
What 's your answer to that kind of defense ?
Dr. Blaylock : Sure , but you see , all of these types of glutamate are bound .
They 're in oligosaccharides , polysaccharides .
They are bound in amino acids groupings .
They 're not free amino acids .
If you have it as a complex protein , you absorb it in your GI tract .
In the GI tract , there are almost no free amino acids if you eat foods such as tomatoes .
The level of free amino acids is nil ; it 's almost all absorbed as combined amino acids , and then it 's only broken down in the liver , where it 's released in very low concentrations that the body can deal with .
It was never meant to have free amino acids in such high concentrations .
Well , when you hydrolyze them -- or you use yeast extract or enzymes to break down these various proteins into their free , released amino acids -- they 're not natural any longer .
What you 've done is artificially release the amino acids in an unnatural way , and when they enter your GI tract , they are absorbed as free amino acids , then your blood level of that glutamic acid goes up significantly .
As I said , it can go up as high as 20 - fold , in some cases 40 - fold .
Your blood brain barrier is not constructed to handle such high levels of glutamate , because it does n't naturally occur that way .
It can handle the lower levels , but it can't handle these very high levels .
So this argument , " Oh , it 's natural , " is just a lot of nonsense .
Mike : I do find that many manufacturers claim to be natural health companies , or health food companies , as a cover .
They do n't really follow that philosophy , because they 'll use these ingredients .
Dr. Blaylock : Sure , and they use all kinds of backhanded ways .
Mike :
Here 's a practical question that 's actually been burning in my head for about eight years :
Is there anything that a person can take to block the absorption of MSG or glutamate as a defensive supplement ?
Dr. Blaylock :
Well , not necessarily to block it .
You have other amino acids that can't compete for glutamic acid absorption .
So that may be one way to help reduce the rate at which it would be absorbed .
Mike :
Which aminos would those be ?
Dr. Blaylock :
Those would include leucine , isoleucine and lysine .
They would compete for the same carrier system , so that would slow down absorption .
There are a lot of things that act as glutamate blockers .
You know , like silimarin , curcumin and ginkgo biloba .
These things are known to directly block glutamate receptors and reduce excitotoxicity .
Curcumin is very potent .
Most of your flavonoids .
Magnesium is particularly important , because magnesium can block the MNDA glutamate type receptor .
That 's its natural function , so it significantly reduces toxicity .
Vitamin E succinate is powerful at inhibiting excitotoxicity , as are all of your antioxidants .
They found combinations of B vitamins also block excitotoxicity .
Mike : Let 's talk about restaurants .
I can't even eat at restaurants anymore at all , even those natural restaurants .
They do n't know they have MSG , because it 's in one of the sauces or something .
Dr. Blaylock : I talked to them , and they said , " We get our food in these big crates , so there 's no ingredients listed . "
It 's the same thing for hospitals .
I talked to a hospital dietitian and she said , " We can't tell because it comes in a crate , and they wo n't put the ingredients on it .
It just says Salisbury steak or whatever . "
They do n't know , so it 's hard for them to come out and tell their customers , " It 's free of MSG . "
What they mean when they do say that is , " We did n't put any in there . "
Their white sauces are particularly high , as are their salad dressings , especially the ones that are pure oil .
They all contain MSG .
Mike : Gravy mixes almost always have it , right ?
Dr. Blaylock :
Yes , they 'll put hydrolyzed protein in it .
They 're selling taste .
I mean , that 's why a person prefers one restaurant to another .
The food tastes better .
Then they go home and feel sick and do n't understand why .
One of the things that has been noticed about sudden cardiac death is that most that have it , other than athletes , die after eating a meal in a restaurant .
I suspect it 's because these people have low magnesium .
They eat the meal , the glutamate stimulates the glutamate receptor in the cardiac conduction system as well as the hypothalamus , and they have a sudden cardiac death .
I was in a bookstore in Oxford , Miss .
This young guy was there , and he just dropped and died .
We took him to the hospital and tried to resuscitate him , and we could n't .
He was only 26 years old , and he had just eaten a big bowl of soup at one of the restaurants .
Well , I talked to the person that was there , and he said they use a lot of hydrolyzed protein and MSG .
People will eat a meal , have a soup before the meal , get this huge dose of MSG , and drop dead from the arrhythmia .
Mike : Could this explain some sudden infant deaths as well , you think ?
Dr. Blaylock :
Oh yeah .
I mean , look at the popularity of these soy infant formulas .
Mothers are crazy to give their kids soy formula .
There is a lot of concern about it .
There 's concern about the fluoride level , the manganese level , and the glutamate levels in these soy infant formulas .
Mike : At Wal - Mart , I saw bottled water with added sodium fluoride .
It 's fluoride water .
Dr. Blaylock :
Oh yes , it 's for babies .
They have a picture of a baby on it .
Mike :
So , is there a website or a newsletter that people can visit or sign - up for ?
Dr. Blaylock : I have a newsletter .
It 's www.BlaylockReport.com.
It 's by subscription , but you can buy individual newsletters .
You do n't have to get the whole year .
It 's issued monthly , for $ 3.98 a piece .
It covers everything .
I try to cover a lot of common subjects and bring people up to date on the new thinking and research .
I go through all the medical research .
Usually I 'll go through everything that conventional medicine has to offer .
A lot of times they have good physiology , a good pathophysiology , but then , they switch over and start talking about drugs .
I 'll go through all the good pathophysiology material they have , and then I 'll look up all the nutritional research that 's been done that can correct those problems .
Mike : I see .
Here 's an off - the - wall question :
If MSG and all its different versions , as well as aspartame , were outlawed tomorrow , what changes would we see in the next five years in terms of public health ?
Dr. Blaylock : I think you 'd see a significant drop in obesity and metabolic syndrome .
You 'd see a tremendous drop in certain cancers .
You would certainly see a tremendous drop in the neurodegenerative diseases , and all of these diseases that are increasing expeditiously .
The neurodegenerative diseases are just exploding .
Things that used to be rare , we 're seeing all the time now .
It 's just frightening .
And when you look through the neurosciences literature , they have no explanation .
They do n't know why it 's increasing so rapidly , but it 's because we have such a large combination of toxins .
For instance , we know that cellular neurodegenerative diseases are connected to mercury , aluminum , pesticides and herbicides , and the way they produce brain damage is through an excitotoxic mechanism .
So , we are all exposed to those toxins , and then when you add MSG and excitotoxins to the food , you tremendously accelerate this toxicity .
That 's why we 're seeing this explosion in neurodegenerative diseases ; Alzheimer 's and autism and ADD and Parkinson 's -- all these things are increasing so enormously because we are exposed to carcinogenic toxicity from all these different things and this huge exposure to excitotoxins , which is the central mechanism .
This is what no one 's been able to claim .
You look at one person 's report and they 'll say , " Alzheimer 's is related to mercury exposure , " and then another one says , " No , it 's related to pesticides , " and yet another one says it something else , but they 're all operating through the same mechanism .
All of these things operate by increasing brain immune activity , and that activates excitotoxicity .
So that 's why all of them seem to be related , because they 're all doing the same thing to the brain .
Mike : What about the American Diabetes Association ?
Given that aspartame actually promotes obesity , based a lot of the work you 've uncovered , I find it curious that the ADA so strongly supports aspartame .
Dr. Blaylock : I do n't , considering they receive huge amounts of money from the makers of aspartame .
They fund their walk - a- thon and all that kind of stuff , so they get tremendous amounts of money from the makers of aspartame , and money talks .
Whether they 're just deluding themselves and choosing not to believe it 's toxic , refusing to look at the evidence , or they 're just concerned about the money and could care less , I do n't know , but when you look at the pathophysiology of diabetes and the effect of aspartame , it 's absolute nonsense for anybody who has diabetes to be on aspartame .
Particularly in a neurological aspect , it 's going to make it a lot worse .
Mike :
What about other popular chemical sweeteners like sucralose in Splenda ?
Dr. Blaylock :
There 's really not a lot of research in those areas .
They have some basic research , like with Splenda , showing thalamus suppression .
If that holds up in other research , it 's a major concern .
If you 're suppressing the thalamus gland in a child , that 's the future of their immune function .
You can increase everything from autoimmunity to producing immune - related diseases , to infections and cancers .
The implications of thalamus gland suppression are enormous .
There have been reports of miscarriages associated with Splenda in experimental animals .
The problem is , we do n't have a lot of well - conducted studies on Splenda to ferret these things out , and they 're not going to do them .
The best way to protect your product is to never test it , or just to set up some phony test and report it in a journal that 's friendly to your point of view .
That 's what they did with certain vaccines .
They did thousands of phony studies and waved them around , claiming nothing was found .
You can design any study to find whatever you want .
Particularly , you can design it to have negative results .
That 's the easiest thing to do .
Mike :
We 've got government health officials telling us mercury is safe and we 've got big business telling us both aspartame and MSG are safe .
It sounds like every poison in the food supply or in organized medicine is perfectly safe .
Dr. Blaylock :
We did that with lead .
When they first started questioning the safety of lead , the levels they said were safe were just enormously high , and then a mere 10 years later , suddenly we 're finding out that lead is toxic at 10 micrograms .
In the '60s , they were fighting over the same thing .
The defenders of gasoline - added lead were saying lead was n't toxic , except in extremely high doses .
Then neuroscience literature was contradicting them , but nobody would listen .
Finally , the weight of the evidence was so overwhelming that they found out extremely low concentrations of lead were toxic and accumulate in the brain .
It 's the same thing with mercury .
Mercury is even more poisonous than lead .
An infant is getting 150 times the dose of mercury than the EPA safety limits .
A hundred times higher than the FDA safety limits .
Here 's a little baby that 's getting 150 times higher a dose than the FDA says is safe for an adult .
Mike :
What are the big points readers to take away ?
What do you think they need to remember in order to protect themselves ?
Dr. Blaylock :
You need to abstain from all of these things .
Aspartame is not a necessary nutrient , and neither is MSG .
The weight of the evidence is overwhelming .
If you want to avoid obesity , metabolic syndrome and cancer , and if you do n't want to make your cancer more aggressive , then you need to stay away from these products .
The damage affects pregnant women , unborn babies and newborns .
It produces changes in the brain that are irreversible .
What we 've found is that it reprograms the wiring of the brain , particularly the hypothalamus , so it does n't function normally .
These children are abnormal for the rest of their lives in terms of their physiological function .
Mike :
Well , hopefully the weight of this evidence will someday become overwhelming , and government regulators will listen to you .
Dr. Blaylock :
The pressure on researchers is so enormous .
Larry Troker came out with his research about the DNA damage by aspartame .
Then his career was damaged by the makers of aspartame .
He said he would never do another research project concerning aspartame .
Well , a number of researchers have said the same thing .
Once they published their results , the full weight of these companies come down on their head .
NutraSweet will contribute millions to a university and threaten to pull their donations if someone is n't quieted .
Mike :
So there 's blatant scientific censorship at work here .
Dr. Blaylock :
There 's blatant , and then there 's just understood .
You have NutraSweet manufacturers donating several million dollars to your university .
The director of that laboratory , or the president of the university , will just quietly let them know that they 'd really like to see research come to a stop .
The editor - in - chief of The Chemical News went through that with fluoride .
They fired him because he refused to be quiet about fluoride toxicity , and they had just received this huge grant from Colgate - Palmolive .
They said , " We 'll lose our grant if you do n't get quiet about fluoride . "
He would n't , and they fired him .
Researchers know this .
Mike : I want to commend you for being willing to stand up and tell the truth about all of this .
I think you 're doing a great , positive service to public - health .
Dr. Blaylock :
You 're the one doing the service , because you 're putting the word out there .
Without you , I would just be sitting in a room fussing .
It 's people like you that get this word out and let people know what 's going on in the world .
Mike : I would n't be surprised if they tried to pass a bill to outlaw health talk on the internet .
Dr. Blaylock :
They 're trying to do it .
You know , they passed a law at one time in several states that no one but dietitians could speak on the subject of nutrition .
Several states had that law passed .
This meant Ph.D. biochemists could n't talk about health .
It was ridiculous .
I 'm sure that one day they 're going to have an internet bill saying there 's just too much dangerous material coming over the internet on health issues , and we need to regulate it .
Mike :
Well , I want to thank you very much for all your time .
Dr. Blaylock :
Thank you .
I appreciate you giving me this opportunity .

Print This Email This The Daily Show's Jon Stewart got out the Big Book of law to weigh in on the national debate over torture .
At issue was as the effort by Republican politicians to cast water - boarding as a legitimate interrogation tactic .
" What 's this right here , " Stewart asked , picking up a slip of paper from inside his hefty law book .
" Oh , it 's a Justice Department memo in my US Law ... uh , we are allowed to head slap , expose people to extreme temperatures , and simulate drowning , which is called waterboarding , which , by the way , sounds so much better that ' simulate drowning . ' "
Stewart went on to skewer Former Mayor and Republican Presidential Candidate Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey about their vague statements about whether or not waterboarding is torture .
Stewart was then joined by Rob Riggle to help explain CIA Director Michael Haydon 's comparison of torture to Marine Corps .

I 'm not sure I understand the emphasis -- from both the pundits and from the Clinton campaign itself -- on money at this point .
Did n't we just learn that the Clintons have a fortune of over $ 100 million ?
Surely insofar as her campaign thinks it 's actually the case that money is what stands between her and the White House the family can afford to spend the necessary cash whether or not her fundraising revives .

A Bronx man has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was taunted and falsely arrested by police officers after they learned that he had the same name as a West African immigrant shot to death by other officers in 1999 .
Amadou Diallo said he was parking his car in Harlem in February when a group of officers confronted him over a broken headlight , and then searched his vehicle for weapons .
Once the officers learned his name , Diallo 's lawyer said in the suit , it became " a source of much amusement , laughing and inappropriate joking amongst the officers , with crude and disgusting comments . " " Oh , you 're back from the dead , " one of the officers told Diallo , the suit claimed .
Amadou Diallo was also the name of an unarmed immigrant killed in 1999 when four plain - clothed police officers , apparently mistakenly thinking he was reaching for a gun , fired 41 rounds in the doorway of a Bronx apartment building .
The killing prompted large street protests , which were echoed on a smaller scale in recent weeks as activists expressed outrage over a similar shooting involving Sean Bell , a groom - to - be who was killed as he left his bachelor party .
The new Diallo lawsuit , filed in federal court in Manhattan , said he was arrested and charged with possessing a knife , but those charges were dropped by prosecutors within 24 hours .
Diallo 's lawyer said no knife was ever found .
A spokeswoman for the city 's law department declined to comment on the suit .
CYBERCRIME PAYS CYBERCRIME PAYS SEATTLE 
Two days after actor Heath Ledger died , e-mails began moving across the Internet purportedly carrying a link to a detailed police report divulging " the real reason " behind the actor 's death .
Ledger had been summarily drafted into the service of a botnet .
Bots are compromised computers controlled by profit - minded crooks .
Those e-mails were spread by a network of thousands of bots , called a botnet .
Anyone who clicked on the link got instantly absorbed into the fast - spreading Mega - D botnet , says security firm Marshal .
Mega - D enriches its operators , mainly by distributing spam for male - enhancement pills .
BACKGROUND : Botnets can be used to blackmail targeted sites Largely unnoticed by the public , botnets have come to inundate the Internet .
On a typical day , 40 % of the 800 million computers connected to the Internet are bots engaged in distributing e-mail spam , stealing sensitive data typed at banking and shopping websites , bombarding websites as part of extortionist denial - of - service attacks , and spreading fresh infections , says Rick Wesson , CEO of Support Intelligence , a San Francisco - based company that tracks and sells threat data .
" It 's like a disease you can't even feel , " Wesson says .
" The mechanisms we use to protect our networks simply are not working . "
The botnet problem shows no sign of easing .
Security firm Damballa pinpointed 7.3 million unique instances of bots carrying out nefarious activities on an average day in January — an astronomical leap from a daily average of 333,000 in August 2006 .
That included botnet - delivered spam , which accounted for 91 % of all e-mails in early March , up from 64 % last June , says e-mail management firm Cloudmark .
The upshot of this deluge is profound , if not immediately obvious , says Adam O'Donnell , Cloudmark 's director of emerging technology .
Telecoms and Internet service providers must absorb the cost of carrying botnet traffic ; they can be expected to pass that expense onto companies and consumers , he says .
Meanwhile , tens of millions of botted computer users are experiencing degraded performance with no clue why .
" Newer machines feel old , so people end up buying new machines more often than they have to , " O'Donnell says .
Beyond that , cybercrime gangs are stockpiling enough stolen data to fuel identity theft scams for years to come .
Meanwhile , law enforcement is negligible , and security protections for consumers and businesses remain , at best , patchwork and haphazardly deployed , says Somesh Jha , computer science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" The botnet landscape is shifting , and the worst has n't happened yet , " says Jha , who is also chief scientist at security software firm NovaShield .
A perfected Storm Exhibit No. 1 showcasing botnets ' criminal potential : the mega botnet Storm .
At first , the e-mail that began circulating on Jan. 19 , 2007 , appeared to security researchers to be a garden variety e-mail virus .
It carried a tainted link to a news story about a deadly storm .
In fact , the gang that released the e-mail had spent months preparing a strategy for amassing a sprawling , impenetrable botnet designed to self - replicate .
Fourteen months later , Storm remains entrenched as the largest , most active botnet clogging the Internet .
Security experts credit Storm 's operators with breakthroughs now being widely emulated by copycat botnet operators .
Storm was first to make wide use of peer - to - peer , or P2P , communications — the technology that allows one computer to share files with any other computer across the Internet .
Bots in a botnet typically receive instructions from a central PC , called the command - and - control server .
Authorities are getting better at discovering and shutting down such central servers .
So Storm 's operators perfected a way to use P2P communications to issue commands from a rotating subset of PCs inside the botnet .
As extra protection , Storm became the first botnet to encrypt its instructions .
" They 've built a very resilient infrastructure , " says Dmitri Alperovitch , principal researcher at Secure Computing .
" If one command server gets shut down , it moves to the next . "
Meanwhile , Storm rewrote the book on the psychological ploys — known as social engineering — that lure victims into clicking on tainted attachments or Web links .
Storm e-mails arrived with irresistible links to holiday - themed greeting cards , Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Clarkson music videos , even an NFL game - tracking tool .
Storm peaked last July , infecting an estimated 1.7 million PCs , according to Symantec .
Anti-virus firms began to block Storm e-mail , and Microsoft ( MSFT ) helped clean up Windows PCs infected by Storm .
But Storm 's operators proved adept at dodging the latest anti-virus filters .
Subscribing to the idea that the best defense is an aggressive offense , they also began attacking any researcher who tried to isolate any of their bots .
Outsiders detected trying to establish contact with a Storm bot are inundated by an avalanche of nuisance requests launched from the wider botnet .
" Storm has a self - defense mechanism , " Alperovitch says .
" Any time someone probes the botnet too much , it reacts automatically and starts a denial - of - service attack against that researcher . "
Tool of choice
The result : Storm endures as the king of botnets with several hundred thousand infected PCs doing its bidding on any given day .
Yet Storm is really a one - trick pony .
It generates cash mainly by spewing spam urging recipients to buy shares in obscure companies , the linchpin to an array of scams spinning off the artificial inflation of the share price .
Another tier of smaller , multipurpose botnets spring from widely available tool kits that make it easy for anyone to infect computers , assemble a basic botnet and embark on a criminal career .
Dozens of crime rings , for instance , have cropped up to run phishing scams that lure victims into clicking on fake Web pages where they get tricked into divulging passwords and other sensitive data .
Botnets distribute phishing spam , host phishing Web pages and store phished data .
Since 2005 , phishers have used botnets to take aim at more than 1,750 companies and government agencies , mainly financial institutions , including 106 fresh targets in the fourth quarter of 2007 , according to a survey by security data firm Cyveillance .
Phishing expeditions are just one of many uses of botnets .
Some botnets crawl the Internet looking for Web pages that can be corrupted with pop-up ads selling fake anti-spyware ; some implant programs on popular Web pages to harvest any sensitive personal data typed there by visitors ; some repeatedly click on online advertisements to earn fraudulent " click through " revenue .
" Botnets have become the tool of choice for bad guys , " says Rick Howard , director of intelligence at VeriSign iDefense .
" You take over a box ( PC ) , put it in your botnet and forevermore you own that box and can do whatever you like with it . "
One particularly invasive collection of botnets , known as Zbot , is controlled by Russian crime groups going by the online designations UPLEVEL , CAR Group and Glamorous Team .
Zbot 's operators late last year got away with swiping millions from banks in four nations , says Don Jackson , a senior researcher at SecureWorks who has been monitoring Zbot .
" We know that the amount stolen in December , which affected banks in the USA , U.K. , Italy and Spain , was just over $ 6 million , " Jackson says .
" This is based on sources within the banks and law enforcement that work with us . "
The scammers enticed bank customers to click on a link purportedly to download an updated digital certificate , the equivalent of a digital ID card .
Instead , Zbot installed a program that positioned it to come along for the ride the next time the user successfully accessed the account .
Zbot then automatically executed cash transfers to other accounts controlled by its operators — while the victim did his or her online banking .
" This scheme is extremely clever and quite ironic considering that digital certificates are provided by financial institutions to protect online bank users from fraud , " Jackson says .
Deeper footholds
Zbot notwithstanding , organized crime groups have only scratched the surface of the criminal capabilities of botnets .
Meanwhile , law enforcement agencies globally remain hamstrung by a lack of technical expertise , manpower and political resolve to put a dent in the botnet scourge , says Paul Ferguson , senior threat researcher at anti-virus firm Trend Micro .
Numerous indicators portend botnets are destined to increasingly corrupt consumer online transactions and range deeper into corporate and government networks , security experts say .
Some criminals on the cutting edge , for instance , are using data harvested by botnets to send e-mail to specific executives at certain government agencies and large corporations .
Carefully crafted to look like they come from a colleague or business contact , the e-mails include a corrupted Microsoft Office file .
Once opened , the tainted file cloaks itself and installs a tool that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic , collecting clues on ways to drill deeper inside the organization 's internal network .
Such a foothold can give a botnet operator access to more firepower and improved cover , says Paul Royal , principal researcher at Damballa .
" If I can get on a workplace computer , I have a lot more bandwidth and reliability with which to perpetuate illegal activities , " he says .
" And the person whose workstation is infected may not even notice . "

Dear Admiral Fallon ,
I have not been able to find out how to reach you directly , so I drafted this letter in the hope it will be brought to your attention .
First , thank you for honoring the oath we commissioned officers take to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies , foreign and domestic .
At the same time , you have let it be known that you do not intend to speak , on or off the record , about Iran .
But our oath has no expiration date .
While you are acutely aware of the dangers of attacking Iran , you seem to be allowing an inbred reluctance to challenge the commander in chief to trump that oath , and to prevent you from letting the American people know of the catastrophe about to befall us if , as seems likely , our country attacks Iran .
Two years ago I lectured at the Naval Academy in Annapolis .
I found it highly disturbing that , when asked about the oath they took upon entering the academy , several of the “ Mids ” thought it was to the commander in chief .
This brought to my mind the photos of German generals and admirals ( as well as top church leaders and jurists ) swearing personal oaths to Hitler .
Not our tradition , and yet …
I was aghast that only the third Mid I called on got it right – that the oath is to protect and defend the Constitution , not the president .
Attack Iran and Trash the Constitution
No doubt you are very clear that an attack on Iran would be a flagrant violation of our Constitution , which stipulates that treaties ratified by the Senate become the supreme law of the land ; that the United Nations Charter – which the Senate ratified on July 28 , 1945 , by a vote of 89 to 2 – expressly forbids attacks on other countries unless they pose an imminent danger ; that there is no provision allowing some other kind of “ pre-emptive ” or “ preventive ” attack against a nation that poses no imminent danger ; and that Iran poses no such danger to the United States or its allies .
You may be forgiven for thinking :
Is n’t 41 years of service enough ; is n’t resigning in order to remove myself from a chain of command that threatened to make me a war criminal for attacking Iran ; is n’t making my active opposition known by talking to journalists – is n’t all that enough ?
With respect , sir , no , that ’s not enough .
The stakes here are extremely high and with the integrity you have shown goes still further responsibility .
Sadly , the vast majority of your general officer colleagues have , for whatever reason , ducked that responsibility .
You are pretty much it .
In their lust for attacking Iran , administration officials will do their best to marginalize you .
And , as prominent a person as you are , the corporate media will do the same .
Indeed , there are clear signs the media have been given their marching orders to support attacking Iran .
At CIA I used to analyze the Soviet press , so you will understand when I refer to the Washington Post and the New York Times as the White House ’s Pravda and Izvestiya .
Sadly , it is as easy as during the days of the controlled Soviet press to follow the U.S. government ’s evolving line with a daily reading .
In a word , our newspapers are revving up for war on Iran , and have been for some time .

Bush lies about lying
May 31 , 2008 at 3:37 pm
If two wrongs make a right , do two lies make a truth ?
Not only did Bush lie about Iraq and WMDs , he lied last week when he said the intelligence was faulty .
In an interview with the Politico and Yahoo !
News , President Bush blamed faulty intelligence .
“ I do n’t think so .
…
Intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment .
And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was . ”
“ Do I think somebody lied to me ? ” he said .
“ No , I do n’t .
I think it was just , you know , they analyzed the situation and came up with the wrong conclusion . ”
Yes , they did analyze the situation .
They came to the right conclusion .
You ignored it and now you ’re blaming intelligence ,
Let ’s take a look at the intelligence the Bush administration ignored going into Iraq :
1 . As early as September 12 , 2001 , Bush administration officials quietly questioned the claims .
Richard Clarke , Bush ’s then counterterrorism advisor , responded to Bush ’s query whether Hussein was linked to the attacks .
“ But you know , we have looked several times for state sponsorship of al Qaeda and not found any real linkages to Iraq . ”
2. Beginning November of 2001 , Defense Undersecretary Douglas Feith led a team to explore the relationship between Iraq and Al - Qaeda .
Almost a year later , the team briefed Colin Powell and then - CIA director George Tenet on their findings .
On September 25th 2002 , Bush linked the two :
“ They ’re both risks , they ’re both dangerous .
The difference , of course , is that Al Qaeda likes to hijack governments .
Saddam Hussein is a dictator of a government .
Al Qaeda hides , Saddam does n’t , but the danger is , is that they work in concert .
The danger is , is that Al Qaeda becomes an extension of Saddam ’s madness and his hatred and his capacity to extend weapons of mass destruction around the world . ”
In July of the same year , the Defense Intelligence Agency found “ compelling evidence demonstrating direct cooperation between the government of Iraq and Al Qaeda has not been established , despite a large body of anecdotal information . ”
In April 2001 , the CIA drafted a report called Iraqi Support for Terrorism , that found “ no credible information that Baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks or any other al - Qaeda strike . ”
3. September 8th , 2002 :
“ We do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon .
We do know there have been shipments going into . . .
Iraq , for instance , of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to — high - quality aluminum tools that only really suited for nuclear weapons programs , centrifuge programs . ”
In April 2001 , the Energy Department concluded that “ while the gas centrifuge application cannot be ruled out , we assess that the procurement activity more likely supports a different application , such as conventional ordnance production . ”
In September of 2002 when the CIA was preparing the NIE , the Department reminded them of their findings .
The CIA ignored them .
4 . In his September 28 radio address , Bush claimed :
The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons , is rebuilding the facilities to make more and , according to the British government , could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given .
The regime has long - standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups , and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq .
This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb , and with fissile material could build one within a year . ”
Until three weeks ago , there was no National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraq and WMDS .
The CIA scrambled to complete one , later debunked by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence : “ Postwar findings do not support the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) judgment that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program . ”
5 . His 2003 State of the Union addresses mentioned Iraq buying Uranium from African countries .
“ The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . ”
As early as March 2002 , the intelligence community was divided about the link .
During that month the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research published a report named “ Niger : Sale of Uranium to Iraq Is Unlikely . ”
During July of that year , the Energy Department found “ no information indicating that any of the uranium shipments arrived in Iraq ” and the “ amount of uranium specified far exceeds what Iraq would need even for a robust nuclear weapons program . ”
The 2006 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence confirmed this :
“ Postwar findings do not support the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) assessment that Iraq was ‘ vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake ’ from Africa .
Postwar findings support the assessment in the NIE of the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research ( INR ) that claims of Iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in Africa are ‘ highly dubious . ”
6. On February 3 , 2003 Colin Powell presented to the UN .
“ My colleagues , every statement I make today is backed up by sources , solid sources .
These are not assertions .
What we ’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence .
I will cite some examples , and these are from human sources . ”
He also claimed that “ a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons [ of mass destruction ] to Al Qaeda . ”
Six days earlier , the CIA had concluded that the detainee “ was not in a position to know if any training had taken place . ”
No Mr. Bush , the intelligence was correct .
What you took from that intelligence and told the American people is what ’s flawed .
Thanks Center for Public Integrity !

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Science has provided the souped - up seeds to feed the world , through biotechnology and old - fashioned crossbreeding .
Now the problem is the dirt they 're planted in .
As seeds get better , much of the world 's soil is getting worse and people are going hungry .
Scientists say if they can get the world out of the economically triggered global food crisis , better dirt will be at the root of the solution .
Soils around the world are deteriorating with about one - fifth of the world 's cropland considered degraded in some manner .
The poor quality has cut production by about one - sixth , according to a World Resources Institute study .
Some scientists consider it a slow - motion disaster .
In sub -Saharan Africa , nearly 1 million square miles of cropland have shown a " consistent significant decline , '' according to a March 2008 report by a worldwide consortium of agricultural institutions .
The cause of the current global food crisis is mostly based on market forces , speculation and hoarding , experts say .
But beyond the economics lie droughts and floods , plant diseases and pests , and all too often , poor soil .
A generation ago , through better types of plants , Earth 's food production exploded in what was then called the " green revolution . ''
Some people thought the problem of feeding the world was solved and moved on .
However , developing these new " magic seeds ' ' was the easy part .
The crucial element , fertile soil , was missing .
" The first thing to do is to have good soil , '' said Hans Herren , winner of the World Food Prize .
" Even the best seeds can't do anything in sand and gravel . ''
Herren is co-chairman of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge , Science and Technology for Development , a collection of scientists sponsored by the United Nations and World Bank .
It produced a 2,500 - page report last month which , among other recommendations , emphasized a need to improve the world 's soil .
Genetic improvements in corn make it possible to grow up to 9,000 pounds of corn per acre in Africa .
But millions of poor African farmers only get about 500 pounds an acre " because over the years , their soils have become very infertile and they can't afford to purchase fertilizers , '' said Roger Leakey , a co-author of the international report and professor at James Cooke University in Australia .
Soil and water issues " have been taken for granted , '' said Ohio State University soil scientist Rattan Lal .
" It is a problem that is not going to be solved .
It 's going to get worse before it gets better . ''
In Africa , farmers are forced to use practices that rob nutrients from the soil , not put it back , said Herren , who heads an Arlington , Va. , nonprofit .
Fertilizer is a quick , short - term fix , but even that is n't being done , he said .
The current crisis could have been avoided " if we , the world , had promoted fertilizer in Africa and we have known for ages it works , '' said Pedro Sanchez , Columbia University tropical agricultural director .
In that way , the problem with soil is a prime example of a larger failing of agriculture science , said Sanchez , who has won both the World Food Prize and a MacArthur genius grant .
Scientists have the knowledge to feed the world right now , but that is not happening , Sanchez said .
" It 's very frustrating , especially when you see children dying . ''
The fruits of biotechnology and the staples of modern agricultural scientific techniques include irrigation , crop rotation , reduced tilling , use of fertilizer and improved seeds .
It 's a way of farming differently instead of just using better seeds that requires extra money up - front that many African farmers do n't have , scientists said .
Fixing soil just is n't " sexy ' ' enough to interest governments or charities , said Robert Zeigler , director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Manila , Philippines .
Zeigler 's center last week planted its 133rd crop of rice in the same land since 1963 , trying to pinpoint the right combination of nitrogen and fertilizer .
Better seeds worked wonders .
But finding money for soil health is difficult and because of that , less work is accomplished , he said .
But there are success stories , Sanchez said , pointing to the small African country of Malawi .
Three years ago , the country 's new president invested 8 percent of Malawi 's national budget in a subsidy program to get fertilizer and better seeds to small farmers .
Each farmer got two bags of fertilizer and 4 1/ 2 pounds of seeds at less than half the cost .
Before the program started , one - third of Malawi was on food aid and the country was n't growing enough food for itself , Sanchez said .
It was producing 1.2 million tons of maize in 2005 .
In 2006 , Malawi had more than doubled its production .
By 2007 and 2008 , the crop was up to 3.4 and 3.3 million tons .
Now Malawi is exporting corn .
" In two years , the country has changed from a food aid recipient to a food aid donor and is self - sufficient , '' Sanchez said .
" if Malawi can do it , richer countries like Nigeria , Kenya can do it . ''

Eight months after his nine - year - old son died in a shooting incident involving private security guards from the US firm Blackwater , the boy 's father has called for an official apology and admission of guilt from the company , rather than compensation .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I am ready to sign a deal [ with Blackwater ] in exchange for an admission of the crime and an apology , " Mohammed Hafidh Abdul - Razzaq , a car spare - parts dealer from Baghdad , told the BBC .
" This is important for me , morally , for my family and my tribe . "
He said he had conveyed the message to one of the company 's officials when they met in the Iraqi capital ; but , he said , he was told that an admission would not be possible " for legal reasons " .
On Tuesday , Mr Abdul - Razzaq was one of three Iraqis to give evidence to a closed - door session of a federal grand jury in Washington investigating the shooting on 16 September , 2007 , in which 17 Iraqi civilians died , including Mr Abdul - Razzaq 's son Ali .
It was one of the most serious incidents involving private security firms in Iraq .
According to Blackwater Worldwide , its guards were responding to an attack on the convoy they were assigned to protect .
The company 's owner , Eric Prince , told a congressional hearing last year into the shooting that Nisoor Square was a " terrorist crime scene " .
A spokesperson for Blackwater declined a BBC invitation for an interview , citing the ongoing investigations .
' Ali 's dead '
Speaking to the BBC before he travelled , Mr Abdul - Razzaq said that he was not aware of any threat to the Blackwater convoy in Nisoor Square .
I began to shout down the road , ' They 've killed my son , they 've killed my son '
Mohammed Hafidh Abdul - Razzaq Mr Abdul - Razzaq had been driving home with his sister , her three children and Ali .
He said that " everything was quiet , nothing was happening " when the security guards began to open fire on civilian vehicles , including his own .
" They just kept shooting , although no - one was moving , they were just combing the whole road , tat tat tat , like that , there was nothing in the road . "
He said that he and his sister huddled together , each trying to protect the other , while the four children tried to find protection under cushions in the back of the car .
He said the shooting lasted " 10 , perhaps 15 minutes " and that when he climbed out of the bullet - ridden car , shaken but unharmed , one of his nephews called out to him from the back seat : " Uncle , Ali 's dead . "
Sobbing , he described opening the car door to a scene of horror .
His son had been shot in the head .
" I pushed him back inside and I began to shout down the road , ' They 've killed my son , they 've killed my son ' . "
' New procedures '
Following the shooting , Mr Abdul - Razzaq said that on at least two occasions he had been offered compensation by Blackwater and US government officials in Baghdad .
On each occasion , he said he had turned down the offers - one of which was for US $ 12,500 .
" Other people who have relatives who were victims took the money , but I refused , " he said .
Patrick Kennedy , under secretary of state for management , confirmed that it was US policy to offer compensation to Iraqi civilians " in circumstances where it was evident that [ they ] were not engaged in an attack on the United States " .
Mr Kennedy said that the US government had established new procedures for its security contractors - including Blackwater - following the shooting last year .
Each convoy was now required to be accompanied by a US state department official , and to install cameras and recording equipment on their vehicles .
" I know of no other country than Iraq that employs these measures , " Mr Kennedy said .
John Holmes , a retired major general and director of the British security firm Erinys International , which has been offering protection services in Iraq since August 2003 , said there was now a " closer relationship " between the American military and all the private security convoys .
Companies were now required to give at least 72 hours notice to the military of all movements - something lacking in the past , he said .
But , he added : " There will always be some difference between companies , depending on their previous military experience and nationality , the same as the difference between units in a multi-national force , which have a different interpretation of the rules and regulations . "

Very early this morning , after many voters had already gone to sleep , the conventional wisdom of the elite political pundit class that resides on television shifted hard , and possibly irretrievably , against Senator Hillary Clinton ’s continued viability as a presidential candidate .
The moment came shortly after midnight Eastern time , captured in a devastatingly declarative statement from Tim Russert of NBC News : “ We now know who the Democratic nominee ’s going to be , and no one ’s going to dispute it , ” he said on MSNBC .
“ Those closest to her will give her a hard - headed analysis , and if they lay it all out , they ’ll say : ‘ What is the rationale ?
What do we say to the undeclared super delegates tomorrow ?
Why do we tell them you ’re staying in the race ? ’
And tonight , there ’s no good answer for that . ”
It was not exactly Walter Cronkite declaring that the Vietnam War would end in stalemate .
But the impact was apparent almost immediately , starting with The Drudge Report , the online news billboard that is the home page to many political reporters in Washington and news producers in New York .
It had as its lead story a link to a YouTube clip of Mr. Russert ’s comments , accompanied by a photograph of a beaming Mr. Obama with his wife , Michelle , and the headline , “ The Nominee . ”
The thought echoed throughout the world of instant political analysis , steamrolling the Clinton campaign ’s attempts to promote the idea that her victory in Indiana was nonetheless an upset in the face of Mr. Obama ’s heavy spending and his campaign ’s predictions that he would win there , or that she could still come back if delegates in Florida and Michigan are seated .
Defenders of deferred prosecutions say that they have been too harshly criticized lately and that they play a crucial role in allowing the government to secure the cooperation of a company while avoiding the time , expense and uncertainty of a trial .
The agreements , government officials say , also avoid the type of companywide havoc seen most acutely in the case of Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm that was shuttered in 2002 after being indicted in the Enron scandal .
The firm ’s collapse threw 28,000 employees out of work .
At a Congressional hearing last month , Mr. Ashcroft defended the agreements , saying that they avoided “ destroying entire corporations ” through criminal indictments .
“ Prosecutors understand that a corporate indictment can be a corporate death sentence , ” he said .
“ A deferred prosecution can avoid the catastrophic collateral consequences and costs that are associated with corporate conviction . ”
Paul J. McNulty , a former deputy attorney general who put new guidelines in place in 2006 for corporate investigations at the Justice Department , said in an interview , “ There ’s a fundamental misapprehension with D.P.A. ’s to think that they ’re a break for the company . ”

With the imposition of fines and an outside monitor , “ the reality is that for the government , it gets pretty much everything without the difficulty of going forward with an indictment , ” said Mr. McNulty , who is now in private practice .
“ I think companies are beginning to wonder whether they ought to fight more , because they are pretty burdensome . ”
But critics of the agreements question that assertion .
Charles Intriago , a former federal prosecutor in Miami who specializes in money - laundering issues , said that huge penalties , like the $ 65 million fine for American Express Bank International in 2007 , were “ peanuts ” compared with the damage posed by a criminal conviction .
The company was accused of failing to enact internal controls to guard against laundering of drug money and other reporting problems .
The agreements were once rare , but their use has skyrocketed in the current administration , with 35 deals last year alone by the Justice Department , lawyers who follow the trend said .
Banks , financial service companies and auditors have frequently entered into such agreements , including recent ones involving Merrill Lynch , the Bank of New York , AmSouth Bank , KPMG and others .
Beyond financial crimes , deferred agreements have been used in lieu of prosecuting companies  though not individuals  for export control violations , obscenity violations , Medicare and Medicaid fraud , kickbacks and environmental violations .
So DivX Corporation 's Stage6 has croaked .
The service 's ' goodbye , cruel word ' note says it was a victim of its own success , but that it proved ' it 's possible to distribute true high definition video on the Internet ' .
What it really showed is how deliriously inefficient streaming video is , whether it 's high def or otherwise .
It cost at least $ 1 m a month to run Stage6 with its 17.4 million unique users a month , whereas ( at an informed guess )
The Pirate Bay costs about $ 50,000 a month all - in for its 92.5 million .
That ’s $ 57,000 per million users for Stage6 ; $ 540 per million for The Pirate Bay ( not including people using its tracker without visiting the site , which adds a lot of Mininova ‘s traffic as well , not to mention the other big indexes . )
So at the very least , The Pirate Bay is a hundred and five times more efficient than Stage6 was .
But inefficiency is not the only reason the service is no more , while the vilified Pirate Bay , Mininova et al. are still with us .
Stage6 was also a lot more illegal than a BitTorrent tracker — whether it pretended to be complying with the DMCA or not .
Surprisingly under reported after the abrupt demise of the service was the 6th Feb US court ruling against DivX ’s attempt to establish its protection under the DMCA ’s safe harbour provisions ahead of a legal battle with Universal Music Group .
My reading of the company ’s consequent , speedy exit from the stage ( and correct me if you think I ’m wrong ) is that Stage6 did n’t have the cash or confidence to test its luck any further .
( How much this affects DivX as a whole remains to be seen .
But only six days after the court decision , Jerome Vashisht Rota , the inventor of DivX and a major shareholder in DivX corporation , was openly dumping stock . )
It ’s not hard to read the tea leaves .
While GooTube ( famously being sued by Viacom on pretty much the same grounds ) probably wo n’t lose sleep , smaller players eating their lunches off of pirate content will be paying very close attention .
VCs burning money on pushing streaming media to the masses will at least want to imagine some returns on their investment rather than the further expense of executives in the dock .
So why is the exit of Stage6 a step in the right direction ?
Because for all the hyperbole in the mainstream ( and sometimes online ) media about the YouTube or Google Video or Stage6 ‘ revolution ‘ , the relationship to media they offer us is far too traditional .
Come to this place .
Be served your media ( and suck down your advertising along with it ) .
Go away again .
Yes , we can upload material , but I ’m not the only one who feels that this was n’t the primary function of Stage6 , even if it did distribute about 50,000 copies of STEAL THIS FILM II before its demise .
No need to share , no need to understand the technology , no need to think .
It ’s what they called ‘ lean back ’ media : millions of people slouching thoughtlessly in front of an marketing - emitting portal .
The promise of P2P is a thorough breakdown of the kind of power that congeals in a portal like Stage6 .
A user - owned , user - operated infrastructure that does n’t require massive investment , does n’t by default allow oligarchs to make more money from us .
A disruptive , mutable infrastructure that brings media to us in the context we choose , forcing a massive re-think about what , why and how we create — as individuals , as businesses , as a society .
It is lazy for us to rely at all on portals like Stage6 , but worse than lazy , it ’s dangerous .
It suggests we do n’t value the potential autonomy P2P offers us .
Our old media masters profited from control of content : are we really so happy to swap them for new ones who profit from control of our eyeballs ?
However lazy we are , I think that most of us are able to see that that this is n’t a model that we want to encourage .
The demise of Stage6 and the portals that will follow gives us cause to think about strengthening our infrastructures : and that ca n’t be a bad thing .

A self - proclaimed " minister of marijuana " says pot is his religion and he has every right to use it .
Cops disagree and busted him while pulling 100 plants out of his house .
Steven Swalick does n't use terms like " pot " or even " marijuana . "
Those terms appeared to upset him during a jailhouse interview .
He admitted to using cannabis and even growing it but says it was for his religion .
And he wanted only to be addressed as the " Reverend . "
" It is the tree of life , " said Swalick .
" I 've come to realize that the oil that is in that seed will provide nourishment for your whole body .
You will need no other food .
" The 56 - year - old Swalick claims he has practiced a religious belief that requires the use of cannabis since he was 15 - years - old .
He claims to be an ordained minister .
He calls his home a sanctuary of sorts for a religion called the " Hawaiian Cannabis Ministries . "
"
You have the right to use an otherwise illegal sacrament in a religious practice if it is mandated within your religion , " he said .
The Palm Bay police department 's SWAT team raided Swallick 's home , Wednesday afternoon , seizing 107 plants , along with all sorts of equipment used to grow and harvest them .
Police say it would be worth $ 100,000 on the streets .
Swalick said it was n't being sold , but rather grown for religious ceremonies .
When the word " marijuana " was used , he became upset .
" We do not use that word , " he said .
" Please forgive me and I 'll apologize for you .
The word is cannabis .
It 's the holy sacrament recognized by the Bible .
" Swalick now faces felony drug charges , which he believes will eventually be cleared under constitutional religious protections .
" I can not be convicted by man .
I answer to the Lord , " he said .
Bond was set at $ 20,000 .

The hackers panel is one of the highlights of InfoSecurity Europe High street chains will be the next victims of cyber terrorism , some of the world 's elite hackers have warned .
They claim it is only a " matter of time " before the likes of Tesco and Marks & Spencer are targeted .
Criminals could use the kind of tactics which crippled Estonia 's government and some firms last year , they warned .
The experts were members of the infamous " Hackers Panel " which convened in London this week at the InfoSecurity Europe conference .
The panel includes penetration testers and so - called " white hat " hackers , who help companies tighten up their digital security by searching for flaws in their defences .
Previous panellists include Gary McKinnon , known as Solo , alleged by the US government to have hacked into dozens of US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense computers .
The " hackers " usually remain anonymous , " for security reasons " , but this year 's panellists agreed to break cover .
Common cause First up was Roberto Preatoni , the founder of the cyber crime monitoring site , Zone - H , and WabSabiLabi , a trading site for security researchers .
His appearance came just a few months after he was arrested by Italian authorities on charges of hacking and wiretapping , as part of the ongoing investigation into the Telecom Italia scandal .
Mr Preatoni told the audience that the attacks in Estonia were a harbinger for a new era of cyber warfare .
Notorious hacker Gary McKinnon has previously taken part in the panel " I 'm afraid we will have to get used to this , " said Mr Preatoni , also known as SyS64738 .
" We had all been waiting for this kind of attack to happen .
" Estonia was just unfortunate to be the first country to experience it .
But very soon , our own [ western ] companies and countries will be getting attacked for political and religious reasons .
" This kind of attack can happen at any time .
And it will happen . "
During the two week " cyber war " against Estonia , hackers shut down the websites of banks , governments and political parties using " denial - of - service " ( DoS ) attacks , which knock websites offline by swamping servers with page requests .
As many of the attacks originated from Russia , the Estonian government pointed the finger at the Kremlin .
But Mr Preatoni said that , having spoken to contacts in the hacking community , he was clear that " Putin was not involved " .
" In my opinion , this was a collection of private individuals who spontaneously gathered under the same flag .
" Even though Estonia is one of the world 's most advanced countries in IT technology , the whole economy was brought to its knees .
" That 's the beauty of asymmetric warfare .
You do n't need a lot of money , or an army of people .
You can do it from the comfort of your living room , with a beer in your hand .
Gate control
His warning was echoed by Steve Armstrong , who teaches seminars in hacking techniques , at the SANS Institute for information security training .
" If someone wants to have a pop at the UK , they are unlikely to go for the government web servers .
They will go for the lower hanging fruit - companies which are seen as good representatives of the country .
Hi -tech crime : A glossary Cracking hi-tech crime " The likes of Tesco , Marks & Spencer and B &Q can be seen as legitimate targets .
" We have to get the message across to companies [ to invest in information security ] .
" At the moment Chief Executives are only interested in the bottom line .
But remember - if tesco.com goes down , that 's a lot of shopping . "
Mr Preatoni said that the Estonian government 's repeated failure to thwart the attacks was proof that we still have " no good solutions " for denial of service attacks .
The panellists then argued over whether Internet Service Providers should do more to tighten security , by helping customers ' protect their computers from being " zombified " by hackers for use in distributed DoS attacks .
" Actually , I do n't think the ISPs should have any role in security , " said Preatoni .
" In my opinion , that 's like asking the Royal Mail to be responsible for the quality of your post . "
But his view was immediately challenged by the third panellist , Jason Creasey , head of research at the independent Information Security Forum .
" I believe ISPs can play a phenomenal role in security , with a little bit of legal pressure , " he claimed .
Net weakness
He was backed by an audience member , Angus Pinkerton , of Lynks Security Consulting .
" The only way to defend against a distributed attack is with a distributed defence , " he argued .
" I think it 's unacceptable that ISPs are content to let their customers be part of bot-nets . "
He challenged Steve Armstrong 's view that asking ISPs to perform security duties was " fundamentally , censorship . "
" This is not about free speech , " said Mr Pinkerton .
" Free speech does not entitle you to shout fire in a crowded theatre . "
In the meantime , Mr Preatoni warned the audience it is " only going to get easier " to carry out a DoS attack , because he claimed the latest net address system , known as Internet Protocol Version 6 ( IPv6 ) , is actually more amenable to DoS.
Later , he told the BBC that the rise in cyber attacks originating in China was a convenient cloak for western countries to disguise their own cyber espionage activities .
" It 's too easy to blame China , " he said .
" In fact , legitimate countries are bouncing their attacks through China .
It 's very easy to do , so why not ?
" My evil opinion is that some western governments are already doing this . "

This morning Texas Democratic Party Chairman Boyd Richie and DNC member Betty Richie announced that they are endorsing Barack Obama for President .
“ Too many Texas families find themselves unable to make ends meet , much less save and invest in the future , due to Republican policies that burden the middle class and divide Americans , ” Boyd Richie said .
He also discussed Obama ’s work to help build the Texas Democratic Party , “ I am also grateful for Senator Obama ’s commitment to help build the Texas Democratic Party .
Senator Obama and his campaign understand something that Texans have known for at least a couple of years – that when Democratic candidates invest the time and resources necessary , Texas Democrats have the numbers to compete and win across every region of our great state .
We made progress in 2006 , and in 2008 , the Texas Democratic Party is more energized , better organized , and we are poised to make significant gains this fall . ”
Betty Richie mentioned how she thought Obama was the best candidate to address the needs of rural Texans , “ Under Senator Obama ’s administration , there is no doubt the issues of concern to rural Texas will be put front and center .
The futures of our families are far too important to leave in the hands of any Republican .
It is time for a Democrat to put our country and our state back on the right track . ”

The meeting of the party ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee is really just a formality tomorrow .
I suspect that after the last two primaries next week , no matter what the new number is to wrap up the nomination , the superdelegates will put Obama over the top .
I think this is the first endorsement that talked about Obama and rural issues .
This is something that the campaign needs to do more of if they are going to run strong in the swing states .
The voters will decide the election in places like Virginia , Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Ohio are n’t in the cities .
They live in the small towns and rural areas .
This is a group of voters that Obama needs to openly court .
He is already poised to dominate the urban areas across the country , where he needs help is with small town America .
Hopefully , his choice of running mate will help address this concern .

The US Dunkin ' Donuts chain has pulled an online advertisement featuring celebrity chef Rachael Ray after critics argued that a scarf she wore in the ad offers symbolic support for terrorism .
Dunkin '
Donuts said today it pulled the ad over the weekend because of what it calls a " misperception " about the scarf that detracted from its original intent to promote its iced coffee .
Critics , including conservative commentator Michelle Malkin , complained that the scarf appeared to be traditional garb worn by Arab men .
The ad's critics say such scarves have come to symbolise Muslim extremism and terrorism .
Remember the action figures from your childhood ?
The ones that gave you hours of unbridled entertainment ?
As it turns out , some of it was so crappy it borders on depressing .
The action figure industry is based on one idea : that young boys do n't exactly have high standards when it comes to quality .
5 Rambo
When a toy manufacturer markets an action figure based off a crazed killing machine , we have to assume they aimed it at children who were told bedtime stories that started off with " So , there I was ... knee - deep in Charlie guts ... "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Or maybe , as brutally violent as the films are , John Rambo still appeals to the 8 - year - old in all of us .
He rebels against a world that , as Will Smith said best , parents just do n't understand .
We all felt like Rambo at one time or another , just wanting to go over to our friend 's house to play , causing us to throw a murderous temper tantrum so monumentally destructive no amount of time - out can clean the blood from our hands , unless it involves a 4 - by - 4 concrete cell and a bucket in which to defecate .
Figuratively .
Worst Toy in the Line :
This honor actually goes to two horrendously designed figures .
First , there 's the Rambo figure ( appropriately named " Rambo " ) which is strapped with oodles of killing mechanisms , none which can disguise the fact that he looks like a greased - up cage dancer that just wants to bump and grind his shell - shock away .

Then there is the " RAMBO ONE - MAN ASSULT JET " which is more Rambo then jet .
There is something inherently wrong when you see a man piloting a jet that has replaced a conventional cockpit glass dome with a plastic welding visor , and the typical flight suit with a more breathable shirtless look .
When you see a man flying at you in a vehicle that offers about as much protection as a Harley - Davidson , you know the bare - chested psycho steering the thing does n't care about his own life but , rather , the amount of people - chunks that will inevitably obstruct his view of the slaughter .
Also , the jet , like most of these Rambo toys , is loaded to the sweaty mullet with unnecessary missiles , grenade launchers and guns , all of which goes against the underdog spirit of the whole franchise .
All Rambo really needs is an ejector seat and a survival knife with which to rain steel justice upon those of the evil persuasion .
In the first movie , the only weapon he 's given at the outset of the movie is the fucking forest .
This is why a Rambo toy line is so ill - conceived .
To make money , every action figure needs tie - in toys , bad ass , death - weilding versions of the Barbie Dream House .
But the only Rambo toy you should really need is John Rambo .
To put it another way , it 's tough to justify tie - in toys when your protagonist only needs his bare hands to punch someone 's head off .
(* UPDATE : Due to a mathematical error , Hillary Clinton 's loans to herself were added twice in the calculation of this item .
Her total debts are about $ 21 million , not $ 31 million .
A corrected item covering the first five paragraphs of this one has been published here . )
No wonder Sen. Hillary Clinton was so late filing her required campaign financial reports Tuesday night .
Her political team did n't want the shocking news in it to overshadow her lopsided thumping of Sen. Barack Obama in Kentucky .
But here 's the morning after , pay - up time .
Clinton 's campaign debt has now soared to nearly $ 31 million , according to numbers crunched early this morning by The Times ' campaign finance guru , Dan Morain .
She added another $ 9.5 million in unpaid bills to vendors this last month alone , pushing her total debt to vendors and herself to the new astronomical figure , about a 50 % debt increase in one month .
According to a campaign release put out Tuesday evening as election returns revealed her big win in Kentucky and loss in Oregon , Clinton raised " approximately $ 22 million " from other people in April .
The release also touted that $ 10 million had poured in within 48 hours of another lopsided Clinton victory over Obama , that one in Pennsylvania , and said it was the second best fund - raising month of her entire campaign .
But the number collected is actually closer to $ 21 million and the release also neglected to mention that she spent $ 28.9 million , nearly $ 8 million more than she took in .
She used personal loans to make up part of the difference .
She also delayed payments to consultants .
Including the $ 9.5 million in unpaid bills from April , she owes consultants and other vendors $ 19.5 million .
Not to mention the total $ 11.4 million she has loaned herself .

The likely Democratic nominee Obama continues to vastly out - raise Sen. John McCain , but the presumed Republican nominee is closing the money gap with the significant help of his party , according to new campaign finance reports filed Tuesday .

Gallup Daily : Both Democrats About Even With McCain Obama ’s 10 - point lead over Clinton continues for fourth day , 51 % to 41 %
PRINCETON , NJ -- Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are running about neck and neck with John McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking trial heats for the presidential election .
Clinton holds a slight edge over McCain , 47 % to 45 % , while Obama ties McCain at 46 % .
Clinton 's two percentage point lead over McCain in Gallup 's May 27 - June 1 interviewing is not statistically significant .
However , when considering that she has polled two points better than the presumptive Republican nominee in each of the last four Gallup Poll Daily tracking reports , she does appear to have a real , albeit , slight advantage against McCain .
Furthermore , Clinton has led McCain by at least two points in every Gallup tracking release since May 8 , and at times by as much as five points .
By contrast , Obama has been essentially tied with McCain for over a week , and has not led McCain by more than one percentage point in any Gallup Poll Daily tracking release since May 22 .
More generally , the current differences between how the two Democrats stack up against McCain , though slight , reflect a persistent pattern seen throughout May .
While Obama and Clinton are now at rough parity among registered voters for the fall election , Obama holds a significant lead over Clinton in national Democratic preferences for the nomination .
In Gallup Poll Daily tracking from May 29 - June 1 , Obama leads 51 % to 41 % .
This is his fourth consecutive day with a 10 - point advantage for the nomination .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
The final primary elections of the year will take place June 3 in Montana and South Dakota , with most observers assuming Obama will be the presumptive nominee when the voting is over .
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from May 29 , May 31 and June 1 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,255 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from May 27 - 29 , May 31 and June 1 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,378 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Komodo Edit vs Komodo IDE
Komodo Edit is an free dynamic language editor put out by Active State , while Komodo IDE is Active State ’s commercial dynamic language IDE .
The two share a common project system , so although I had installed and used Komodo Edit first , when installed Komodo IDE and opened it for the first time it automatically loaded the project I had created in Komodo Edit .
The most immediately apparent different between the two regarding Python development is that IDE has a debugger and Edit does not .
The next most immediately apparent difference between the two is that IDE has a Code ( browsing ) tool window and Edit does not .
Komodo vs PyScripter vs WingIDE – Goto Definition and Code Completion
Goto definition support appears to be identical between the two Komodo variants , but it is n’t as good as the free PyScripter or the commercial WingIDE Pro .
The inability to find definitions as well as PyScripter or WingIDE also means that the Komodo variant ’s code completion is not on par either .
Once case that did n’t work for Komodo was actually quite simple .
I have a Camera class defined in one file and its made use of in another file .
The use is quite standard , simply camera = Camera ( … ) , yet the two Komodo variants could not find the definition .
When I was initially evaluating Python IDEs and editors , one of my top criteria was that goto definition worked well and I found the best ones to be WingIDE and PyScripter with WingIDE being the better of the two .
With that said , I ’ve been frequently finding that goto definition and code completion were not available throughout much of my code in even in WingIDE and PyScripter as my code makes use of a lot of the dynamic features the Python language and thus making it difficult–although I do n’t think impossible for goto definition with a disambiguation dialog ala the decent C++ editors –to determine types at design time via static analysis .
So perhaps I overemphasized that particular feature in my initial evaluations .
Komodo vs PyScripter vs WingIDE – Find and Replace
Both Komodo variant ’s find and replace feature work the same , and , as with WingIDE , they work as I would expect of modern IDE .
PyScripter is the lone standout regarding Find and Replace being deficient .
I previously posted on that subject in detail here .
Komodo vs PyScripter vs WingIDE – Running and Debugging
Komodo IDE ’s debugger has “ feature ” that it only runs / debugs the python file that is the currently active document .
While there are times when this is definitely convenience , when you are working with an application comprised of many files in different directories , having to switch the open file every time you want to run / debug is quite annoying .
WingIDE lets you specify which file is currently the main file from the right click menu in its project explorer , and you can also tell it to run the current file rather then the file that is currently tagged as main .
PyScripter is in between the two .
When you run / debug from the main debug menu ( or the keyboard shortcuts bound to those menu items ) it runs / debugs the current file , but it also allows you to specify run configurations that show up in the project explorer and have right click menus that let you run that configuration rather then the current file .
UPDATE : While debugging Komodo IDE does not show you the current value of any variable if you mouse hover over it .
Both PyScripter and WingIDE do so to the best of their ability .
Also Komodo IDE does not handle non-standard numerical types well at all such as come when using numpy .
If you sum an array comprised of numpy .
int32 you get a numpy .
int32 and rather then showing you the value of this the best Komodo IDE can do is show you an array of four single character strings , thus you first have to convert the characters into hex then string them together in the correct order to get the actual number .
Neither PyScripter or WingIDE have this issue and they are both able to show you the content of a numpy .
array as well .
So I give WingIDE the top mark for debugging , followed closely by PyScripter , with Komodo IDE trailing far behind .
In 1990 Gary Weaver of Ohio was alleged to have bought $ 21.64 cents worth of merchandise from a store , using a roll of dimes to pay for part of the bill .
After he left , a store employee discovered that the roll was filled with pennies , and that roll was capped with a dime on each end .
The long arm of the law caught up with Mr. Weaver on Wednesday and Municipal Court Judge Richard Bernat set a $ 1 million bond on the case .
That means Weaver is in the jail – that officials say is overcrowded and in need of replacement – on a bond that is $ 999,978.36 higher than the amount he is accused of stealing 18 years ago .

Drought has already spurred significant changes in Australia ’s agricultural heartland .
Some farmers are abandoning rice , which requires large amounts of water , to plant less water - intensive crops like wheat or , especially here in southeastern Australia , wine grapes .
Other rice farmers have sold fields or water rights , usually to grape growers .

Scientists and economists worry that the reallocation of scarce water resources  away from rice and other grains and toward more lucrative crops and livestock  threatens poor countries that import rice as a dietary staple .
The global agricultural crisis is threatening to become political , pitting the United States and other developed countries against the developing world over the need for affordable food versus the need for renewable energy .
Many poorer nations worry that subsidies from rich countries to support biofuels , which turn food , like corn , into fuel , are pushing up the price of staples .
The World Bank and the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization called on major agricultural nations to overhaul policies to avoid a social explosion from rising food prices .
With rice , which is not used to make biofuel , the problem is availability .
Even in normal times , little of the world ’s rice is actually exported  more than 90 percent is consumed in the countries where it is grown .
In the last quarter - century , rice consumption has outpaced production , with global reserves plunging by half just since 2000 .
A plant disease is hurting harvests in Vietnam , reducing supply .
And economic uncertainty has led producers to hoard rice and speculators and investors to see it as a lucrative or at least safe bet .
All these factors have made countries that buy rice on the global market vulnerable to extreme price swings .
Senegal and Haiti each import four - fifths of their rice , and both have faced mounting unrest as prices have increased .
Police suppressed violent demonstrations in Dakar on March 30 , and unrest has spread to other rice - dependent nations in West Africa , notably Ivory Coast .
The Haitian president , René Préval , after a week of riots , announced subsidies for rice buyers on Saturday .
Scientists expect the problem to worsen .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , set up by the United Nations , predicted last year that even slight warming would lower agricultural output in the tropics and subtropics .
Aid agencies are warning supplies are not getting to the areas worst hit UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned Burma 's military government for not allowing international aid to reach the victims of Cyclone Nargis .
Mr Brown told the BBC that a natural disaster had been turned into a " man-made catastrophe " because of the negligence of the ruling generals .
He said their actions since the cyclone , said to have killed at least 78,000 , amounted to inhuman treatment .
France has said Burma is on the verge of committing a crime against humanity .
Burma has refused to allow in French and US aid ships which are waiting off the coast .
In addition to the dead , some 56,000 people are officially reported missing .
Burma took foreign diplomats on a tour of the worst - hit region , the Irrawaddy Delta , on Saturday but the visit was dismissed by a senior US envoy as a " show " .
The international community is trying to organise a team of Asian and United Nations aid workers in the hope this will be more acceptable to Burma 's rulers , a UK Foreign Office minister has said .
' This is inhuman ' Mr Brown said Burma 's ruling generals would be judged by the world and their own people for thwarting the assistance offered by the rest of the world .

" This is inhuman .
We have an intolerable situation , created by a natural disaster , " he said .
" It is being made into a man -made catastrophe by the negligence , the neglect and the inhuman treatment of the Burmese people by a regime that is failing to act and to allow the international community to do what it wants to do .
" The responsibility lies with the Burmese regime and they must be held accountable . "
Asked if he believed it was time for dropping aid by air , Mr Brown said nothing was being ruled out .
The UK and others are working to channel British aid through China and other Asian states , Mr Brown added .
UK Foreign Office Minister Lord Malloch - Brown told the BBC from Rangoon that the idea of a mixed relief team was a " last best effort to try and meet the anxieties and paranoia ... of the regime " .
" Ultimately we will not stand by or go away ... because the government wo n't receive assistance and deliver it , " he said .
Lord Malloch - Brown travelled to Burma on Saturday and met aid workers and UN officials , according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) .

However , the authorities have allowed the UN and some other agencies to hand out supplies directly .
A team of 50 Indian medical personnel is also being allowed to fly into Rangoon on Saturday , equipped with medical supplies .
Foreign diplomats were flown to several sites in the delta by helicopter where they were shown survivors receiving aid in camps .
" It was a show - that 's what they wanted us to see , " Shari Villarosa , the top American diplomat in Burma , told The Associated Press .
But Bernard Delpuech , head of the European Commission Humanitarian Office in Rangoon , said the trip had at least shown " the magnitude of the devastation " .

The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator , John Holmes , is due to visit Rangoon on Sunday in a bid to persuade the government to grant more access to UN relief workers and expand its aid effort .
Correspondents say that at this stage it is not clear who he will be able to talk to given that Burma 's leader , Gen Than Shwe , has refused to answer calls from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon .
The Association of South East Asian Nations is due to meet on Monday , with plans for an aid donors ' conference likely to be discussed .

What are these ?
The only thing that Obama and Tiger Woods have in common is that they are both part white .
So what ’s the McCain campaign ’s point ?
That Obama is n’t racially pure enough ?
Remember , this this is n’t the first time this has happened .
McCain keeps being introduced by racists , and the question is why .
More from MSNBC , that missed the larger story :
Before McCain spoke , former Army Staff Sergeant David Bellavia introduced the Arizona senator , telling those in attendance he wants his sons to view McCain as a role model , versus someone like Tiger Woods .
While McCain did not mention either of his Democratic opponents , Bellavia engaged , calling the Arizona senator and former prisoner of war “ the real audacity of hope . ”
Ah , yes – John McCain , the great white hope .

DNC Chair Howard Dean delivered this week ’s Democratic radio address , which he used to point out the differences between the Democratic Party , and Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
After welcoming the Pope , Dean laid out the challenges facing America .
“ We face challenging times in our country and our world .
Our troops are in Iraq – many on their second or even third tour of duty .
The gap between the most fortunate and everyone else is widening .
As we elect our nation ’s next leader it ’s important that we choose someone who understands the struggles that so many families here at home face as they try to make ends meet .
As I listened to Senator John McCain ’s remarks about the economy this week , I heard more of the same Republican policies that George Bush has brought us for the last eight years , ” Dean said .
Dean detailed America ’s economic woes , “ This year , more than a quarter of a million Americans have already lost their jobs .
Since the Republicans have occupied the White House , seven million more Americans have lost their health insurance .
Wages have fallen .
Gas prices are at record highs .
And even groceries cost more than they have in the past 17 years .
And America has the largest deficits in our history .
Senator McCain believes we are better off . ”

He asked how McCain was going to cut taxes and still pay for the Iraq war .
He also discussed McCain ’s flip - flops , “ On the campaign trail , Senator McCain talks about spending American tax dollars responsibly .
But how can he think he ’ll pay for a $ 12 billion a month war in Iraq , make the Bush tax cuts permanent , and give additional tax cuts to billionaires without making our deficits even bigger ?
So far in this campaign we have heard very little “ straight talk ” from John McCain .
He was against the Bush tax cuts before he was for them .
He was for comprehensive immigration reform before he was against it .
He was for campaign finance reform before he said it did n’t apply to him . ”
Dean mentioned McCain ’s so called “ compassion tour ” next week , “ Next week , Senator McCain will embark on what he ’s calling a compassion tour .
We have n’t seen much compassion from George Bush and I do n’t think we are going to see any more from John McCain : privatizing social security , denying our children health care , adding eight trillion in new deficits , no plan to turn our economy around , or help people keep their homes . ”
“ We honor John McCain ’s service to our country , but John McCain is not the right choice for America ’s future .
This November , voters do have a choice .
If you want to see more of this Bush economy , if you want to see our troops in Iraq for a long period of time , we can stay the course with Senator McCain , ” Dean concluded .
During bad economic times
Republicans have chosen a nominee whose strength is a wildly unpopular war , and whose weakness is the economy .
The nomination of McCain demonstrates the level of disconnect that exists between the GOP and average Americans .
Once the Democratic Party chooses their nominee , beating McCain should be like shooting fish in a barrel .
McCain has no answer for how he will pay for the war , and cut taxes .
He ca n’t call himself fiscally responsible and justify spending $ 12 billion a month in Iraq in the same breath .
McCain is like Bob Dole in 1996 .
This is an election that the GOP expects to lose , so they nominated an old party war horse to fall on the sword for them .

OTTAWA  Nalgene , the brand that popularized water bottles made from hard , clear and nearly unbreakable polycarbonate , will stop using the plastic because of growing concern over one of its ingredients .
The decision by Nalgene Outdoor Products , a unit of Thermo Fisher Scientific , based in Rochester , came after reports that the Canadian government would declare the chemical bisphenol - a , or BPA , toxic .
Some animal studies have linked the chemical to changes in the hormonal system .
Those reports also prompted many of Canada ’s largest retailers , including Wal - Mart Canada , to remove food - related products made with plastics containing the compound chemical , like baby bottles , toddler sipping cups and food containers , from their stores this week .
“ Based on all available scientific evidence , we continue to believe that Nalgene products containing BPA are safe for their intended use , ” Steven Silverman , the general manager of the Nalgene unit , said in a statement .
“ However , our customers indicated they preferred BPA - free alternatives , and we acted in response to those concerns . ”

Our real enemy ?
Hint :
It is n't the terrorists .
By Steve Kirsch Terrorists are just a distraction .
The real enemy is government stupidity .
Here 's how I know that .
Last week , I was diagnosed with a rare incurable blood cancer called Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) .
Because it kills , on average , only about 1,200 people per year , it 's considered an orphan disease so it gets very little money and attention from the government and drug companies .
It 's basically a death sentence .
I have a little more than 5 years to live .
As I learned more about my disease , some of the most significant things I learned were : the lifetime risk of developing cancer is 1 in 2 for men and 1 in 3 for women
there is a 25 % chance that you will die from cancer
500,000 people die from cancer each year
the government spends about $ 5 billion a year on research ; $ 114 M of which is spent on non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas collectively , but zero dollars are spent on WM specifically .
Only 8 % of the research proposals to the NIH get funding .
Researchers spend about 30 % of their time writing grant proposals .
Since 92 % are turned down , this is an enormous waste of our most precious medical talent .
Even prominent , highly decorated researchers such as Ken Anderson at Harvard , only have 8 % of their research proposals granted .
our society spends $ 200 billion a year on medical care for cancer victims ( 40 times the amount we spend on prevention )
Gleevec is proof that we now have the technology to create real " wonder drugs " that cure cancers that were previously untreatable
the researchers on my particular cancer said that they could efficiently deploy more funds to accelerate their research .
They are confident that they can create a " wonder drug " for my disease .
They just lack the funds .
They get zero dollars from the government now .
the research dollars for cancer have been going down every year in real dollars for several years now
cancer research has never been a national priority
To put the cancer numbers in perspective , a disease called " terrorism " in the US kills , on average , about 224 people per year .
Approximately 0 people per year are killed by terrorists from Iraq .
At that size , it should be categorized like my disease as an orphan disease and it should get no government funding at all .
Yet , we spend over $ 100 billion a year fighting it in Iraq alone .
Not only that , but every year , four times as many lives are lost fighting it , than are directly killed by the disease itself !
In short , we 've save more lives by not fighting it at all .
Even worse is that the more money we spend fighting this disease , the more prevalent it becomes and the more people unnecessarily lose their lives !
So instead of putting our dollars where they would do the most good and save the most lives , our government does the exact opposite : we allocate our dollars in such a way as to maximize the number of people killed .
In fact , it is hard to conceive of a more inefficient allocation of resources .
This is government stupidity at its finest .
Here it is in black and white : Cause of death Number of US deaths per year $ allocated per year by US government to prevent those deaths Terrorism 224 $ 100 B Cancer 500,000 $ 5 B Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia 1,200 zero .
There are also 0 FDA approved drugs for this disease .
Perhaps we are spending all this money in Iraq because we have data that if we do not , then terrorists from Iraq will kill , on average , 10 million Americans each year since that is the only way you could justify the dollar expenditure .
That is an interesting projection since as far as I know , no American inside the US has died at the hands of a terrorist who came from Iraq ever .
Am I wrong ?
So the dollar allocation makes no sense to me .
Does it make sense to you ?
There is a better way .
If I were running the country , here 's what I would do .
First I would disarm the terrorists by by changing our behavior to eliminate all the reasons that people , even our allies , do n't like us .
I would pull out of Iraq now and vow never to invade a foreign country again unless we are either attacked by that country or we are part of a UN - sanctioned mission .
I would offer our friendship and our help to every country where basic human rights are upheld .
Then I 'd take all the money I 'd save and invest it in areas that would save lives that would make everyone on the planet want us to succeed .
In particular , I would be a leader in world efforts to combat disease and global warming .
I 'd allocate money " in proportion to the benefit . "
For example , if we are spending $ 100 billion a year on global warming , I 'd provide the biggest tax dollars to things that make the biggest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Similarly , if we are fighting disease , I 'd spend the dollars allocated for fatal disease research in proportion to the number of deaths from that disease per year .
If you can't spend those dollars on a disease because we lack a critical mass of good scientists doing first rate research in that area , then we should bank those dollars each year for use in the future ( instead of losing it like we do now ) .
And we should be very intelligent in our allocation within a disease by focusing our spending primarily on team science proposals that coordinate efforts across multiple disciplines to methodically step through the process required to cure a disease including discovery , diagnosis , and treatment .
Funding an uncoordinated potpourri of individual investigator - initiated research proposals ( hypothesis - driven basic research ) should still be done , as there have been tremendous discoveries because of this ( such as telomerase ) , but not at the expense of a coordinated effort .
Right now , blood cancers cause 11 % of the deaths from cancer , yet receive only 5 % of the funding ( see Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act of 2002 ) .
I would also immediately get rid of the government ban on stem cell research .
People are dying because we forbid research that would save their lives .
And who is benefiting from the ban on stem cell research ?
The stem cells themselves certainly are n't !
Without the ban , those stem cells would have a chance of living .
With the ban , those same stem cells have no chance at life : they are thrown in the trash and die .
Nobody benefits .
Again , government stupidity at its finest .
Watch this excellent video on stem cells by Jerry Zucker .
That 's what I would do .
What would you do ?
In conclusion , I think I 've been a good citizen of the United States .
I 've created hundreds of jobs , I 've paid tens of millions in taxes , and I 've donated tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes including medical research , the environment , education , and the local community .
The products of the five companies I 've started have either directly or indirectly benefited virtually every person in the United States .
My philanthropy has been so exemplary that I 've been the recipient of numerous awards and honors , including a national Caring Award , an award given to only a few people each year .
Now when I find that my life is threatened with a fatal disease , my government basically turns its back on me and tells me that my life is not worth saving .
They will not even spend a dime on funding research to find a cure .
Look , I 'm not asking for any special treatment .
All I 'm asking for is to be treated fairly ; that my government fund the research on my disease in proportion to the number of people who die from it each year .
Am I asking too much ?
Apparently not .
There are heroes in Congress who can fix things .
I told my story to my Representative ( Anna Eshoo ) and my Senator ( Barbara Boxer ) and both were shocked that this is happening and both have pledged to everything they can to help .
Congresswoman Eshoo co-chairs the House Medical Technology Caucus , and serves as Vice Chair of the 21st Century Health Care Caucus .
So I am optimistic that something can be done to right the wrongs of the past and to move forward in a way that treats the research into cures for these fatal diseases on a more equitable basis .
Geraldine Ferraro is a victim of multiple myeloma , a far more serious cancer than I have .
In 2002 , she was able to get Congress to pass a bill ( S.1094 in the 107th Congress ) that authorized spending $ 250 M for research for blood cancers .
It was first introduced June 22 , 2001 , and it was signed by Bush less than 1 year later on May 14 , 2002 .
But the funds were never appropriated !!
Eshoo told me that she needed to find a friend on the appropriations committee to get this done .
So I called Mike Honda and they are looking into it .
Because we choose to invest money in Iraq instead of America , 500,000 people each year die from our decision .
But it does n't end there .
The costs to our society of this under - funding also include approximately $ 200 billion per year in health care costs .
It seems to me it would be far cheaper to invest the dollars to prevent the disease in the first place rather than pay the costs of inaction .
We do the same thing with global warming .
Instead of investing the money now to reduce our emissions , we allocate huge amounts of money to make the problem worse , and then allocate money when disasters occur to clean up the mess .
Not one single candidate running for president is talking about allocating money to pay for shutting down a single coal plant .

Gravel on Romney : ' I 'd eat his lunch ' Nick Juliano
Published : Monday May 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel , who has been filling the gadfly role in the Democratic nomination race , said he wants to create a cash flow to the poor and predicted he'd trounce Mitt Romney in a general election in an interview with his hometown newspaper Sunday .
" If he 's the nominee , I 'd eat his lunch , " Gravel said in an interview with the Worcester ( Ind . )
Telegram & Gazette , referring to the former Massachusetts governor .
Gravel , whose support hovers between 0 and 1 percent in polls of Democratic voters , created waves with his bombastic performance in the first debate among the Democratic candidates .
He is advocating a series of unorthodox policies including establishing a national ballot initiative that would have Americans voting on most of the country 's laws and a replacement of the current tax code with a universal sales tax .
The sales tax , which Gravel insists would not be regressive , would provide for cost - of - living assistance to cover food , shelter and transportation for the poor .
" Now , the poor person is either on welfare or sleeping under the bridge ,  Mr. Gravel told the newspaper .
 This would provide a cash flow to the poor . 
Much of Gravel 's support comes from anti-war activists excited about his calls for an immediate withdraw of all US troops from Iraq .
He said US trouble in Iraq is " identical " to the situation the country found itself in during the Vietnam war .
" They 're identical wars , " he said .
" It 's just unbelievable that we could walk in the footsteps of that terrible debacle . "
Excerpts from the Worcester Telegram & Gazette : #
He called congressional resolutions put forth so far to limit the war  Rube Goldberg plans that do nothing to stop the pile of bodies from growing .
 Do the math ,  he said .
 Count the number of seats on planes needed to get the troops out .
Leave the equipment .
The Army says its all worn out anyway .
We can be out by Labor Day .  ....
Though he won re-election to a second term , he had begun to burn bridges within his party and the Alaska voters .
In 1980 , he lost a Democratic primary to Clark Gruening , grandson of Ernest Gruening .
 Had I remained in Congress , I would have been corrupted ,  he said .
 I was disgusted with government and politics . 

The Byzantine General 's problem is one of many in the field of agreement protocols .
In 1982 , Leslie Lamport described this problem in a paper written with Marshall Pease and Robert Shostak .
Lamport framed the paper around a story problem after observing what he felt was an inordinate amount of attention received by Dijkstra 's Dining Philosopher problem .
This problem is built around an imaginary General who makes a decision to attack or retreat , and must communicate the decision to his lieutenants .
A given number of these actors are traitors ( possibly including the General ) .
Traitors cannot be relied upon to properly communicate orders ; worse yet , they may actively alter messages in an attempt to subvert the process .
The generals are collectively known as processes .
The general who initiates the order is the source process , and the orders sent to the other processes are messages .
Traitorous generals and lieutenants are faulty processes , and loyal generals and lieutenants are correct processes .
The order to retreat or attack is a message with a 1 or 0 .
In general , a solution to agreement problems must pass three tests : termination , agreement , and validity .
As applied to the Byzantine General 's problem , these three tests are :
A solution has to guarantee that all correct processes eventually reach a decision regarding the value of the order they have been given .
All correct processes have to decide on the same value of the order they have been given .
If the source process is a correct process , all processes have to decide on the value that was originally given by the source process .
One side effect of this is that if the source process is faulty , all other processes still have to agree on the same value .
It does n't matter what value they agree on , they simply all have to agree .
So if the General is subversive , all lieutenants still have to come to a common , unanimous decision .

National Football League owners ' decision last week to award the 2012 Super Bowl to Indianapolis , rather than Arizona , might have a silver lining .
It gives Valley aviation authorities at least another year to figure out whether they can minimize problems that left the planes of Super Bowl XLII high rollers sitting on the tarmac at Scottsdale Airport for more than six hours .
Big names in the professional - football world , treated to a weekend of exclusive parties and perfect Arizona weather , left town Feb .
4 - the Monday after the NFL championship game - furious at delays that kept their private jets waiting for permission to take off .
It was a nightmare that some say could n't be avoided , or if it could , no one would like the solutions .
NFL owners decided after four rounds of voting Tuesday to award the 2012 Super Bowl to Indianapolis , rather than Arizona or Houston .
Arizona 's Super Bowl Host Committee President Bob Sullivan said he doubted that memories of the airport snafus would affect decisions .
" We have no indication that would be a factor , " Sullivan said .
Even with the year of planning that preceded this year 's game , airport and aviation officials agree they could n't have controlled the storm that blew in the morning afterward and slowed travel .
They disagree , however , on how much air - traffic controllers could have done to more efficiently manage the hundreds of departures .
FAA reply unsatisfying
Finger - pointing over the delays went as high as the office of U.S. Sen .
Jon Kyl , whose help was sought in pushing the Federal Aviation Administration for an explanation .
The FAA 's response dissatisfied the Scottsdale Airport Advisory Commission .
" Somebody blew the whole thing , " said Commissioner Arthur Rosen , a pilot active in the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association .
" Basically , I do n't want it to occur again . "
The busy Super Bowl weekend was made even busier by the fact that two East Coast teams , the New York Giants and the New England Patriots , made the Feb .
3 NFL championship game and brought with them a fan base used to traveling by corporate and private jet .
The FBR Open golf tournament , which ended in Scottsdale on Super Bowl Sunday , also added to the jet glut .
After the big game ended at Glendale 's University of Phoenix Stadium , more than 500 private aircraft left airports Valley - wide from 10:30 p.m. Sunday to 3 a.m. Monday .
At most , they experienced a two - hour wait , FAA officials said .
Problems hit just hours later .
The storm system that had threatened to blow in at game time appeared Monday with the low ceilings , intermittent rain and ice that make flying trickier .
1 runway , lots of flights
Scottsdale 's one - runway airport normally can handle almost 25 departures an hour .
At that rate , the 211 aircraft that left Scottsdale Airport beginning at 6 a.m.
Monday could have been cleared by 2:30 p.m. , but delays , and the more than 80 landings , stretched departures out to 8 p.m .
" When you have hundreds , if not thousands , of flights wanting to leave a small area at the same time , there are going to be delays , " FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said .
Delays also were inevitable , the FAA said , because the storm forced airports to switch from allowing pilots to fly by visual flight rules to requiring instrument flight rules .
Used during conditions of low visibility , the instrument rules require more space between aircraft and more time between takeoffs and landings .
Scottsdale departures also had to be fitted into the flow of hundreds of departures from Sky Harbor , Gregor said .
And , the FAA said , pilots contributed to the problem by unnecessarily filing multiple flight plans or filing incorrect departure routes .
Owner reportedly miffed
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft reportedly raised hell after his jet was among those long delayed at Scottsdale .
Patriots spokesman Stacey James said he never heard of the delay and said Kraft would not comment on factors weighing in his decision for or against a 2012 game in Arizona .
" I wo n't disagree with the weather , " Scottsdale Aviation Director Scott Gray told the Scottsdale Airport Advisory Commission last week .
" But it does n't explain why we had a 6 1/2 - hour delay and Deer Valley had a three - hour delay . "
They say the Deer Valley Airport got its 80 departures going with no more than a 3 1/2 - hour delay .
Deer Valley spokeswoman Julie Rodriquez said the two - runway airport , which along with Sky Harbor and Goodyear Airport is part of Phoenix 's Aviation Department , got no complaints from pilots .
" Overall , we , the Phoenix Aviation Department , were happy with the way the FAA did its job during the Super Bowl at all three of our airports , " she said .
" It was a very busy time , delays were expected , and the weather also was a factor . "
Part of the yearlong planning put the Scottsdale and Deer Valley airports in their own air - traffic - control sector and separated Goodyear and Glendale airports into their own sector over Super Bowl weekend .
At times when the Goodyear and Glendale airports were n't busy , that sector 's controller was able to handle Deer Valley departures independent of Scottsdale , Gregor said .
Airport officials suggest that for future events , Scottsdale and Deer Valley be split into their own airspace , each with its own air - traffic controller .
But the FAA 's Gregor said last week that a separate Scottsdale sector would not be feasible given the limited airspace and Scottsdale Airport 's proximity to Sky Harbor and Deer Valley airports .
' Slotting ' a possibility
Airport officials hope they do not have to turn to one possible solution , a so - called slotting program under which pilots receive specific departure times .
Corporate - jet passengers , who typically pay big bucks expecting to come and go as they please , would have to give up that freedom under this scenario .
Some likely would not fly into an airport that implemented such a system , one pilot said .
The FAA 's Gregor agreed that slotting programs are unpopular and , in good weather , less efficient .
Unused slots go to waste when pilots fail to cancel them , and pilots ' tendency to reserve multiple slots exaggerates delays , he said .

Ron Paul campaign ' touched a nerve ' with supporters
As nomination bid ends , passion of his followers far from quelled
WASHINGTON — Ron Paul 's fight for the Republican nomination is ending , but his followers are attempting to turn his failed candidacy into a lasting movement that would alter the landscape of American politics .
While Paul 's 1.1 million votes are only a fraction of those won by the presumed GOP nominee , John McCain , some supporters of the 72 - year - old Lake Jackson congressman exhibit a passion uncommon in politics .
They have put his new book , The Revolution : A Manifesto , on the best - seller lists of Amazon.com and the New York Times .
Ron Paul Meetup Groups get together regularly in cities as varied as Austin , San Diego and New York , where " A Very Ron Paul Happy Hour " packs them in at a Manhattan bar .
Living in a ' Paulville '
Some loyalists have even drawn up plans for a series of utopian " Paulvilles , " gated communities inhabited exclusively by Ron Paul followers .
" Ron Paul operates in a long - standing American tradition of giving voice to marginal groups at ' Time A , ' who turn out to be something more at ' Time B , ' usually to be absorbed by larger coalitions , " said Bruce Buchanan , a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin .
Paul 's ranks include college students , political libertarians and people from the middle class .
Some are angered by the war in Iraq and the national debt .
Others see Big Brotherism in Washington .
Still others have become cynical about the political system .
More than 150,000 people have donated $ 34.4 million to his presidential campaign .
Around the world , 101,502 people have joined Ron Paul Meetup.com groups in 1,040 cities in 26 countries , from Australia to Iraq .
About 131,000 have subscribed to his YouTube channel .
Paul 's official Facebook profile has nearly 88,000 friends , and his MySpace page has about 131,000 friends .
Paul said in an interview that the Internet accounts for " probably 90 percent of our success in the campaign . "
" The money is raised on the Internet , " he said .
" The message has been spread on the Internet .
The books are sold over the Internet .
" And it just goes on and on . "
Political phenomenon
Paul has embarked on a national tour to tout his new book , and he has visited about a dozen universities in the past six weeks .
" Ron Paul has touched a nerve among a small number of people , " said James Riddlesperger , a political science professor at Texas Christian University . "
That following has kept the Paul campaign alive far beyond the candidate 's March 6 announcement via YouTube video that his national campaign was " scaling down . "
In subsequent months , Paul fans , without assistance from the national headquarters , took over some county - level Republican conventions in Missouri and Texas .
He won 16 percent of the vote in the Pennsylvania primary , his native state .
He took 15 percent in Oregon and 24 percent in Idaho .
Paul has not yet endorsed McCain .
In fact , his longtime House buddy Bob Barr recently won the Libertarian Party 's presidential nomination .
" There 's a lot of friends of mine running for the presidency right now , " Paul said , " so I have n't thought seriously about endorsing anybody . "
And why should he , when his cause has taken on a life of its own ?

As I ’ve said , I ’m still going to critique the Clinton campaign as a way of studying what went wrong , and what went right .
One thing that struck me as I drove home a few hours ago , though , was how strikingly similar the trajectory of the Clinton campaign and that of our occupation of Iraq had been .
Of course , analogies always fall apart on some level , but there are some key parallels that I believe are worth mentioning .
The first and foremost , of course , being the run up to Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday itself .
In the buildup to the Iraq war , it was sold as a cakewalk , that we would be greeted with candies and flowers , welcomed as liberators .
Whether through ignorant omission or through intentional obfuscation , the Bush administration did not portray for the American people the significant complexity and difficulties that invading Iraq would present and , in the end , we learned the hard way that the invasion and subsequent occupation were not , in fact , a cakewalk .
So too goes the Clinton campaign ’s intentions regarding Super Tuesday .
Many , including the Clinton campaign itself , believed that the entire primary would be done and over with on Super Tuesday .
We would later be made fully aware of how deeply vested in this concept the Clinton campaign was when it utterly failed to prepare for the states whose primaries took place later in February .
But this was a widely held belief not just within the campaign , but without .
Obama had a bright glimmer of hope when he won Iowa , but the loss in New Hampshire , and apparent loss in Nevada combined to tarnish that glimmer .
But just as Bush did n’t cover all the bases he needed to in order to quickly establish a peaceful post Saddam Iraq , Clinton failed to take into account the effectiveness of Obama countering her big state strategy with his own more complete all state strategy .
And thus , while it was expected that Clinton would have the entire primary sewn up in early February , the day after Super Tuesday provided a much bleaker picture than she was hoping for .
In fact , Clinton would never actually hold a lead in pledged delegates throughout the race .
What followed in both Clinton ’s campaign and the US occupation of Iraq would be an era of mismanagement and chaos .
In Iraq , this would account for much of the Iraq War , especially that prior to Muqtada al Sadr ’s call for a ceasefire amongst the Jaish al Mahdi , and the surge .
For Clinton , this would be February .
Indeed , the mismanagement of the Clinton campaign had led to the replacement of Patti Solis Doyle , and would see a definitive shift away from the strategy that allowed Obama to build up the delegate and popular vote leads that have buoyed him through some particularly rough patches in the primaries .
Just as Bush , Rumsfeld , and Cheney seemed to meander aimlessly with regard to strategy in Iraq , pushing from one Friedman unit to the next , the Clinton camp astonishingly ignored one state after another , assuming that playing the game of low expectations would be all the damage control that they needed .
I say astonishingly because it was a surprise that the Clinton campaign would n’t contest those states more vehemently , put more resources in them , and work harder to at least cut into Obama ’s leads .
And , as the American public ’s opinion soured on the Iraq War and a new strategy was created , so did we see confidence in the one time predicted nominee make a shift in strategy .
For Bush , we know this new strategy as the surge , with Clinton it was a matter of actually contesting every state , building firewalls , and employing what was called by one staffer , the “ kitchen sink ” strategy .
Also integral to the Clinton campaign ’s continued viability was a constant shifting of goal posts .
In both Iraq and in the Clinton campaign , however , these late strategies were only at best capable of creating veneers of progress and success .
With Iraq and the surge , as has been often posited by those not willing to go with the Administration ’s narrative , the surge was not as responsible for the decrease in violence in Iraq as was the ceasefire of the Mahdi Army .
More important , however , was the fact that neither the surge nor the drop in violence could easily hide the lack of political reconciliation that had always been the prime objective of the surge .
Even now we find political reconciliation out of reach .
For Clinton , despite a newly reinvigorated campaign , an aggressive strategy , and a persistent push for Super Delegates , the one thing that remained untouched was Obama ’s insurmountable leads among the metric that mattered the most : delegates .
Even the popular vote which , for a time , had become a driving narrative of the Clinton campaign , ultimately became an unattainable goal for Team Clinton without the addition of Florida and Michigan , both states whose standing are heavily disputed at best , though based upon the rulings of the DNC , that is a generous classification .
And so here we are ; possibly at the end of this ordeal .
Unlike Iraq , this Democratic primary does have a deadline and a “ withdrawal date ” , and we have the luxury of understanding what happened .
So why did Clinton ’s campaign so closely track with the trajectory of Iraq ’s war ?
Perhaps because both were waged with similar mentalities .
Hubris , for one , played a factor in both .
This is not meant as a jab at Hillary , please do n’t misunderstand me .
She had plenty of hubris in the beginning , and she was well within her right to believe she was the heavy favorite because she most definitely was .
Over a year ago when we were first getting a feel for the Democratic field , Hillary Clinton was the hands down favorite who led in just about every poll by incredible margins .
Just as one would think that the US was the hands down favorite going into Iraq as a result of a far superior military .
Coupled with this is the adherence to old paradigms .
For Iraq , that would be that US military might trumps all .
For Clinton , that would be that her standing within the party , her foundation from high powered support to an awesome fundraising mechanism , could not be matched .
Both paradigms , however shifted .
And incompetence .
This condemnation I do not lay completely on Clinton ’s shoulders , but instead I feel that the upper echelon of her campaign should bear the brunt of this burden .
But one could hardly call the likes of Howie Wolfson , Mark Penn , and Harold Ickes anything but ham - handed .
Indeed , it would be Maggie Williams who would bring sanity and competence to a campaign that had everything on its side and did n’t seem to know what to do with it .
Unfortunately , just as the surge was too little too late ( an extra thirty thousand troops after the fact could not make up for ignoring General Shinseki ’s advice of putting several hundred thousand pairs of boots on the ground ) , Maggie Williams ’ addition to the fold was also too little too late , and most definitely not enough to instantly counteract the negative effects the rest of the crew had on Clinton ’s chances at the presidency .
But again , I bring this up not to tap dance on graves , and not to mean disrespect .
Indeed , there are most definitely lessons to be learned from the Clinton campaign and those too can be analogous to other things in life and politics .
For the sake of this argument , I think the biggest lesson to be learned here is that an overconfidence in one ’s own capabilities is not enough to engineer success .
What Obama did that Clinton did n’t do was look at the situation before him objectively as opposed to through a lens muddled with preconceived paradigms and an overappreciation of what he was capable of and had at his disposal .
This was what allowed him to formulate a successful strategy against a seemingly unbeatable foe .
He approached it as an underdog , but instead of doing so like the valiant martyr who does n’t have a chance , he and his team actually studied the system and devised pathways to victory .
Had Clinton taken the same approach , even with her superior advantages taken into account , she would have noticed that the big state and firewall strategy that she was about to employ had a chink in the armor .
That chink , of course , being the method by which delegates were meted out based upon vote proportions .
Given that the electoral college is a winner take all system , the strategy will have to be adjusted some , but the premise remains the same ; expect nothing , take everything .
And that ’s how we ’re going to beat McCain in the fall .
Yesterday , Harry Reid gave Republicans another chance to show their true colors in this fight , do they mean it when they say they want to protect America , or is it about protecting AT&T ?
" On several occasions , I have proposed a 30 - day retroactive extension of the law that expired in February , the so - called Protect America Act .
My purpose is to make sure there is no gap in our intelligence gathering capacity , and to set a deadline for final action on a longer - term bill .
But the President has threatened to veto such a bill and Republicans have blocked it .
" I will now again propose such an extension .
Republicans may again object .
But if they do , they bear responsibility for the fact that this law is not in place .
Eventually , the President and Republican leaders must come to the negotiating table , for the good of the country . "
Three guesses what the Republicans did .
Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to revive a controversial wiretapping law for 30 days on Monday night , leading to a mini-squabble on the chamber floor over the Bush administration ’s program .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) had asked for unanimous consent for the month - long extension to allow more time for House - Senate negotiations ....
" It ’s time for us to get serious and protect the companies that protect us , " McConnell said .
This was the law , the Protect America Act , that Republicans told us was necessary for preventing the end of the world .
Until Democrats said " bullpuckey " and let it expire , after which the world did not end .
Now that bill is n't enough , because the gaps in intelligence they insisted would cripple us if the law expired are not nearly as important as letting AT&T off the hook for illegally spying on us .
The Republicans are still playing politics with this bill , still using the threat of the apocalypse to scare their dwindling base into organized calling efforts against people like Dem Freshman Kirsten Gillibrand , who stood up to the pressure and voted for the sane , amnesty - free , House FISA bill .
I wonder if all those callers know that they 've been duped into trying to protect their phone company ?
Good Morning !
Here is my pick from the English Sunday papers .
With North Carolina and Indiana holding their primaries on Tuesday , the focus will be , once again on the US Democratic Party .
Other topics that are making the headlines are : Boris Johnson as the new Mayor of London , his eccentric style will be good for many headlines to come .
And the Austrian incest drama , but I refuse to cover that .
Boris Johnson has found his stride again and after his first drink in three months opened up his mind again .
Some see him as a danger to tory leader David Cameron , some even say he ’s obviously planning to make Downing Street 10 his ultimate political abode .
The Democratic Primaries :
It is almost tragic to see , how a struggling , ill - managed campaign managed to drag down a very successful campaign so now both are on the ropes .
The opposing candidate , weak by any standard , is rubbing his hands in glee .
So what do the English newspaper have to say ?
The Times
On the eve of two crucial primary election contests , Hillary Clinton is pinning her hopes of winning the Democratic presidential nomination on a collapse in the white vote for Barack Obama .

Could last week go down as the moment when the roof fell in for Barack Obama ?
True , just 48 hours before Tuesday ’s crucial primaries in Indiana and North Carolina , the pundits maintain – albeit with a mite less conviction than before – that the Illinois senator is still overwhelmingly likely to be his party ’s nominee after the last vote is cast in this extraordinary Democratic primary season .
But something fundamental has changed .

Neat features in Eclipse editor
From : Richard Stallman Subject : Neat features in Eclipse editor Date : Sat , 22 Mar 2008 17:45:52 -0400
I just got a demo of the Eclipse editor and saw these features which we should have in Emacs .
* Having tabs above a window to switch buffers in it .
* " Perspectives " are named persistent window configurations .
We have had the window configuration mechanism in GNU Emacs since the beginning but we have never developed a good user interface to take advantage of them .
Eclipse 's user interface seems to be good .
* Perspectives work well even if you do the equivalent of C-x 4 C -f because of the distinction between view windows vs file windows .
In Emacs this is more or less the " dedicated window " feature , but we have never really made it work for this .
* Perspectives also need to interact with the tabs .
* Imenu could be extended into a file - structure browsing mechanism using code like that of customize - groups .
* Flymake 's customization mechanism needs to be both simpler ( fewer levels of indirection ) and better documented , so it is easier to understand .
I find it quite hard to figure out what compilation command it will use .
I suggest totally rewriting that part of Flymake , using the simplest mechanism that sufficies for the specific needs .
That will be easy for users to customize .
* Display something in the margin on lines that have compilation errors .
* Compilation error navigation bar , parallel to the scroll bar , indicating where in the buffer there are compilation errors .
Perhaps we could arrange to display these error indications on top of the scroll bar itself .
That depends on to what extent toolkit scroll bars are extensible .

One of the great aesthetic legacies of the Soviet Union is the great wealth of magnificent propaganda posters it left behind .
In this post , I present some personal favorites .
With the coming of revolution in Russia in 1917 , one of the great powers of the world turned abruptly into a regime that embodied ideas that were radically different from those of the established powers of the day .
Accompanying a new outlook on politics and economy , there had to be renewal and change in other areas too , including the way the new state presented itself and its ideas .
The revolution coincided with a period of many radically different art forms in western culture , dada , futurism , constructivism , surrealism and so on .
Especially in its early years , propaganda posters produced in Soviet Russia were influenced by such movements .
Though the more experimental looks eventually gave way to designs more akin to what could be seen in other western countries , Soviet propaganda still retained a look of its own , beyond the presence of cyrillic lettering .
- 1920
Lenin was known as a great orator , with a fiery style , well illustrated by his stance in this poster , pointing the way ahead .
Two important elements of Soviet propaganda can be seen here , the red banner representing the revolution , and the smokestacks representing the industry that will take the new state into a bright future .
The text is taken straight out of the introduction of Karl Marx 's " Communist Manifesto " .
- 1920
This famous piece by El Lissitzky shows the influence of the new avant garde modernist art movements on early Soviet propaganda .
There is in fact a clear political message behind this design .
When the revolution took place in Russia in 1917 , it did not mean that the Soviet Union with its many components was immediatly formed .
A civil war erupted between the communists , the reds , and the royalists supporting the old regime , the whites .
With that in mind , this becomes a stylized battle plan for the communist victory , rather than just some abstract geometric design .
- 1920
With the civil war still raging , there was no time to relax for the inhabitants of Soviet Russia .
Another interesting poster , with a stylized , simple look that clearly conveys its message .
- 1920s
The mutiny of the battleship Potemkin in 1905 was later viewed as part of the prologue to the revolution of 1917 , and the event was greatly exploited for propaganda purposes , as seen in this very heroic looking poster .
What made the Potemkin truly famous , not only in the Soviet Union but also abroad , was the movie " Battleship Potemkin " by Sergei Eisenstein , released in 1925 , which is counted among the greatest film classics of all time .
- 1926
With a look that makes you think of the black plague rather than traffic safety , this poster was designed to inform people of the great dangers of a relatively new transportation method that was spreading in Soviet cities ; the tram .
- 1925
Mosselprom was a big state run department store in Moscow , famous for its unusual advertisements .
Constructivism , the art movement present in both the architecture of the Mosselprom building , and in the poster itself , originated in Russia in the years around and after the revolution .
In recent times , Mosselprom has been relaunched , mainly as a poultry company , re-using much of the imagery created for the original Mosselprom .
- 1926
Women 's liberation was an important part of the Russian Revolution from its beginning , and boy , does this poster show it !
With the confident , stern look of this female worker , there 's no mistaking her ability and will to commit to the revolution .
Magnificent !
- 1930
Yet another example of the influence of the modern art movement on Soviet posters , this poster does n't even try to look like something out of the real world , with it 's red giant marching past , accompanied by little white airplanes that to me resemble the Canadian airplanes in " South Park " .
- 1930
Soviet posters were not all about factories and fighting the bourgeois .
This funky poster goes on to explain in some detail all the fine facilities of the Petrograd ( St. Petersburg ) Zoo .
- 1939
The posters presented so far have for the most part been quite restricted in their content , devoted to a single subject with an accordingly simple look .
This however , is nothing short of pompous .
With a whole armada of airplanes flying above , the people of the Soviet Union are milling across the red square beneath in a massive march .
The aircraft are nevertheless the central element , with the bright red central monoplane dominating the upper half of the poster .
- 1941
With the launch of Operation Barbarossa by the Germans in June 1941 , the Soviet Union entered World War II .
Supposedly , the story behind this poster is that the wife of the artist , Irakli Toidze , ran into his studio screaming " War ! " upon hearing the news on the radio .
Irakli asked her to freeze her movement , and her posture is what is seen in the poster , though her great looks were allegedly toned down a lot for the poster .
It was indeed published in the very early stages of the German attack and became iconic in Soviet imagery .
- 1941
The German forces advanced rapidly in 1941 and soon threatened Moscow itself , which was one of Hitler 's main goals for the invasion .
This poster is a powerful call to arms , I assume it was used to raise the morale of the Soviet forces while facing an enemy which had in only a few months conquered the massive expanse of land from the present - day eastern border of Poland , all the way to Moscow .
The fate of the city was decided in the bloody Battle of Moscow at the end of 1941 , with a Soviet victory .
- 1941
This theme can be found in just about any beligerent nation of World War II , such as the " Loose lips sink ships " poster of the United States .
- 1941
During Operation Barbarossa , Soviet civilians started operating as guerilla warriors behind German lines .
With burning houses and a gallow in the background , these incredibly grim militiamen and women have a look to them that leaves little doubt that the poster is correct in its claim .
- 1942
Quite a few posters of this kind can be found from the war years , emphasizing the importance of non-combatants for the war effort .
Simple , uncluttered and with a clear focus on its theme makes leaves no room for misunderstanding , which I suppose is much of the point of propaganda posters .
- 1943
By late 1943 , the Soviet Union were pushing the Germans back on all fronts , illustrated in this comic book - like poster .
In the upper left corner can be seen a sign in german saying " Nach osten " ( " To the east " ) , a reference to the german term " Drang nach osten " ( " Drive to the east " ) , the idea of a german desire to expand eastwards , which could be said to have its roots in the middle ages , and was most powerfully exemplified with the german invasion of the Soviet Union .
In 1943 however , the tables were turning with the german drive checked , and the Soviet Union now driving westwards instead .

From its forming in 1922 , the Soviet Union was a multi-ethnic state , and peaceful , respectful cooperation between the Russian majority and the various minorities living primarily in the borderlands of the country was maintained as very important , at least in theory .
Here we see the great Stalin receiving flowers from what to my eyes looks like grateful Azerbaijani , showing their happy co-existance within the Soviet Union .

Alcholism has been and still is a great problem in Russia .
From the view of an industrial society were maintaining and improving efficiency in the factories and farms , alcoholism was a huge drain , ruining the productivity of the state .
For the college student , a spoof version of this poster is occasionally available at eBay with the man happily accepting a drink instead of turning it down .
- 1950
While the problems associated with alcoholism were readily apparent , by 1950 , the dangers of smoking were not as well known .
Since the Soviet Union did in fact have an industry producing cigarettes , it also needed to have someone consume them , and thus , posters such as this came about .
Since all cigarettes were produced by the state , this poster did not need to advertise for a specific brand , promoting smoking in general was enough .
- Unknown year
This poster really epitomizes the look cultivated by Stalin in posters promoting his greatness .
It 's a look of a kind , wise man , always with a calm , reassuring smile on his face .
In some posters , you can see him greeting adoring children , in others he 's smoking his pipe , with the very smoke rooting out capitalists and infiltrators from Soviet society .
He was the subject of a cult - of - personality , instigated by himself , and during his reign , his likeness was never far away .
- 1950's
With Stalin 's death in 1953 , the reaction to his regime came swiftly , and many of his supporters were persecuted .
Here we see Stalin as a towering building , entirely made out of prison cells , a reference to the widespread imprisonings carried out by Stalin .
The viewpoint of this poster , seen from the bottom looking upwards is effective in enhancing the impression of the old premier as some kind of evil giant .
- 1954
It was Nikita Khrushchev who came to power after Stalin 's death .
One of his big domestic project was the Virgin Lands campaign , promoting the breaking of vast areas of new farmlands in northern Kazakhstan .
Posters showing the effectivity of the Soviet Union 's mechanized farming is a commonly found theme in old Soviet propaganda .
- 1954
The breaking of new land of course required much manpower , something posters like this one was aimed at recruiting .
And many hundreds of thousands did indeed leave their homes to settle down in these " new lands " , but many also only stayed for a single harvest , and left again .
The virgin lands campaign was a big success in its first year , but eventually came to be seen as an ecological disaster , turning vast areas of fertile land into steppe due to poor farming techniques .
- Unknown year
In my mind , this is pretty much the stereotype of a Soviet propaganda poster .
It 's got the three central occupations represented ; peasant , worker and soldier , all under the shining red star of the revolution , working in unity to drive the Soviet Union forward .
This poster is nothing short of brilliant , supremely confident looking , with bright and powerful colours .
- Unknown year
The stereotypical yankee capitalist is a common figure in propaganda posters .
Here , he 's trying to set fire to and bomb the Soviet Union , but a vigilant ( and rather handsome ) Soviet soldier is keeping watch .
With the attitude of the soldier and the slogan , this poster gives a sense that the capitalists are nothing more than mischiveous little juveniles .
- Unknown year
A popular format for showing the evils of capitalism is comparing the situation of the US and the USSR .
While in the United States ( as seen on the left ) , the talented violinist is left on his own , wandering the streets at night , his twin in the Soviet Union is embraced by state and society , and has his talent promoted .
- 1962
The cold war was n't all about building nuclear bombs and sattelites .
Prestige and power could also be found elsewhere , and the Soviet Union put a big effort into their athletes .
Bright , fresh colours to enhance the wholesome figure of this determined sportsman !
- 1970
With its stark simplicity and highly restrained use of colours , this makes you think of modern day street artists such as the ( in ) famous Banksy .
In form with all Soviet Propaganda , the " hero " of this poster is big , strong and focused on the importance of his task , even as menial as this might seem .

MIT 's Nexi robot expresses emotions the same way you do - with your highly mobile face .
Nexi 's head and face were designed by Xitome Design with MIT .
The expressive robotics started with a neck mechanism sporting 4 degrees of freedom ( DoF ) at the base , plus pan - tilt - yaw of the head itself .
The mechanism has been constructed to time the movements so they mimic human speed .
Nexi 's face has been designed to use gaze , eyebrows , eyelids and an articulate mandible to communicate a greater range of different emotions .
Nexi has a color CCD in each eye as well as ( top this , humans ) an indoor Active 3D infrared camera in its head and four microphones to support sound localization .
The chassis for the robot is also advanced ; it is based on the uBot5 mobile manipulator developed by the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics UMASS Amherst .
The mobile base can balance dynamically on two wheels ; Nexi has what amounts to a Segway - like body .
The arms can pick up ten pounds ; the plastic covering of the chassis can detect human touch .
Now , Nexi needs to learn to react emotionally , like the Kansei robot created at Meiji University 's School of Science and Technology .
You should also compare Nexi 's range of emotional expression with that of the South Korean EveR2 - Muse Robot ; she has a more human face .
Also , the WD - 2 Face Morphing robot uses a much more flexible facial structure .
Take a look at this video of Nexi expressing itself .

Adult attention deficit disorder or AADD is characterized as a condition causing inattentiveness , organization problems , procrastination and difficulty completing work .
It is believed that adults can see an onset of AADD later in life maybe as a carryover from childhood , but in order to receive a diagnosis you must have had symptoms as a child .
The condition has differing levels of severity so treatment options vary all the way from coping skills to medication to control the symptoms .
Medical intervention will come with some unwanted side effects so many patients opt for social counseling and other less invasive treatment options .
ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is similar to AADD but research has shown that one third of the adults affected with AADD do not show any hyperactive behavior .
Thus , the medical community has taken to using the AADD term instead .
In the brain of patients with AADD , executive function is impaired .
This is the function that governs a person ’s ability to monitor their own behavior by organizing and planning .
This disorder affects approximately 2 to 4 % of adults .
AADD patients are often the types seen by others as not thinking before they speak or act .
They are sometimes referred to as a Type A personality or an always on the go individual .
While they may seem to be driven , it is noted that they are rarely focused on one task long enough to see it to completion .
In a recent study , three different groups of AADD patients all scored much lower than non-AADD adults on a dual memory and simultaneous capacity test , demonstrating their inability to concentrate in such situations .
While this may seems like a small step , this recognition helps prove AADD to be a real concern .
As mentioned , treatment options vary depending on the severity of symptoms .
For some AADD patients the symptoms are bad enough that medications along with social therapy are prescribed .
Some of the more popular prescription medications are Ritalin , Adderall or Vyvanse .
Ritalin is the most commonly known medication and is used in the treatment of ADD in children with some success .
Adderall is a psychostimulant and Vyvanse ( also used for children ) is a stimulant as well .
It may seem strange that stimulants are prescribed for a disorder that sometimes causes hyperactivity but they are effective in many cases .
This is thought to be accomplished by coaxing the brain to manufacture more serotonin .
Increased serotonin has been shown to have a calming effect .
This not only treats the hyperactive symptoms but may allow an adult to focus on their tasks at hand and see them to completion .
As recognition of AADD grows , more studies may lead to new treatments and an increased awareness of the disorder .

Tomorrow there are big primaries in Virginia , Washington DC and Maryland .
The so - called Potomac Primary .
But tonight if you were in New York you could have seen Clinton ’s message - spin - poll guru Mark Penn giving a reading from his book Microtrends at The Strand .
Good to see Penn ’s got his eye on the ball , right ?
Casey quickly changed tune on endorsement
Sen .
Bob Casey must have caught the Obamamania bug over the past few weeks .
Back on March 5 , the day after the big Texas and Ohio primaries , Casey , a freshman Democrat from Pennsylvania , was very firm in talking to Politico about superdelegate endorsements , given the high profile of his home - state primary April 22 .
“ If there ’s one thing we ’ve learned , endorsements by superdelegates are vastly overrated , ” Casey told Politico and a few other reporters outside the Senate chamber that day .
“ They [ the candidates ] have plenty of time to debate the challenges in Pennsylvania . …
I said a long time ago I ’d stay neutral . ”
Casey also said he wanted to play a role as a “ unifier ” in the party instead of taking sides .
How quickly things change .
Today Casey endorsed Obama at a speech in Pittsburgh , saying he believed Obama would provide a " new path of hope and healing . "
In fact , Casey will join the Obama bus tour through Pennsylvania , adding the powerful Casey family brand name to the campaign .
Speaking to reporters after his speech , Casey said he could no longer stay neutral and believes in Obama " like I have never believed in a candidate in my life , except my father . "
Casey 's father , Bob Casey Sr. , was a former governor and one of the most popular Pennsylvania Democrats of his generation .
Obama now says this endorsement was as important as any he's received on the campaign trail .
In his March 5 comments , Casey warned that “ our voters will have no patience for nastiness ” if the Obama - Clinton fight continues to head in a negative direction .
Whether the Casey endorsement will have an effect on the polls remains to be seen .
Hillary Clinton has a double - digit lead over Obama in most Pennsylvania polls .
UPDATE : Crypt colleague Carrie Budoff Brown has sent along comments from Casey and Obama .
" This campaign is a chance for America , a chance for America to chart a new course , to go down a different path .
A path , first of all , of change , a path of a new kind of politics , a path – and finally a path of hope and healing , " Casey said .
Casey also compared Obama to Abraham Lincoln .
" I ’ve been impressed by so much watching this campaign .
I ’ve been impressed by his compassion , his strength , his ideas , and I think especially , especially under fire , he has appealed as ...
Abraham Lincoln asked us to do many years ago to the better angels of our nature , and we appreciate that as he ’s campaigning . "
Obama says he did not seek the endorsement and understood the need to keep neutral .
" I told him I ’d love to have his support but I understood that you know we ’re behind in the Pennsylvania polls , " Obama said .
" I just want to say it would have been easy for Bob just to stay out of it , just to stay neutral .
I think everybody would have accepted that .
But when he called me and said , I think this is the right thing to do , it meant as much to me as any endorsement that I ’ve received on the campaign trail . "
UPDATE II : Casey spoke to reporters after his event and explained why he changed his mind about staying neutral .
" A lot of you could you be asking , I ’m sure you will , saying well I thought you were neutral and now you have decided to endorse , " Casey said .
" It is a very simple answer .
I am like a lot of voters .
When you approach a primary like this and you have two very strong candidates , two candidates that are your colleagues , two candidates that will be very effective in the White House and you have to make a decision and for a long long time I was not only neutral .
I was an undecided voter .
And that changed recently .
I became someone who made a decision in my heart as a voter to support Sen. Obama . "
Casey said he could no longer " stay on the sidelines .
I could n’t do that in a state that I have worked so hard in .
... I believe in this guy like I have never believed in a candidate in my life , except my father . "
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has gained support in the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking report for April 4 - 6 , and now leads Hillary Clinton by a statistically significant margin , 52 % to 43 % .
Obama 's current 52 % support level matches his highest of the year , although his margin over Clinton was slightly larger , at 52 % to 42 % , in March 27 - 29 polling .
So far this year Obama has been unable to sustain a significant lead over Clinton for more than a few days .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Obama had a particularly strong showing in Sunday 's interviewing , and it will remain to be seen if he is able to enlarge and sustain a margin of victory in the days ahead .
Two events have been in the news in recent days that , in theory , could affect Democrats ' support levels for their two candidates .
Bill and Hillary Clinton released their tax returns for the last eight years on Friday , reporting that they made over $ 100 million during that time period .
Sunday Clinton 's chief campaign strategist , Mark Penn , resigned his position after reports that the public relations firm of which he is president had a conflict of interests with the Clinton campaign .
Obama remains tied with presumptive Republican nominee John McCain when registered voters nationally as given a hypothetical November general election matchup between the two .
McCain retains a slight two percentage point margin over Clinton .

Wal - Mart Exposed : Videos You Were Never Meant To See
When they were n't discussing sales , Wal - Mart men dressed in drag .
April 9 , 2008  --
From the tough anti-union talk to the wilder side of men in drag , videos of Wal - Mart corporate meetings are being sold to willing buyers , and the corporate behemoth is not happy about it .
The videos , thousands of them spanning three decades , are in the library of a production company in Lenexa , Kan .
Flagler Productions Inc. was hired on a handshake deal by Wal - Mart in the 1970s to produce and film corporate sales meetings and other company events .
After receiving a verbal commitment that Flagler would be used for meetings in the future , Wal - Mart abruptly ended its deal with Flagler in 2006 causing the company to lay off most of their employees , according to Flagler .
Representatives from Wal - Mart tried to buy the library in 2007 , but Flagler and Wal - Mart could not agree on a price so the sale never happened .
Now , Flagler is offering the tapes to anyone else who might be interested , including the media and plaintiffs ' attorneys .
Wal - Mart is currently defending itself in a lawsuit that claims widespread sex discrimination regarding issues of salary and promotional opportunities on behalf of at least 1.6 million female employees .
The attorney representing the female employees , Joe Sellers , says that some videos show the company acknowledged there was a lack of women in management back in the late 1980s .
" There 's no question these videos capture in a fairly candid way the sentiment of top executives many years ago , " Sellers said .
" This is not new , and it is not something that top management was unaware of . "
Indeed , in one video obtained by ABCNews.com , Wal - Mart founder Sam Walton addresses the issue at a shareholders meeting in 1987 .
" We know we have n't gotten as far as we'd like to be advancing women in our company .
But we 're very conscious of it , " he says .

Wal - Mart released this statement to ABCNews.com today .
" Needless to say , we did not pay Flagler Productions to tape internal meetings with this aftermarket in mind .
It 's definitely an unusual business model on their end , and we can't imagine too many other clients will be eager to pay for this service . "
Wal - Mart has also stated previously that it is confident it did not discriminate against female employees .
Aside from the serious allegations of discrimination , the videos also show a glimpse of corporate shenanigans , including one meeting at which male employees dressed in ladies lingerie and sang a song , " Walkin ' Round in Women 's Underwear " to the tune of " Walking in a Winter Wonderland . "

Wal - Mart said the act was just for fun .
" Over the years these internal meetings included a wide range of messages and activity -- some practical , some inspirational and some just plain silly .
Clearly this video falls in the silly category , but having fun is just part of running a business , " said a company spokesperson .
In January , ABCNews.com reported on videos dating back to when Hillary Clinton was on the board of directors at Wal - Mart .
In her six years on the board , Clinton remained silent as the world 's largest retailer waged a major campaign against labor unions seeking to represent store workers .
Wal - Mart 's anti-union efforts were headed by one of Clinton 's fellow board members , John Tate , a Wal - Mart executive vice president who also served on the board with Clinton for four of her six years .
Tate was fond of repeating , as he did at a managers ' meeting in 2004 after his retirement , what he said was his favorite phrase , " Labor unions are nothing but bloodsucking parasites living off the productive labor of people who work for a living . "

Wal - Mart says
Tate 's comments " were his own and do not reflect Wal - Mart 's views . "
The Clinton campaign has since stated , " As president , she will fight alongside labor to promote the economic growth of America 's middle class , " and that Clinton strongly believes that Wal - Mart employees should be allowed to unionize .

She was kidnapped by her father , imprisoned in a cellar for 24 years and had seven babies by him , but Elisabeth Fritzl survived thanks to her devotion to her children .
Fears are growing , though , that a transition to normal life could prove impossible , reports Caroline Davies in Amstetten
They wo n't have told her yet ; it is much too soon .
Any hopes that Elisabeth Fritzl may have of living a normal life with her children , funded by compensation from the father who imprisoned and repeatedly raped her , will be in vain .
Yesterday it was revealed that Josef Fritzl , the 73 - year - old grandfather who incarcerated Elisabeth in a dank dungeon for 24 years beneath the family home and fathered her seven children , is financially ruined , with millions of euros in debts .
As Fritzl was moved to solitary confinement for his own safety , his heavily mortgaged property empire was on the brink of collapse , taking with it any dreams of a haven where Elisabeth and her children could find happiness .
It is a cruel blow for a daughter who still can offer no clue as to why her father held her captive in a windowless bunker beneath the grey , three - storey townhouse at Yppsstrasse 40 , in the small town of Amstetten .
' I do n't know why it was so , ' she has told detectives .
' My father simply chose me for himself . '
Today she and her children are a few miles away from their dungeon home in the Clinic Mostviertel , where they have begun a long and painful journey towards rehabilitation that experts estimate could take eight years .
Elisabeth and her children have their own unique traumas to resolve .
Half are the ' upstairs family ' - Lisa , 16 , Monika , 14 , and Alexander , 12 - all fathered by Fritzl in the cramped chambers he dug out beyond his cellar .
All three were taken in as babies by him and raised by his wife Rosemarie , 68 , after seemingly just appearing , one after another , on the doorstep of the family home .
Fritzl would tell everyone that their mother had run away to join a sect , dumping them with her parents because she could not care for them herself .
Then there is the ' downstairs family ' - Kerstin , 19 , Stefan , 18 , and Felix , five - who remained in the tiny prison , never once seeing daylight and knowing only four other faces in their whole lives .
Kerstin is comatose in hospital , suffering from renal failure .
It was her life - threatening illness that would eventually betray Fritzl 's monstrous secret .
Her two brothers are stooped , anaemic and barely able to communicate in anything other than their own peculiar growling language .
A seventh child , Alexander 's twin , died three days after birth , his body incinerated by Fritzl in the house 's furnace .
Perhaps the worst fears are for Elisabeth .
She is said to be ' deeply distressed ' , agreeing to talk to doctors and detectives only on the promise that she will have no further contact with her father .
At the age of only 42 , her crudely cut hair is completely white , her lips are shrunken around toothless gums , her face is deeply lined , her body painfully thin , her skin almost transparent .
According to a forensic psychiatrist , Dr Guntram Knecht , she has been ' destroyed by all means ' .
Of all those Fritzl damaged , she was the only one to know she was a victim .
If she can live with her children again , ' it will be because of her desire to be a mother , ' he said .
Police photographs of the labyrinth of cellar rooms show narrow , stone - lined passageways , uneven floors and ceilings no higher than 5ft 6in .
There was an ancient cooker , washing machine , freezer , as well as a television , video and radio .
A small area housed a lavatory , sink and tiny shower .
All the rooms were lit by harsh strip - lighting .
Poignantly , the pictures show how Elisabeth desperately tried to decorate the drab rooms for the sake of her children .
On the grimy white bathroom tiles are a painted yellow snail with green shell , a purple octopus , a child 's drawing of a flower and a fish , and stickers of stars and the sun - all of them things her ' cellar children ' had never seen , except on the television , which was on all day .
No photographs have been released of the two tiny rooms where all four slept , or the rubber - padded room where Fritzl is believed to have raped his daughter away from the children .
Was it in this room that she also delivered her babies without any medical help ?
In all , the area measured 60 square metres , with Fritzl enlarging it as his family grew .
But the area is so confined that police officers now examining it can work for only an hour at a time because of the severe lack of oxygen .
For Elisabeth there was no way out .
Fritzl threatened that poisonous gas would be pumped in if they tried to overpower him .
Police are checking this , along with his claim that an electronic lock on the door was designed to open automatically after a lengthy period .
But they are sceptical .
Fritzl enjoyed several holidays , including a three - week break in Pattaya , Thailand 's sex - tourist resort , in 1998 .
Had he met with an accident , would his downstairs family simply have starved to death ?
Or was someone else helping to feed them ?
Throughout the years , Fritzl lived his grotesque double life with relish .
According to his wife 's sister , Christina , he went to the cellar every day , usually at about 9 am , allegedly to draw blueprints for machines he was selling .
He would often spend whole nights there .
He watched motor racing on television with his children and , in a bizarre attempt at playing the normal father , would buy toys for the children and play with them .
He bought Elisabeth clothes .
Sometimes she chose them out of a catalogue .
On other occasions he would choose them himself .
Friends he holidayed with in Thailand saw him picking out a glittering evening dress and lingerie at a market - clearly much too small for his rotund , ageing wife .
When he realised that he had been spotted , he joked about ' having a bit on the side ' .
Not for one minute did they suspect it could be his daughter .
But it is clear that he wanted Elisabeth , whom he called his Liesl , to dress up and parade around for him in the squalid , miserable cell he forced her to call home .
Then , after raping her , he would settle down at the table while she prepared a meal and they would discuss the children 's upbringing .
Some upbringing , but Elisabeth was determined to do the best she could .
Though there were no books , she watched adventure films with them on television and made up stories about princesses and pirates .
' Their mother taught them some reading and writing , though Elisabeth herself lost much of her childhood knowledge because of the years of sexual abuse , ' said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz .
Upstairs , the three other children continued to thrive , doing well at school , playing the trumpet , and were regularly seen out on Saturday nights , laughing and joking with their grandfather and Mami , as they called Rosemarie .
It was Elisabeth 's primeval instinct as a mother desperate to save her child that finally led to her father 's arrest .
Realising that Kerstin was seriously ill , she demanded he take the girl to Amstetten general hospital .
She slipped a secret , desperate note into her daughter 's pocket , telling doctors that she had given her cough medicine and aspirin .
' Please , please help her .
Kerstin is really terrified of other people .
She was never in a hospital , ' she wrote , adding a one - line message for her daughter : ' Kerstin , please stay strong until we see each other again . '
Upon reading it , doctors immediately made a TV appeal for her to come forward .
When Elisabeth saw it , she ordered Fritzl to take her .
And he did , accompanying her on the journey that would lead to his arrest in the hospital grounds and the end of her nightmare , which began a quarter of a century earlier on 28 August , 1984 .
Elisabeth was 18 and working as a waitress at a motorway service station near Amstetten when she was lured to the cellar by her father that day .
He knocked her out with ether and handcuffed her to a metal pole .
For the first few weeks he kept her in the dark , visiting only to rape her and supply food .
' She had the choice , to be raped or to starve , ' said a police source .
She was reported missing , but police , neighbours and supposedly even her own mother believed Fritzl 's explanation that she had run away to join a sect .
A letter , which she was forced to write , arrived at the house a month later , reinforcing the lie .
It told her parents that she was making a new life for herself and that they should not search for her .
Fritzl singled Elisabeth out early .
The fourth of his seven children by his wife , she was still an infant when , in 1967 , he was sentenced to 18 months for climbing through an open bedroom window and raping a sleeping woman in the Austrian city of Linz , where he was working as an electrical engineer .
Investigations have shown that he also had convictions for an attempted rape and for indecent exposure .
However , these were expunged from his records 15 years later , in line with Austrian law .
Social workers found no trace of the convictions while rubber - stamping the paperwork that would allow him to adopt one of Elisabeth 's children and foster two others .
By then he was a seemingly successful landlord , renting out flats at the family home and at four other premises he owned , as well as running a lakeside pub and campsite .
Family friends remember Elisabeth as a ' very withdrawn and shy ' child .
Paul Hoerer , 69 , who first met Fritzl on holiday in 1973 and visited the Amstetten house several times , noticed that she ' got a slap for every small thing ' .
Though domineering and despotic with all his children , Fritzl appeared to treat Elisabeth even more brutally than her siblings and Hoerer got the impression that 'he did not like her very much ' .
When she reached the age of 11 , the abuse started .
From then on Elisabeth would be raped by her father regularly : in his car , during forest walks , even in the same cellar that would become her prison .
At 16 , she twice attempted to run away from home , but each time was delivered back into her father 's violent embrace by the local authorities .
Three years later , there was no possibility of escape .
The chambers were so well hidden that police initially failed to find them until Fritzl guided them through five different rooms in the cellar , to his workshop .
There , concealed behind shelves laden with paint cans and containers , was a 3 ft - high , reinforced , 660 lb concrete door , secured electronically .
Though adamant that he had no accomplice , police are struggling to explain how he could have fitted it alone .
But why did he choose to release the three ' upstairs ' children and not the others ?
A likely explanation is that when Kerstin and Stefan were born Fritzl believed it was possible they could be secluded for ever .
But as the raping continued , and Elisabeth 's family grew , he simply ran out of room .
It was too late to move the two eldest , who by now had memories of the place and of their mother and him together .
So they were condemned .
By the time Felix arrived , he may have believed that his wife was too old to cope .
There are signs that Fritzl was planning to release them .
He had made Elisabeth write a letter in which she said she wanted to come back , ' but it 's not possible yet ' .
' Perhaps he was aware that he could n't keep the thing going forever , ' said Colonel Franz Polzer , police chief of Lower Austria .
Or perhaps he was no longer attracted to his anaemic , ailing daughter who now looked as old as her mother .
His plan seems to have been that Elisabeth would appear to return suddenly from the sect and that the dreadful physical condition of her and her children could be attributed to her treatment there .
But this deceit was denied by Kerstin 's illness .
Today the family is slowly acclimatising in a special area set aside for them at the clinic .
Elisabeth and her mother are said to have have wept for hours together , with Rosemarie saying over and over : ' I 'm so sorry .
I had no idea . '
After their initial delights at seeing the sun for the first time , and riding in cars , Stefan and Felix can clamber back into the dark confines of a special container set up in the clinic to help them adjust to life outside .
Felix often crawls in there , and sits humming an unknown melody to himself .
Police believe his mother used it to soothe him to sleep .
' It ca n't be called a good - night song really , as there was never any night in the cellar , ' said Chief Inspector Etz .
IQ levels rocketed in the last century , but argument still rages about how our brain power should be tested , and the roles played by genetics , social conditions , culture and even race .
Keen to find out whether he might pass for a genius , our reporter puts himself to the test at Mensa , and asks the question : why are some people smarter than others ?
For most of the last century it was widely thought that intelligence was in decline .
The idea was that those at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum were having more children , thereby reducing the general intelligence level .
Then one November day in 1984 James Flynn , a New Zealand - based moral philosopher , had a Eureka moment that turned cognitive science on its head .
He opened a package sent to him by an academic in Holland named PA Vroon .
Inside were data from an IQ test known as Raven 's Progressive Matrices .
IQ are the initials of ' intelligence quotient ' , the psychometric system by which the mental ability known as intelligence is measured .
Vroon did not know how to crunch the raw numbers , but Flynn did .
And he noticed that 18 - year - old Dutch males had made a giant leap in IQ scores on the previous generation .
Over the following month , he checked similar data from around the word and the answer was the same : IQ was going up , and dramatically .
Flynn found that in both the developed and developing worlds IQ had improved in the 20th century at the remarkable rate of 3 points per decade .
This development has since become known as the ' Flynn effect ' .
The Flynn effect is noteworthy because , apart from anything else , it suggests a world - changing increase in intelligence in succeeding generations .
IQ measurements are based on the score of 100 being allocated to the median average of a group ( say 18 - year - old Dutch males ) .
Projecting forwards the Flynn effect predicts , for example , that someone with an average IQ today ( i.e. of 100 ) will have grandchildren with a score of 120 .
Perhaps more shocking , it suggests that someone with an average score today would have had grandparents who were close to mental retards .
Neither scenario makes much sense , particularly if you 're a grandchild or a grandparent .
As Flynn writes in his recent book , What is Intelligence ? :
' In either event , the cognitive gulf between the generations should be huge . '
Plainly it 's not .
And thus the Flynn effect has become one of those phenomena that are almost universally accepted but little understood .
Some psychologists have attempted to explain the gains in what Flynn calls ' artefactual ' terms .
It has been argued that children have got better at doing the tests partly because the administration of the tests has improved .
Others put the rise in IQ down to improvements in diet .
Flynn rejects both theories , pointing out that tests are frequently restandardised and that diet has been of marginal importance in the West since the 1950s .
Flynn is convinced that intelligence has improved .
' But , ' he said , 'we have to rethink exactly what we mean by intelligence .
For what the IQ gains really give us is a cultural history of the 20th century and an insight into the gulf that separates our minds from those of our ancestors . '
On the phone from Dunedin in New Zealand , where he is emeritus professor of political studies at the University of Otago , Flynn several times used the phrase ' detaching logic from the concrete ' to define what is considered the mark of intelligence in the modern world .
' Imagine , ' says Flynn , 'if we were archaeologists of the future and all we found were targets from target practice .
We would see that in 1880 there were two shots per minute .
In 1900 there were five shots .
And later in the century , 50 shots .
How could they have improved their aim , speed and steadiness by such an amount ?
We'd be totally baffled until we dug up pistols , rifles and machine guns .
So it 's not a change in human physiology .
The same applies for intelligence .
We 've created tools and the environment to maximise those scores . '
In What is Intelligence ?
he gives a number of examples of how we now privilege abstract classification .
A century ago if the question was asked what links dogs and rabbits , the most common answer would probably have been that dogs are used to catch rabbits .
That 's a zero - point answer in an IQ test , where the correct answer is that both animals are mammals .
But if that seems a cultural rather than a cerebral development , the change is not just cosmetic .
The ability to think in abstract terms underpins the scientific , material and , arguably , moral advances of modern society .
Therefore the continued rise in abstract intelligence might be expected to produce a continued rate of scientific and material development .
Except there are signs that the Flynn effect is coming to an end , at least in western Europe .
Recent studies in Scandinavia show a plateau in results , and a drop in arithmetic .
Far from being surprised , Flynn has been expecting as much .
'[ The Flynn effect ] is not like the law of gravity , ' he says .
' Social conditions vary in each country . '
One of the key environmental factors , Flynn says , is adult - infant ratio .
Basically , the more adults there are to children , the richer the cognitive environment .
As you can't really get a better ratio than the two parents to one child , there is not much further that low - birth rate in Europe can go in that direction .
Indeed , the rise of solo parents may push the trend in the opposite direction .
Flynn also believes that Scandinavian teaching methods are the best around , and perhaps they , too , have gone as far as they can go .
' There 's got to be a limit to how much we can classify the world and to how cognitively challenging our leisure time can be .
Everyone needs to relax sometime .
And if IQ levels in the West slow down and those in the developing world continue to increase and catch up , then we could be in for some interesting times . '
Another study by the British psychologist Michael Shayer , of King 's College , University of London , that looked at tests concerned with volume and heaviness , showed a marked reversal in geometric reasoning .
In 2003 children of almost 12 years did as well as eight - or nine - year - olds in 1976 .
The biggest drop was in the performance of boys .
Shayer believes that boys today are less inclined to develop the ' differential play patterns ' that previously accounted for their advantage over girls .
In short , they have grown less prepared to explore further afield , to go beyond the comfort zone of their controlled environments .
' Presumably , ' says Shayer , ' because they were looking at bloody computer games . '
Flynn thinks that computers can help with abstract cognitive skills , but , he warns , there is a price .
' They do n't read , the little bastards , ' he says of young people today .
' And I do n't consider someone educated unless they can read Tolstoy or Plato . '
For his part , Shayer is sceptical about the value of the psychometric tests by which IQ is measured .
' All they will tell you is how someone compares with a representative group of that age , ' he says .
' They wo n't tell you what they can do . '
What constitutes intelligence is a question over which generations of psychologists and educationalists have argued .
And there is still no conclusive answer .
All we can state with confidence is what is not intelligent .
For example , it 's not intelligent to stay up drinking alcohol until the early hours the night before sitting an IQ test .
That , as it turned out , was my second mistake in preparation for the supervised Mensa test .
My first mistake was not to practise .
Someone from Mensa had told me that it did n't make any difference , and as I do n't usually require more than one reason to avoid work , I left it at that and skipped looking at model papers .
Later , when it was too late , I was to learn that practice can add a few points to your IQ score , though beyond that , further effort will have no effect .
Instead I walked into the examination cold .
It was the first time in more than 20 years that I had put myself through any kind of formal mental test , and I felt anxious , largely ignorant of what to expect and mournfully hung over .
Scaled intelligence testing was first introduced by the French psychologist Alfred Binet in 1905 , though it was his German colleague William Stern who coined the abbreviation IQ .
Almost 3,000 people sit the Mensa test in Britain each year and the figures are rising as various forms of psychometric testing become more commonplace in business and employment .
I was not sure that I would find out what IQ measured by sitting the test .
But I did hope that it would at least help me get a better grip on the question .
And , OK , I wo n't deny it , I 've always been secretly curious to know my IQ rating .
Have n't you ?
Finding the examination room , which was tucked away in a 5th - floor alcove of London 's Birkbeck College , was itself a challenge , and one a couple of the examinees failed to meet .
Perplexed by the building 's layout , they arrived too late to take the first test .
Unfortunately I was not one of them .
There are two papers in the Mensa test .
The first is called the Culture Fair test , which assesses non-verbal reasoning through a series of diagrammatic problems .
The other is called the Cattell B test , which is more concerned with verbal reasoning , though it also features a number of visual - only questions as well .
To be invited to join Mensa , you need to score in the top 2 per cent of the British population in either one of the tests .
For the Culture Fair test that means a score of 132 or above , and in Cattell B a score of 148 or more .
Other IQ tests have different rating systems .
So when you hear talk of someone having a certain IQ rating , it does n't tell you much , unless you know to which test it refers .
Mensa was founded in Britain in 1946 by an Australian barrister , Roland Berrill , and a British lawyer - cum - scientist Dr Lancelot Ware .
There are now around 100,000 members around the world , of which a quarter are in Britain and half in America .
It 's a non-political organisation whose stated purpose is to encourage research into intelligence and create a social forum for its members .
' The word Mensa is not an acronym , ' explained the invigilator , before the test .
' It 's Latin for table , and it represents the round - table equality of Mensa .
Everyone is equal .
There is no elitism at Mensa . '
It seemed strange that an organisation that excludes 98 per cent of society should claim that it 's not elitist .
But perhaps that 's a prerequisite for any organisation these days .
Mensa is , of course , specifically , constitutionally elitist , but it 's also diverse .
There were 15 people sitting the test : 11 males and four females from a variety of ethnic backgrounds , including Asian , Chinese and Afro-Caribbean .
They all looked clear - eyed and razor - sharp , the sort of people who could complete cryptic crosswords in a few minutes while shouting out the answers to University Challenge and reciting the decimal expansion of pi to a few thousand digits .
The youngest was 12 and I , at 45 , looked by a decade the oldest .
And therefore the slowest .
Or so it seemed during the Culture Fair test .
It started easily enough .
Three simple shapes are presented and you have to select from six choices the correct shape that completes or fits into the pattern .
So , for example , the first shape is a black circle , the next is circle with three quarters black , and the north - west quarter white ; the one after that , the east semi-circle black and the west white .
And so the missing shape is a white circle with a black north - east corner .
But after that there was an exponential growth in geometric complexity until , a few questions on , I was looking at a series of diabolically intricate shapes that offered no obvious answer .
It was at this point , staring cluelessly at the abstract patterns , that I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of regret at the previous night 's indulgence .
Through the cognitive fog , there flickered an intuitive sense of the correct answers , but instead of ticking the appropriate boxes I tried to work out proofs to my satisfaction .
That took too much time and at the end of the half hour , I still had seven or eight questions that I had n't answered .
The invigilator had advised us to tick a random box if we did n't know an answer because a wrong selection does n't count against you and there 's a chance that you might pick the right box .
This seemed to introduce chance , and therefore imprecision , into the IQ assessment and , out of a combination of high - mindedness and incompetence , I left blank the questions of which I was unsure .
I decided not to dilly - dally on the second test , the Cattell B , which is about an hour long .
But halfway through I felt the stirrings of a nervous breakdown .
The intense level of concentration required was achingly beyond my experience .
No getting up to make a cup of tea , or surfing the internet , much less my preferred means of task avoidance : staring vacantly out of the window .
After a while , the questions began to take on different lives to those intended .
' If Mr Jones is 40 years younger than his father , and his father will be twice his age in 20 years , how long before ...' - I found myself wondering if Mr Jones visited his father at Christmas and whether Mr Jones Sr tended to repeat details and anecdotes .
Nonetheless , despite my racing anxiety and vindictive hangover , I was at least making a fist of answering the questions until the final section of the Cattell B .
The invigilator had told us three times that this last bit would require a piece of authorised scrap paper on which to scribble our working out .
I became so preoccupied with using the scrap paper , after all these warnings , that it took me three questions before I realised I did n't need it and it was slowing me down .
By then I had run out of time , before I could answer the last two .
The invigilator said it would be 10 days or so before we found out if we had the attained the necessary score to join Mensa .
I had no plans to hold my breath .
The phrase ' Flynn effect ' was first coined by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray in their 1994 bestselling book The Bell Curve .
The book argued that IQ was a vital factor in a whole range of social issues , including employment , crime and single - parent families .
It also placed pronounced emphasis on the differences in average IQ scores between black and white Americans and suggested that these differences were in some sense innate .
A number of scientists and psychologists have subsequently argued that much of the research underpinning Murray 's findings ( Herrnstein died around publication ) was flawed or skewed , pointing out that it drew on the research of eugenicists .
The controversy unleashed by The Bell Curve continues to dog the study of intelligence .
Last year , James Watson , the Nobel prize - winning biologist who co-discovered DNA , triggered a whole new round of the dispute when he said that he was ' gloomy ' about Africa 's prospects because ' all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really . '
Watson was widely criticised , but some notable voices came to his defence .
In America , the journalist William Saletan wrote a three - part series for the online magazine Slate in which he stated : ' Tests do show an IQ deficit , not just for Africans relative to Europeans , but for Europeans relative to Asians ...
It 's time to prepare for the possibility that equality of intelligence , in the sense of racial averages on tests , will turn out not to be true . '
He later issued an apology when it was pointed out that he had based much of his research on the work of J Philippe Rushton , a psychologist who speaks at conferences held by an American segregationist organisation and whose work on what he terms the ' Negroid ' brain involves measuring the length of the ' Negroid ' penis .
Murray and Watson are what might be called genetic determinists .
They look at the various IQ data relating to different ethnic groups and conclude that race is the cause of the variation .
Watson 's comment on Africa occupies the crude end of this argument .
There are obvious environmental reasons - poverty , lack of schooling , the less pressing importance of abstract reasoning in every day life - why Africa might lag behind in the IQ league that have nothing to do with gene distribution .
As Flynn says : ' This idea that developing countries are too dumb to industrialise - well , our IQs were the same 100 years ago and we industrialised .
It 's like climbing a ladder .
One foot goes up one rung - industrialisation - and that leads to the next rung , improving schools , etc . '
Murray presents a more challenging statistical argument than Watson .
In a debate last year at the Manhattan Institute in New York , Murray examined the continuing gap in IQ scores between black and white Americans .
He argued that for a period in the post war years the gap was narrowed , as the IQ of black Americans rose , in group terms , more rapidly than that of their white counterparts .
Then around 1970 that process came to a halt and since then results show a stable advantage in favour of white Americans .
The average white American IQ is estimated to be around 15 points higher than the average black American IQ .
Murray attributed the gap to inherent genetic difference .
' By the 1970s , ' Murray told his audience , ' you had gotten most of the juice out of the environment that you were going to get . '
Opposing Murray in the debate was Flynn .
He described himself as a ' democratic socialist ' .
A civil - rights activist , he grew disillusioned with the nation of his birth when his opposition to racial segregation lost him his job at the University of Kentucky .
He left the United States for New Zealand in 1963 .
He is soon to publish a book entitled , Where Have All the Liberals Gone ? , in which he aims to defend neglected concepts like equality .
Flynn agrees with the biologist RC Lewontin that the overwhelming part of genetic variation is within , rather than between , population groups .
He also estimates that genetic advantage in individuals accounts for 25 per cent of the variation in intelligence scores , and that the rest is determined by environment .
But he goes further to suggest that the environment acts as a kind of echo chamber for genetic endowment , so that such advantage as exists is amplified by social conditions .
The analogy he uses is that of a talented athlete .
Society rewards the talent with coaching , dietary advice , material support and competitive testing , thus greatly enhancing the raw talent , especially by comparison with the norm that goes unrewarded .
And something like the opposite takes place , Flynn posits , if you start with an environmental disadvantage .
' If you go into a school where the kids have a mean average [ IQ ] of 95 , ' he told the Manhattan Institute , ' kids who want to be above average do n't have to shoot as high if you 're surrounded by kids with a 95 IQ as [ compared with ] a 100 IQ . '
On the phone , Flynn characterises the problem in slightly different language .
' I think there are many aspects of black culture that emphasise utilitarian skills .
And it had better as well because typically young black men face more immediate problems of survival .'
In the debate , Murray challenged Flynn 's proposition by comparing the IQ and educational data .
The IQ gap remained roughly the same in favour of whites , even in circumstances of apparent economic and educational parity .
Flynn , however , rejected the notion that there was an equality of environment in Murray 's example because , in short , he said there was less priority given to mental discipline in black households .
Furthermore , drawing on the work of the Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson ( who happens to be black ) , Flynn stated : ' In black teenage culture there is seemingly a much greater emphasis on dressing sharp , having money , being in shopping malls and speaking an atypical brand of English .
Now I can't see that any of these things would be helpful in terms of an enriched cognitive environment . '
This kind of analysis , of course , shows what a minefield IQ has become .
In countering Murray 's racial determinism , Flynn would earn the title of ' racist ' in many fields of academia .
Once the simplistic nature argument is rejected , it leaves you with nurture .
To look at environment , necessitates an assessment of culture , which can lead to some unpopular conclusions .
Thus the study of IQ occupies territory that many scientists prefer to avoid .
Flynn has little time for sensitive evasions .
' The answer is to grow up , ' he says , ' follow the evidence wherever it leads , and acknowledge that reality never extracts as heavy a price as ignorance of reality . '
In this respect , it 's worth remembering that the key findings behind the Flynn effect are not in dispute : IQ has been going up .
But that does seem to call into question the very notion of innate , hereditary intelligence .
For if IQ is simply handed down the generations , how is it that IQ scores rose so rapidly in the last century ?
Stephen Jay Gould , the late zoology professor at Harvard , wrote a riposte to The Bell Curve in the 1996 edition of his 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man , declaring , ' the theory of unitary , innate , linearly rankable intelligence ' to be full of ' fallacies ' .
The often - heard version of this criticism , much like Shayer 's comment , is that psychometric intelligence testing only measures the ability to perform psychometric intelligence tests .
In any case , the steep rise in IQ would seem to lend weight to the idea that IQ does not evaluate some objective totality of intelligence but rather a cultural definition loaded towards the kind of abstract thinking that forms the basis of everyday life in post - industrial societies .
In which case a discrepancy between Africa and the West , or poor and rich ( or its too frequent manifestation , black and white ) is effectively built in to the system .
As the writer Malcolm Gladwell put it , IQ ' measures not so much how smart we are as how modern we are ' .
So the question is , how modern am I ?
I certainly felt ancient during the tests , and when my result arrived a week later I was reluctant to open it up .
Just under half those who take the Mensa test are invited to join ( around 70 per cent take up the offer ) , but it 's a self - selecting group .
People tend to take the test because they think they 'll make the grade .
The paradox was that before I took the test , I had no great expectations .
But after it was finished , and I felt as if I 'd fared poorly , I really wanted to have done well .
I asked myself why I should care .
After all , I did n't want to join Mensa .
It seemed like a perfectly benign and perhaps even worthwhile organisation , but I 've always experienced a reflex wince whenever I 've heard that someone - a celebrity or acquaintance - is a member of Mensa .
It 's a bit like those people who insist on telling you their excellent A - level results , 30 years after the event .
According to Flynn , when the philosopher Karl Popper was invited to join Mensa , 'he said , whatever his intelligence was , it was n't so low as to make him want to sit around with people whose only attribute was they the did well on IQ tests . '
Flynn agrees .
' I can understand why you might want to join up with people who share a love of music or literature .
But to get together because you all did well in an IQ test ?
Bizarre .'
Still , I wanted to have the choice of rejecting Mensa on the Groucho Marxist principle of not joining any club that would have me as a member .
I do n't believe that IQ is an accurate or comprehensive measurement of intelligence , particularly on an individual basis .
It is undoubtedly a useful tool for examining social and educational developments , but next to meaningless on the personal level .
Yet all things considered , I preferred to get a meaninglessly high score .
I asked some of the other participants why they wanted to find out their IQ .
Almost everyone cited curiosity as their reason .
But one 14 - year - old in Joe 90 glasses told me that he thought it might help with job prospects .
It was somehow depressing to see a boy preparing for the competitive job market before his voice had broken .
I felt concerned that he appeared to have lost his corporate virginity at such a tender age .
What if he did n't qualify for Mensa , how would that make him feel ?
He gave me a look that was awkwardly close to contempt .
' I 'd feel really stupid , ' he said , ' but that 's not going to happen . '
Oh , for such confidence .
' Your Supervised Test Result ' was the headline of my Mensa result letter .
My eyes shot down to the body copy and fixed on ' 113 ' , my score in the Culture Fair test .
That placed me in the 21st centile .
Damn that hangover .
No , let 's be honest .
It was n't the hangover , it was me .
Too slow to decode a few simple patterns .
So what ?
Belatedly , I made imaginative use of my reasoning faculties .
How often was I required to perform diagrammatic pattern - recognition tasks in real life ?
What good was that skill when parking a car or making coffee or even reading Tolstoy ?
Mensa , I wanted to shout , am I bovvered ?
Then I saw the ' 149 ' score of the Cattell B test , which put me in the second centile .
' We offer you our congratulations , ' continued the letter , ' and would like to invite you to become a member of Mensa , the high IQ society . '
Yes !
Phew , now I could turn them down , which was so much more appealing than the alternative : them turning me down .
But hold on .
Flynn argues that the Mensa IQ tests need to be ' normed ' .
As IQ has been rising , the median average score has to be recalibrated on a regular basis to take account of the general improvement .
He estimates that one third of the Mensa membership would be ' wiped out ' if the tests were normed .
' Are you in the top 2 per cent ? ' he asks .
' Or the 2 per cent of 20 years ago ? '
Either way , a rather stunning personal Flynn effect had taken place from one test to the next .
I 'd jumped 19 per cent , or 19 people in a random selection of 100 .
Was n't that all a bit freakish ?
' Yes and no , ' explained Maria Leitner , consultant psychologist to Mensa - an answer that seemed to typify the ambiguities inherent in the any discussion of IQ .
' It really depends on how localised your brain is . '
Apparently journalists often do better on the Cattell B , because we regularly - at least in theory - use language - based reasoning .
I found the two scores neatly reassuring .
They seemed to demonstrate the subjective nature of IQ testing .
If there 's that level of variation in just one person , how can anyone draw definitive conclusions about whole groups ?
The mysteries of the brain are not so easily reduced to a number .
Naturally , if asked , I 'll say I have an IQ of 149 , rather than 113 .
It sounds better .
But what does it amount to in the real world ?
Something close , I suspect , to a great big zero .

United States Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice recently took time off from her busy schedule in Stockholm , Sweden to meet and chat with member of KISS , according to the AFP .
Simmons and the other band members — Paul Stanley , Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer — autographed for her a glossy concert photograph of them on stage and gave band T - shirts to Rice ’s aides .
Rice said she had never seen KISS perform but she had been to four rock concerts in her life .
Rice took a second to pose for pics with the unmasked members of KISS , including this one where Gene Simmons is sizing Condi up for addition to his extensive collection of sexual conquests .
It ’s not the first time Condi has been photographed hobnobbing with rock royalty .
Here she is with Saint Bono of U2 .
And another with the boys from ZZ Top .

I know , it is a provocative title .
But considering what North ’s “ security ” did to members of We Are Change at the Louisville Exposition Center on Sunday , the title is entirely appropriate .
Cody Deeds asked North about Rex 84 , short for Readiness Exercise 1984 , and asked if a new 9/11 investigation was in order .
Sam Logulo asked about the Iran Contra hearings and “ the presence of concentration camps in America , ” a fact reported by the Miami Herald on July 5 , 1987 .
Rex 84 and other “ contingency planning readiness exercises ” are a subset of Operation Garden Plot , a plan alive and well and recently activated as Noble Eagle under the control the U.S. Northern Command .
Op Garden plot is described as providing military and law enforcement assistance to local governments during “ major civil disturbances , ” that it to say it is a violation of Posse Comitatus , now quite moribund .
In response to questions about Rex 84 , North basically claimed ignorance , stating the “ only concentration camps were shut down after World War II , ” in other words , North either has a bad case of amnesia or is telling a lie , the latter not surprising as even Ronald Reagan , who North worked for , accused North of making various “ false statements ” during the Iran - Contra hearings .
“ North has a magic mouth , ” explained the late David Hackworth , and is also “ one of the most dangerous men in America today . ”
We Are Change discovered how dangerous North is — or at least how dangerous his “ security ” detail is , a detachment apparently comprised of the same stock as Hitler ’s brownshirts .
“ Logulo told North that he would send him the information on the camps , but at this point , police surrounded the WeAreChange members .
At which point the officers told the members to shut off their cameras .
Adam Covington from Kentuckiana Change asked an officer , ‘ Why ca n’t I record this when I have a press pass , and this is a second and first amendment venue ? ’
Despite the lack of explanation from the police , the members shut off their devices and proceeded to walk out of the building . ”
It was bad enough these Americans were denied journalistic freedom , at one time guaranteed under the First Amendment .
But simply denying this right was not enough for Ollie ’s goons .
“ While escorted out , a plainclothes officer yelled ‘ Give me your camera , ’ and tried to snatch Logulo ’s camera from behind .
Four officers tackled Logulo , and drove him to the ground .
One officer put Logulo into a headlock . ”
Logulo told the “ officers ” he was not resisting and there was no need for violence , but then these modern day brownshirts , not much different than their fascist predecessors , were obviously interested in punishing Mr. Logulo for his temerity .
Deeds taped the assault and for this he was attacked as well .
“ Three officers took Deeds down to his knees as they ripped the camera out of his hand .
Deeds tried to take the memory stick out of his camera , and was accused of ‘ tampering with evidence ’ a Class D felony according to officer Rehm . ”
Of course , this accusation was so absurd as to be almost laughable , or it would be if not for the physical violence and the theft of memory cards , two battery packs , two sets of batteries , and a disc .
“ Throughout the 30 min ordeal the members of change were interrogated , harassed , and searched . ”
Calling the cops brownshirts is probably not correct .
More accurately , they served as North ’s Ordnertruppen , or protective guard .
In Nazi Germany , the Ordnertruppen specialized in thrashing the opposition , as fascists have no tolerance for those who are in disagreement .
In fact , the term Ordnertruppen is especially pertinent , as the handpicked brawlers and bullies were organized to protect Hitler during speeches and Nazi Party gatherings .
Hitler ’s Ordnertruppen eventually morphed into the Sturmabteilung , or SA brownshirts , and they relished beating , tormenting , torturing and killing the opposition .
“ All opposition must be stamped into the ground , ” was a famous SA maxim .
North ’s security is now at the Ordnertruppen stage .
How long before they evolve into a neocon version of the Sturmabteilung ?
How long before the Halliburton constructed concentration camps — as originally envisioned by Oliver North under Rex 84 — are activated ?
For now , the opposition — actually nothing more than a small group of citizen journalists — are merely assaulted , but soon enough they may be rounded at up three in the morning , hooded , beaten , and tortured in Abu Ghraib fashion .
How long before they are slaughtered and dumped in mass graves ?
Fascism usually looks and smells about the same , no matter the country or period of time .
Finally , it should be noted that the neocons are fans of the professor from the University of Greifswald , Hitler ’s crowned jurist and philosopher of dictatorship , Carl Schmitt , who called for Ausnahmezustand , or a state of emergency .
John
Yoo , who justified the torture of children , is a student of Schmitt , as are any number of other neocons , many who follow the teachings of Leo Strauss , who was mentored by the Nazi Schmitt .
For such monsters , beating up citizen journalists is no problem .
Even those less strictly neocon — such as Glenn Beck , Morning Joe , no shortage of Faux News talking heads , and Geraldo Rivera — believe asking questions about September 11 is a dangerous precedent and requires an aggressive if not violent response , such as tasering , beating , and internment in concentration camps .

TALLAHASSEE , Florida ( Reuters ) - Senate lawmakers in Florida have voted to ban the fake bull testicles that dangle from the trailer hitches of many trucks and cars throughout the state .
Republican Sen. Cary Baker , a gun shop owner from Eustis , Florida , called the adornments offensive and proposed the ban .
Motorists would be fined $ 60 for displaying the novelty items , which are known by brand names like “ Truck Nutz ” and resemble the south end of a bull moving north .
The Florida Senate voted last week to add the measure to a broader transportation bill , but it is not included in the House version .
In a spirited debate laced with double entendre , Senate lawmakers questioned whether the state should curtail freedom of expression in vehicle accessories .
Critics of the ban included the Senate Rules Chairman , Sen. Jim King , a Jacksonville Republican whose truck sported a pair until his wife protested .
The bill ’s sponsor doubted it would succeed .
“ It ’s probably not going to make it through the process , ” Baker said on Thursday .
“ It wo n’t be much of story in a few days . ”

Dissident Voice
May 15 , 2008
In the wake of Senator Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) and Susan Collins ’ ( R - ME ) alarmist report , “ Violent Islamist Extremism , the Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorism Threat , ” the Senate may be moving towards passage of the Orwellian “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ″ ( S. 1959 ) .
A companion piece of legislative flotsam to the House bill , “ The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ″ ( H.R. 1955 ) , the Democrat - controlled Congress seems ready to jettison Constitutional guarantees of free speech and assembly .
The bill passed the House by a 404 - 6 vote in October .
Twenty - three congress members abstained , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers .
Under cover of studying “ violent radicalization , ” both bills would broaden the already - fluid definition of “ terrorism ” to encompass political activity and protest by dissident groups , effectively criminalizing civil disobedience and non-violent direct action by developing policies for “ prevention , disruption and mitigation . ”
Call it COINTELPRO 2.0 .
Crafted by former House Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , the legislation would create a domestic commission , a university - based “ Center of Excellence ” that would study and then , target domestic “ radicalization ” as a “ threat ” to the “ homeland . ”
David Price , a professor of anthropology at St. Martin ’s University who studies state surveillance and the harassment of dissident scholars , told Jessica Lee of New York ’s Indypendent newspaper last year that Harman ’s bill “ is a shot over the bow of environmental activists , animal - rights activists , anti-globalization activists and scholars who are working in the Middle East who have views that go against the administration . ”
Evoking disquieting memories of political witchhunters ensconced in the House Committee on Un- American Activities and Senator Joseph McCarthy ’s Senate Subcommittee on Investigations , the anti-radicalization commission would be empowered to “ hold hearings and sit and act at such times and places , take such testimony , receive such evidence , and administer such oaths as the Commission considers advisable to carry out its duties . ”
With the power to subpoena and compel testimony from anyone , the commission would create the ( intended ) impression that a person forced to publicly testify before a congressionally mandated star chamber must be involved in “ subversive ” or illegal activities .
According to Naomi Spencer ,
The commission would be composed of appointees , one chosen each respectively by Bush , Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff , the Senate and House majority and minority leaders , and by the ranking majority and minority members of the two congressional homeland security committees .
Such a selection process would certainly result in an extremely right - wing panel .
1
When one considers that elite consensus favoring “ muscular ” strategies for fighting “ terror ” – homegrown or otherwise–emerge during a period when the Bush regime has illegally wiretapped phone calls , sifted e-mails , spied on political and religious organizations , and conducted extensive data mining of financial and other personal records , it becomes clear that the corporate police state is shifting into high - gear in a desperate move to criminalize ideological “ thought crimes . ”
The intent of the proposed legislation , however , goes far beyond an academic exercise .
According to Jessica Lee , Harman stated that “ the National Commission [ will ] propose to both Congress and [ Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael ]
Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent . ”
In the context of the post - Constitutional “ New Normal ” paradigm , Harman and her acolytes evoke images of Philip K. Dick ’s Department of Precrime in his dystopian novella , The Minority Report .
Only here , in the bizarro world of outsourced “ homeland security , ” mutant precogs are replaced by high - end–and taxpayer funded –data - miners , psychological profilers and social network analysts in the employ of dodgy security firms linked to America ’s military - intelligence complex .
The legislation specifically singles out the Internet as a “ weapon ” for domestic radicalization .
When she introduced her bill to the Senate last November , Harman remarked , “ There can be no doubt : the Internet is increasingly being used as a tool to reach and radicalize Americans and legal residents . ”
Equating America ’s web - surfacing habits with the threat of ideological infection by Islamist pod-people , Harman avers that the Internet allows Americans “ to become indoctrinated by extremists and to learn how to kill their neighbors … from the comfort of their own living rooms . ”
( Britney , Paris , better move over … there ’s a new truck - bombing instructional posted over on YouTube !
OMG !)
Harman ’s ludicrous pronouncement is considerably ramped - up by the Lieberman and Collins report , based on –what else– “ expert testimony ” during hearings held by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
Lieberman and Collins claim that ,
… the report assesses the federal government ’s response to the spread of the violent Islamist message on the Internet and concludes that there is no cohesive and comprehensive outreach and communications strategy in place to confront this threat .
The report does not discuss relevant classified tools and tactics employed by the law enforcement and intelligence communities , but does recognize that there is no plan to harness all possible resources including adopting new laws , encouraging and supporting law enforcement and the intelligence community at the local , state , and federal levels , and more aggressively implementing an outreach and counter - messaging campaign on the Internet and elsewhere .
In other words , “ independent ” Democrat Lieberman and “ maverick Republican ” Collins are proposing new “ tools ” for regulating the Internet through a counter - propaganda campaign that would create “ message force multipliers ” that “ support law enforcement ” initiatives to crush the radical “ threat . ”
By targeting the Internet , House and Senate thought police claim that “ the Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens . ”
But as the American Civil Liberties Union wrote last week ,
Experience has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack , the results of this report will likely be used to recommend the use of racial , ethnic and religious profiling .
This will only heighten , rather than decrease , the spread of extremist violence .
As an organization dedicated to the principles of freedom of speech , we cannot in good conscience support this report or any measure that might lead to censorship and persecution based solely on one ’s personal beliefs .
The ACLU is concerned that identifying the Internet as a tool for terrorists will lead to censorship and regulated speech — especially since the Internet has become an essential communications and research tool for everyone .
Indeed , some policy makers have advocated shutting down objectionable websites in violation of the First Amendment .
It is an unworkable solution .
2
Precisely .
But wait , there ’s more !
Citing the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) as “ experts ” in the area of “ homegrown radicalism , ” the report avers :
After more than two years of research into homegrown terrorism cases in the United States and around the world , the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) developed a model to explain how this core enlistment message , and the “ jihadi - Salafi ” ideology that provides the foundation for that message , drive the domestic radicalization process — transforming “ unremarkable people ” into terrorists .
Perhaps Lieberman and Collins should have consulted the family of Sean Bell as to the NYPD ’s “ expertise ” on analogous crime “ modeling . ”
Murdered by trigger - happy cops after a bachelor party the morning of his wedding , Bell ’s life was snuffed - out after he and his friends were shot some 50 times .
The cops–surprise ! –were recently found “ not guilty ” on all counts by a New York judge .
We can dismiss senatorial allusions to NYPD ’s acumen in the area of “ counterterrorist analysis ” with the contempt it deserves .
But let ’s be clear on one thing : the sole purpose of the “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act ” is to target the American people ’s constitutionally - protected right to say No .
If the U.S. House and Senate care to examine the “ root causes ” of terrorism today , they need look no further than the on - going U.S. slaughter in Iraq–a “ preemptive ” war of choice to which they infamously gave their consent with eyes wide open .

What a tangled web they weave ...

University of Professor Peter Duesberg is the pre-eminent virologist in the world today and one of the top , if not the top , molecular biologists .
Unfortunately , he has a political problem .
He does n't accept the still - unproven ( and some say dubious ) theory that the group of diseases known as AIDS is caused by HIV .
If " science " is wrong about the cause of AIDS , then finding a cure is impossible .
This may explain why a cure has not been found in spite of billions of dollars that has been raised and spent on AIDS " research . "
But the waste of time and effort is only the tip of the iceberg .
There may be something more sinister afoot .
With a little understanding , the AIDS " help " trumpeted for Africa ( by George Bush no less ) and low income , minority families in the US looks less like medicine and more like a genocide program .
Who 's behind this scam ?
The answer may surprise you .
Note :
The t- shirted " surfer dude " at the end of the first video is Kary Mullis .
He won the Nobel Prize winner for developing the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , one of the fundamental tools of biomedicine and hailed as one of the monumental scientific techniques of the 20th century .
Not everyone buys the AIDS story as told by the media , the US government and the pharmaceutical companies .

In a recent post , Ted Neward gives a brief description of a variety of programming languages .
It ’s a useful post ; I ’ve known
Ted for awhile now , and he ’s quite knowledgeable about such things .
Still , I have to comment on what he says about Erlang :
Erlang .
Joe Armstrong ’s baby was built to solve a specific set of problems at Ericsson , and from it we can learn a phenomenal amount about building massively parallel concurrent programs .
The fact that it runs on its own interpreter , bad .
I might have said it like this :
Erlang .
Joe Armstrong ’s baby was built to solve a specific set of problems at Ericsson , and from it we can learn a phenomenal amount about building highly reliable systems that can also support massive concurrency .
The fact that it runs on its own interpreter , good ; otherwise , the reliability would n’t be there and it would be just another curious but useless concurrency - oriented language experiment .
Far too many blog posts and articles that touch on Erlang completely miss the point that reliability is an extremely important aspect of the language .
To achieve reliability , you have to accept the fact that failure will occur , Once you accept that , then other things fall into place : you need to be able to restart things quickly , and to do that , processes need to be cheap .
If something fails , you do n’t want it taking everything else with it , so you need to at least minimize , if not eliminate , sharing , which leads you to message passing .
You also need monitoring capabilities that can detect failed processes and restart them ( BTW in the same posting Ted seems to claim that Erlang has no monitoring capabilities , which baffles me ) .
Massive concurrency capabilities become far easier with an architecture that provides lightweight processes that share nothing , but that does n’t mean that once you design it , the rest is just a simple matter of programming .
Rather , actually implementing all this in a way that delivers what ’s needed and performs more than adequately for production - quality systems is an incredibly enormous challenge , one that the Erlang development team has quite admirably met , and that ’s an understatement if there ever was one .
They come for the concurrency but they stay for the reliability .
Do any other “ Erlang - like ” languages have real , live , production systems in the field that have been running non -stop for years ?
( That ’s not a rhetorical question ; if you know of any such languages , please let me know . )
Next time you see yet another posting about Erlang and concurrency , especially those of the form “ Erlang - like concurrency in language X ! ” just ask the author : where ’s the reliability ?

Although with regard to the past , when this is reported correctly what is brought out from the memory is not the events themselves ( these are already past ) but words conceived from the images of those events , which , in passing through the senses , have left as it were their footprints stamped upon the mind .
My boyhood , for instance , which no longer exists , exists in time past , which no longer exists .
But when I recollect the image of my boyhood and tell others about it , I am looking at this image in time present , because it still exists in my memory .
— St. Augustine of Hippo , Confessions , 398
Memory is the same as imagination .
— Giambattista Vico , New Science , 1725
NOTE : This profile of the allegedly fake memoirist Augusten Burroughs is based on real events .
Dialogue has been compressed , and chronology has been changed for dramatic effect .
Augusten Burroughs travels between Amherst , Massachusetts , where he lives , and New York , where he keeps an apartment , in a hired black Town Car , so he can sit in the back and chew nicotine gum and watch Trauma : Life in the ER on his iPod .
He has come down , this April afternoon , to walk me around his old neighborhood while I dredge his apparently superhuman memory in an effort to determine whether he is , as millions of readers seem to believe , one of the most honest men on the planet — someone willing to share unvarnished true - life details of his childhood statutory rape and the time he murdered a rat in cold blood in his bathtub — or whether , as others have alleged ( some of them in a court of law ) , he is actually a gigantic liar .
I know that his memory is superhuman because he told me so , last week , over lunch .
“ I can remember being 8 months old in my high chair , ” he said , chewing nicotine gum between bites of a goat - cheese omelette .
“ I can remember learning to walk .
I can remember the exact sound the wooden spoon made on the aluminum pot on the stove .
I can remember that the lid of the pot had a little knob , putting it in my mouth like a nipple .
I can remember my high chair ’s tray :
The metal was textured , it had peak - valley , peak - valley , peak - valley , a small design element , a striation . ”
Tomorrow he leaves for San Diego to give a speech to someone about something or other .
He does n’t remember .
“ I just show up and talk , ” he says .
He does , indeed , show up and talk .
In person , Burroughs has a focused analytical intelligence that does n’t always come through in his writing , which tends to be emotional and therapeutic and often is written from the perspective of a child .
In our first conversation , he gives me speeches about the neglected genius of middlebrow novelist Elizabeth Berg ( “ If she had a penis , she ’d be John Updike ” ) , the origins of southern manners among Belle Époque New York millionaires , and the ecstasy of quantum physics .
( He ’s particularly jazzed about a phenomenon called “ entanglement , ” in which photons at opposite ends of space seem to communicate instantaneously . )
He says he can differentiate between the major brands of carbonated water ( “ Perrier has sharp , broken - glass bubbles ; Calistoga ’s are smaller ” ) , as well as between real homeless people and college kids pretending to be homeless .
“ There ’s that look you ca n’t replicate with eye shadow , ” he says .
He is , in person , almost the opposite of his textual persona : tall , athletic , and intense .
In an effort not to look “ pregnant ” for the book tour for his new memoir , he ’s been working out every day and recently broke his addiction to midnight bags of M&Ms .
He is wearing , today , his publicity - tour uniform : jeans , black leather jacket , a blue T - shirt with some kind of Victorian woodcut on it , and a brown mesh trucker hat featuring an artsy cow .
The biggest surprise , to me , is that he radiates trustworthiness :
He seems open , unrushed , self - deprecating , and willing to discuss any subject with piercingly direct eye contact .
He asks questions about my childhood , listens carefully to the answers , and follows up with more questions .
He is unfailingly kind to waiters .
His voice is dry , higher - pitched than I ’d expected , and a little twangy , the product of growing up under highly educated southern parents in western Massachusetts .
He puts an especially heavy accent on the word was :
It comes out sounding like “ wahz ” or “ waaaahz ” — as if , even phonetically , the past requires disproportionate emphasis .
I find myself trusting Burroughs far more in person than I ever have in print — and yet I recognize in this trust yet another reason to doubt .
Our meeting , after all , is just the first phase of a global marketing campaign whose success depends entirely on the spectacle of his honesty .
Trust is the product for sale .

Burroughs and I are sitting looking out the big rectangular plate - glass window of an Equinox fitness center on the corner of Greenwich and 12th .
The window is giant and perfectly clean and creates the illusion of containing the entirety of West Village foot traffic like fish in an aquarium .
Although Burroughs no longer drinks , he collects lesser compulsions like little girls collect seashells , and he has been drawn to this spot by the lure of two converging addictions , one minor , one major .
The minor addiction is Red Bull ; they did n’t have it , so he settled for a Diet Coke .
The major addiction is , as usual , Burroughs ’s Big One , the master dependency around which all his minor dependencies ( M& Ms , the Internet , French bulldogs , nicotine ) seem to rotate in twitchy , continuous orbit — the source of pretty much all his wealth and fame and controversy : namely , his allegedly vivid , restless , overstuffed memory .
He is giving it a light workout , here at the window , excavating some details mostly for my benefit .
This , he says , is an ideal spot for reminiscence , “ a very nutrient - dense area . ”
The gym is on the corner of Burroughs ’s old street , which he has n’t returned to in over ten years .
He lived here in the West Village eighteen years ago , when he was 24 .
“ All these little details come back when I ’m here , ” he says .
“ It ’s like there ’s a whole other time layered over this one .
And the people that lived here still live here for me , still walk the streets . ”
He says he remembers , for instance , watching a painter — “ navy shirt , white pants , brown belt , black boots ” — painting a door across from his old apartment .
“ White drop cloth spread out over the stone steps , ” he says .
“ The way the light hit him . ”
My internal polygraph begins to twitch here , subtly , because what sort of freakishly bloated cortex retains , for eighteen years , the color of a random workman ’s belt ?
This is exactly the kind of improbably authenticating detail Burroughs has been accused of inventing in his books — not a big deal on its own , perhaps , but patch enough of them together and your life story is suddenly more imagined than remembered .
“ The way the light hit him ” ?
Seriously ?
Burroughs says that , back when he was busy drinking himself to the brink of death in his apartment halfway down the block , this fitness center with its big glass window was an old movie theater called the Art Greenwich .
He used to hang out in front of it with a crowd of homeless people , in a kind of informal apprenticeship .
“ I was n’t doing it to be cool and have homeless friends , ” he says .
“ I was doing it to see , How hard can this be ?
I thought it was inevitable I would become one of them . ”
They got to be such pals they ’d do him favors .
“ They would see me going down to the subway , and all of a sudden there ’d be this filthy hand slapping right in front of me , putting a token in . ”
( My polygraph spasms again : a bit Dickensian . )
Burroughs fires up his synapses and describes , in detail , the look of the old theater ’s lobby : its threadbare red carpeting , the off - kilter angle of its back corner , its glass door .
I ask him what movies he saw here .
“ Lots , ” he says , but he ca n’t come up with any names , just something about Robert De Niro as a pedophile on a boat with Juliette Lewis .
Village girls drift past the window in complicated boots .
Burroughs points across the street to the diner where he used to have fat - soaked hangover breakfasts to try to absorb some of the alcohol before it reached his swollen liver .
He tells me about miserable nights at a now - defunct gay bar called Uncle Charlie ’s , a place “ just exactly as loathsome as the name implies . ”
He remembers , vividly , the embarrassment of trying to sneak Hefty bags full of wine bottles down the stairs of his old building in the middle of the night .
But he ca n’t remember which apartment he lived in .
“ Something D , maybe ? ” he says .
At this , my polygraph sketches a quick profile of the Alps .
Who can remember the color of a stranger ’s belt , and the precise angle of the back corner of an old movie theater ’s lobby , but not the number of his own apartment , or any of the movies he saw ?
What kind of memory is that ?
To describe Burroughs ’s semi-mythic and exhaustively self - documented life is , at this point , deeply redundant .
Over the last six years — as America reached and then passed the red - hot climax of its sadomasochistic affair with memoir — Burroughs has seemed determined to surpass all reasonable human limits of public self - disclosure .
In that span , he has published five autobiographical books , and he supplements these with a blog , a MySpace page , and an elaborate promotional Website complete with emotive folk songs about his childhood and video of him kissing his dog .
We know the names of not only his current pets ( Bentley and the Cow ) but also his childhood dogs ( Cream , Brutus , Grover ) and his dead guinea pig ( Ernie ) .
Burroughs ’s new book , A Wolf at the Table , is being promoted as “ his first memoir in five years ” — a gem of self - canceling hype roughly equivalent to “ her first wedding since last fall ” or “ his ninth bar mitzvah since he was 13 . ”
And yet somehow here we are .
Burroughs was born Chris Robison in 1965 , into legendarily unpromising circumstances .
His mother was a suicidal bad poet , his father a sadistic , alcoholic philosophy professor .
When the marriage flamed out , after years of enthusiastic mutual abuse , Burroughs commenced his world - famous adolescence , as described in his ubiquitous 2002 debut memoir , Running With Scissors :
His mother abandoned him to her eccentric psychiatrist , a Santa Claus look - alike who searched for hidden messages in his own feces , excused himself during therapy sessions to visit his “ masturbatorium , ” and allowed Burroughs to have a sexual relationship with a 34 - year - old man .
( According , at least , to Scissors . )
After escaping this madhouse in his late teens , Burroughs reinvented himself :
He went to computer school , changed his name ( Burroughs after a defunct computer , the Burroughs tabulator ; Augusten because it “ sounded classic — but then , when you looked at it twice , absolutely unfamiliar ” ) , and commenced the second , only mildly less world - famous phase of his life , described in his second memoir , Dry ( 2003 ) :
He landed a high - paying job in advertising , moved to New York , blew his money and health on alcohol and drugs , went to rehab , and lost his best friend , Pighead , to AIDS .
After all of this tragedy , Burroughs discovered the circular salvation of the memoir .
He was rescued from homelessness , alcoholism , crack , and abuse — in short , from everything depicted in his books — by the books themselves .
Today , Burroughs is the last of the big - game memoirists , targeted but still on his feet , still profitably working the cud of his dysfunctional youth , still memoiring , against all odds , under the vengeful glare of Oprah and her increasingly skeptical public .
As the culture of memoir has imploded over the last few years — as JT LeRoy dissolved into some kind of conceptual - art project about Truth in Media , as James Frey suffered the most visible public flogging in the long history of global torture , as Margaret “ Gangland ” Seltzer was outed by her own sister as a pampered suburbanite , as Misha Defonseca admitted that she was neither a Holocaust survivor nor raised by wolves — Burroughs sat at his laptop , undeterred , furiously masticating his chemical gum , and claimed , with a perfectly straight face , to be faithfully transcribing the honest - to - God events of his past .
When Burroughs writes , he tells me , he drifts into a kind of shamanistic memory trance that allows him to travel freely through time .
He never stops to look at what he ’s typing , which he says would only distract him .
Instead , his eyes glaze over , and he stares absently at the small aluminum strip between his laptop ’s keyboard and screen .
“ When I am writing , ” he says , “ I am there .
I ’m there .
I never , ever , in any of my books , ever , have thought , ‘ Now , how would I have talked ? ’
That is not how I write .
It feels like I just go back and I ’m there .
It ’s like a movie .
It ’s extremely vivid .
I ’m a monkey at a typewriter , writing about the time it got M&Ms , and the time a blue M&M came out instead of a red one . ”
Like Proust , he works in bed , propped up on some pillows .
He feels terror , excitement , and sadness ; he cries .
It ’s more like a séance than a job .
Burroughs ’s publicist has set us up for dinner at an unlikely venue , a tiny West Village cave with tastefully arranged paparazzi outside that also happens to be owned ( and frequented ) by Graydon Carter , whose magazine , Vanity Fair , published a long article about the Running With Scissors lawsuit — the biggest dent yet in Burroughs ’s public credibility .
In 2005 , the family depicted in Scissors sued Burroughs for libel ; the case settled last summer , when Burroughs and his publisher agreed to publish the book with a disclaimer recognizing that the family had a different perspective of the events described .
( Burroughs called it “ a victory for all memoirists . ” )
When I mention the Vanity Fair connection , he shrugs .
He ’s still wearing his book - publicity uniform , except this time his hat has a pig on it instead of a cow , and his T - shirt is a lighter shade of blue .
When we sit down , he takes off his leather jacket to reveal a pair of tattoos running up each forearm : on his left arm , a mess of winding filigree , on his right , the phrase CICATRIX MANET — Latin for “ The scar remains . ”
( He says he also has a spiral tattooed on the back of his shoulder , to remind him not to drink . )
He has a way of shrinking already - small New York restaurants .
His voice , as it locks into one of his speeches , tends to rise in volume to match the intensity of his thought , and to find its way into distant corners .
The dignified elderly couple at the next table leaves not long after we sit down .
Burroughs says he never read the Vanity Fair article — in general , he avoids reading his press — but that it does n’t bother him .
“ It did n’t have the impact they thought it would , ” he says .
“ No one mentioned it to me .
Only reporters .
It did n’t build .
It was like a nothing .
There was nothing there . ”
I ask if he ’d mind , given that we ’re at Vanity Fair ’s unofficial headquarters , responding to the article ’s main points .
He agrees .
I run through the accusations one by one : that Burroughs fudged the book ’s timeline ; that he never saw a 6 - year - old nicknamed “ Poo Bear ” poop under the family piano ; that there was no masturbatorium ; that a shock - therapy machine the kids played with was actually an old vacuum cleaner missing a wheel ; that Burroughs and one of the children did not tear down the kitchen ceiling .
He responds , vehemently , to every charge .
“ Well , no , that ’s not true at all , ” he says .
“ God no , I lived with them far longer .
A year and a half , they said that ?
That ’s weird . …
It was not an old vac — I know a shock - therapy machine from an old vacuum cleaner , for God ’s sake !
That ’s weird , that ’s just a weird comment …
Why would they deny that he has a masturbatorium ?
How does that harm them ?
If he were alive , he ’d be the first person to tell you where it was .
He ’d sit right here and say of course it was my masturbatorium .
So it ’s just weird to me … Wow .
Wow !
I ’m flabbergasted .
Wow . ”
His voice begins to fill the little restaurant .
As I watch Burroughs react , my polygraph needle begins to tremble again .
Outraged denial is , of course , a reasonable response for an honest writer accused of lying .
But is it even remotely possible that , after a well - publicized two - year trial in which his career and reputation hung in the balance , these allegations would come as a surprise to him ?
Can he possibly be “ flabbergasted ” by anything I ’ve said ?
I ask him if these accusations came up in court .
He says he does n’t remember .
A minute later he says he thinks they probably did .
Soon he is borderline shouting about how ridiculous it would be for a writer seeking mainstream fame to describe not only a gay sexual relationship between a man and a young boy but “ anal penetration ! ”
The new diners at the table next to us , a pair of quiet young gentlemen in nice sweaters , pause momentarily from their conversation about a Paris Review party .
I ask Burroughs if all of this makes him angry .
“ It does n’t make me angry , ” he says .
“ It makes me feel incredulous .
It ’s a very arbitrary list of things .
They ’re reaching , grasping at straws .
What it comes down to is they ’re trying to portray me as a liar and say , ‘ No , it was n’t sunny that day , it was rainy .
He lied .
We want our money . ’ ”
Does it ever make him doubt , even for a second , his account of things — or wonder if he might have just misunderstood as a kid ?
“ Oh , God , no , ” he says .
“ How can I explain this ?
It ’s not like writing about high school and talking about what yard line the cheerleaders stood at .
High school for the most part is unexceptional .
These were absolutely extraordinary circumstances .
I mean , the terror of my mother going psychotic the way she did , being unable to raise me , and then the wildness of living in this house — it burns into your brain .
If you had been on the Titanic when it sank , I promise you , I bet you every penny I have , you would know exactly what you were wearing , exactly who was standing next to you , what they were wearing , exactly what people were saying .
You would know precisely which side of the lifeboat you climbed into , you would remember if you took your life jacket off or if you left it on , you would remember exactly how that ship sank .
You just would .
But if you took the Titanic and it did n’t sink , how much would you really remember ?
So it does n’t make me second - guess my recollection of it .
I do n’t see how I could be wrong .
It is n’t .
It is n’t .
I bet my life on it .
I bet my life on it . ”
The maître d’ comes over and asks him to lower his voice .
“ I did not sit down and cleverly think of a story that I thought would be gripping and make me lots of money and famous , ” he continues .
“ I sit down and I go back and I write the stories from my life .
It is that simple .
All the rest of it I leave to other people to talk about and debate . ”
We do not order dessert .
The tension between “ actual ” memory and our translation of that memory into words is not , despite the public ’s perennially fresh outrage , a new problem , nor one that has an easy answer .
Every memoir depends on a loose cognitive partnership between notoriously sketchy processes : the subjectivity of memory itself , the spotty and biased power of recall , the translation of images into language .
Memory is chaotic , nonsequential , and spotty ; marketable narrative is easy , clean , and quick .
You might say , in fact , that a certain low - grade lying basically defines the genre , and always has , all the way back to the very first memoirist : Saint Augustine , the fourth - century bishop of Hippo , who confessed , in his Confessions , that he was recording “ not the events themselves … but words conceived from the images of those events . ”
( When I asked Burroughs if he got his first name from the memoiring saint , he said that if he had he “ should be taken out back and shot in the fucking head .
That would just be so horribly pretentious . ” )
All of this is , by now , a very familiar can of worms to Augusten Burroughs .
“ We ’re a binge culture , ” he says .
“ The media will get on one topic and stay on that topic forever .
I ’m going to be asked about the veracity of my memoirs and the state of memoir when I ’m 65 .
It will never , ever stop . ”
Still , he ’s happy to make his position clear .
He insists that Running With Scissors preceded the memoir boom — and that now , after a publishing craze brought on largely by his own success , the genre has spun out of control .
“ It ’s just exactly like fucking puppy - mill puppies , ” he says .
“ All of a sudden a dog will win Westminster and it will become the ‘ It ’ dog and you ’ll see it in New York everywhere and it ’ll be in all the pet stores , and what happens is you start off with a really solid , good breed — poodle is a perfect example .
Very stable dogs , very good with children , very smart , the smartest breed .
Very loyal .
And then they get bred , and they get inbred , and they get inbred , and the genetics become weaker and weaker and you get hip dysplasia .
Until what you end up with ca n’t even be called a poodle .
That ’s kind of what ’s happened with memoir . ”
“ It does n’t make me angry .
It makes me feel incredulous .
They ’re reaching , grasping at straws .
What it comes down to is they ’re trying to portray me as a liar and say , ‘ No , it was n’t sunny that day , it was rainy .
He lied .
We want our money . ’ ”
Burroughs says he rarely reads other memoirs , but when he does he expects the truth .
“ I find the privileged white girl writing about gangland morally corrupt , ” he says .
“ I have a problem with that .
I would feel manipulated .
JT LeRoy ?
I would feel really violated .
People sort of think now , not ‘ Do I have a story to tell ? ’ but ‘ Can I think of a story I could write and call a memoir ? ’
And it ’s unfortunate because it becomes the focus in the media , and as a result I think there are a lot of incredible stories that may get overlooked because of the big memoir scandals .
I mean , how would Bastard Out of Carolina do today , you know ? ”
( Bastard Out of Carolina , just for the record , is a novel . )
Burroughs responds to charges of fakery with a denial so bulletproof it almost feels suspicious in itself — it suggests either supreme heroic conviction or a deep , possibly even unconscious , self - deception .
He insists , always , that he ’s telling the absolute truth , even about the details of events that happened 30 years ago .
And the bedrock of this defense is always his bionic memory , in which he seems to have total faith .
“ I guess it ’s unusual , ” he says .
“ My brother thinks it ’s because I have a little Asperger ’s like him , and it ’s an Aspergian trait .
It ’s an incredible benefit when I ’m writing about my past .
But it ’s also a disadvantage in that it ’s incredibly vivid . ”
At the center of the skepticism about Burroughs ’s credibility , even among his admirers , is his work ’s relentlessly scenic quality .
He never recounts dialogue in general terms or describes incidents vaguely .
Even the most banal exchanges are quoted verbatim .
In the new book , instead of summarizing a 30 - year - old conversation with his mother , Burroughs re-creates it , word by word , gesture by gesture , to a degree that seems humanly impossible .
When I ask him how this works , he is open and adamant .
“ Did I get every syllable right ? ” he says .
“ No , probably not .
But that ’s the gist of it .
That ’s how she spoke .
Those are her inflections .
And if it ’s not exactly word for word , it ’s certainly nobody else , and it ’s certainly not my words in her mouth .
Was there sun streaming in that day , the actual day that she told me about her marriage ?
Was the sun at a 47 - degree angle ?
How the fuck would I know ?
But that ’s my memory of that period with my mother painting , when the sun was low in the sky like that .
I took a sky from one of hundreds of days that were all the same .
But that ’s the painting .
I have it downstairs in my house .
That ’s the smell , that turpentine smell .
If it was n’t Tosca on the stereo it was La Traviata .
“ The thing with memoir is that it ’s not court stenography , and it should n’t be .
We have video for that .
We have YouTube for that .
And I do n’t understand the criticism .
This is not a trial , where I ’m recounting a murder and every action must be photographed and documented and measured with a tape measure .
It ’s a life .
“ It ’s a very peculiar fixation .
It ’s like asking the orange : ‘ Why ?
Why do you have the pits ?
Why are n’t you smooth like the apple ?
Why ?
Why do you have to have the little indentations ?
No one licks the indentations , no one hides anything in the indentations , it ’s not like those little indentations are useful .
Why do you have them ? ’ ”
Burroughs , it should be said , does seem to have an uncanny knack for voices .
I notice that , whenever he tells a story about his father , he drops into an impromptu little Dad impression : a slow , low , doltish voice with a southern accent .
( “ Wul , son , y’know , long time ago .
Dud n’t matter . ” )
When I ask him if this is really what his father sounded like , instead of answering normally , he breaks eye contact , and his gaze drifts into some kind of wormhole several light - years behind my left ear , and he answers my question by channeling his father himself :
“ Uh , uh , a better … impression , uh , of my father , ” he says , in a halting , flat voice .
“ Wou - would , would , would be — like I say , uh , a better , impression , of my fa — if I were to try , if I were to attempt an impression of my father . ”
He keeps staring blankly at the wall of the restaurant .
“ What I would do , first , primarily , is , A , I would try to — attempt — the cadence , with which he spoke .
And then further if I was , again , engaging in this impression of my father , B , I would try — and though I may fail , like I say , I would try , but I may fail , to imitate : the tone , of his voice . ”
His eyes click back over to mine .
“ That ’s my father , ” he says .
A Wolf at the Table is essentially the prequel to Running With Scissors , although it ’s significantly more painful and probably two - thirds less funny .
It tells the story of the young Augusten ’s suffering at the hands of his sadistic father , a dry - lipped , black - toothed , lesion - plagued professor of logic and ethics .
( He died three years ago . )
The book swings between scenes of pathos and terror .
Preadolescent Augusten , desperate for affection , stuffs his father ’s old clothes with pillows and cuddles with them at night ;
Dad murders Augusten ’s guinea pig , magically retrains the family dog to be vicious , and tries to kill his son in a car accident .
Burroughs often describes his writing in therapeutic terms , as “ venting , ” or “ swatting branches out of the way in a dense forest ” ; often , his books begin as journal entries ( Dry was harvested from an 1,800 - page computer file called “ mess , collected ” ) , and they tend to have the strengths and weaknesses of a diary :
They can be artless , repetitive , meandering , and mawkish , but also immediate , heartfelt , connective , and sympathetic .
I talk to Burroughs ’s older brother , John Elder Robison , about his brother ’s version of events .
Although he and Burroughs grew up largely apart , they are now neighbors in Amherst .
Robison tells me , in a voice that sounds 100 percent identical to Burroughs ’s impression of it , that he and his brother are opposites .
Owing to his Asperger ’s , he tends to be “ flat and logical , ” while Burroughs is “ entirely governed by emotion . ”
( As Burroughs later puts it , “ My brother has the emotion of an IBM laptop computer . ” )
Because of this , they often experience the same events in radically different ways .
Still , Robison insists that his brother is honest .
“ I really feel strongly that people are critical of my brother because he ’s so emotional .
But that absolutely does not mean it ’s made up .
Just because somebody dramatizes the emotional content of something in their mind does not make it false . ”
Burroughs ’s mother has said that she , too , remembers some things differently .
She ’s currently working on her own memoir .
Robison published his , Look Me in the Eye , last year .
After dinner , Burroughs and I walk in continuous disorienting loops around the Village while he extracts more baubles from his memory - hoard .
We pass his favorite independent bookstore , which is now a Chase bank .
He tells me about the time he met Academy Award winner Linda Hunt while holding a fresh handful of dog feces .
( “ And I ’m thinking , ‘ Okay , so what are the chances of just an average guy meeting any Academy Award winner in his life ?
And what are the chances further of meeting that Academy Award winner while holding dog shit ?
And what are the chances that they would be the only dwarf Academy Award winner ? ’
It just seemed spectacular . ” )
We pass a real - estate agency that used to be a corner store with an oddly distinctive smell — like “ sour milk and earth , ” he says , “ but somehow neither . ”
I ask Burroughs what memoir he ’s going to write next .
Growing up with his brother ?
Nursing his bulldog back from a spinal injury ?
Overcoming his addiction to M&Ms ?
He says he might be done .
He wants to go back to fiction , which he says always feels like an adventure .
( His first book was the novel Sellevision , which he wrote in seven days . )
“ I ’ll always write about myself .
I just do n’t know if I ’ll always publish what I write . ”
I ask what this novel might be about .
“ I should write about the son of a Connecticut senator who writes about a dysfunctional childhood living with a psychiatrist , ” he says .
“ It would be very postmodern . ”
Five days after our last meeting , I send Burroughs an e-mail thanking him for his time and warning that I might have some follow - up questions .
He responds , quickly , to say that he enjoyed it , then adds , apparently as an afterthought : “ what ’s that little white dot on your front left tooth ?
a filling ? ” I ’m impressed :
The bottom half of that tooth is fake , a mutual gift from my older brother and the concrete edge of our apartment complex ’s swimming pool when I was 8 .
One little spot stands out .
I have n’t noticed or thought about it in years .
I write back and tell him so .
As I wait for a response , I start to wonder about his motives .
Was he actually curious , or was this just some kind of guerrilla - marketing campaign to tout his astounding powers of observation and recall ?
Again , he writes back quickly , recommending that I see his dentist : “ of course , it ’s not like you have some glaring tooth problem .
it ’s a tiny thing .
most people would n’t even notice .
just like most people might notice your glasses ?
but not that they say Nautica along the temple . ”
I take off my glasses :
It ’s true .
This is also impressive , but a little flagrantly calculated for my taste .
I begin to doubt his powers altogether .
For all I know , he ’s just memorized a couple of trivial details in order to unleash them on me at exactly this kind of strategic moment .
Now that he ’s being brazen , I decide to test him :
What else does he remember ?
He responds with a detailed 1,200 - word recap of our time together : exact phrases we spoke at specific intersections and the cars that passed as we said them ; which hand I ’d used to straighten my notes at the table ; the names of my children ; the design of my watch face and wedding ring ( “ either white gold or platinum … two ridges , or channels — one on top , one on the bottom ” ) .
Having been there myself , and having just relived the entire experience via five hours of recorded conversation , I find his account ( although he gets a word or two wrong ) very persuasive .
He even remembers a story I told him about fainting from dehydration in a grocery store in the middle of Queens .
He admits that , as I was telling it , he was doubting some of its details , wondering if I ’d allowed myself to embellish the story over the years , eventually even revising my memory to match the more dramatic version .
And he was right : I had .
By firing its actuarial consultant last week , the New York State Legislature shone a light on one of the public sector ’s deepest secrets :
All across the country , states and local governments are promising benefits to public workers on the basis of numbers that make little economic sense .
The numbers are off - base for a variety of reasons .
Sometimes there is a glaring conflict of interest , as there was in Albany , where the consultant was being paid by the workers seeking richer benefits .
More often , there is subtle pressure on the actuary to come up with projections that make the pension fund look good .
Most of all , public pension actuaries use old methods that have fallen far out of sync with the economic mainstream .
That does not necessarily mean their figures are wrong , but it does make them vulnerable to distortion , misunderstanding and abuse .
“ Financial burdens have been hidden ” as a result , said Jeremy Gold , a New York actuary and economist who was one of the first to call attention to the gap between actuarial figures and economic reality .
Many economists now agree with Mr. Gold , saying they believe actuaries are routinely underestimating the cost of providing governmental pensions by as much as a third .
I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THAT IT takes two hours to jog around the periphery of the Mall of America , the nation ’s largest indoor shopping center in Bloomington , Minnesota .
The two hours includes circumnavigating the mall ’s 520 stores along with its 20,000 parking spaces , which are mostly contained within orbital rings of monumentally sized parking garages .
I began this run early in the morning and , during my circuit , saw one other human being : a man with a cigarette standing against the largest expanse of brick wall I had ever seen .
Near him was a door with no doorknob .
From the depths of the parking garages , a few car alarms pulsed , some near , some far , like foghorns .
The wind that pours through the loading docks of the Mall of America is fearsome .
It slowed my progress considerably .
When I returned to my room in the Ramada Inn — which required crossing fourteen lanes of traffic — it was almost time for my keynote address at the twenty - first annual North American Hazardous Materials Management Conference .
I do n’t believe its organizers intended to make an ironic statement with their choice of venue .
They seemed a sincere , overworked lot .
They probably figured that the continent ’s hazardous - materials managers might appreciate the chance to get an early start on holiday shopping .
Ten years ago , I published a book called Living Downstream that was about , among other things , hazardous materials .
Ever since , I ’ve received invitations to speak about the topic .
Wherever I go , I do two things .
One , I look up the Toxics Release Inventory for my host - community ’s zip code .
I study the location of the dumps , the routine chemical emissions , the accident reports , the off - site transfers , the permitted releases .
And then , once I get there , I run .
Both rituals are ways of paying attention .
When I run , I can feel the slope of the land under my feet and figure out how water flows here .
I notice the decrepit apple tree that means this subdivision was once an orchard .
I notice the aluminum smelter ’s proximity to the floodplain .
Sometimes the names of streets — Creamery Road — provide clues .
Sometimes a windbreak of trees does .
Even when I ’m completely confounded — I cannot tell you how groundwater flows beneath the Mall of America — I discover something amazing .
Once , in Livonia , Michigan , while running beside glass office complexes with glabrous names like Techtron and VisTaTech , I veered off toward a small scrim of woods .
Within it , three derelict buildings flanked a derelict tennis court , its green surface shattered by sprouting trees .
One of the buildings was entirely filled with chairs .
The other was entirely filled with bicycles .
Birds flew in and out of slumping holes in the roofs .
DURING THESE TEN YEARS of running and speaking , I ’ve noticed two opposing trends .
The first is that people increasingly believe that their health is affected by hazardous materials in the environment .
And they know a lot more about hazardous materials .
Pesticides in strawberries .
Lead in lipstick .
Bisphenol A in water bottles .
But there is decreasing knowledge about the actual environment itself .
Public awareness is specific to chemicals in consumer products — which are produced elsewhere ( increasingly China ) and brought into our homes .
The location of those homes on former orchards ( where arsenical pesticides were used ) or near old toxic - dump sites ( where drums of solvents were buried ) — these matters seem blurrier and blurrier to the folks in my audiences .
In fact , I ’ve had to start explaining the word “ Superfund , ” as it does n’t seem to ring any real bells for a lot of people — including people in communities where Superfund sites are present .
( Superfund sites are the nation ’s worst toxic - waste sites .
There are 1,305 of them , and they are named for the “ super ” fund of money put together by Congress in 1980 to clean them up , a trust that went bankrupt five years ago . )
I was recently invited to Rockford , Illinois , to speak about toxic chemicals .
That seemed appropriate because Rockford is the site of a longstanding Superfund site .
Solvents used by former businesses had drizzled into drinking water wells .
Rockford is famous within toxicology circles because of the bladder - cancer cluster that was discovered here and because it was here where researchers figured out , in the 1980s , that the level of solvents in human blood is predicted not by the amount of water drunk from the tap but by the length of “ shower run times . ”
In other words , inhalation is a bigger route of exposure to solvent - contaminated drinking water than drinking it , and showering provides the biggest dose .
And yet only two people in my college audience knew about these studies — or even knew that Rockford had a Superfund site .
Even the local emergency - room physician had n’t heard the news .
WHAT ’S INDUCING THIS EPIDEMIC of environmental amnesia ?
Maybe one contributor is the long silence of the federal government on environmental catastrophes of all kinds .
In the breach , activist groups have tried to protect the public .
In need of positive messages and deliverable results , they focus on individual solutions .
Do n’t microwave in plastic .
Buy organic .
There is no place in that discussion for the barrels of waste buried atop the aquifer .
The very mention of them fills a room with paralyzing despair .
Or maybe we ’re now spending so much more time with consumer objects than with our natural environments that we have forgotten how to think about them .
Sport water bottles are real to us — polycarbonate ?
or stainless steel ? — but creekbeds are fuzzy concepts .
Or maybe our unremembering is a wall against grief .
My own elementary school — along with the field , playground , and wooded path to the crosswalk — was razed years ago to make way for discount shopping .
I have steadfastly refused to frequent that part of town .
But when my son needed a haircut for my father ’s funeral , I found myself driving my old walking route to school , in search of a salon open on a Monday .
It was supposed to be in here somewhere .
While navigating the service roads , I tried hard to forget .
But while my son was being pumped up in his pneumatic chair , I saw reflected in the mirror a retaining wall at the edge of the parking lot .
I know that pattern of stones .
I looked at them every day during math .
I was standing in my fifth grade classroom .
And the military recruiting center next door would have been the lunchroom .
And that drive - through over there was the field where , every recess , my sister and Danelle and I ran , circling and whinnying like wild , wild horses .
Dems to Clinton : Do n't Say Anything to Hurt Us A Democrat compares Clinton to the Glenn Close stalker in " Fatal Attraction . "
May 12 , 2008  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , pressed her campaign ahead of Tuesday 's West Virginia primary as Democratic Party leaders warned her not to do or say anything that could hurt Democratic front - runner Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , in November .
Clinton is considered likely to win West Virginia 's primary , perhaps by as many as 30 percentage points , but the victory in the small state is not expected to shake Obama 's apparent hold on the party 's nomination .
What Democrats fear could have a lasting impact is what Clinton might say about Obama that could split the party or be gleefully reused by Republican John McCain in the fall election .
Rep . Steve Cohen , D - Tenn , an Obama supporter , compared Clinton to the Glenn Close character in " Fatal Attraction " -- a spurned woman turned stalker who was apparently drowned in a bathtub only to jump up one more time to be shot dead .
" Glenn Close should have stayed in that tub , and Sen. Clinton has had a remarkable career and needs to move to the next step , which is helping elect the Democratic nominee , " Cohen said during a local TV interview .
He later apologized for his comments .
Onetime Democratic contender John Edwards was more delicate in his warning that Clinton be careful how she campaigns in the few remaining primaries .
" She has to be really careful she 's not damaging our prospects , the Democratic Party and our cause for the fall , " Edwards said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
But there 's also the message former President Bill Clinton delivers to blue collar white voters as he makes his way throughout West Virginia , painting Obama and his supporters as looking down on these voters .
" They make a lot of fun of me because I like to campaign in places like this , " he told a small - town crowd in West Virginia this weekend .
" They said I had been exiled to rural America , as if that were a problem . "
A big decision Hillary Clinton must make as she goes forward is whether to spend money from her campaign , which is already in debt , to run negative TV ads against Obama .
Right now she 's on TV in West Virginia , Kentucky and Oregon , but the ads are all positive .
Will she pull the trigger and run ads trashing the man who is all but certain to be her party 's nominee ?
Clinton spent her third day out of the last five days stumping in West Virginia , but her own optimism may have slipped at times .
In the town of Eleanor , W. Va. , Sunday night , it was n't clear whether Clinton tripped over a pronoun or was trying to score points with women voters .
" All the kitchen table issues that everybody talks to me about are ones that the next president can actually do something about , if he actually cares about it , " she said at a rally .
" He " ?
She caught herself .
" More likely , if she cares about it , " Clinton added .
Publicly , Clinton rejected any suggestion that she drop out and quoted Eleanor Roosevelt , saying , " A woman is like a tea bag .
You never know strong she is until she is in hot water . "

Gwen Stefani is the beautiful lead singer for No Doubt and has had a successful solo career .
We ’ve all had that moment when we sense that things are about to change .
For Gwen Stefani that epiphany occurred as a high school senior in Orange County .
‘ I remember being this 17 year - old girl , in love and really excited about my future with the boy that I thought was going to be my husband and we ’d have babies and that , ‘ she pauses , ‘ was my passion .
Then I learned that I could write songs and that is when my life changed .
I went from being this really passive girl to ‘ Oh my God .
This makes me feel so powerful when I write these words . ’
It was such a turning point to find that I had a talent and I had something to contribute , somewhere . ”
Gwen Stefani was married at a London church for her September 14th 2002 nuptials to Gavin Rossdale , but arrived an hour late .
“ I ’m just an Orange County girl from a loving family making music with my friends .
It ’s not really that big of a deal .
Writing songs is super intimate .
It ’s a bit like getting naked . ”
“ I ’ve never considered myself a great singer .
To be honest , it ’s kind of nasally and piercing and I have no range . ”
