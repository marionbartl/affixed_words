It has been a few months since I ’ve done a thorough analysis of the California housing and economic situation .
Given the current changes I think it warrants another close look .
The last article I did regarding California with an in depth perspective laid out 10 reasons why I thought California would not face a housing bottom until May of 2011 .
Since August , all of the reasons laid out in the assessment have only accelerated and thus cement the target date for a bottom .
In addition , I was simply flabbergasted on Monday when the market had its 4th worst point tumble on record .
In fact 13 of the 20 top point drops on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have occurred in 2008 :
Now of course the above data may not say much given that the Dow is higher as well so it only goes with logic that the biggest point declines will happen as time goes by .
But make no mistake , yesterday was the 12th biggest percent decline and that does signify a big drop :
The Dow has seen 4 of the top 20 percent declines occur in 2008 .
This is significant .
Let us run a quick tally from the top 20 percent down days :
2008 : 4
1929 : 3
1987 : 2
1933 : 2
1932 : 2
1899 : 1
1907 : 1
1931 : 1
2001 : 1
1997 : 1
1937 : 1
1899 : 1
Out of the top 20 percent declines on the Dow , 2008 is the winner which should give you a perspective on the volatility we have been witnessing on the market .
And the news for the decline yesterday was simply a statement of the most obvious .
That yes , we are in fact in a recession .
It was incredible that there were a large number of people in the market still believing that somehow beyond all logic and sense of reason that the market was somehow not technically in a recession .
The National Bureau of Economic Research stated that we have been in a recession since December of 2007 .
Even though we had positive GDP growth in Q1 and Q2 of this year this was a pseudo bounce based on the Uncle Sam American Express voucher program that provided a bit of stimulus to the country .
So we ’ve been in a recession for a year but certainly the problems go back even further beyond that .
The Governator announced to the newly minted politicians on Monday that California is now officially in a fiscal emergency .
He had called for a special session trying to resolve the issue but lame duck politicians were on “ fact finding ” junkets or simply playing hide the salami while Rome burned .
These are the people leading our state which is the most powerful economic engine in the 50 states of the union .
What an absolute disgrace .
These people are getting 6 - figure salaries and the only job they have is to represent the populace and they ca n’t seem to even get that right .
Our deficit is ballooning each and every day and budget analysts are saying that we may be broke by February .
I ’d argue that we are already broke but to many debt is the same as wealth .
Today , a group of Governors including Arnold are meeting with President - elect Obama for what I would imagine should be a fascinating spectacle of who can hold out the largest tin-can .
The state budget deficit is gigantic .
To first understand this mess , you have to follow the money :
Keep in mind these are estimates .
A state as large as California with expenses over $ 100 billion is no small thing .
But anyone can quickly look at the above pie chart and understand we are in serious trouble .
The two biggest sources of revenue for the state are personal income tax and sales tax .
These 2 areas make up 71 % of all revenue sources .
Well , you can already see the problem arising here .
First , as much as people want to believe that Black Friday was somehow going to resurrect the economy one day does not make a trend .
People are not spending as much and subsequently sales tax revenues are going to shock us on the downside .
In terms of the personal income tax , well you can pretty much kiss a large portion of that goodbye .
High paying bubble jobs like real estate agents , mortgage brokers , financial analysts , construction workers , car salesmen , and others in the FIRE economy are no longer going to be paying Uncle Arnold their chunk of gravy train day salary .
The personal income tax damage will be obvious come Q1 and Q2 of 2009 .
In addition , those that have no job are literally paying zero into this pot and we are having more and more fall into this category especially here in California that now has the 3rd highest unemployment rate in the nation :
You can expect this number to shoot up even further .
JP Morgan recently announced that they ’ll be slashing 19,000 WaMu employees , many in Seattle but California has the largest number of retail money spigots which I ’m sure will see their cuts .
I remember walking into a WaMu once and a mortgage broker / lender / financial analyst / life guru wanted to sign me up for a pay Option ARM because the cheap payments were “ awesome ” and I ’d love it .
So the repercussions are going to be fierce , long , and severe .
These folks also are n’t consuming .
Some of the biggest consumers of urban tanks , granite countertops , and all other things that carry heavy sales tax price tags were people in the bubble economy .
Guess what ?
They are taking a double hit to the two biggest items of revenues for California , personal income tax and sales tax .
You may think there are n’t many agents or brokers in California but I suggest you look at this graph :
Now you tell me , what industries are going to absorb these folks ?
Even if they get positions in retail , that is a big cut in their paycheck .
The government is n’t hiring as much because guess what , we are flat broke !
Our politicians are going to be forced to grow a spine here .
You have some puritans on both sides .
Some say “ we ’ll never raise taxes ” yet do n’t give ideas on how to solve the economic problems of the state because if they do slash , they ’ll simply create longer lines of the unemployed .
Others say , “ raise taxes on everyone ” yet fail to realize that there is n’t much taxes to raise now that people are getting hammered .
There has to be a balanced approach and this will simply help us through the period .
There is no easy way out of this folks .
A decade of financial decadence is coming home with a very expensive bill .
Maybe we ’ll think about instituting a constitutional amendment that when times are good , the state be forced to collect extra money and set it aside for financial emergencies like the one we are currently facing .
But politics is n’t exactly a logical business .
You would think that the best time to raise taxes is when everyone is fat and pigging out at the easy money buffet .
Instead , regulations disappear and crony capitalism takes a hold of the entire economy and we spend every nickel that comes in .
In addition , many of these people will need to be retrained for new jobs and public colleges are cutting back on enrollments or raising fees .
Another whammy on this group .
The few industries that are still hiring like engineering , healthcare , and accounting require a specific skill set .
This is n’t like taking an online video course and getting your DRE real estate license in one week .
Even to become a nurse , you ’ll have to go to a community college full - time for 18 to 24 months .
California is the heart of darkness when it comes to this economic disaster .
We had the highest priced real estate and the largest number of highly paid bubble blowers benefitting from a once in a lifetime gig .
It is like hitting 10 blackjacks in a row .
At a certain point , you start thinking that you have control over the game until you bust 15 times in a row .
Let us look at the county with the largest population in California , Los Angeles to see exactly what is transpiring .
Los Angeles County has 88 cities and 10,000,000 people call the place home .
In terms of diversity , Los Angeles is it .
You have extremely prime areas like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica and other areas on the other side of the spectrum like Compton or Lynwood .
Yet during the bubble even non-prime areas saw outrageous price increases mostly fueled by subprime or toxic lending pushed by greedy lenders who were puppets for Wall Street and blinded by their own ambition .
Let us look at the Los Angeles median home price over this time :
* Click for sharper image
The L.A. median home price topped out at $ 550,000 in August of 2007 .
I know that it seems like a lot longer ago but only a year ago , were we sitting at the mountaintop .
Now , the median home price for the county is $ 355,000 .
A drop of nearly $ 200,000 in one year .
How would you feel if you bought at that $ 550,000 peak and now knew your home was only able to fetch $ 355,000 ( if that ) on the open market ?
I can tell you how many are feeling .
Many are simply walking away from their homes .
When I say walking away I do n’t mean that they leave on their first miss payment .
In fact , idiotic legislation like SB 1137 simply kicks the shiny empty Coke can down the road a few more months and allows many people to stay rent free in a home they clearly cannot afford .
They will walk in droves next year .
I ’ve talked with a few contacts in the industry and they are telling me that if you have a 720 credit score and 25 % down you can get a loan at 5.25 % up to $ 725,000 .
Yet the traffic is not there .
Why ?
Because how many people today have $ 181,000 sitting around for a down payment on a home ?
Also , you have to have debt - to - income ratios that keep you under 37 % so let us take that $ 725,000 home and run the numbers :
Down payment : $ 181,000
Mortgage 30 - year fixed ( 5.25 % ) : $ 3,003 ( Principal and Interest )
Taxes and Insurance : $ 755
Total monthly payment ( PITI ) : $ 3,758
Needed net monthly income : $ 10,156
You will need a monthly net income of $ 10,156 to afford this home even after putting $ 181,000 down if we want to keep the 37 % DTI ratio with net income .
Yes , you ’ll have tax deductions but keep in mind that monthly nut of $ 3,758 comes out of your monthly cash flow stream .
You reap the rewards when you do your taxes .
But let us not get caught up in missing the bigger picture .
There is such a tiny amount of people in California that fall within this range that it is comical .
That is why sales have fallen .
People are missing the point .
It is all about income and jobs .
It always was about this .
If the median U.S. income was $ 100,000 I assure you we would n’t be having this discussion .
But the fact of the matter is the median income is only $ 46,000 .
Many are now losing even that median income job .
That ’ll depress wages and home prices further .
And California had this incestuous relationship with housing .
That is , many of the high paying jobs simply existed as a leech to the bubble .
Now that the host is gone the vector can no longer survive in the current ecological system .
That is simply a fact .
Even with all these foreclosure moratoriums and hackneyed responses to the bubble , the foreclosure rate is still through the roof :
* Click for sharper image
When this year comes to a close , 2008 will have the highest number of foreclosures we have ever seen .
Take a look at the above chart .
This chart includes bailouts , the Hope Now Alliance which I actually called up 1 year ago , foreclosure moratoriums , Ben Bernanke dropping rates like there was no tomorrow , and every other gimmick in the world .
Yet foreclosures are still at record highs .
The reason all the programs have failed is because they do n’t explore the household income side of the equation .
So long as the unemployment rate keeps increasing , we should n’t even begin to discuss a bottom .
And even when it levels out , we should take a deep look at the jobs that are growing .
The last thing we want is what happened in 2000 when nearly 30 percent of all job growth happened in the finance , insurance , and real estate economy .
California is at the epicenter of all this .
In fact , California alone made up over 20 % of all nationwide foreclosure activity last month .
And this is including every gimmick you can imagine .
Just wait until Q1 and Q2 of 2009 .
That is when the tsunami of pay option ARMs will recast , plus we ’ll have the SB 1137 zombies coming to life , and finally the grim tax revenues that unless we have a 100 % stock market run up , is certainly going to show us a very poor state indeed .

APPLE VALLEY , Minn. , Dec. 24 ( UPI ) --
A teacher on leave from a private high school in Minnesota faces charges she had a sexual relationship with a 17 - year - old girl who had been her student .
Authorities said Melissa Diana Koehn , 30 , of Kenosha , Wis. , was charged by the Dakota County Attorney 's office Tuesday with three felony counts of fourth - degree criminal sexual conduct and freed on $ 10,000 bail , the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Wednesday .

An Apple Valley police officer said he found Koehn and the teen kissing in a car in a parking lot near a soccer field Saturday and became suspicious because of the apparent age difference between the two .
He notified the girl 's parents and turned the case over to a detective .
Koehn had been the teen 's teacher and coach last year at St. Croix Lutheran High School in West St. Paul , authorities said .
She continued to see the girl after starting her leave of absence from the school in June , sometimes sleeping over at the teen 's home , police said .
The girl still attends the school .
According to the criminal complaint , the girl 's parents told authorities they believed she had slept on the floor of their daughter 's bedroom and were unaware of any sexual activity .
Under Minnesota law , 16 is the age of consent for a sexual relationship .
However , teachers , coaches or others in position of authority over a young person are prohibited from sexual contact with someone age 16 or 17 .
Her next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 9 in Hastings .

" Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard . "
~ H.L. Mencken
America is a majority being ruled by a corrupt venal minority .
We may have been taught that we are under a government " of the people , by the people , for the people . "
But our original Republican principles and laws are straining to keep us from careening toward the precipice of Absolute Democracy .
What happens when the Common Man meets Sam Adams ?
If you were to Google " Sam Adams " you might get the impression that America is a little more interested in beer than liberty — at least by one level in the search results .
The original Sam Adams was not a tea teetotaler .
George Washington was a purveyor of fine rye whiskey .
Yet , one came to be recognized as the Father of the American Revolution and the other the Father of his country .
Neither was a common man per se .
But both believed with every fiber of their being that the common man should live in freedom — enough to risk being hung by George III .
Sam Adams was the kind of person feared most by tyrants .
He was the one , who , like the prophet Nathan , would speak the truth to power regardless of the consequences .
He incessantly agitated for Revolution .
Adams was also smart enough to avoid being murdered by the British before he could foment his Revolution — quite a feat when one considers that the enemy was everywhere around him [ just like today ] and looked almost exactly like him .
Mainly , he was the type of writer and orator who could make the common man understand the " real deal . "
Obviously he was prone to self - replicate .
George III may have been crazy but he had the prescience to know what one man like Adams might accomplish .
How does the Common Man get to know Sam ?
Since my days in the Navy I have had scant experience with alcoholic beverages .
I would n’t know one beer from another .
Wine is still a mystery to me .
I prefer grape juice so far .
But I do know something about bottled water .
There is an annual International Water Tasting in West Virginia , and I have been there to experience it and learn the differences between all kinds of water ; bottled , foreign , natural spring water , municipal , sparkling , etc .
A water tasting is not unlike a wine tasting .
Trained participants take a bite of a soda cracker between samples to reestablish a baseline taste in their mouths .
Then they evaluate each one in a double - blind taste test , writing down their impressions .
This is all quite serious and training is provided by Arthur von Wiesenberger , who is , perhaps , to the world of water , what Julia Child was to that of fine cuisine .
A jury of 12 tasters is typical .
The differences between a heavily chlorinated municipal water and Perrier are not so subtle .
But with a little training from Arthur , tasters quickly become adept at differentiating between very similar entries in each category .
The soda crackers help immensely .
Any ordinary citizen can get to know Sam Adams in a hurry if he has a frame of reference that can be trusted — and he is given the necessary Media and Education .
Right now he is getting a taste of tyranny and government corruption .
He is being told that " the rules " he was playing by , are not only changed , they are now permanently in flux without Any accountability .
The MSM and Academe are locking ranks to woo all of us back into complacency .
But what have they to offer us now ?
The more they try to pretend and prop up this regime and its corrupt paradigm , the more ridiculous they make themselves .
Send in the Clowns .
In times such as these , with the incestuous relationship between the Federal Reserve and the " government " hanging out all over the place , it would be far better for all of us to read Sam Adams and company than to listen to the Siren Song of Obama or his bankster handlers .
To Sam , English Monarchy was the focus of tyranny , to Rothbard , it was the State : " … nothing more nor less than a bandit gang writ large . "
Our soda cracker , our baseline , can be almost anything but the establishment media or government - controlled or funded education .
In short , any medium that is entirely uncritical of corrupt government is of little use to anyone who loves liberty .
So we all need exposure to Quality Alternative Information — Alternative Media — Alternative Education .
A few sites I suggest : LEXREX.com , Antiwar.com , WarIsARacket.com , Mises.org , JamTheCulture.com , LewRockwell.com .
At LEXREX.com
I have posted a compendium entitled " The American Ideal of 1776 , " where we can go for free and get his liberty baseline reactivated from time to time .
We can bite off a piece ; ruminate a while , and go back for more whenever we are ready .
Spaced repetition is the key .
In addition I have recently made an Audio CD of " The Law " by Bastiat — so the usually busy American family can listen while they work , drive or play .
By the way , if you do n’t think you ’ve been brainwashed — it worked .
The key is to take over the task of auto - brainwashing .
If you do n’t know the power of Bastiat you are in for a refreshing drink indeed .
Read it free here .
" The Politics of Obedience : The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude " by Étienne de La Boétie is also of great value as we continue to transform the common man into the not - so - common man .
The edition linked above includes an excellent preface by Murray Rothbard .
We should get enough of a foundation in some of the previously mentioned sources so that you can refute any argument coming from Left , Right or Center .
Then sample what ’s out there and compare it to our own well - digested compendium of liberty .
At first we will probably need to spend more time with the primary source documents of our original American political philosophy .
But after we really get to know " Sam " — we become more and more dangerous to tyrants and sycophants of any kind — in any place or time .
Remember , if what you are reading is not critical of the status quo you should be reading more of something else .
As I have said before , watch Ron Paul .
He takes the argument away from his opponent and tries to direct the discourse to sound political doctrine — and especially sound economics and the Constitution .
Obviously you ca n’t do this within the controlled Media .
You must become as Guerilla - like as Ron Paul or Sam Adams .
It ’s quite interesting and entertaining .
For instance , go into the grocery store , and , when you are ready to pay , ask the clerk if she takes " coupons . "
She will usually say , " Sure ! " and ask you , " What kind do you have ? "
Then pull out some Federal Reserve Notes [ commonly but erroneously called " dollars " ] and offer them to her .
Many times she will be too tired or bored to engage you .
Occasionally you will stumble across a budding libertarian .
" It only takes a spark to get a fire going . "
Think back to the seemingly insignificant events that added up to your own Epiphany .
We are not so used to gleaning from what we read as they were back in the 18th century .
But consider well [ chew thoroughly ] the words of Sam Adams below in one of his most famous quotes :
If men , through fear , fraud or mistake , should in terms renounce or give up any essential natural right , the eternal law of reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation .
The right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty , it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave .
~ Samuel Adams
The King , on realizing just how dangerous Sam Adams had become , assigned him the appellation : " The Grand Incendiary . "
Sam also said :
It does not require a majority to prevail , but rather an irate , tireless minority keen to set brushfires of freedom in the minds of men .
Ron Paul relates so well to ordinary citizens because he honors and respects the common man as did the best and brightest among the Founders and Framers .
He is disposed to explain and teach , and provide a consistent example .
He is worthy of emulation .
Join him in the Campaign for Liberty .
Historically , Liberty is The Road Less Taken :
The spirit of the times may alter , will alter .
Our rulers will become corrupt , our people careless .
A single zealot may commence persecutor , and better men be his victims .
It can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest and ourselves united .
From the conclusion of [ their ] war [ for independence , a nation begins ] going down hill .
It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support .
They will be forgotten , therefore , and their rights disregarded .
They will forget themselves but in the sole faculty of making money , and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights .
The shackles , therefore , which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of [ that ] war will remain on [ them ] long , will be made heavier and heavier , till [ their ] rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion .
~ Thomas Jefferson : Notes on Virginia Q.XVII , 1782 . (*) ME 2:225
According to Jefferson and others , and consistent with his words above , it is clear that we have no choice but to learn how to educate the common man and equip his mind for liberty .
He is becoming more aware of the abuse of power right now .
It ’s up to those of us who know something about liberty to offer him a timely taste of it .
Homework
Jefferson and Madison introduced a resolution at a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia , to recommend a short list of works every American should study as " embodying " the core American principles :
Whereas it is the duty of this board to the government [ of the United States ] under which it lives , and especially to that [ of Virginia ] of which this University is the immediate creation , to pay especial attention to the principles of government which shall be inculcated therein , and to provide that none shall be inculcated which are incompatible with those on which the Constitutions of this State , and of the U.S. were genuinely based in the common opinion : and for this purpose it may be necessary to point out specifically where these principles are to be found legitimately developed . . .

BBC News , Moscow
Russia has sent thousands of soldiers to strengthen security in Ingushetia Human rights activists and opposition politicians in Russia 's southern republic of Ingushetia have told the BBC that the predominantly Muslim region is now in a state of civil war .
It is reported that more than 800 people have been killed in an escalating conflict which originally spilt over from neighbouring Chechnya six years ago .
Ingushetia is a tiny region with a total population of just 300,000 .
" A lot of my human rights colleagues and politicians say it is now a civil war and I agree with that , " Magomed Mutsolgov , director of the Ingush Human Rights organisation Mashr , says .
" In my opinion it is a war between the security forces and the local population .
Many members of the security forces consider themselves above the law and the population outside the law , " he adds .
See detailed map of the region A low - level insurgency involving Muslim fighters escalated dramatically last year with a surge of attacks on the security forces and also on people who have moved into the region from other parts of Russia .
" From July or August last year there have been three or four attacks every week , " Tanya Lokshina , of Human Rights Watch , says .
She recently compiled a major report on Ingushetia .
" There are a few hundred insurgents in total who are Jihadists fighting to establish a Caliphate in the ( Caucasus ) region . "
Hamzat Gardanov was shot dead in August Moscow 's response has been heavy - handed , with reports that an extra 2,500 troops from outside Ingushetia were deployed in the republic last year to help crush what Russia sees as a Muslim rebellion .
But this has only added fuel to the fire which is driving ever more young Ingush men into the arms of the rebels .
' Destroying everything '
The military and other security services including the FSB , the successor to the KGB , have long stood accused of committing gross human rights violations against the Ingush population - such as kidnapping and torture .
But last year , according to Human Rights Watch , the security forces were also responsible for a wave of extra-judicial killings .
Human Rights
Watch says 40 people were killed without any proof they had anything to do with the insurgency .
Young men of 18 and 19 want to avenge these killings - for some it 's a Jihad against Russia
Jamaldin Gardanov
On a dirt track on the outskirts of the main town , Nazran , Jamaldin Gardanov showed me the spot where he says his brother Hamzat was shot through the head by a Russian soldier in August .
He told me Hamzat had been driving home with his cousin after buying some paint in town .
" My brother and his cousin were passing a checkpoint set up after a policeman was killed on the main road , " he said .
" The car turned down here ( into the dirt track ) and the security forces opened fire with intent to kill .
Jamaldin Gardanov with some of the children of his dead brothers " My brother died on the spot and his cousin ran off through the fields .
The police then fired on the fields for two hours destroying everything .
" I 'm 36 - years - old and far from being a fighter , but young men of 18 and 19 want to avenge these killings .
For some it's a Jihad against Russia , " he said .
Back at Jamaldin 's house we met Hamzat 's widow and her two children .
Jamaldin is now looking after them all .
Over lunch he showed me photographs of a raid on his house by Russian soldiers at the beginning of this month .
One of the pictures shows a young child standing outside the house in front of an armoured personnel carrier .
" My wife and children were standing outside for three hours as they searched our house , " he said .
" They claim we are all Wahhabis " , he said , " so we are being persecuted . "
Shocking video Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Jamaldin does come from a family of theologians and is deeply religious , but he strongly denies any links to radical Islam .
" The security forces have created the threat of Wahhabism as a cover for what they are doing here , " he said .
He then showed us some shocking clips of video stored on his mobile phone .
In the first we could see a close - up of a man 's head covered in blood .
This was another of Jamaldin 's brothers , 21 - year - old Adam .
Jamaldin says he was also shot dead by the security forces .
The widow of one of the brothers
The second mobile phone video shows the incident , which happened in the centre of Nazran , in February last year .
It was filmed by someone inside the main administration building , looking down on the square where Adam and a friend had been sitting in a car .
The video shows what looks very much like a soldier pulling the bodies from the vehicle .
Jamaldin says the prosecutor told him off the record that his brother Adam was " absolutely clean " , there was no reason for him to have been killed .
The family believes Adam may have been targeted simply because he was a devout Muslim who had studied in Egypt .
Torture victim Later , in a safe location , we met up with another victim of the security forces ' dirty war in Ingushetia .
23 - year - old Tamerlan could barely get out of the car when he arrived at our meeting - point .
He had just been released after being detained for six days by the security forces in the northern town of Maglobek .
He had been picked up with three friends following the murder of a policeman in the town .
When we got inside , he pulled up his jumper to reveal a cluster of deep bruises and cuts around his lower back .
He said he was also badly bruised on his upper thighs and he had marks on his wrists .
Tamerlan says he was tortured for 12 hours and lost consciousness " They tortured me from six in the morning to six in the evening , " he said .
" They put a sack over my head and beat me so badly I lost consciousness .
They put sharp implements under my nails .
I thought I was going to die , it was sadistic .
" They also tied my hands and feet together and hung me up - so I started to suffocate . "
He says the security forces were trying to get him to confess to involvement in the policeman 's murder but had to release him because he knew nothing about it .
He told me he had no connection with the rebels .
" Maybe they detained me because I 'm a Muslim and pray at the Mosque and my wife wears the Hijab , " he said .
According to the mainstream opposition leader Maksharip Aushev , this brutal treatment of the local population is not only swelling the ranks of the rebel fighters .
" People are coming to me all the time , saying let 's vote for independence , " he says .
" If we had a referendum , 80 % of the population would vote to leave Russia , " he adds .
In a sign of mounting panic back in Moscow , the Kremlin suddenly announced three weeks ago that the former KGB officer Murat Zyazikov , who had been in charge of Ingushetia since 2002 , was being replaced .
The new man is a career soldier , Yunus - Bek Yevkurov , who made his name during the wars in Chechnya .
He turned down our request for an interview .
The most senior politician in the region who was prepared to speak to us was the chairman of the local parliament 's security committee , Mukhtar Buzurtanov .
He said Yunus - Bek Yevkurov must bring the security forces under control and stop what he called their " illegal activities " .
But he also accused the rebels of trying to destabilise Russia , saying they were part of a radical Islamic movement which had moved into Ingushetia after the wars in Chechnya .
He added that more than 50 soldiers had been killed so far this year .
Other senior officials in the local government have been quoted as saying they have to mount security operations to eliminate the rebels because of the threat they pose to Moscow 's rule over the region .
The arrival of a new leader of Ingushetia who is a battle - hardened soldier and veteran of the Chechen conflict may sound ominous .
But the top opposition politician Maksharip Aushev holds out some hope that Yunus - Bek Yevkurov could improve the situation .
" The former leader Zyazikov was 100 % to blame ( for the situation ) .
The first thing ( new leader Yunus - Bek Yevkurov ) did was to invite us to meet him and he said he plans to stop the human rights abuses and tackle corruption .
At the moment we see no reason not to trust him . "
So far there have not been any signs of change and the violence and abuses have continued .
" We will give [ Mr Yevkurov ] a maximum of three months , " Mr Aushev says .
" We will support him if things change , if not it will go back to the situation as it was before . "

John McCain in 2000 on Robocalls : “ I promise you I have never and will never have anything to do with that kind of political tactic . ”

Sydney Ferries could be privatised within a year , the NSW government says .
Transport Minister David Campbell called on Wednesday for expressions of interest from the private sector to run Sydney Harbour 's ferry service .
" The private sector have said they can do better , ( there is an ) opportunity now for them to put their money where their mouth is , " Mr Campbell told reporters in Sydney .
He said the government would be looking for the best proposal , but not necessarily the cheapest .
" We 'll be looking to get the best service levels for commuters ... in terms of timetable , in terms of operation , in terms of on - time running , " Mr Campbell said .
The following analysis uses data provided by Prof. Jeffrey B. Lewis of UCLA who coauthored Residual Votes in the 2008 Minnesota Senate Race .
My analysis is entirely independent and not in anyway shape or form associated with the aforementioned individuals or institutions .
The data contains an exhaustive compilation of the revised Post Election Audit Review published by the Office of the Secretary of State in Minnesota .
I parsed the data and created the graphs shown below .
The three graphs immediately following this paragraph depict the number of votes gained or lost with respect to the total votes recorded for each precinct included in the audit .
The dots represent the change between the machine counted votes and hand recorded votes surveyed in the audit .
A dot located at ( 443 , 2 ) represents a gain of 2 votes by the given candidate in a precinct with 443 total votes .
Each approximation line uses a least - squares nonlinear regression for arbitrary fit functions as provided by Mathcad 's genfit ( ) function :
You 'll notice that the graphs range from 0 to 2,645 votes ; this is because the largest precinct surveyed in the audit contained just 2,645 votes .
The following functions correspond to the resulting regression 's interpolation .
The input x represents the number of votes in a given precinct .
Although it appears as though the first two terms cancel , the truncated three decimal numbers are in actuality much more precise :
The following graph illustrates the best fit regression functions , developed above , extrapolated out to include the vote totals of all 4,130 precincts statewide .
As of right now ( 12:55 AM CT 11/20 ) the Otstego precinct of Wright County currently leads the state in total votes with 6,621 .
I plan on rehashing this analysis with the current results of the recount within the immediate future .
Today Franken gained 43 votes as a result of today 's recount over the certified returns published on November 18th :
Nov. 18 Recount Change Coleman ( R ) 195,708 195,638 - 70 Franken ( D ) 180,950 180,923 - 27 Franken Net Gain : 43
Franken made up much of his ground in St. Louis County , as I have previously suggested , by gaining 40 votes and losing 16 .
St. Louis County has recounted just 77 of 232 precincts ( 33.18 % ) and has contributed to a 23 vote decrease in Coleman 's lead .
Overal , Franken gained votes in 50 precincts , and lost votes in 79 while Coleman gained votes in 40 precincts and lost in 92 .
While today 's result appears to be good news for Team Franken , the result of a Ramsey County lawsuit may be even better .
The Franken Campaign sued the St. Paul county for the names of voters whose absentee ballots had been rejected .
The presiding judge issued this statement : " With each passing hour , the Franken campaign is irreparably harmed in its efforts to ensure that each valid vote is properly counted . "
Franken 's attorneys said the ruling strengthens their case in other counties and with the canvassing board over the ongoing issue of " wrongfully " invalidated absentee ballots .
Taoiseach Brian Cowen has confirmed he is going to hold a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty after the Government secured the legal guarantees it had requested over ethical issues , taxation , neutrality and the retention of a commissioner .
The deal was finalised at a European summit in Brussels today .
However , the Government appears to have dropped its request to secure legally binding guarantees on workers rights in a new protocol that it will now seek to negotiate with its EU partners over coming months .
Following talks between Taoiseach Brian Cowen and British prime minister Gordon Brown in Brussels this morning a breakthrough over the extent of the legal guarantees offered to Ireland was achieved .
Speaking at a press conference in Brussels at lunchtime Mr Cowen said : " On the basis of today 's agreement ... I am prepared to go back to the Irish people next year . "
The Lisbon treaty was rejected by the Irish electorate in June .
French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was greatly satisfied that the Lisbon process had been relaunched .
“ The Irish will be consulted again , ” he said at a press conference where he lauded the bravery of Mr Cowen in aiming to ratify the treaty again before November .
Asked about the guarantees the Irish had achieved at the summit , Mr Brown said he believed people would be satisfied by the agreement of EU leaders .
“ I believe ( it is ) a successful attempt to ensure that the Irish concerns are taken note of but not disrupting the progress we made in Europe on the Lisbon treaty , ” he said .
Britain had raised an unexpected objection to the nature of some of the legal guarantees being sought by Mr Cowen , particularly to legally binding assurances about workers ’ rights .
The issue of workers ’ rights is particularly sensitive in Britain , which negotiated its own protocol to the Lisbon treaty to ensure the charter of fundamental rights could not override British domestic law .
EU sources said there were concerns that legally binding guarantees offered to Ireland on social rights could cause political problems in Britain .
When asked about workers rights and the Irish guarantees at a press conference , Mr Brown said all the red lines negotiated by the British in the Lisbon treaty remained .
The draft summit conclusions have now been amended to remove a statement offering the Government the necessary legal guarantees on social issues .
Instead , the conclusions contain language that now only offers assurances on workers rights .
“ In addition , the high importance attached to the issues , including workers rights , set out in paragraph ( d ) of annex II will be confirmed , ” says the amended set of summit conclusions .
The conclusions , which have now been finalised , also outline that that EU leaders have agreed to offer the “ necessary legal guarantees on the following three points :
as regards all member states , nothing in the Lisbon treaty makes any change of any kind to the extent or operation of the Union ’s competence in relation to taxation ;
the Lisbon treaty does not prejudice the security and defence policy of member states , including Ireland ’s traditional policy of neutrality , and the obligations of most other member states ;
a guarantee that the provisions of the Irish constitution concerning the right to life , education and the family are wholly unaffected by the conferral of legal status on the EU charter of fundamental rights by the Lisbon treaty and by the justice and home affairs provision of the treaty .
Speaking on RTÉ Radio this morning , the Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin insisted that the deal put forward by the Taoiseach had been decided upon as a result of listening to the will of the people of Ireland .
" What we 're endeavouring to do is reflect the wishes of the people as expressed through the ballot box and through the democratic process in a new situation and reflect that into agreements with the other countries because I 'm convinced that Irish people do n't want to hold up 26 other countries in Europe if we can get satisfaction on the issues that are important to the Irish people , " he said .
The Rhineland - Westphalia Institute for Economic Research ( RWI ) , a leading German economic research organization , said in a statement that Germany , Europe 's largest economy , would see gross domestic product ( GDP ) shrink 2 percent next year .
In September , RWI had forecast growth of 0.7 percent in Germany for 2009 , but downscaled this prediction after factoring in recent events in world - wide financial sectors .
" The reasoning is that the financial crisis is taking a wider toll on the economy than previously anticipated , " the Essen - based group said .
Unemployment to rise
The institute said when compiling its September economic situation report for Germany , indicators had been pointing towards a calming of financial markets , but that this calming had not eventuated .
German exports are set to fall
RWI said German exports would clearly weaken in 2009 , unemployment would increase and public revenue would drop .
The previous worst decline of the German economy came in 1975 , when the oil crisis pushed GDP down 0.9 percent .
World Bank makes dire prediction
RWI 's predictions echoed a World Bank report released Tuesday which significantly dimmed short - term economic prospects for developing countries and forecast the first contraction in world trade since 1982 .
The bank 's " Global Economic Prospects 2009 " report predicted world GDP growth for 2008 would stand at around 2.5 percent , but would drop to 0.9 percent next year .
" The global economy ( is ) transitioning from a long period of strong developing - country led growth to one of great uncertainty as the financial crisis in developed countries has shaken markets worldwide , " the report said .
Trade , exports down
Global trade will shrink 2.1 percent in 2009 , RWI said
The bank said developing countries would likely grow by 4.5 percent next year , down from 7.9 percent in 2007 , while growth in high - income countries like Germany would turn negative .
It also said world trade volumes were projected to contract 2.1 percent in 2009 , causing a significant drop in exports .
" Given the expected decline in global trade , both developed and developing countries need to resist the temptation to resort to protectionism , which would only prolong and deepen the crisis , " said Uri Dadush , Director of the World Bank 's Development Prospects Group .
Audio geeks and songwriters have another tool at their disposal : FourTrack , a well - designed app for the iPhone or iPod Touch that records , mixes and plays up to four tracks like a shrunken version of Pro Tools .
There 's no way it 'll replace your main recording setup , but then again , you can't put your main recording setup in your pocket .
FourTrack ( iTunes link ) is the work of Sonoma Wire Works , makers of the desktop recording software RiffWorks , and The Retronyms , makers of Recorder , the top- selling ( single - track ) recording software in the App Store .
After a few days of pre-release testing , we can safely say that this is asolid , functional app that justifies its $ 10 price formusicians and anyone else who messes around with audio despite – or perhaps because of – its rudimentary , four - track - like functionality .
Legend has it that Michael Jackson devised the ridiculously catchybassline for " Billie Jean " while sitting in a tree .
Maybe , if he'd had this , he could have written thewhole song up there .
The screenshot to the right represents the bulk of the application , where you can arm tracks to record , set playback levels and pans , activate the recording process or skip to any point in the song by tapping the progress bar or rolling the jog wheel .
Recording and mixing are a snap thanks to intuitivecontrols and a record switch that requires a sliding motion toprevent you from accidentally recording over a previous track .
While there 's no way to see waveforms , the app 'slive monitoring function lets you listen along to the one - to - three tracksyou 've already laid down , which gives enough of an indication of whereyou need to be within a given song .
There 's no gain control either ,
but at least you can monitor recording levels to check for clipping .
Each track can be as long as your device 's memory can handle , and the program can contain an unlimited number ofprojects .
We like that you never have to save – everything you record gets storedautomatically .
However , the iPhone / iPod Touch hardware is an occasional issue when it comes to recording .
TheiPhone 's built - in speaker is too soft to allow the program to be usedin any meaningful way without headphones , and not every pair ofheadphones has a skinny enough jack to fit into the first - generationiPhone .
Plus , there 's currently no way to use a high - quality mic , and the software does n't work on the first - generation iPod Touch – just second - generation models that can be used with a third - party microphone ) .
Each track gets stored as a separate , mono , 44.1 kHzWAV file that can be easily transferred to any computer on your WiFi network , another one of our favorite features .
With your iPhone or iPod Touch connected to your wireless network , activatethe WiFi Sync option to generate a URL to enter into your computer ' sbrowser .
Then you can download the four recorded tracks directly to your computerand into the audio editing software of yourchoice .
Another nice touch : FourTrack adds blank space to the beginning ormiddle of each WAV file , so that all you need to do is line them up inyour audio software with each track starting at the same time to put allof the tracks in sync with each other .
However , anypanning or mixing done on the phone gets lost during the transfer .
No big deal – this is a sketch pad , not a canvas .
Here 's a screenshot of the recording process :
Then it 's time to mix the levels and pan tracks left and right :
The song list displays your projects , lets you create new ones , and handles syncing over WiFi :
Songs can be relabeled at any time :
When you activate WiFi sync , the iPhone seeks permission to connect , and then it does – no muss , no fuss .
You can transfer the files onto your computer through a browser :

Tonight I ’m trying conciseness .
Editor ’s note : I failed .
I recently decided to test my git_remote_branch gem with Ruby 1.9 , for the heck of it .
Well , I was making sure it ran on a bunch of platforms : Windows , Ruby 1.8.7 and with the most recent Git version ( 1.6.0.2 , get it ) .
So it seemed fitting to check it out under Ruby 1.9 .
On Leopard , the only missing dependency to Ruby 1.9 is readline 5.2 .
This article will present the installation of both .
And help heat up your apartment .
Linux too
These instructions will mostly work on Linux as well ( tried on Ubuntu ) .
There will be a few minor differences though .
Make sure you download the original readline from the gnu site and patch it yourself ;
Uninstall older versions of Ruby1.9 ;
Make sure you have the basic dev tools installed , like gcc and make ;
Skip the part about installing Xcode :-)
Prerequisites
You first need to have the Apple developer tools installed on your mac .
They ’re available on your installation CD .
Put it in , run the installer .
It ’s pretty straightforward .
# in your terminal open / Volumes / Mac\ OS \ X\ Upgrade \ DVD / Optional \ Installs / Xcode\ Tools/XcodeTools.mpkg
If you do n’t compile your own stuff often , you may have to set up your PATH variable in your ~/.bash_profile .
# file ~/.bash_profile export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$ PATH "
Now , prepare a working directory to keep the source close to the corresponding executables .
# in your terminal sudo mkdir -p / usr / local / src sudo chgrp admin /usr / local / src sudo chmod - R 775 /usr/local/src cd /usr/local/ src
Once you ’ve set yourself up , if you do n’t care about the details , you can skip to the end for the Cliff ’s notes .
Installing readline
This one ’s not as straightforward as it could have been .
The gzipped readline library available on the gnu site is 12 patches behind .
It so happens that the 12th patch fixes a problem with compilation under OS X .
So I applied all 12 to the code and repackaged it .
The example uses that file , compiled by me .
You can also do do the patching by yourself if you so wish .
Here ’s where you can download the readline code :
So let ’s get on with the instructions to install readline from my patched package :
# in your terminal curl - O http://s3.amazonaws.com/webmat-public/readline-5.2-patch012.tar.gz md5 readline-5.2-patch012.tar.gz # should be a9f37d2a22d181f8c23c6a320907917d tar xzf readline-5.2-patch012.tar.gz cd readline-5.2-patch012 ./ configure -- prefix= /usr / local make sudo make install cd ..
Build Ruby 1.9
Build options
Note that here you have a few options as to how you want to distinguish your 1.9 stack from your main 1.8 one .
In the following example , I build Ruby with the ‘ 1.9 ’ suffix , which means all executables will be suffixed with 1.9 : ruby1.9 , gem1.9 , irb1.9 , rake1.9 and so on .
This approach is ideal for casual use of two versions side by side .
If you do n’t care about the details , skip right over the next paragraph .
The industrial approach would be to put ruby in a non standard directory and only add it to your path when you want to use that version ( or use the explicit path to invoke executables ) .
To go industrial , you can simply use the - - prefix= / usr / local / ruby1.9 option and then drop the -- program - suffix argument when you run configure for Ruby .
This setup is ideal if you really want to have a bunch of versions living side by side ( e.g. all 1.9 versions as well as 1.8.7 in addition to the current 1.8.6 ) .
Actual installation of Ruby 1.9
Pick the most recent version or Ruby 1.9 on the ftp server .
At the time of writing , 1.9.1 - preview1 is the most recent .
So , still from /usr / local / src :
# in your terminal curl - O ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-preview1.tar.gz tar xzvf ruby - 1.9.1-preview1.tar.gz cd ruby - 1.9.1 - preview1 ./ configure --prefix=/usr/local -- program - suffix=1.9 --enable - pthread --with-readline-dir=/usr / local -- enable - shared make sudo make install
Now you ’re about to see some of the funniest looking progress indicators around .
Ruby ’s about making the programmer happy , and it delivers even in the details !
Note : the recent source packages of Ruby1.9 automatically include the documentation , as the end of the make install attests .
Try Ruby 1.9
# in your terminal ruby1.9 -- version gem1.9 --version irb1.9
Once inside the Ruby interactive shell ,
# in irb1.9 RUBY_VERSION #=> " 1.9.1 " stabby = ->( msg= ' inside the stabby lambda ' ) { puts msg } stabby .
call # => " inside the stabby lambda " stabby .
call ' hello world ' # => " hello world "
Yep , Ruby 1.9 introduces the very cool stabby lambda syntax .
Ruby 1.8 ’s lambdas could n’t have optional parameters ( unless you fiddled with * args ) .
1.9 ’s stabby lambdas can , with a syntax as clean as a simple method definition , as you just experimented .
Now install the gems you use everyday ( or kindly make available to your peers ) and help make them 1.9 compatible .
For the sake of the stabby lambda !
That ’s it !
( Except for those who skipped to the Cliff ’s Notes ) .
Cliff ’s Notes
After he declared his candidacy , in early 2007 , the Obama who dominated his first year of campaigning was the post - partisan one .
He won legions of followers through the sheer power of inspiration .
At Dartmouth College in early January , on the night before the New Hampshire primary , a group of students expressed to me deep disenchantment with the Bush and the Clinton dynasties — the boomer War of the Roses .
“ Obama is the anti-Bush who could get us beyond Bush and all the polarization in Washington , ” one student said .
Another put it this way : “ He ’s one of us . ”
The post - partisan Obama brought millions of young voters into his movement , and he began to peel away moderate Republicans who were sick of their party ’s being defined by Dick Cheney ’s autocratic style of governance and Karl Rove ’s cynical political tactics .
The real problem with partisanship , Obama believes , is that it ’s no longer pragmatic .
After decades of bruising fights in Washington , it has become incompatible with effective government .
“ I believe any attempt by Democrats to pursue a more sharply partisan and ideological strategy misapprehends the moment we ’re in , ” he writes in “ Hope . ”
“ I am convinced that whenever we exaggerate or demonize , oversimplify or overstate our case , we lose .
Whenever we dumb down the political debate , we lose .
For it ’s precisely the pursuit of ideological purity , the rigid orthodoxy and the sheer predictability of our current political debate , that keeps us from finding new ways to meet the challenges we face as a country . ”
Partisan politics , defined merely as demagoguery or stupidity , is easy to reject — but doing so does n’t take us very far .
It ’s like calling on everyone to be decent .
At its weakest , post - partisanship amounts to an aversion to fighting , a trait that some people who know Obama see in him .
In the early months of the primary , Obama seemed almost physically to shrink from confrontation , and Hillary Clinton got the better of him in debate after debate .
Just before the Iowa caucus , Sidney Blumenthal , a friend and an adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton , told me , “ It ’s not a question of transcending partisanship .
It ’s a question of fulfilling it .
If we can win and govern well while handling multiple crises at the same time and the Congress , then we can move the country out of this Republican era and into a progressive Democratic era , for a long period of time . ”
Blumenthal found Obama ’s approach to be “ ahistorical ” — a simple hope that the past could be waved away .
Should Obama win the nomination , members of the Clinton campaign cautioned , he would have no idea what was in store for him .
At a Clinton event in Hampton , New Hampshire , a seventy - one - year - old woman named Ruth Keene told me that “ the Republicans would chew Obama up . ”
They tried like hell .
They called him an élitist , a radical , a socialist , a Marxist , a Muslim , an Arab , an appeaser , a danger to the republic , a threat to small children , a friend of terrorists , an enemy of Israel , a vote thief , a non-citizen , an anti-American , and a celebrity .
Obama did n’t defeat the Republicans simply by rising above partisanship , although his dignified manner served as a continual rebuke to his enemies and went a long way toward reassuring skeptical voters who were n’t members of the cult of “ Yes We Can . ”
It turned out that the culture war , in spite of Sarah Palin ’s manic gunplay , was largely over .
Obama won because he had a vastly superior organization , a steely resilience that became more evident in October than it was in January ( for which he owes a debt to Hillary Clinton ) , and a willingness to fight back on ground on which the majority of Americans — looking to government for solutions — now stand .
According to David Axelrod , among the books that Obama has read recently is “ Unequal Democracy , ” by the Princeton political scientist Larry M. Bartels .
It attributes the steep economic inequality of our time not to blind technological and market forces but to specific Republican policies .
Bartels writes , “ On average , the real incomes of middle - class families have grown twice as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans , while the real incomes of working poor families have grown six times as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans . ”
For decades , rising inequality coincided with conservative electoral success , because voters were largely ignorant of the effects of tax - code changes and other economic policies , those in power were unresponsive to the concerns of working - class citizens , and broader income growth occurred in election years .
In other words , the causes of inequality are essentially political — an insight that suggests that Obama might use economic policy to begin reversing a decades - long trend .
“ Unequal Democracy ” is decidedly a title from the left - wing book club , and it suits a candidate whose language became more ideological in the days after the markets crashed , in mid-September .
Obama began to refer to the financial meltdown as “ the final verdict ” on a “ failed economic philosophy ” — words that one of his advisers called “ the key line in the campaign narrative . ”
Another adviser told me that , in the final months of the race , economic conditions pushed Obama to the left .
“ Barack is a progressive person but also cautious , ” the adviser wrote in an e-mail .
“ He understands politics and understands the limits it can create on progressive policy .
But as the times have moved , he ’s moved quickly along with them . ”
Early on , during the more vaporous and messianic phase of his candidacy , Obama took more cautious stands than Hillary Clinton did , but this fall he began to embrace some of Clinton ’s positions that he had once refused to support , such as a moratorium on foreclosures and a government buyout of mortgages .
Obama was able to make a powerful case for a break with conservative economics , in part , because he does n’t carry the scars of recent history .
“ He ’s not intimidated by the issue frames that have bedevilled Democrats for the last couple of decades , ” one of the advisers said .
“ There ’s never been a sense of having to triangulate . ”
By the end of the campaign , Obama was n’t just running against broken politics , or even against the Bush Presidency .
He had the anti-government philosophy of the entire Age of Reagan in his sights .
So events in the homestretch crystallized Obama ’s economic liberalism .
But anyone who has read “ The Audacity of Hope ” already knew that Obama is no moderate when it comes to the purpose of government .
On social and legal issues — guns , abortion , the death penalty , same - sex marriage , the courts and the Constitution — Obama ’s instinct is usually to soften the left - right clash by reconciling opposites or by escaping them altogether , to find what he called , discussing abortion in his final debate with McCain , “ common ground . ”
The phrase is a perfect expression of what Sunstein says is Obama ’s determination to accommodate disagreement to the extent possible .
On issues of culture and law , Obama ’s liberalism is more procedural than substantive : his most fervent belief is in rules and in standards of serious debate .
Given the abuses of executive power and political discourse under George W. Bush , this trait will bring no insignificant cleansing .
But Obama ’s personal caution and conservatism , his sense of rectitude , as well as his idea of politics as a mature calling , should n’t be mistaken for split - the - difference centrism on every issue .
On questions of social welfare — jobs , income , health care , energy — which do n’t immediately provoke a battle over irreconcilable values , he has given every indication of favoring activist government .
When I asked Axelrod if the conservative era had just ended , he said , “ From the standpoint of values , I would n’t say that .
But , from the standpoint of economics , yes — American history runs in epochs like this . ”
He added , “ That ’s what the theory of our race was — that this is one of those periods of change we encounter every once in a while in our history . ”
A chapter in “ The Audacity of Hope ” titled “ Opportunity ” describes why “ the social compact F.D.R. helped construct is beginning to crumble , ” and begins to sketch a new social compact for a new century .
Obama makes a point of incorporating some of the insights of the Reagan era—such as the importance of market incentives and efficiency — but his conclusion , which is unmistakably Rooseveltian , is a call for the renewal of “ widespread economic security . ”
Similarly , in a speech on the economy at New York ’s Cooper Union , last March , Obama said , “ I do not believe that government should stand in the way of innovation or turn back the clock to an older era of regulation .
But I do believe that government has a role to play in advancing our common prosperity , by providing stable macroeconomic and financial conditions for sustained growth , by demanding transparency , and by insuring fair competition in the marketplace .
Our history should give us confidence that we do n’t have to choose between an oppressive government - run economy and a chaotic and unforgiving capitalism . ”
Since then , Obama has made it even more clear that he wants to lay the ghost of Reagan to rest .
“ You ’re still in here ?
Go home .
We lost . ”

In September , the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library , in Boston , held a forum on Presidential leadership .
Cass Sunstein was one of the participants ; another was Robert Kuttner , the co-founder of The American Prospect and a liberal economics journalist .
The two argued over what it would take for Obama to be a great President .
In Kuttner ’s view , nothing short of a return to New Deal - style government intervention will be enough to prevent the dire economy from dooming Obama ’s Presidency .
This summer , Kuttner published a short book titled “ Obama ’s Challenge , ” which he described to me as “ an open letter ” to the candidate .
“ Obama will need to be a more radical president than he was a presidential candidate , ” Kuttner writes .
“ Obama , in his books and speeches , has been almost obsessed with the idea that people are sick of partisan bickering .
Yet he also has claimed the identity of a resolute progressive .
Can he be both ?
History suggests that it is possible both to govern as a radical reformer and to be a unifier , and thereby move the political center to the left . ”
According to Kuttner , the next President must be willing to spend at least six hundred billion dollars — a Keynesian outpouring — on public works , health care , energy independence , unemployment benefits , mortgage refinancing , aid to state and local governments , and other programs .
Otherwise , the country will slide into a depression that will rival the one Roosevelt inherited .
( When I ran the six - hundred - billion figure by Paul Krugman , he agreed . )
“ Sunstein ’s minimalism is exactly what ’s not called for , ” Kuttner told me , and he later added , “ We ’re on the verge of Great Depression Two .
All bets are off .
The people who talk about post - liberal , post - ideological , they have been completely overtaken by events .
It ’s the same abuses , the same scenario , that led to the crash of ’ 29 .
It ’s the same dynamics of the financial economy dragging down the real economy — these are enduring lessons .
Everybody who was talking about being in a kind of post - liberal world , they ’re the ones who do n’t have much purchase on what ’s going on .
The question is whether Obama will come to this . ”
The answer will depend in part on the advisers he chooses .
In Kuttner ’s mind , the deficit hawks and deregulators of the Clinton Administration — Robert Rubin , Lawrence Summers — have been discredited by the financial crisis , and he thinks that it would be a big mistake for Obama to give them powerful roles in his Administration .
( Summers is considered a likely candidate for Treasury Secretary , and his top economic advisers are connected with the Hamilton Project , a center - left affiliate of the Brookings Institution . )
But , beyond macroeconomics , Kuttner , who plans to hold a conference in Washington called “ Thinking Big , ” shortly before Obama ’s Inauguration , thinks that the Democrats have a clear political agenda : “ the reclamation of an ideology . ”
This is not an ambition that Obama has ever publicly embraced .
In “ The Audacity of Hope , ” he specifically rejects such talk .
“ That ’s not Obama , ” Robert B. Reich , who was Bill Clinton ’s first Labor Secretary and now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley , said .
“ Obama is not about the restoration of government as a progressive force per se . ”
He added , “ Were Obama to approach this in an ideological way , talking about this as ‘ We are now going to affirm the importance and centrality of government in the future of the nation , ’ I think the public would walk away . ”
Reich , who holds Obama in high regard — he supported his candidacy over that of his old friend Hillary Clinton — bears his share of scars from the Clinton years , many of them inflicted by other members of the Administration .
He fought and lost a number of first - term battles against Rubin and other centrists , who persuaded Clinton to balance the budget rather than spend more on public investments .
Obama will take office with a number of advantages that were unavailable to the last Democratic President .
The Party is more united , the Democrats in Congress energized by their recent return to a majority .
As stagnant wages and pressing public needs have become the focus of Democratic domestic policy , the old line between deficit hawks and economic liberals has dissolved — last week , the Times published an Op - Ed piece co-written by a leading representative of each group : Rubin and the economist Jared Bernstein , respectively .
( They met somewhere around the forty - yard line on Bernstein ’s half of the field . )
Bill Clinton began his Presidency as the country was coming out of a recession , and Alan Greenspan , the semi-divine chairman of the Federal Reserve , could hold the new President hostage to Wall Street .
Now Greenspan , in retirement , has confessed to Congress that his free - market world view was flawed ; Wall Street lies prostrate after suffering something like a paralyzing stroke ; and , with the country entering a deep recession , both deficit spending and financial regulation are givens .
More profoundly , the conservative tide was still high when Clinton entered the White House , and it quickly swamped him .
Obama will take power at its lowest ebb .
It is for all these reasons that 2009 will be more like 1933 than like 1993 .
Nonetheless , in our conversation Reich kept returning to the many ways in which President Obama ’s ability to act quickly will be compromised .
“ We are not in Hundred Days territory , ” Reich said .
“ We may be , if the economy goes into free fall — the public may demand dramatic action .
But there are so many constraints on dramatic action . ”
New Presidents make mistakes — in Clinton ’s case , Reich said , they included the push to integrate gays into the military , the botched effort to reform health care , and a failure to establish priorities .
Even with a solid majority in Congress , Obama will have to deal with the Blue Dog Democrats , who represent states and districts that are more conservative .
Reich recently met with one Blue Dog , in the Southwest , who “ felt that it was going to be very difficult politically to make the case ” that increasing the deficit during a recession was the right thing to do .
On the other hand , unions will likely pressure the Administration to curtail trade agreements , in the interest of preventing the further loss of industrial jobs to other countries .
AMERICAblog reader JW writes :
hey john , I got a self - mailer from the NRSC [ National Republican Senatorial Committee ] today .
My wife and I have 3 small boys under 6 years old .
So when I saw the cartoon cover that says “ Come on in kids … ” then talks about rape with a little girl on the opposite page you can guess my utter disgust .
I ’m just glad I got to it before my 6 year old .
He does n’t need to be exposed to this .
What the hell is going on with the NRSC ?
I am absolutely livid .
How sick are the Republicans ?
Creating a children ’s book talking about rape , and then sending it to Minnesota ’s children , all on behalf of Norm Coleman .
So much for Coleman claiming the negative advertising was going to stop .
( Then again , Coleman was at a rally last week where Obama was compared to mass murderer Charles Manson . )
But making sleazy campaign literature look like a children ’s book , then sending it unwrapped into Minnesotans ’ homes so their kids can find it .
Not very Senatorial .
Here ’s a mailing that AMERICAblog reader JW just got yesterday from the Republican party supporting Norm Coleman against Al Franken .
PS Anyone else think the Republicans drew Franken a bit “ ethnic , ” shall we say ?
When you go to the grocery store or to the department store , many of the things you buy are disposable – they wind up in the trash .
Packages .
Plastic wrap .
Boxes .
Bags .
It ’s just trash , right ?
If you look a bit closer , though , you ’ll see something else in there .
Money .
Each time you toss something in the trash , you ’re tossing away some sort of value .
Part of the price you pay at the grocery store goes to cover the packaging and the portion of the item you ’ve thrown away .
A better approach ?
I argue that as a strong rule of thumb , the less you throw away , the less you spend .
6 Ways to Save Money and the Environment
Paper towels
You can get thirty rolls of Bounty on Amazon for $ 48.39 .
Each roll has fifty six sheets .
From what I can observe , the average paper towel usage requires about two sheets , so let ’s just say you get 30 uses per roll , times 30 rolls , means 900 uses .
Each use thus costs about $ 0.05 – and you ca n’t recoup the cost .
Once you use it , it ’s gone .
Alternately , you could buy fifty pounds of cotton rags for $ 30.00 .
Assuming each rag weighs an ounce , you ’d get 800 uses out of that batch – about $ 0.04 per use the first time through .
But wait !
If you ’re using cloth , you can just toss ’em in with the wash and wash them again .
Let ’s say you could wash all of the cloth in four loads for about a quarter a load – $ 1 and you have a fresh new batch of 800 cotton rags .
That means each subsequent use is one eighth of a cent .
Assuming you ’d use these things five times a day , over the course of the first year , you ’d save $ 57.96 , and in every subsequent year , you ’d save $ 88.97 .
Paper towels are just throwing money away .
Ziploc bags
Instead of using Ziploc bags , use plastic containers .
Buy two large sets of Rubbermaid containers ( like this set , giving you 24 containers for $ 21.99 ) and you ’ll have more than you ever need .
Then , whenever you ’d ordinarily use a Ziploc bag , grab one of these containers and use it instead .
You can freeze stuff in them , keep stuff in the fridge in them , and keep stuff in the pantry in them .
When one gets dirty , run it through the dishwasher , effectively replacing it for less than a penny .
How does that compare to Ziplocs ?
You can get 20 quart Ziplocs there for $ 3.70 , making them $ 0.19 a pop .
The large Rubbermaid set above costs $ 0.92 a pop .
After ten storage uses , you ’ve dumped $ 1.90 into the Ziplocs and $ 1.02 into the Rubbermaid , and the difference grows rapidly from there .
Ziplocs are just throwing money away .
Swiffers
My wife got a starter pack of these as a bridal shower gift .
Frankly , I do n’t get it .
You get a poor mop that requires you to buy special pads to replace the head ?
Come on .
Pick up a PVA mop ( like this one for $ 12 ) and just dip the end in a mix of a half gallon of hot water to one half cup of white vinegar .
Cleans like a charm .
The low - end Swiffer starter kit costs about the same as the mop , but the cloths are ridiculous – 72 pads for $ 64.99 ?
You can either blow $ 0.83 per mopping with a Swiffer or roughly a cent ( for the vinegar ) with a regular mop .
Over twenty moppings , you ’re comparing $ 16.60 to $ 0.20 .
Swiffers are just throwing money away .
AA batteries
We have quite a few devices around our home that eat batteries , from the remote controls for our Wii to a plethora of kid ’s toys .
In short , we were going through AAs like Pac - Man goes through dots .
After doing the research , I found that investing in rechargeable batteries would save us significant money in the long run – and I was right .
We ’ve about passed the break - even point in terms of the cost of the battery charger and rechargeables versus the cost of all of those disposable batteries , and from here on out , it ’s downright cheap .
Dead batteries are just throwing money away .
Kleenexes
Everyone has a box of Kleenexes at home , right ?
We do , but they ’re strictly for guests only .
It ’s much cheaper to just grab a handkerchief , blow away , and toss it in the wash .
Let ’s say we ’ve bought that big batch of cotton cloths I mentioned above in the paper towel section – they cost about $ 0.04 per use the first time through and an eighth of a cent each time thereafter .
You can get 570 Kleenexes for $ 8.17 on Amazon , adding up to about about a cent and a half per use .
Thus , after only the third use , the handkerchief catches up in price , and thereafter , every eight uses saves you eleven cents .
Kleenexes are just throwing money away .
Paper plates
Paper plates are vastly overpriced .
You can get reusable plastic plates for $ 0.20 a pop on Amazon , as many as you want .
Use them for picnics and keep them in the closet for large events where you have dozens of guests .
Paper plates ?
Any remotely sturdy ones will cost you a dime or so , meaning the plastic ones are covered after just two uses .
After that ?
It ’s saving a dime a use compared to paper .
Paper plates are just throwing money away .
These are just a few of the many tips that will help save you money .
What ’s the moral of the story here ?
You save money – often pretty quickly – by buying stuff that ’s reusable instead of stuff that ’s disposable .
Plus , reusing stuff is much more environmentally friendly , too .
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 November 14
Explanation : Fomalhaut ( sounds like " foam - a- lot " ) is a bright , young , star , a short 25 light - years from planet Earth in the direction of the constellation Piscis Austrinus .
In this sharp composite from the Hubble Space Telescope , Fomalhaut 's surrounding ring of dusty debris is imaged in detail , with overwhelming glare from the star masked by an occulting disk in the camera 's coronagraph .
Astronomers now identify , the tiny point of light in the small box at the right as a planet about 3 times the mass of Jupiter orbiting 10.7 billion miles from the star ( almost 23 times the Sun- Jupiter distance ) .
Designated Fomalhaut b , the massive planet probably shapes and maintains the ring 's relatively sharp inner edge , while the ring itself is likely a larger , younger analog of our own Kuiper Belt - the solar system 's outer reservoir of icy bodies .
The Hubble data represent the first visible - light image of a planet circling another star .
Immigration officials are under pressure to hit targets , MPs were told An estimated 300,000 visas giving foreigners the right to come to Britain may be wrongly approved every year , a committee of MPs has been told .
Linda Costelloe - Baker , the independent visa monitor , told the Home Affairs Committee it was " reasonable " to assume 15 % of short - term approvals were wrong .
She also said officials were " under pressure " to issue - rather than reject - visas to meet productivity targets .
The Tories said it made a " mockery " of Labour 's claims to control immigration .
Embassies and consulates examine 2.4 million applications each year from tourists , business people and those visiting relatives - they check applicants intend to leave after their visa expires and have enough money to live in the country and are not looking for a job , Ms Costelloe - Baker told the committee .
' Pressure ' Rejected applications were checked for accuracy but there was not a similar system in place to check applications that were approved , said Ms Costelloe - Baker .
" About 80 % of visas are issued and yet there has been no external scrutiny over that 80 % . "
Officials considering visa applications found it much easier to approve visas than reject them , she said because issuing was a " much faster " process than refusal .
This error rate not only increases the scope for increased illegal immigration , but is obviously a security threat
Dominic Grieve
Shadow home secretary " I do n't think there has been adequate scrutiny of decisions to issue , " she said , adding : " I think there is pressure to issue visas because it helps people hit their productivity targets . "
Conservative MP
David Davies asked if it was reasonable to assume that , if 15 % of rejections were found to be incorrect , a similar proportion of approvals were " incorrectly approved " .
" I think that 's a reasonable supposition , " Ms Costelloe - Baker said , adding that that total would include cases where an applicant rightly got a visa but where there were errors in the way the visa was approved .
Mr Davies continued : " I 'm trying to make an assumption here which is reasonable based on the evidence and that is that a large number of visa applications have been incorrectly approved in the country where they were requested . "
Ms Costelloe - Baker said : " I think that 's a reasonable assumption . "
Illegal immigration
But she said entry clearance officers were also conscious of the scrutiny their decisions were liable to come under when people applied for leave to remain when their visas expired .
She said there was evidence the new points - based system , which comes into effect on 27 November , would be more effective , although it was too early to tell .
Based upon a visit to the British embassy in Tehran , she said : " The quality of decision making and refusal notices there was poor but the quality of work on the points - based system was excellent and that is because it's a much clearer , simpler system . "
But shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said her comments highlighted a major flaw in Labour 's immigration system .
Every application is scrutinised , fingerprints are taken , and the individuals checked against a range of watch - lists .
Visas provide the first line of defence against those who seek to abuse the system .
Travellers are subject to further tough checks at the border .
Mark Sedwill
UK Border Agency " This makes a mockery of Labour 's claims to have a grip on our immigration system .
It is obvious that its operation is neither firm , nor fair .
" This error rate not only increases the scope for increased illegal immigration , but is obviously a security threat .
" The public will be dismayed that Labour targets are making our border controls more vulnerable . "
Ms Costelloe - Baker 's role as the independent monitor of visa entry is being phased out and she will be replaced by a new chief inspector of the UK Borders Agency , John Vine , former chief constable of Tayside Police .
Mark Sedwill , the international director of the UK Border Agency , said : " Our decisions are fair and objective , and last year the Independent Monitor determined they were right and reasonable in 99 % of cases .
" It is untrue to claim our staff give out visas when people do not meet the criteria set out in the immigration rules .
" In fact every application is scrutinised , fingerprints are taken , and the individuals checked against a range of watch - lists .
Visas provide the first line of defence against those who seek to abuse the system .
Travellers are subject to further tough checks at the border .
" Already we 've fingerprinted more than three million people and identified 4,600 cases of identity fraud .
So far this year we 've refused visas to nearly 20 % of applicants . "
The Office for National Statistics is due to publish its net migration figures - showing the numbers entering and leaving the UK - on Wednesday .

BIRMINGHAM , Alabama ( Reuters ) - Federal authorities arrested the mayor of Birmingham , Alabama , on Monday in a corruption probe surrounding a sewer bond debt that could lead to the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history .
Birmingham Mayor Larry P. Langford in an undated photo .
REUTERS / Handout
Authorities arrested Mayor Larry Langford in Birmingham at 7 a.m. ( 1200 GMT ) and charged him with 60 counts including bribery , money laundering , conspiracy and filing false tax returns , according to U.S. Attorney Alice Martin .
Langford was charged along with investment banker William Blount and lobbyist Al LaPierre for a total of 101 counts .
The government said it was also seeking $ 7.6 million in forfeiture from the three men .
Blount ’s company profited from collecting fees recommended by Langford in the sewer bond transactions , Martin said .
Birmingham is the largest city in Alabama ’s Jefferson County , which is fighting to stave off bankruptcy over what is now a $ 3.2 billion sewer debt .
Langford , a Democrat , was the head of the Jefferson County commission at the time it engaged in variable rate , auction and bond swaps to raise money to improve its sewer system .
“ He sold out his public office to his friends Blount and LaPierre for about $ 235,000 in expensive clothes , watches and cash to pay his growing personal debt .
All the while , Blount was paid fees topping $ 7 million , ” said Martin .
“ Through a web of financing agreements Langford required many institutions to use Blount as a consultant so Blount would make fees and in turn pay off Langford , ” Martin told a news conference , adding : “ It was a classic pay - to - play scheme . ”
Langford ’s office said the arrest was “ no surprise . ”
“ We are glad the Mayor will finally have his day in court .
As members of his team , we stand behind him and look forward to the day when we can return the focus to the important issues before the city , ” Langford ’s chief of staff , Deborah Vance - Bowie , said in a statement .
He was later released on a $ 50,000 bond .
In May the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit accusing Langford of receiving and not disclosing a $ 156,000 illegal payment .
Langford sat on Jefferson ’s county commission from 2002 to 2007 and was its president .
He became Birmingham mayor in 2007 .
Congress is stupid .
Really .
Amid all of the debate in Washington over what to do and whom to help to solve this financial crisis , our legislators are ignoring one critical and imperiled industry .
It 's piling up losses , overburdened by debt , and unable to attract consumers who have cut back on spending .
And even a Hail Mary merger between its principal players will not save it .
Stock in its flagship company has dropped more than 90 % this year , and something needs to be done .
So listen up Obama , Reid , Pelosi , and all the rest : Forget about the auto industry .
Now is the time to save Sirius XM Radio ( NASDAQ : SIRI ) .
Yes , I 'm kidding
In reality , there 's no good reason for the government to step in and save satellite radio .
It 's a terrible business that 's done nothing but pile up losses and disappoint shareholders .
It ca n't compete with the Internet , podcasts , or MP3s .
The business destroys value .
If the government were to loan it money , it would never see that money again .
Bailing out satellite radio is a ridiculous notion .
No one -- not even the politicians in Washington ( let 's hope ) -- is considering it .
Yet Washington is considering a hefty bailout for U.S. automakers -- an industry with much more in common with satellite radio than anyone would like to believe .
Here 's why
Ford ( NYSE : F ) , General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) , and Chrysler do not deserve taxpayer dollars .
They are poorly run companies that have shown they cannot compete in the global economy .
Like satellite radio , they 've done nothing but pile up losses and disappoint shareholders for a decade .
They 're also overburdened by debt and hamstrung by labor relations .
Yet at the same time the financial bailout was being passed in September , Congress approved $ 25 billion in low - interest rate loans for the " Big 3 " to retool their assembly lines to make more fuel - efficient cars .
More recently , we 're getting word out of Washington that the automakers are back lobbying Congress to get more money , more quickly .
They even want access to the $ 700 billion previously approved for the financial sector .
We 're also hearing that Chrysler would like the government to subsidize a merger between it and one of its American peers .
Let 's be clear :
This would not create a healthy company .
Instead , it would bail out a terrible investment decision by Cerberus Capital Management ( apparently , John Snow was n't just in over his head at the Treasury Department ) and create an even bigger liability for the government down the line .
This is where we draw the line
When we bailed out the financial companies , we did n't like it , but we did it .
And at The Motley Fool , we supported the move .
In that case , the consequences of inaction would have been severe and far - reaching .
Had there been no rescue package for financial institutions , the credit markets would have frozen up .
In turn , the housing market would have collapsed , and healthy businesses small and large would have been unable to meet payroll , finance inventory , or expand .
Quickly , America 's depression would have spread around the world , as demand for everything from gasoline to toys dried up , paralyzing manufacturing and service sectors .
It would have been a global financial apocalypse .
But if Sirius XM or Ford or GM goes out of business , none of that will happen .
Yes , a segment of Americans will lose their jobs .
But that would not mean the end for auto manufacturing in America .
After all , the leading U.S. auto manufacturer is n't Ford , GM or Chrysler .
It 's Toyota -- a Tokyo - based company that has opened plants in Kentucky , Indiana , California , and Texas .
But autoworker unions and the candidates they support are not keen on Toyota , because Toyota factories are not unionized .
In other words , bailout funds would not help a vital part of our economy , but would instead preserve entrenched political interests .
Do n't do it
While surviving financial firms such as AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) , Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) , Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) and JPMorgan ( NYSE : JPM ) may have overreached , they can recover alongside our domestic economy .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said for auto manufacturers , satellite radio , airlines , or any other industry with fundamentally poor economics .
Bailing out the automakers would throw good money after bad , in the name of an outdated belief that companies like Ford , GM , and Chrysler are the backbone of the American economy .
This is not the first time our country has been confronted with this choice .
At the time of the early - 1980s government bailout of Chrysler , David Henderson of the Cato Institute wondered : " Should the U.S. government let Chrysler fail ?
Let 's reword the question :
Should the government force taxpayers to subsidize a company whose products do not meet the market test ? "
Rather than spend billions to support companies that can't compete in the global economy , Congress should divert some of those funds to help retrain workers who need to find work with companies better suited for success .
Call your representatives in Congress and tell them to oppose additional money for the automakers .
Our economy needs to be healthy again -- not propped up in its sickbed by another dose of dumb money .

By Kevin Connolly
BBC News , Washington
The US presidential elections are on 4 November
The trouble with cultivating the idea that you are good in adversity is that it only works if you have a convincing plan for extracting yourself from it .
It is starting to look as though presidential hopeful John McCain simply does not .
His supporters will remind you he has been on the ropes before and survived but as things stand he is losing this election .
A historian reminded me last week of the extent to which Harry Truman had been written off in 1948 before he overhauled Thomas Dewey in the closing days of campaigning .
But if John McCain wins it from here it seems to me that he should be compared to Lazarus not just Harry Truman .
With seven days to go before polling , the problems for Mr McCain remain pretty much as they have been all along .
He is the first Republican in many years to find himself outgunned financially and outmuscled on the ground .
Barack Obama has raised more than $ 603 m ( £ 386 m ) and Mr McCain just over $ 380 m ( £ 244 m ) .
' Air war '
The effect of that is that wherever you go in America , you cannot switch on the TV without seeing Obama advertising .
The campaign has so much money that the adverts pop up in the middle of major sporting events , which candidates often cannot afford , and on digital cooking channels , where they often would not bother .
Viewers are being treated in the last few days to an ad in which Mr Obama talks about himself and his values and to endless commercials which hammer home the link between John McCain and President George W Bush .
This Democratic domination of the " Air War " will reach a curious climax on October 29 when several of the major broadcasting networks will air a 30 minute long Obama advert which has involved breaking into their regular schedules - and in the case of Fox , even delaying Game Six of the Baseball World Series .
The next week will also see the climax of a ground war in which the Obama camp seems to be on the point of another resounding victory .
Volunteers
This is all about having networks of volunteers in place winning the election in thousands of small towns and big-city precincts all over America .
For months , they have been registering voters , persuading doubters , and chasing - up waverers .
Mr McCain has not fired up an army of his own and you cannot win without one
Now , with early voting already under way in more than 30 states , like infantry soldiers going over the top , their moment has come .
Now their task is to make sure people know where polling stations are , have a lift to get them there if needed and understand the voting processes in their state - a lot of them are rather complicated .
In the last few weeks I have been in Ohio , Virginia , West Virginia , New York , Florida , Kentucky and Pennsylvania and in most of those places it looks like Obama has more people on the ground and a much tighter and more disciplined operation to get out the vote .
One key to all this is the use of the internet .
Internet The Obama camp has been brilliant at harvesting names and e-mail addresses from anyone who has ever had any kind of contact with them , and then brilliant at exploiting that database to raise funds and recruit volunteers .
But there is plenty of old - fashioned spade work in all this too .
Consider this : Ohio has 88 counties and in 2004 the Democratic Candidate John Kerry had offices in 16 of them .
That effort was almost , but not quite , enough to win him the state .
Obama has 88 offices - one in each of those 88 counties - all of them working on getting out the vote in a state which could decide who wins the White House .
When George W Bush won he had Karl Rove behind him orchestrating an army of volunteers and an inter-church network that provided a kind of neural pathway for Republican thought .
Mr McCain has not fired up an army of his own and you cannot win without one .
It is a measure of Republican desperation that they are starting to use the argument that America should not place the White House , the Senate and the House of Representatives all in the hands of the Democrats at the same time because that would leave Barack Obama free to exercise power without checks and balances .
It is the kind of argument you deploy only when you are trying to limit the scale of the loss and have given up all hope of winning .
A former Bush speechwriter David Frum - who is admittedly no great fan of McCain - has even suggested that Republicans should stop throwing good money after bad on the presidential race and start to focus resources on limiting Democratic gains in the Senate .
Hardly the kind of thing the old warrior McCain wants to hear on the eve of his greatest battle - but nothing compared to the vitriol he will hear from the Right if he goes down to resounding defeat next week and takes other conservative candidates for the House and Senate with him .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
I ’ll leave the debating of its merits and flaws to others .
But a
Hill staffer friend writes today to say the proposed administration bailout plan or variations thereof is in far more trouble on the Hill than media coverage is reflecting .
“ I ’m telling you , the coverage is not reflecting how much trouble a bailout is in in Congress .
The leadership wants it to happen , and maybe it will .
But I think [ reporters ] are getting their stories from leadership , plus the White House , who all want it to happen and play down opposition .
But things are ugly , the rank and file – there ’s just no way they are going to vote for this crap .
It just seems to me the bailout is in deep , deep trouble .
“ No way it ’s going to pass , ” he added in a later email .
“ It seems impossible .
Maybe we will get lucky , we get through the election , the meltdown proceeds apace , and somebody comes up with a save that does not look like – and is not – a bailout for rich Wall Street malefactors .
But that is the sine qua non . ”
Update : Some press reports suggest that Senate Democrats have reached a deal with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , that could be announced Thursday .
Hill friend comments , “ Look , we will see , it will be very interesting .
One of two things is possible , but not both : either 1 ) the leadership knows what it is doing , and has some reason to be confident that their plan will pass ( they ’ve done whip counts etc ) …. OR 2 ) the leadership has disastrously failed to understand where the caucus stands , despite getting chewed out by rank and file members , they just do n’t realize that members are really and truly going to vote against it .
And that will be an all around disaster .
One can hope they know something I do not , and there will be no disaster . ”
Can vulnerable incumbents vote for it ?
A Spanish woman has been found guilty of staging the fake kidnapping of her two children seven times in order to obtain ransom money from her husband .
Over five years , Josefa Sanchez Vargas conned her estranged husband out of more than 600,000 euros ( £ 535,000 ) , saying she had to pay the kidnappers .
But he eventually became suspicious , and hired a detective to investigate .
Sanchez Vargas has been jailed for three - and - a - half years .
Two accomplices have also been given jail terms .
The provincial court in Madrid heard how she invented increasingly bizarre stories behind the kidnappings .
The first time , in 2001 , she told her husband , identified only as Pedro GM , that strangers had broken into the family home to take her daughter and had demanded a ransom of 30,000 euros .
He then handed over another 48,000 euros the following year , believing the girl had been kidnapped again .
In 2003 , Sanchez Vargas said her son had been kidnapped by clothing dealers to whom she owed money .
Mr GM agreed to pay the " debt " of 36,000 euros .
Then in 2004 , Mr GM paid out 54,000 euros , believing his son was being held by drug dealers .
Pedro 's family finally convinced him to hire someone because they did n't believe a word of the claims
Jose Antonio Novo
Private detective In December and January , Sanchez Vargas obtained 180,000 euros from Mr GM , claiming that the boy had been seized by gypsies who were demanding blood money in exchange for the boy having sex with a 13 - year - old in their family .
Finally , in September 2006 , she claimed that her son had been grabbed in the street and asked Mr GM for 252,000 euros in ransom money .
On that occasion , the boy himself called Mr GM to say he had been kidnapped .
However , by that time Mr GM had hired a private detective , Jose Antonio Novo , who saw the teenaged son chatting with friends shortly after he made the phone call .
" Pedro 's family finally convinced him to hire someone because they did n't believe a word of the claims , " the Telegraph newspaper quoted Mr Novo as saying .
Mr Novo said Mr GM was in love with Sanchez Vargas and did not want any harm to come to his family , reported Europa Press .
He said Mr GM still had very strong feelings for Sanchez Vargas , and as such had renounced any rights to reclaim the money .

August finally ruled out South Ossetia as a summer tourist destination after Georgia and Russia launched a major offensive inside the region and this was the followed by the incredible news that Pervez Musharraf had resigned from the post of President of Pakistan under impeachment pressure from the coalition government proving that the man really does listen to the people …
After years of outrage and protest the 2008 Summer Olympics began in Beijing , China , which were notable for many achievements , including Michael Phelps surpassing Mark Spitz in Olympic Gold Medals won at a single Olympics .
However , August will be remembered as the month that introduced the world to a " hockey mum from Alaska " and a frightening glimpse into a possible future of American politics Sarah Palin style .
September welcomed Haumea as the fifth dwarf planet in the Solar System and Finland was shocked by another school shooting in Kauhajoki , a city in Western Finland , when 22 year - old culinary arts student Matti Juhani Saari shot dead ten people with a semi-automatic pistol , before shooting himself in the head .
October left the world 's jaw dropped open in collective shock as we tried to comprehend 700 billion dollars , which was the amount in the revised Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that President Bush signed into law .
The month also saw Iceland unfortunately declared a terrorist state by the UK and we all expected the worst ( thanks to the movies ) when the Large Hadron Collider was officially inaugurated .
November … what happened in November ?
Was there an election of some - kind ?
If memory serves , somebody named Obama is set to become the 44th President of the United States , but do n't quote me on that .
The month ended with a horrifying number of terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India that claimed the lives of 195 and injured almost 250 .
December has barely begun but we do know that Martti Ahtisaari will finally receive the Nobel Peace Prize , while Martin Chalfie , Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien receive the Chemistry prize , Paul Krugman wins the Economics prize , Jean - Marie Gustave Le Clézio wins the Literature prize , Makoto Kobayashi , Toshihide Maskawa and Yoichiro Nambu win the Physics prize , and Françoise Barré - Sinoussi , Harald zur Hausen and Luc Montagnier win the Physiology or Medicine prize .
2008 has also bid a sad farewell , some prematurely , to many of Ovi's heroes and inspirations among which were : Arthur C. Clarke , Michael Crichton , Bo Diddley , Bobby Fischer , Isaac Hayes , Charlton Heston , Heath Ledger , Bernie Mac , Paul Newman , Jacques Piccard , Sydney Pollack , Roy Scheider and Stan Winston .
So , it is now up to you to influence the Ovi team 's final decision over whom or what should become our Person / Event of the Year .
Will you choose Nicolas Sarkozy , Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , Silvio Berlusconi , Robert Mugabe , Nelson Mandela , Sarah Palin , Hugo Chavez , Dmitri Medvedev , Britney Spears , George W. Bush , Martti Ahtisaari or Cristiano Ronaldo , or perhaps gay marriage , Somalia pirates , the financial crisis , Georgia , Kosovo , HIV AIDS or the US election will grab your vote .

Probably the event or person of the year will not be evident for a decade but I have read an interesting article about the Somalia pirates at http://www.counterpunch.org/whitney12032008.html
that indicates they might not all be the vicious brigands portrayed in the media .
Since Somalia is about as lawless as a country can get without dissolving totally many immoral commercial operations have taken to dumping poisonous garbage in their local seas causing frightful medical problems and some of the " pirates " a are merely responding by attacking these pollution distributors to protect the population since there is no legal policing of the seas .

Paul Newman as a tribute to his astonishing and superb acting career .
We will not see his likes again for a long while .

Newman was a great actor , but I do n't think his death is the event of the year .
I 'll take the US election for $ 500 , Alex .

Only joking , hehe ...
Barack Obama , definitely .
AP 2008-12-08 03:21:12 Cristiano Ronaldo , of course .
Naaa ... joking too .
I think Ingrid Betancourt , for the six and a half years she spent on the jungle , deserved to be on the list .
I would say the new puppy in the White House :P
So it 's not person nor event ... but animal of the year !

jess 2008 - 12-08 09:54:27 god what a horrible year .
Where to start ?
For as big as the story was about Obama winning the American election I 'd have to say that the radical transfer of wealth in such a remarkably undemocratic and illegal fashion to reciepients that the Feds refused to name has to be the bigger story .
I mean , it 's truly hard to imagine the magnitude of this crime .
Saberi 2008-12-08 13:02:24
Very interesting question .... but the disappearance of 3 large investment banks from Wall Street in one year is unthinkable and unexpected event of the year .
The US elections are not an unexpected event but Obama would be the person of the year I guess .
Akli Hadid 2008-12-10 16:08:04
Obama has n't accomplished anything yet besides being elected president .
I think it would be too early to judge whether he could be person of the year .
My pick would be Mike Zukerberg , for developing a website that has millions of addicts worldwide and that might one day , bring the entire earth together .
His concept is interesting and he has given the entire planet the opportunity to be at the center of attention , and to express their opinions freely , in sum , to make their own news .
Digging into a mysterious failure today at work , I discovered an odd factoid about the way Internet Explorer interprets Javascript .
Here ’s a small sample HTML file with a chunk of Javascript :
< html >
< head >
< script >
/* When are functions defined ? */
function really ( ) { alert ( " Original " ) ; }
if ( 0 ) {
alert ( " No " ) ;
function really ( ) { alert ( " Yes , really " ) ; }
}
really ( ) ;
</ script >
</ head >
< body >
Really </ body >
</ html >
What alerts will display when you load this page ?
In Firefox , you ’ll see “ Original ” .
In Internet Explorer 6 ( and I think 7 ) , you ’ll see “ Yes , really ” .
In neither browser will you see “ No ” .
In IE , the redefinition of really ( ) is interpreted and used even though it is inside a block of code that is not executed .
Wonder of wonders ...
You can fix it by changing the redefinition clause to :
if ( 0 ) {
alert ( " No " ) ;
var really = function ( ) { alert ( " Yes , really ! " ) ; }
}
Oh , Internet Explorer , how can you be right when you feel so wrong ?
Burger King describes the scent as seductive
American fast food chain Burger King is marketing a men's fragrance with the scent of meat .
Called Flame , the company says the spray is " the scent of seduction with a hint of flame - broiled meat " .
The scent is on sale in New York for $ 3.99 ( £ 2.65 ) and through a website that features a variety of romantic images - but no actual burgers .
Its character the Burger King is also seen reclining almost naked in front of a log fire with whipped cream .
Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Thursday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says she is stunned at how McCain advisers have attacked Sarah Palin .
( CNN ) --
Whatever you may have thought about John McCain 's running mate -- about whether she was qualified , prepared or experienced enough for the job -- try to put all of that aside for just a moment , because Sarah Palin is who she is .
She did not become measurably more intelligent or measurably less intelligent during this campaign .
Remember , she was only part of the campaign for a matter of nine weeks .
Sarah Palin is who she is , which is why I find it so stunning that the very people who introduced us to her , who told us she would make a great vice president , have now turned on her with a vengeance .
They are the top advisers to John McCain 's failed campaign and they are desperate to find someone to blame for their long , long list of mistakes .
They have been launching grenades at Palin and her supporters .
CNN has found some of their allegations to be patently false .
iReport.com : What 's next for Sarah Palin ?
You will hear people say , " This is what always happens with a losing campaign , " and hopefully , this is the last time we will be talking about these people .
But what they have done just in the last few days to save their own skins is worth a final comment .
To those top McCain advisers who leaked the little story about seeing Sarah Palin in a towel ; to those who called her and her family " Wasilla hillbillies " while using her to stoke class warfare with red meat speeches and an anti-elitist message ; to those who claim she did n't know Africa was a continent ; to those McCain aides who say she is the reason they lost this election :
Can I please remind you of one thing ?
You picked her .
You are the ones who supposedly vetted her , and then told the American people she was qualified for the job .
You are the ones who , after meeting her a couple of times , told us she was ready to be just one heartbeat away from the presidency .
If even half of what you say now is true , then boy , did you try to sell the American people a bill of goods .
If Sarah Palin is the reason some voters chose Barack Obama , that is no one 's fault but your own .
John McCain , as he so graciously said himself the other night , lost this election .
He lost it with your help , your advice , your guidance , and yes , your running mate recommendations .
And that is crystal clear to everyone , no matter how hard you try to blame Sarah Palin or anyone else .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .

I have suggested in previous columns that the al - Qaeda model of 4GW may be failing for inherent reasons , i.e. , for reasons it cannot fix .
" Tom Ricks ’s Inbox " in the Oct. 19 Washington Post offers some confirmation of that assessment .
Ricks writes :
" Where did al - Qaeda in Iraq go wrong ?
In a paper prepared for the recent annual meeting of the American Political Science Association , the Australian political scientist Andrew Phillips argues persuasively that , by their nature , al - Qaeda affiliates tend to alienate their hosts . "
He then quotes Phillips at some length :
" In successive conflicts ranging from Bosnia to Chechnya to Kashmir , the jihad jet - set has rapidly worn out its welcome among local host populations as a result of its ideological inflexibility and high - handedness , as well as its readiness to resort to indiscriminate violence against locals at the first signs of challenge .
That this pattern has so frequently been repeated suggests that the underlying causes of al - Qaeda ’s defeat in Iraq may transcend the specific circumstances of that conflict .
Baldly stated , the causes of al - Qaeda ’s defeat in Iraq can be located in its ideological DNA . "
In my view , the " DNA " to which Phillips refers is the type of people drawn to al - Qaeda and other Fourth Generation entities modeled on al - Qaeda .
They are mostly religious fanatics of the most extreme varieties , similar to the Levellers and Diggers of the English Civil War .
Regardless of what their organization ’s leadership may enjoin , they will treat any locals they regard as religiously " lax " with severity .
They cannot do otherwise without becoming " impure " themselves .
It is useful to remind ourselves where the word " Puritan " comes from .
A failure of the al - Qaeda model , while welcome , does not imply any weakening of the impulse toward Fourth Generation war .
On the contrary , it represents its evolution .
4GW is something new in the post - Westphalian world , and it is likely to go through many cycles of innovation , failure , learning , and adaptation as it evolves .
I expect that evolution to play out over the course of the 21st century and beyond .
What does the prospective failure of the al - Qaeda model mean for other current models ?
The Taliban model would seem to share al - Qaeda ’s DNA .
When they were in power in Afghanistan , the Taliban also imposed a Puritanism that overrode local cultural norms and thereby alienated much of the population .
However , the Taliban also left power with several assets on its balance sheet , assets it continues to draw on .
It represented Pashtun dominance of Afghanistan , something all Pashtun regard as natural and necessary ( the Karzai regime ’s origins are Uzbek and Tajik ) .
Like a state , it brought order .
It reduced corruption , now out of control , to locally acceptable levels .
And while actually a creation of Pakistan ’s ISI , the Taliban successfully presented themselves as something homegrown , which the Karzai government will never be able to do .
In terms of the all - important quality of legitimacy , Robespierre always trumps Vichy .
Beyond Afghanistan , the Fourth Generation future belongs neither to al - Qaeda nor to the Taliban but to two more sophisticated models , Hezbollah and the Latin American drug gangs .
Both can fight , but fighting is not primarily what they are about .
Rather , both are about benefiting their members with money , services , community , identity , and , strange as it may sound , what passes locally for good government .
Even the drug gangs ’ governance is often less corrupt than that of the local state .
Both of these 4GW models can fall into the fatal error of alienating the local population , but the tendency is not inherent .
While Hezbollah is religiously defined , it seems to appeal well beyond the Puritans , which means it can give orders Puritans will not obey .
The drug gangs ’ principal faith is in making money , and few faiths are more broadly latitudinarian .
Andrew Phillips adds to his analysis the prudent warning that " Al - Qaeda may have lost Iraq , but this is no way implies that America and its allies have won . "
In Iraq as elsewhere , the fading of the al - Qaeda model is being balanced not by the rise of a new state but by the adoption of other models of 4GW .
So far , as best I can determine , no foreign intervention in a Fourth Generation conflict has succeeded is re-creating a real state ( you can add Ethiopia in Somalia to the long list of failures ) .
Do intervening foreign forces , like al - Qaeda , have DNA that preordains failure ?
The answer , while not final , seems to be pointing toward the affirmative .
I attended PloneConf 2008 recently , to talk about Deliverance .
But I ’ll talk here more about my observations as a relative outsider to that community .
( This post is really written for the Plone community — if you are n’t familiar with Plone this post probably wo n’t make much sense or be very useful . )
One of the ongoing concerns in the Plone community has been the difficulty of attracting and maintaining developer interest in the community , and generally making Plone easier to work with as a developer .
It ’s been a very successful community for consulting and integration work , but it has not been as rewarding for developers .
There ’s the idea of a “ Plone Tax ” , which means different things to different people but just generally speaks to the sense that Plone takes a little off the top — time to restart , time to run the tests , time to dig into code that just goes too deep .
There are some distinct problems with Plone , but probably the biggest problem is the quantity of small challenges and the general size and complexity of the system .
At the moment there is no clear path forward to resolve this .
A previous effort to fix things is a project called “ Five ” , which referred to Zope 2+3 — backporting libraries and techniques from Zope 3 into Zope 2 .
Plone is intimately tied to Zope 2 , and Five let them use new code without having to do abandon the old environment .
But the result was n’t terribly satisfying :
Five did n’t remove any complexity , it only added to it .
Even if the new components were superior that does n’t make them simple .
Plone is aching for more simplicity , not more power .
It ’s unclear how Plone can actually reform itself as a codebase .
Zope 2 is a behemoth , and its metaphors are deeply intertwined with existing code .
Acquisition in particular is ubiquitous , essential to lots of the machinery , and deeply confusing .
I saw a general interest in two directions : one was to encourage non-content - management tasks to be implemented in a complementary ( but separate ) technology , another direction is continuing to refactor the existing codebase while somehow trying to maintain backward compatibility .
It ’s unclear how to refactor the existing codebase in such a way that it is any simpler , but I suppose these two directions are not exclusive .
I want to focus on the idea of a complementary environment .
There ’s two products in particular that have been attracting interest : Grok and Repoze .
These two products usually go under the umbrella of “ exciting new ways to improve the developer experience in Plone ” which is a kind of generic positive sentiment .
But to my mind they represent two significantly different paths forward , and the differences deserve some more critical thought .
Grok is a layer on top of Zope 3 that attempts to make development in that environment more pleasing .
It eliminates most ZCML ( ZCML is Zope 3 ’s XML - based language for declaring the relation of various components in a system ) .
Grok uses conventions and introspection to make Zope 3 look more like a traditional web framework , with simple views and models and templates , and less of the wiring you have to set up in typical Zope 3 architectures .
At the same time , you can add all the Zope 3 declarations to break out of the automatic conventions .
Grok is a more pleasant layer on top of Zope 3 , but it ’s entirely focused on Zope 3 , and it is led by Martijn Faassen and Philipp von Weitershausen who are both very involved with the Zope 3 community .
Repoze is a more recent project , led by Chris McDonough , Tres Seaver , and Paul Everitt ( well , Paul might call himself more of a cheerleader ) .
They all work together at Agendaless Consulting .
They ’ve been highly involved in Zope 2 for a long time , and are all former employees of Zope Corp and major contributors to Zope 2 .
I do n’t think they ’ve ever quite made the jump to Zope 3 , and their consulting and experience kept them involved with Zope 2 .
A while back they got some WSGI religion and started splitting out some pieces of Zope into WSGI middleware and other independent libraries .
This included things like pulling out the transaction handler from Zope , reimplementing the Zope 2 publisher so it was more WSGIish , and a variety of other libraries .
These libraries are essentially extractions from Zope , or in the case of the Zope publisher and repoze .
plone , a way to wrap what would be considered a “ legacy ” application in the same interface as other newer pieces .
Having extracted nearly everything they wanted , they ’ve started work on a framework intended to be familiar to the Zope community , repoze.bfg .
This framework uses some Zope 3 concepts , but it ’s more built from scratch than it is built from Zope 3 , and it is attached to Zope 2 only insofar as it uses the pieces they ’ve extracted and the ideas they ’ve become comfortable with .
They ’ve described it as the framework they want to use when someone asks them to build something in Zope 2 .
Grok and Repoze have a significantly different development methodology .
One is a layer on Zope 3 , the other is an extraction of ideas from Zope 2 ( and a few from Zope 3 ) .
In part I think the distinction has n’t been presented very clearly because the Repoze and Grok communities overlap a great deal , and everyone is quite congenial with each other , and they are reluctant to enter debates about the designs .
While I also consider them all colleagues , I also feel pretty strongly about the design differences and I feel a discussion contrasting them is important .
Martijn recently wrote a post on why Plone should consider Grok and a follow - up post .
These posts speak to a variety of advantages Grok has over plain Zope 3 , which Grok can offer to Plone to manage its existing use of Zope 3 technologies .
I think Plone should n’t be so focused on managing the complexity of its stack , but focus on reducing that complexity .
And it should reduce that complexity by focusing on content management and moving all the other pieces people have built on Plone out of Plone .
It ca n’t just leave people hanging , which is why developing a clear story for how those other pieces should be developed is essential .
Plone the community does n’t have to map one - to - one to Plone the software .
Plone the software should become smaller and more focused .
Plone the community does n’t have to become more focused — the community does what it needs to do , what customers ask for , what is necessary to make a site compelling .
To be clear on what I ’m proposing here : Plone should have a community - recommended way to build non-Plone applications .
This does n’t mean you have to use those techniques , but it should be much more concrete than just “ there ’s a bunch of cool things out there , and maybe you should look around and use one of those . ”
By having a community - recommended pattern of development you can maintain and build on the Plone community , which is at least as important an asset as the Plone software .
With this in mind I believe an extraction of Zope 2 and Plone ideas is the right path forward .
Extraction is the process of isolating code and ideas , and localizing the effect of that code .
These are some of the most important ways to actually increase the simplicity of a codebase .
In the Zope 2 ( and even 3 ) codebase the thing that brings the most complexity is the non-locality of code , that parts of the system can effect each other in complex and unexpected ways .
Zope 3 formalizes these patterns of non-locality : the Component Architecture is largely about introducing non-localized relationships between code .
Arguably this non-locality of effect is exactly what people want , it ’s what enables pervasive customizations .
When a client asks you to change some little piece deep in the system , you do n’t really want to modify the system ’s code — you want to add a little code to the outside of the system that effects the change you desire .
The Component Architecture is a formalized way of making these kinds of changes , where Acquisition was a lower - level mechanism to do the same sort of thing .
I remain a Component Architecture skeptic , mostly because I think the mechanism is overused .
Still I think clearly Plone needs flexibility that a purely bespoke application would not require .
But there ’s no way out of it : that flexibility has a high cost .
In this there is no clear solution .
In addition to Acquisition , the complexity of Zope 2 security , the many layers of skinning … is the Component Architecture what Plone needs ?
From where I stand it seems like a step further in the wrong direction … and yes , it is a better placed step than any of the ones before , but if it ’s still a step in the wrong direction does that matter ?
I think Plone ( at least the community ) needs to be conservative in its enabling of these customizations .
Sure , the customizability is “ powerful , ” but I do n’t hear people clamoring for power .
They want simple , predictable , fast , maintainable .
That ’s not necessarily the same as “ easy ” — I think sometimes it ’s worth making things a little longer and less automatic to make a system more explicit and make code more localized .
I think Repoze is a step in this direction , a big ( maybe even an intimidatingly giant ) step towards simplicity .
That ’s the step I think Plone should make .
So , I offer this as my suggestion to Plone .
I think Plone - the - community has the opportunity to be more than Plone - the - software ; I think it must do this to remain viable in the long term .
But to get there the community make some choices — you ca n’t add simplicity .

When you experiment with Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk , it feels like magic .
You toss 500 questions into the ether , and the answers instantly start rolling in from anonymous workers around the world .
It was great for getting work done , but who are these people ?
I ’ve seen the demographics , but that was too abstract for me .
Last week , I started a new Turk experiment to answer two questions : what do these people look like , and how much does it cost for someone to reveal their face ?
Answer # 1 . This is what Mechanical Turk looks like ( click for full - size ) :
Answer # 2 . About $ 0.50 .
Results
Here ’s my original request :
Upload a photo of yourself holding a handwritten sign that says “ I Turk for … ” , filling out why you turk .
For example , “ I Turk for Cash , ” “ I Turk for My Kids , ” “ I Turk to Kill Time , ” or whatever else you like .
Be honest , be funny , be whatever you like .
As a good faith gesture , here ’s my photo .
If you have a webcam , you can simply go to Cameroid to snap a photo from your web browser , download the JPG , and upload it below .
( Do n’t worry if the text is backwards , I can fix that myself . )
DON’T provide any identifiable information , like your name or email , since that ’s a violation of MTurk policy .
The result will be used in a collage that can be found on my personal weblog , http://waxy.org.
By uploading your image and accepting payment for the image , you give permission to me , Andy Baio , to use your image in all forms and media for any lawful purposes .
( That ’s just cover - my - ass language .
I ’m almost certainly only going to restrict it to this one project . )
The collage will show up there shortly after the HIT is complete .
Thanks , everybody !
I started the task at $ .05 , but only two people responded in the first 24 hours .
( And one of those was Joshua Schachter , who I ’d told about the project . )
Clearly , that was too low , so I increased it to $ .25 , receiving only eight submissions in 48 hours .
( For reference , all 500 of my Girl Talk tasks were done in about an hour . )
Increasing it to $.50 got me 20 more submissions in about 48 hours , after which it started to drop off quickly .
I was n’t about to give dollar bills to random people for their photos , so I ended the experiment there .
People are n’t willing to give up their anonymity for cheap .
The final results : 30 people total — 10 women , 20 men .
Almost all were white , mostly in their 20s and 30s.
21 said they turked for money , 9 for fun or boredom .
Thanks for pulling back the curtain , Turkers .
The newest plans to modify the weather are conceptual or in an embryonic stage .
If they work , they will bring us one step closer to dominion over the elements that often disrupt our lives .
Tornado Terminator
In 1998 , the late physicist Bernard Eastlund suggested that we might control twisters with a space - based , solar - collecting microwave generator , which he called the Thunderstorm Solar Power Satellite .
The microwaves would heat the rainy downdraft inside the storm , disrupting the convective forces needed to concentrate the tornado ’s power , and so effectively stop it from forming .
The concept now awaits development by a new generation of weather modification experts .
Laser Rain Keitaro Yoshihara of the Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute in Nagakute , Japan , is using an ultraviolet laser to generate water droplets , mist , or ice particles from the ambient air in his lab .
Such small - scale photochemical seeding would produce rain in greenhouses or biospheres .
A Strike at Lightning Lighting kills 62 Americans a year , on average , and controlling it would prevent those deaths .
That is the goal at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Florida , where scientists are launching a special rocket that triggers lightning strikes .
These strikes occur just where the researchers want them , suggesting the promise of a technology that would redirect bolts from the sky with far more precision than the lightning rods of today .
ACLU Stops Illegal Voter Purges in Michigan
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Secretary of State 's " One Stop Voter Caging " Ends
Michael Collins
Judge Karen Nelson Moore of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order that ends the Michigan Secretary of State 's unlawful purging of voters from the registration rolls ( court decision ) .
The decision also orders Michigan officials to restore the registration status of 5,500 identified citizens who had been unlawfully removed previously .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) brought suit for the Michigan State Conference of NAACP Branches , plaintiff , and plaintiff - appellees the ACLU of Michigan and the U.S. Student Association Foundation .
Attorneys from both the national and Michigan ACLU are working on the case which is expected to be appealed .
State election officials followed Michigan code by purging any voter whose voter identification mailing was returned as " undeliverable " by the postal service .
The program began in January 2006 .
It has a disproportionate impact on college students and minorities .
Michael J. Steinberg , Legal Director of the Michigan ACLU said ,
" We are thrilled that thousands of voters who were illegally removed from the voter rolls will be able to vote in next week 's historic presidential election .
Disenfranchisement undermines our democracy and the court decision restores a measure confidence in our electoral system . "
Steinberg was positive about the broader impact of the ACLU action :
" We have reason to believe that many more people will be restored to the voter rolls as the litigation moves forward after the election .
For example , Detroit officials have said that nearly 30,000 voters are removed from the rolls each year because their voter ID cards are returned as undeliverable . "
Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lee Land , a Republican from Grand Rapids , is one of her party 's top vote getters but she 's selective about who is allowed to vote .
Michigan law has a special twist to voter registration .
The state receives a voter 's registration , enters it into a Qualified Voter File , and then sends out a voter identification card .
The law states :
" [ I ] f the ' original ' voter identification card is not returned to the clerk 's office , its receipt is presumed and an applicant becomes a registered voter in the State of Michigan . "
Defs . '
Mot. for Stay at 5 - 6 ; see also Mich .
Comp . Laws S.S. 168.499(3 ) , 168.500 c .
If , however , " the original voter identification card is returned to the clerk by the post office as nondeliverable , the clerk shall reject the registration and send the individual a notice of rejection . " ( court decision )
This is the target of the court case brought by the ACLU .
College students , people who 've moved , minorities , and transients would be more likely than most to fall victim to what the court pointed out is an unlawful scheme according the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ( NVRA ) .
The decision reasoned :
" Once the state takes the step of identifying individuals as active voters , those individuals clearly become ' registrants ' protected by the NVRA .
Federal district court issued an order prohibiting the Secretary of State form enforcing this law .
The court relied on the NVRA as the ruling law that determined who is a ' registrant . ' " ( court decision )
The court considered defendant Land 's arguments then demonstrated that the totality of the Secretary 's position resulted in voter disenfranchisement .
Land et al argued " that court orders affecting elections may result in voter confusion and cause a chilling effect . "
The defendants then claimed that even if a qualified voter were rejected due to a cancelled registration , the voter would still have the option to vote on a " provisional " ballot .

Preemptive Spam Penalties
There is a great thread over on SEOmoz by Matthew Inman about how some Googlers consider any of his future attempted linkbaits and widgetbaits to be off topic spam , based on his aggressive misuse of widgets in the past .
With hundreds of comments many of them are noise , but some of them are spot on with Google 's current trends , especially those from Jeremy Luebke and Jim Boykin .
Jeremy wrote :
Google is determined to make any scalable link building process blackhat .
It wo n't be long before all off topic linkbait , including articles , is considered linkspam .
And Jim wrote
And the blackhat club gets bigger .... and the waters get murkier and murkier .... if you 're an SEO , you 're a black hat .
Only those who do n't know what SEO is are the white hats ....
Do n't try to rank high on purpose .... if you do then you 've broken a google guideline
Corporate Marketing vs Individual SEOs
This event clearly demonstrates how differently Google treats major corporations vs individual SEOs ( especially if they are publicly known as SEOs ) .
An individual SEO who is great at his job can expect to be preemptively penalized to be made an example of , even while the competition are doing exactly what he wants to do ( ie : the same activity is brand building when the corporation does it and is spam when Mr. Inman does it ) .
A corporation typically is out of the index for a few days to a week at most , even if they are operating at an industrial spam scale for years !
When the corporations are relisted they may need to do a bit of rebuilding , but millions in profits from years of spamming allow them to invest adequate capital into growth .
This is why some of Google 's editorial judgement seems so arbitrary and lame .
The small player innovates , gets crushed by Google for being creative and innovative , then the monolithic corporations uses the same techniques to an industrial scale and are somehow better for borrowing / stealing the techniques .
How does that process foster web innovation ?
I lost a lot of links when a Google engineer decided to penalize one of my sites , and in the process all the links from my aggressive promotion costing 10s of thousands of dollars disappeared , while the fortune 500 companies in my field got a head start and competitive advantage against me by recycling my idea .
I can't express how thrilled I was .
That was the past and I am over it , but I think Google needs to take a close look at their own behavior when judging others .
Does Google Use Off Topic Linkbait & Widgets ?
An off topic transcription is a legitimate source of links , according to Matt Cutts - at least when you are syndicating Google 's opinions .
When you install AdSense for search on your site with the Google logo ( aka paid link ) it direct links back to Google ( ie : not to their AdSense program ) .
Google barters PageRank to push their business objectives .
How is what they are doing any better than what the average SEO does ?
Should they hold themselves to the standards they judge everyone else by ?
How can they be seen as objective if they do not ?
Be Careful Who You Trust
What is worse about this game of passing arbitrary judgement is that many of the best known SEOs praise each other in public only to snitch on one another in private ( talk about being ethically challenged ) .
One member who recently joined my training program read the training module about how affiliate programs can pass PageRank and asked Matt Cutts if they could use 301 redirects on their affiliate program " like Aaron does " so that he too could " rank for everything " .
Within a week my affiliate program no longer passed link juice .
Pick a Smart Professional Label
Google can not keep growing their revenues at an acceptable rate without beating the value out of others .
If you are new to the SEO field and want to excel online , call yourself something other than an SEO .
Using the label SEO invites arbitrary monitoring and punishment , and there are too many plastic personalities in this field willing to dime out a friend in exchange for a wooden nickel .
Ross Douthat is at it again - calling to defund Planned Parenthood , the health care provider that offers millions of Americans access to care critical for preventing unintended pregnancy and caring for ones ' health .
Is there anything , at this point , that can explain Ross Douthat ’s hubris in attacking a health care provider that offers care to millions of low - income Americans , as health care becomes more a privilege than a right for all Americans ?
His latest column reveals he enjoys making baseless claims to support
his belief system .
Douthat , like many anti-choice movement
members , wants to strip women ( and men ) of a certain income level of this country of reproductive
and sexual health care because he does n’t like that some
providers offer comprehensive , legal medical procedures with which he does n’t agree .
Douthat is opposed to legal abortion , so he
painstakingly plays off of a Family Research Council fabricated controversy over Planned Parenthood – the provider nationwide that happens to
represent one of the few options remaining for women ( and men ! ) of a
certain income level who need ( no , not want ) critical health care
like contraception , family planning , sexually transmitted infection
testing and treatment , HIV testing , annual exams , Pap smears , and
more .
Even William Saletan acknowledged what Douthat ’s " campaign " is really about – abortion .
Saletan goes so far as to call Planned Parenthood the most " effective pro-life organization in the history of the world . "
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .
SUBSCRIBE
But the Family Research Council ( FRC ) is n’t buying it .
They claim , via an email today , that Planned Parenthood is " awash " in funds and that if Planned Parenthood truly wanted to decrease the number of abortions , rather than providing birth control , contraception and family planning ( you know , those things proven to actually prevent pregnancy and STIs ) , they should just " stop providing them . "
Because , you know , if Planned Parenthood stopped providing abortions , unintended pregnancy would magically disappear .
Douthat ’s post is truly
as painful to read ( in its lack of common sense and evidence - based reasoning ) as the FRC email .
As we engage in a nationwide discussion on the
absolutely horrifying state of our health care system – one in which millions
of Americans are forced to go without care , including
reproductive and sexual health care , in part because health care providers can no longer afford to treat those who
require Medicaid subsidies or to provide care on a sliding scale
basis , Douthat and the FRC want to refocus Americans ’ attention on
dismantling an organization that does provide such care .
Planned Parenthood steps in , with the aid of tax dollars ( and where
else would Douthat like to see “ his ” tax dollars go in order
to ensure health care for the millions of Americans who need STI
prevention services , HIV testing , contraception , family planning ,
annual exams , Pap smears and more ? ) in order to provide these
services .
Yes , they also provide abortions .
And , yes , Douthat and
others do not like abortion .
But , here ’s the thing :
Planned Parenthood
must ( by federal law ) keep their abortion services separate from
their other services .
The funding they receive to ensure that
millions of Americans are given access to critical reproductive and
sexual health care services must be funneled to those services .
Federal law dictates that taxpayer money cannot pay for abortions .
If Douthat has evidence that the organization is behaving in a
fraudulent manner in this regard , then there ’s a story here .
If not , Douthat is simply registering his frustration with the fact
that a legal medical procedure for women can be provided by an
organization that also receives federal funds to provide other
health care .
I ’m afraid Douthat has a big battle in front of
him .
What about those folks who believe contraception is murder ?
Should we bar health care providers who offer contraception to
patients from receiving federal or state money too ?
What about
independent physicians in private practice who perform abortions and
also accept Medicaid subsidy for low income clients for other
services ( though , as I mentioned above , they are fewer and farther
between these days ) ?
While
Douthat tries to turn that 3 % of Planned Parenthood costs spent on
abortion care into a 250,000 number - of - abortions outrage he ’s still
left with the original ( true ) fact – 3 % of Planned Parenthood ’s
services are abortion services .
Which means that 97 % of services
Planned Parenthood provides are reproductive and sexual health care
services which are not abortion .
Douthat comes awfully close to admitting that the anti-choice
movement is anti-contraception as well .
He complains
that 250,000 abortions / year are too many , but what is his
answer ?
Defund Planned Parenthood , the organization that ensures
that millions of young women and men are given the preventive tools ,
care and information to avoid unintended pregnancy .
As
a former women ’s health center employee and part of the
reproductive health movement that prioritizes prevention , education
and trust , this next part of Douthat ’s “ argument ”
makes my head spin .
Douthat tries to “ prove ” that Planned
Parenthood is somehow fudging the numbers by using an article
Charlotte Allen wrote :
Just three percent ,
hmm ?
Why , that makes it sound like Planned Parenthood almost never
performs abortions .
Of course , the reality is rather different , as
Charlotte Allen noted last year :
The 3 percent
pie slice in the 2005 - 06 financial report , representing 264,943
abortion customers served , can only be described as deliberately
misleading .
So , here we go again .
First of all , as any current or former nonprofit employee of a service
organization understands , in an annual report , you categorize
services in terms of percentages .
If Planned Parenthood ’s
abortion services make up 3 % of their services , then categorizing this fact is n’t “ sneaky ” – it ’s true .
But more than that , the way Douthat uses Allen ’s reasoning to “ prove ” how Planned Parenthood tweaks
this number is stunning in its ability to demonstrate how little
anti-choicers understand about women ’s health care provision
and how badly they want to politicize women ’s health care at
any cost .
One way Planned
Parenthood massages the numbers to make its abortion business look
trivial is to unbundle its services for purposes of counting .
Those
10.1 million different medical procedures in the last fiscal year ,
for instance , were administered to only 3 million clients .
An
abortion is invariably preceded by a pregnancy test–a separate
service in Planned Parenthood ’s reckoning–and is almost always
followed at the organization ’s clinics by a " going home "
packet of contraceptives , which counts as another separate service .
Throw in a pelvic exam and a lab test for STDs –you get the picture .
In terms of absolute numbers of clients , one in three visited Planned
Parenthood for a pregnancy test , and of those , a little under one in
three had a Planned Parenthood abortion .
Okay , so , for the sake
of anti-choice advocates who want to see abortion criminalized , I’ll
address Allen ’s points but I am hopeful that Rewire
will present an actual health care provider ’s perspective to
crush this nonsense .
Planned Parenthood
is n’t “ massaging ” numbers by separating out
numbers of reproductive and sexual health care services
provided to women either before or after an abortion .
When a woman
comes to a health care provider with an unintended pregnancy and
wishes to discuss her ( legal ! ) options , she is first asked to take a
pregnancy test .
This is , of course , a separate service from an
abortion procedure .
The medical provider needs to know for sure that
this woman is pregnant first .
Then they can discuss options :
continuing the pregnancy and parenting the child , continuing the
pregnancy and working with adoption services , or having an abortion ,
thus terminating the pregnancy .
That ’s what health providers do
– should they instead , in Allen and Douthat ’s world –
ask women to come in with a used pregnancy test ?
Secondly , Planned
Parenthood does not provide prenatal or childbirth services .
Women
who visit Planned Parenthood for a pregnancy test are more than
likely already thinking about abortion as an option .
Secondly , Allen’s
condescending description of a " going home "
packet of contraceptives ’ post- abortion reveals her true
feelings about contraception .
While I can only suppose that the
medical offices of Allen and Douthat would send women away
post - abortion without the tools to actually prevent unintended
pregnancy again , most health care providers in this country ( and all
mainstream medical associations ) understand that ensuring women’s
access to contraception and family planning is critical to a healthy
life .
It is unquestionable at this point that access to
contraception , globally , improves women ’s health and lives ,
elevates their status in society and is only beneficial
for the health of a nation .
As Guttmacher puts it ( PDF ) ,
In addition to
improved health , sexual and reproductive health services contribute
to economic growth , societal and gender equity , and democratic
governance .
But Douthat uses Allen ’s quote as a “ gotcha ” for Planned
Parenthood .
Again , providing women with the means , post abortion , to
prevent unintended pregnancy does not catch Planned Parenthood in
some elaborate scheme – it catches them at doing exactly what
they should be doing , and what we should all be grateful they are
doing : providing women and families with the means to prevent
unintended pregnancy and STIs .
Ultimately Douthat’s
entire article will resonate only with the fiercest of anti-choice
advocates .
As has been made clear this election season , and through
more polling than one can count , Americans support ensuring access to
health care for women – even (! ) reproductive and sexual health care .
In addition , they oppose piling on even more legal restrictions
based on narrow , fundamentalist religious perspectives .
Instead ,
Americans are desperate to invest more time , energy and resources
into those programs – both advocacy and service –that
focus on prevention and education .
It ’s that darn common ground
concept that Douthat does n’t like .
Unfortunately for women ,
though it ’s most certainly the fuel for our fight , finding
“ common ground ” in the reproductive health movement is
about much more than “ gotchas ” and hot - button
ideological accusations .
It ’s about our health and lives .
I started teaching human anatomy at the same time my university renovated my laboratory .
As it turns out , this coincidence could not have been more propitious .
Teaching anatomy for the first time can be a struggle , and it is not just because there are an enormous number of names to learn .
A glimpse inside the body reveals structures left inside of us during the course of evolution , which often seem a confused jumble , with arteries , nerves and other structures taking odd paths to get from one part of the body to another .
GAZA CITY 
The Israeli Air Force on Saturday launched a massive attack on Hamas targets throughout Gaza in retaliation for the recent heavy rocket fire from the area , hitting mostly security headquarters , training compounds and weapons storage facilities , the Israeli military and witnesses said .
Dr. Muawiya Hassanein , the head of emergency services at the Gaza Ministry of Health , said that at least 195 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli air strikes .
Most of the fatalities were among members of the security forces of Hamas , the Islamic group that controls Gaza , but a few civilians were also among the dead , including children .
Scores more Palestinians were wounded .
The reaction to the punishing attacks was swift and varied .
A spokesman for President Bush called on Israel to avoid inflicting civilian casualties , although he did not call for a halt to the attacks on Hamas .
Egypt condemned the raid and opened its border crossing so that the wounded could be treated , and a spokesman for Javier Solana , the foreign policy chief of the European Union , condemned Israel ’s action and called for an immediate halt to the strikes .
For its part , Israel said the strikes would not only continue , but that they would be intensified .
The air attack came after days of warnings by Israeli officials that Israel would retaliate for intense rocket and mortar fire against Israeli towns and villages by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza .
On Wednesday alone , more than 60 rockets and mortars were fired , some reaching further than previously .
While the rockets are meant to be deadly , and several houses and a factory were hit , sowing widespread panic , no Israelis were killed or seriously injured in the recent attacks .
A shaky Egyptian - brokered truce between Israel and Hamas started to break down in early November .
Hamas had originally agreed to a six - month lull , and declared it officially over when the six - month period expired on Dec. 19 .

Though Israel had been threatening to end its policy of restraint that saw only limited strikes against rocket launchers and squads in recent days , the timing of the raid came as a surprise to Gazans .
It came in mid-morning , when official buildings and security compounds were filled with personnel and children were at school , and not , as many had anticipated , at night .
Expecting some kind of Israeli response , the Hamas leaders in Gaza had already been in hiding for two days .
In a statement issued immediately after the raid , the Israeli military warned that “ This operation will be continued , expanded and intensified as much as will be required . ”
“ We face a period that will be neither easy nor short , and will require determination and perseverance until the necessary change is achieved in the situation in the south , ” Ehud Barak , the Israeli defense minister , said .
In Waco , Tex. , where President Bush is vacationing , a White House spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , said : “ Hamas must end its terrorist activities if it wishes to play a role in the future of the Palestinian people .
The United States urges Israel to avoid civilian casualties as it targets Hamas in Gaza . ”
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , who was sharply critical of the Israeli attack , said in a statement , “ Egypt condemns the Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip and blames Israel , as an occupying force , for the victims and the wounded . ”
The spokesman for Mr. Solana said the European Union , “ condemns the disproportionate use of force . ”
At Shifa Hospital in Gaza City , scores of dead bodies were laid out in front of the morgue waiting for family members to identify them .
Many were dismembered .
There 's something funny going on in Minnesota , said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
Comedian Al Franken is mysteriously gaining ground in his too - close - to - call race against Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
Lost ballots are suddenly turning up , " in some cases under strange circumstances , " and it seems like the Democrats are trying to add " to their jackpot by stealing a Senate seat " for this left - wing joker .
One thing is particularly troubling as a recount looms , said Katherine Kerstein in the Minneapolis - St. Paul Star - Tribune , and the trickle of votes moves " inexorably in Franken 's direction . "
Fairness requires that the recount be conducted in a " nonpartisan fashion , " yet Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie came to office with the help of Democratic activists , who launched a nationwide effort to put Democrats into jobs like his so they " could wield influence in precisely the sort of hair 's breadth race we have here . "
" If you think all of this is starting to sound a bit like Florida in 2000 , " said Steve Benen in The Washington Monthly online , " we 're on the same page . "
The Republicans are attacking the official in charge , Ritchie , and accusing him of associating with ACORN and " ( cue the scary music ) " MoveOn.org so they can either influence the outcome or , if that fails , discredit the process in advance .
Franken will come out on top , either way , said Scott Rafferty in AlterNet , and not from cheating .
Hand counting of improperly marked ballots — more common in low - education , low - income areas that trend Democratic — should be more than enough for Franken to close the 200 - vote gap .
And " Minnesota only uses paper ballots , no punch cards and no touch screen , " so there will be a paper trail that should put the claims of fraud to rest .
Twenty Americans who traveled to El Salvador earlier this year to rebuild a church returned with serious cases of histoplasmosis , a lung disease caused by an airborne fungus , the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported .
More than half of the 33 church volunteers from Pennsylvania and Virginia got sick , including six who had to be hospitalized , according to the current issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
The volunteers traveled in separate groups but worked at the same church last January and February .
“ They were a healthy group , so this was a bit surprising , ” said Dr. Katie Kurkjian , an epidemic intelligence services officer with the Virginia Department of Health who wrote the report .
“ That suggests there was a high level of exposure . ”
The fungus that causes histoplasmosis grows in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings .
The spores become airborne when the soil is disturbed .
Mr Harper has been in office since January 2006 Opposition parties in Canada have joined forces to try to topple the minority Conservative government less than two months after elections .
The Liberals , New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois say the government is failing to tackle Canada 's economic problems .
They intend to use their joint majority to vote against PM Stephen Harper in a confidence motion due next Monday .
If Mr Harper loses , Canada 's Governor General would call a snap poll or ask the opposition to form the government .
Constitutional experts say Governor General Michaelle Jean may favour the second option as the country has had an election so recently .
Mr Harper 's Conservatives were re-elected in October but as they failed to secure a majority , they must rely on the support of the opposition to pass budgets and laws .
The prime minister could try to ride his luck and let the confidence vote go ahead on 8 December , or he could try to stave off defeat by asking the Governor General to suspend parliament until 27 January when the government is set to table its budget .
Either way , Mr Harper faces a difficult choice and his worst crisis since first winning power in January 2006 , analysts say .
The opposition Liberals and New Democrats signed a formal agreement to form a coalition that would govern until 30 June 2010 and have the tacit support of the separatist Bloc Quebecois .
The new prime minister would be the Liberal leader , Stephane Dion , who led his party to a serious defeat in the 14 October polls and had already announced plans to step down next May .
The opposition parties say they were spurred to action by the failure of the government to deal with the financial crisis and boost the country 's economy , and that they are set to introduce a stimulus package .
Governor General Michaelle Jean 's post is usually largely ceremonial " Given the critical situation facing our fellow citizens and the refusal and inability of the Harper government to deal with this critical situation , the opposition parties have decided that it was now time to take action , " Mr Dion said .
The opposition parties were also angered by Mr Harper 's attempt to eliminate public financing of political parties , a move that would hit them hard , Reuters reports .
Mr Harper said the Liberal leader had done " a deal with the separatists in order to get the power the voters denied him at the ballot box " and described the opposition 's move as an " undemocratic " power grab .

Two researchers head into the target chamber at the National Ignition Facility in Livermore , California , where the world ’s largest laser is being completed .
The laser , built for fusion research , has already shown the ability to fire 4 megajoules of infrared energy for up to 20 nanoseconds .
Shot into both ends of a tiny gold capsule filled with two frozen hydrogen isotopes , this powerful blast will create plasma around the pea-size target in the center of the capsule .
The resulting heat , researchers hope , will fuse the two isotopes inside — leading to virtually endless energy .
The immediate goals are to test the current optics , which amplify and shape the laser beam , and then to complete construction of the laser by March 2009 .
Researchers are optimistic that by 2010 they will achieve “ ignition , ” the point where more energy is coming out than is being put in .
We have been hearing this sort of promise from fusion researchers for years , of course , but this time , scientists have a giant laser to help them deliver the goods .
Once the connections are bridged between agricultural and manufacturing sectors , hemp will be a viable choice to create financial opportunities for farmers .
According to The Community Press August 21 , 2008 article , (" Hemp : The New Choice For Farmers - And It 's Legal " ) " John Baker , president and founder of Stonehedge Bio-Resources Inc. , said Eastern Ontario has the ideal climate and soil to grow hemp crops .
' This crop has potential to be a good reward to the agriculture sector , ' Baker said .
' It 's just the perfect environment for growing hemp . "
The article states , " Baker has licences for 19 hemp fields with the majority located in Hastings and Northumberland counties .
He currently is researching the plant to determine its use as a biomass .
According to his findings , hemp could be a leader in a growing environmentally friendly economy .
Baker believes hemp products will result in profits for farmers and producers of materials , and benefit the consumer .
Hemp can be used to make bio-masonry and bio-plastic products as well as food supplements and textiles .
' There are hundreds of uses , ' Baker said .
' They are already using it in Europe .
It is just a matter of bringing it here and actually doing it . '
BMW and Mercedes have started using hemp as insulation in their automobiles . "
The article adds , " In my first couple of years , they probably stole two acres from a 10 - acre site , ' Baker said .
Growing hemp in Canada is legal , but regulated .
It requires a licence from Health Canada and is controlled by the Bureau of Drug Surveillance .
Plants must have less than 0.3 per cent THC and they are regularly tested .
' The worry is hemp will be used as a blind for other plant material , ' Baker said .
While hemp farmers have to find their way through a maze of regulations , laws in other countries can be used to Canada 's advantage .
' That same barrier is what 's keeping the Americans out of the market , ' Baker said .
The American Drug Enforcement Agency has its foot firmly in the soil against U.S. farmers producing hemp , leaving manufacturers south of the border looking for a source of the plant 's products . "
Indian and American officials are now reporting that the Mumbai attackers seem to have connections to Lashkar - e - Taiba , the Pakistan - based Islamist organization .
Among other analytical clues , over the weekend , one anonymous American official quoted in the Washington Post noted that Lashkar has a known “ maritime ” capability .
I ’m not sure how much seaworthiness a group needs to demonstrate in order to be labeled “ maritime ” terrorists , but I can testify to the existence of Lashkar ’s pontoon boat fleet , as I was not too long ago a passenger on that line .
Late in 2005 , I travelled for The New Yorker to Pakistan - occupied Kashmir to report on the earthquake that devastated the region .
To facilitate international aid , the Pakistani government opened the region to journalists , creating a very rare opportunity to travel without escort and to poke around on the border .
I was particularly interested in looking up Lashkar , which I had been following for many years .
I made several visits to facilities run by its charity , called “ Jamat - ud - Dawa , ” which is today tolerated openly by the government of Pakistan but banned as a terrorist organization by the United States on the grounds that it is merely an alias for Lashkar .
In Muzuffarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , Jamat had brought in a mobile surgical unit staffed by long - bearded doctors from Karachi and Lahore — very impressive young men , fluent in English , who offered a reminder that unlike , say , the Taliban , Lashkar draws some very talented people from urban professions .
( With its hospitals , universities , and social - service wings , Lashkar is akin to Hezbollah or Hamas ; it is a three - dimensional political and social movement with an armed wing , not merely a terrorist or paramilitary outfit . )
As part of its earthquake relief work , Lashkar ferried supplies to remote villages isolated on the far side of the churning Neelum River , one of the two snow - fed canyon rivers that traverse the area .
I asked to take a ride with its volunteers , and their media officer ( yes , they have media officers ) agreed .
We rode in a van to the river ’s edge , scrambled down a rocky hillside and boarded one of Lashkar ’s rubber pontoon boats , about fifteen feet long , with a large outboard motor — useful for carrying relief supplies , but not coincidentally , also useful for infiltrating militants into Indian - held Kashmir .
It has long been an open secret , and a source of some hilarity among foreign correspondents , that under the guise of “ humanitarian relief operations , ” Lashkar practiced amphibious operations on a lake at its vast headquarters campus , outside Lahore .
The events in Mumbai have taken the humor of these “ humanitarian ” rehearsals away .
That day on the Neelum , I chatted with our thick - bearded captain in my very poor Arabic .
He spoke Arabic as well — from his religious studies , he said , although he conceded , too , that he had travelled to Saudi Arabia , where it is well understood that Lashkar has raised money .
I was also told that around the time of the earthquake they set up fund - raising operations in Britain , to tap the Pakistani diaspora there .
Earlier this year , I met with a Lashkar official in Lahore .
We talked about how Jamat was getting along under international pressure .
I took no notes and the conversation was intended for my informal guidance , but I came away with a number of impressions .
On the one hand , the group ’s bank accounts remain unmolested by the Pakistani government , which gives Lashkar quite a lot of running room ; on the other , the group resents the accommodations reached between Pakistan ’s government and the United States .
Clearly , Lashkar knows what it must do to protect the Pakistan government from being exposed in the violent operations that Lashkar runs in Kashmir and elsewhere .
For example , some of its younger volunteers wanted to join the fight with the Taliban in Western Pakistan and Afghanistan , my interlocutor said , and so Jamat had evolved an internal H.R. policy by which these young men would turn in their Jamat identity cards and go West “ on their own time , ” much as think tanks allow policy scholars to take leaves of absence to advise political campaigns .
One question that will certainly arise as the Mumbai investigations proceed is what the United States should insist the government of Pakistan do about Jamat and Lashkar .
Even for a relative hawk on the subject of Pakistan ’s support for Islamist militias , it ’s a difficult question — comparable to the difficult question of managing Hezbollah ’s place in the fragile Lebanese political system .
To some extent , Pakistan ’s policy of banning Lashkar and tolerating Jamat has helpfully reinforced Lashkar ’s tendency toward nonviolent social work and proseltyzing .
In the long run , this work is a threat to the secular character of Pakistan , but it is certainly preferable to revolutionary violence and upheaval right now .
On the other hand , there is little doubt that the Army and I.S.I. continue to use Jamat ’s legitimate front as a vehicle for prosecution of a long - running “ double game ” with the United States , in which Pakistan pledges fealty to American counterterrorism goals while at the same time facilitating guerrilla violence against India , particularly over the strategic territory of Kashmir , which Pakistan regards as vital to its national interests .
Lashkar is a big organization with multiple arms and priorities and its leadership is undoubtedly divided over how much risk to take in pursuit of violent operations in India , particularly given the comfort and even wealth the group ’s leaders enjoy from their unmolested activities inside Pakistan .
If the boys in Mumbai had support from Lashkar , did the group ’s leader , Hafez Saeed , who runs Jamat , know of the plan ?
If so , that would be a radical act that would likely mean the end of his charity ’s tenuous legitimacy .
If it can be credibly established that Saeed did not know — that this was a rogue operation of some sort , or a strategy cooked up by elements of Lashkar and groups such as the Pakistani Taliban or even Al Qaeda ( perhaps conducted , too , with support from rogue elements of the Paksitan security forces ) — that would be an even more complicated equation .
I was at a conference this morning where another panelist well - versed in these issues said he would not be surprised if it turned out that Lashkar conceived the Mumbai attacks as a way to pull Pakistani Army units and attention away from the Afghan border and into defense positions in the east , to protect the country from the possibility of military retaliation by India .
In any event , if the evidence does show that uncontrolled Lashkar elements carried out the attacks , it would force India ’s government to judge how to calibrate policy toward a civilian - led Pakistan government and Army command that may have little control over the very same Islamist groups that it purposefully built up and supported just a few years ago .
If the evidence shows that these were purposeful attacks endorsed by Saeed and aided by elements of the Army , then the Pakistan government will have no choice but to at least make a show of closing down Jamat and arresting Saeed .
Unfortunately , it has taken such action in the past , but that action has turned out to be partially symbolic and constructed for international consumption , rather than marking a true and complete change in policy .
The U.S. can do a few useful things here .
At a minimum , it can provide transparent information about the investigation and where the facts lead , so that the Indian and Pakistani political systems are on the same footing ; it can indict individuals and groups that can be established as culpable for the Mumbai murders , no matter who those individuals and groups are — even if they include officers in the Pakistan Army ; and it can emphasize in public that the United States seeks the end of all Pakistani support for terrorist groups , no matter whether they are operating in Afghanistan , Kashmir , or Mumbai .
Description :
This monograph is justifiably considered a modern classic .
It is by Stephan Kinsella who caused a worldwide rethinking among libertarians of the very basis of intellectual property .
Mises had warned against patents , and Rothbard did too .
But Kinsella goes much further to argue that the very existence of patents are contrary to a free market , and adds in here copyrights and trademarks too .
They all use the state to create artificial scarcities of non-scarce goods and employ coercion in a way that is contrary to property rights and the freedom of contract .
Many people who read this essay for the first time were unprepared for the rigor of his argument , which takes time to settle in simply because it seems so shocking at first .
But Kinsella makes his case with powerful logic and examples that are overwhelming in their persuasive power .
Fresh off his role as the punchline to Gov. Mike Huckabee ’s presidential bid , Chuck Norris is taking a fresh stab at politics by weighing in on Proposition 8 protests .
In an op - ed called “ If Democracy Does n’t Work , Try Anarchy “ , he cries “ Where are the hate - crime cops when religious conservatives need them ? ”
The whole piece is a gobbledygook of half truths , race - baiting and feigned outrage that form a sort of Greatest Hits list of Yes on 8 talking points over the last week .
Even though we ’ve disproved these things half a dozen times already , we ’ll break it down again , because if there ’s one thing public education has proven it ’s that endless repetition can reach even the dimmest of minds :
“ Protestors [ sic ] of Proposition 8 in California ( the marriage amendment ) shoved aside a 69 - year - old woman who was bearing a cross .
They reportedly spit on her and stomped on her cross .
They then aligned themselves in a human barricade , blocking the media from getting to or interviewing the woman . ”
Only the first sentence of that is factually true .
Meanwhile , at a protest last week at the Mormon Church , one man was punched in the face by a Yes on 8 supporter and three other women were hit by Mormon supporters .
Violence is uncool , no matter where it comes from , but Prop 8 .
supporters have been as violent , if not more so .
“ Letters containing white powder ( obviously mimicking anthrax ) were sent to the Salt Lake City headquarters of the Mormon church and to a temple in Los Angeles .
( Thankfully , the FBI said the substance was nontoxic . ) “
Unless the Texas Ranger has a hot line to the FBI , he ’s jumping the gun on this .
The FBI investigation is still ongoing and nobody knows who sent the envelope .
Some have suggested that , like a similar case involving Scientology , the envelopes may have been sent by someone within the church .
“ The 25 - year artistic director of the California Musical Theatre , who also happens to be a Mormon , was muscled to resign because of his $ 1,000 donation to the campaign to ban gay marriage in California . “
Scott Eckern offered up his resignation of his own accord .
“ A pro-homosexual , pro-anarchy organization named Bash Back marched into the middle of a church service and flung fliers and condoms to the congregants .
They also hung a banner from the balcony that featured two lesbians in provocative positions at the pulpit . “
Well , yeah , that part is pretty true .
“ Lastly , the tolerance - preaching activists also have taken their anger to the blogosphere , where posts have planted ideas ranging from burning churches to storming the citadels of government until our society is forced to overturn Prop . 8 ”
Does that mean Chuck Norris is a Queerty reader ?
If so , “ Hi Chuck !
How are you enjoying this post so far ?
I ca n’t wait til I tear into your statement about how evil it is for minorities not to follow the will of the majority .
Stick around ! ”
“ You even can find donor blacklists online .
The lists include everyone who financially backed Prop. 8 — even those who gave as little as $ 46 ”
Chuck Norris thinks the Los Angeles Times is part of the evil gay anarchy agenda with their database of names provided by the California Secretary of State .
“ What ’s wrong with this picture ?
Lots .
First , there ’s the obvious inability of the minority to accept the will of the majority . “
Damn those pesky majorities being upset by the “ tyranny of the majority ” !
Norris might want to read Plato ’s Republic , Alexis de Tocqueville ’s Democracy in America , John Stuart Mill ’s On Liberty , Federalist Paper No. 10 , or any of the other hundreds of foundations of democratic thought which argue vehemently against what James Madison called “ the violence of majority faction ” .
Seriously Chuck , do you know the first thing about American democracy ?
I ’m serious .
You ’re a moron .
“ What ’s surprising ( or maybe not so ) is that even though 70 percent of African - Americans voted in favor of Proposition 8 , protests against black churches are virtually nonexistent . ”
We ’ve got a big story coming up on this , but as we ’ve pointed out again and again , a. ) the statistic is inaccurate and b. ) there have been protests all over the country , not just outside Mormon temples– and the Mormon Church ( if not all Mormons ) was a direct and active supporter of Prop.
8 , so protesting them is both moral and justified .
“ There is a difference between respectfully advocating one ’s civil rights and demanding public endorsement of what many still consider to be unnatural sexual behavior through cruel coercion and repression tactics . ”
Who knew Chuck Norris was such a big baby ?
Marriage equality advocates throw a few protests and boycott a few business and they ’re guilty of “ cruel coercion and repression tactics ” ?
Norris is absolutely right that people are allowed to vote and donate money as they see fit , but they are also responsible for their actions .
If you run a business and donated to Prop. 8 , knowing full well that your donation would be public , you put your employees welfare at risk .
People are free to spend their money as they please , but people are also free to withhold their money as well .
While there have been scattered incidents of violence and arrests on both sides , the protests , while angry and defiant , are remarkably peaceful for their size and spontaneity .
The fact is , the only argument bigots like Norris have is , “ We do n’t like you . ”
The fact is , you ’re down to calling us “ terrorists ” , “ anarchists ” and “ fascists ” and it ’s pretty laughable .
As Gandhi once said , “ First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
That ’s right Norris , you just got your ass handed to you by Gandhi .

Advertisement South African singing legend Miriam Makeba has died aged 76 , after being taken ill in Italy .
She had just taken part in a concert near the southern town of Caserta and died of a heart attack .
Makeba , known as " Mama Africa " , spent more than 30 years in exile after lending her support to the anti-apartheid struggle .
She appeared on Paul Simon 's Graceland tour in 1987 and in 1992 had a leading role in the film Sarafina !
Passport revoked Makeba , was born in Johannesburg on 4 March 1932 and was a leading symbol in the struggle against apartheid .
MIRIAM MAKEBA 1932 : Born Johannesburg , South Africa 1959 : Stars in the jazz opera King Kong and anti-apartheid film Come Back , Africa , met Harry Belafonte 1960 : Barred from South Africa 1963 : Testifies against apartheid at the United Nations 1966 : Becomes the first African woman to win a Grammy award 1968 : Marries Black Panther Stokely Carmichael and moves to Guinea 1985 : Moves to Brussels after her child Bongi dies in childbirth 1990 : Returns to South Africa after personal request from Nelson Mandela 2005 : Begins a " farewell tour " of the world that lasts three years 2008 : Dies in Caserta , Italy following a concert , aged 76
Mandela 's tribute to Makeba
Her singing career started in the 1950s as she mixed jazz with traditional South African songs .
She came to international attention in 1959 during a tour of the United States with South African group the Manhattan Brothers .
She was forced into exile soon after when her passport was revoked after starring in an anti-apartheid documentary and did not return to her native country until after Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990 .
Makeba was the first black African woman to win a Grammy Award , which she shared with Harry Belafonte in 1965 .
Charlie Gillett , who presents the BBC World of Music programme , says there is nobody to compare to her , as she was popular in West Africa - after living in exile in Guinea - and East Africa for recording a version of the Swahili song Malaika , as well as her home in South Africa .
She was African music 's first world star blending different styles long before the phrase " world music " was coined .
After her divorce from fellow South African musician Hugh Masekela she married American civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael .

" You sing about those things that surround you , " she said .
" Our surrounding has always been that of suffering from apartheid and the racism that exists in our country .
So our music has to be affected by all that . "
It was because of this dedication to her home continent that Miriam Makeba became known as Mama Africa .

A mysterious Renaissance portrait that has hung in an Australian art gallery for 43 years - its artist and subject unknown - has been identified as potentially the world 's only painting of the infamous Lucrezia Borgia .
" What was previously a portrait of an unknown sitter by an unidentified artist now seems likely to be one of the most significant portraits surviving from the Renaissance , by one of the great northern Italian painters , Dosso Dossi , " said Gerard Vaughan , director of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne .
The oval painting , titled Portrait of a Youth , was purchased in London by the gallery in 1965 for £ 8,000 .
If it is proved to be a portrait of Borgia , it could be worth millions .
The man behind the discovery , Carl Villis , conservator of the National Gallery of Victoria , said the revelation follows three years of painstaking detective work , spanning three continents .
" If you had told me two years ago that this painting would be the only known portrait of the most famous and notorious woman in Renaissance history I probably would have shown you the door .
" It seemed so preposterous at first that I was almost too embarrassed to suggest it , " said Villis .
Lucrezia Borgia was the illegitimate daughter of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia , who ruled as Pope Alexander VI from 1492 to 1503 and whose family became known for corruption and scandal .
There are other portraits that have been said to be of Lucrezia Borgia , but none has been accepted by scholars .
Villis said he had been intrigued by the portrait since laying eyes on it 18 years ago .
Indeed , the identity of the artist and his subject - originally thought to be a young male - baffled historians and art critics for more than four decades .
But following what he describes as " patient detective work " , including scientific analysis and meticulous research in Italy , Australia and the US , Villis is certain it could only be of Lucrezia Borgia , painted by Dosso Dossi , a contemporary of Michelangelo and Raphael .
One clue to the subject of the portrait was the dagger held by the figure , which although unheard of in Renaissance portraits of women , symbolised the Roman heroine Lucrezia , renowned for plunging a dagger into her chest after being raped by the son of the king of Rome .
There was also the myrtle bush , highly symbolic in Renaissance painting , which refers to the goddess Venus and indicated the figure was a woman , not a man as originally thought .
" When I started to examine the painting closely and we understood where this was heading I kept quiet about it for quite a while because I just thought it could not possibly be , " said Villis .
He said another clue was the similarity between the portrait and a bronze portrait medal of Borgia , made in 1502 , which was the only reliable likeness of her features .
The gallery , which will put the portrait on display from Wednesday , expects its conclusion to be heavily scrutinised .
A year ago , it was embarrassed by the revelation that its only work by the legendary impressionist Vincent Van Gogh was a fake .
" We 'll put it out now for scholarly debate .
I 'm convinced that the arguments we are putting forward are valid .
Many people are in agreement , some people are not , " said Villis .
WASHINGTON - U.S. military leaders and Pentagon officials have made it clear through public statements and deliberately leaked stories in recent weeks that they plan to violate a central provision of the U.S. - Iraq withdrawal agreement requiring the complete withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities by mid-2009 by reclassifying combat troops as support troops .
The scheme to engage in chicanery in labeling U.S. troops represents both open defiance of an agreement which the U.S. military has never accepted and a way of blocking President - elect Barack Obama 's proposed plan for withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of his taking office .
By redesignating tens of thousands of combat troops as support troops , those officials apparently hope to make it difficult , if not impossible , for Obama to insist on getting all combat troops of the country by mid-2010 .
Gen . David Petraeus , now commander of CENTCOM , and Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , who opposed Obama 's 16 - month withdrawal plan during the election campaign , have drawn up their own alternative withdrawal plan rejecting that timeline , as the New York Times reported Thursday .
That plan was communicated to Obama in general terms by Secretary of Defense Robert M.Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen when he met with his national security team in Chicago on Dec. 15 , according to the Times .
The determination of the military leadership to ignore the U.S. - Iraq agreement and to pressure Obama on his withdrawal policy was clear from remarks made by Mullen in a news conference on Nov. 17 -- after U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker had signed the agreement in Baghdad .
Mullen declared that he considered it " important " that withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq " be conditions - based " .
That position directly contradicted the terms of the agreement , and Mullen was asked whether the agreement required all U.S. troops to leave Iraq by the end of 2011 , regardless of the security conditions .
He answered " Yes , " but then added , " Three years is a long time .
Conditions could change in that period of time ... "
Mullen said U.S. officials would " continue to have discussions with them over time , as conditions continue to evolve " , and said that reversing the outcome of the negotiations was " theoretically possible " .
Obama 's decision to keep Gates , who was known to be opposed to Obama 's withdrawal timetable , as defense secretary confirmed the belief of the Pentagon leadership that Obama would not resist the military effort to push back against his Iraq withdrawal plan .
A source close to the Obama transition team has told IPS that Obama had made the decision for a frankly political reason .
Obama and his advisers believed the administration would be politically vulnerable on national security and viewed the Gates nomination as a way of blunting political criticism of its policies .
The Gates decision was followed immediately by the leak of a major element in the military plan to push back against a 16 - month withdrawal plan -- a scheme to keep U.S. combat troops in Iraqi cities after mid-2009 , in defiance of the terms of the withdrawal agreement .
The New York Times first revealed that " Pentagon planners " were proposing the " relabeling " of U.S. combat units as " training and support " units in a Dec. 4 story .
The Times story also revealed that Pentagon planners were projecting that as many as 70,000 U.S. troops would be maintained in Iraq " for a substantial time even beyond 2011 " , despite the agreement 's explicit requirement that all U.S. troops would have to be withdrawn by then .
Odierno provided a further hint Dec. 13 that the U.S. military intends to ignore the provision of the agreement requiring withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops from cities and towns by the end of May 2009 .
Odierno told reporters flatly that U.S. troops would not move from numerous security posts in cities beyond next summer 's deadline for their removal , saying " We believe that 's part of our transition teams . "

His spokesman , Lt. Col. James Hutton , explained that these " transition teams " would consist of " enablers " rather than " combat forces " , and that this would be consistent with the withdrawal agreement .
But both Odierno's and Hutton 's remarks were clearly based on the Pentagon plan for the " relabeling " of U.S. combat forces as support forces in order to evade a key constraint in the pact that the Times had reported earlier .
In an article in The New Republic dated Dec. 24 , Eli Lake writes that three military sources told him that the U.S. " Military Transition Teams " , which who have been fighting alongside Iraqi units , as well as force - protection units and " quick - reaction forces " , are all being redesignated as " support units " , despite their obvious combat functions , " in order to skirt the language of the SOFA [ status of forces agreement ] " .
U.S. commanders have not bothered to claim that this is anything but a semantic trick , since the redesignated units would continue to participate in combat patrols , as confirmed by New York Times reporters Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker Thursday .
The question of whether Iraqis would permit such " relabeled " combat forces to remain after next June was discussed with Obama on Monday , according to the Times report .
One participant reportedly said Gates and Mullen " did not rule out the idea that Iraqis might permit such troops ... "
Despite Odierno's assertion of the U.S. military 's prerogative to unilaterally determine what U.S. troops may remain Iraqi cities , the Iraqi government has already made it clear that the U.S. military has no such right .
Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mohammed al Askari , responded to Odierno's and Hutton 's statements by saying that U.S. commanders would have to get permission from the Iraqi government to station any non-combat troops in cities beyond the deadline .
The signals from Odierno of U.S. military defiance of the withdrawal agreement suggest that the Pentagon and military leadership still do not take seriously the views of the Iraqi public as having any role in determining the matter of foreign troops in their country .
Nevertheless , the withdrawal agreement is still subject to a popular referendum next July , and Iraqi politicians have already warned that evidence of U.S. refusal to abide by its terms will affect the outcome of that vote .
Washington
Post reporters quoted Sunni legislator Shata al - Obusi as saying that Iraqis " will see this procrastination and they will vote no against the agreement , and after that the government should cancel it according to its provision " .
Beyond the aim of getting Obama to abandon his 16 - month plan , the military and Pentagon group still hopes to pressure Obama to agree to a long - term U.S. military presence in Iraq .
Further evidence emerged last week that Gates is a central figure in that effort .
In a Washington Post column Dec. 11 , George Will quoted Gates as saying that there is bipartisan congressional support for " a long - term residual presence " of as many as 40,000 U.S. troops in Iraq , and such a presence for " decades " has been the standard practice following " major U.S. military operations " since the beginning of the Cold War .
Those statements evidently represent part of the case Gates , Mullen and the military commanders are already making behind the scenes to get Obama to acquiesce in the subversion of the intent of the U.S. - Iraq agreement .

Congressional miscreants just turned down a measly $ 15 billion bailout for the automakers , but apparently had no problem approving $ 700 billion for the big bankers , albeit that the approval required a second try .
Apparently , the automakers lacked the clout to threaten martial law , did not have a Goldman Sachs stand - in like Hanky Panky , our " beloved " Treasury Secretary , to champion their cause , and could not order an orchestrated PPT takedown of the Dow by 777 points .
The automakers had to come up with a plan to show that the $ 15 billion bailout would make their continuance as an ongoing business concern viable , while Hanky Panky was given carte blanche , no questions asked , over the first $ 350 billion of the TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program , a /k / a the Paulson Ponzi Plunder Plan ) money , after lying to Congress about what the funds would be used for in the first place .
Apparently , the gravitational attraction of the super - massive black hole of the banking industry losses was strong enough to attract and suck in taxpayer funds , while the miniature black hole of the auto industry could not apply the necessary " sucking " power for this purpose .
After all , we have to make sure that a large number of future serfs are impoverished to force them to their knees to accept the coming one - world Orwellian police state under King Obama , while the sociopaths in big banking continue to leach their salaries , bonuses , dividends , golden parachutes and banking takeover money ( i.e. competition elimination ) from their taxpayer victims , sucking their blood dry until they are nothing but wizened husks who have no strength left to resist the corporatist fascist order - in - the - making lead by the new would - be lords of the universe , the satanic trillionaire Puppet Masters who run our shadow government , slime - ball pond - scum like Rockefeller , Rothschild and the Black Nobility of Britain and Europe .
Worse yet , after receiving the extorted Paulson Ponzi Plunder largesse based on outright lies as to its intended purpose , the banking pirates and brigands continue to horde their booty , and have exacerbated the problems of the auto industry many fold with their unwillingness to fund car loans , or any other loans for that matter , that the auto industry might need to survive .
King Obama will pay the auto industry lip service and give them a token bailout , after which they will fail , probably in about six months .
This will take place before the Fed attempts to re-inflate our economy as the Big Sting Two gets underway , to make sure that the auto industry is destroyed , just as Bear Stearns was assassinated before the Fed rescue plans , that could have saved it , were implemented .
The elitist 's will sing : " we tried , but we could n't do it , we tried , but we could n't do it ... "
This comes after GM management apologized , with crocodile tears , for its destruction of its auto business , which its executives , under orders from the Puppet Masters , intentionally and malevolently brought about to pave the way for the nationalization of our auto industry while busting our unions and shipping our good - paying jobs overseas in the process .
After all , in a quasi- pseudo - capitalist nation like the US , you can only nationalize a failed business , not a successful one .
Successful businesses are allowed to continue to function as an ongoing concern , at least for now , as part of the facade put on for purposes of making us continue to believe that our nation still has a " capitalist " system , when what we really now have is a corporatist , fascist police state .
The banking industry will be nationalized also , but its uses and purposes have not yet been fully served , so our puppet government of marionettes , with strings leading to the Puppet Masters , continues to prop up our zombie banking industry while stuffing nuts of taxpayer largesse into their baggy little cheeks in preparation for a long , hard winter , to give the impression that they are still solvent while tens of trillions in gargantuan derivative losses continue to go unrecognized due to our so - called regulators looking the other way while bending the Sarbanes - Oxley rules to suit the purposes of their banking masters .
The banking industry , including the Fed , which is destroying its balance sheet with toxic waste to keep its member banks going , will eventually be nationalized , but after it has been used to re-inflate our economy , thus causing hyper- stagflation , and ensuring the Second Great Depression in the aftermath of that hyperinflation .
After all , when you are staring double digit interest rates in the face , everything locks up and you have a crack - up - boom .
This re-inflation will take place in order to complete the Big Sting Two .
They will run up the stock and bond markets in one final massive rally , so they can bail out of all paper assets , behind everyone else 's backs , through their opaque , unregulated dark pools of liquidity like Project Turquoise and Baikal , and then plow their proceeds into precious metals , commodities , real estate , infrastructure ( which infrastructure King Obama will fund upon taking office ) and other real , tangible assets through the use of unregulated markets like the OTC and dark pools , again to hide what they are doing , while leaving everyone else , their sucker - dupes , holding the proverbial bag .
Buy gold and silver by the horde , or get vaporized in the Big Sting Two .
You either learn from 1929 , or get hammered in 2009 .
You learn from the Big Sting One , or you get totally annihilated in the Big Sting Two .
After all , as the saying goes , those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it .
Our problems as a nation and a world are far beyond the extremes of the 1930s .
All stops have been pulled .
The creation of fiat currencies and credit has gone berserk .
Modern central banking is on the edge of extinction , as we ’ve known it .
The insiders went too far this time .
The creation of structured finance , poor lending standards and derivatives have doomed the financial system .
Banks did not believe they were at risk selling this toxic waste to others , but as it turns out they were .
They securitized debt and colluded in bogus ratings in mortgages via CDOs , MBSs and SIVs and ABS as well ( asset - backed securities . )
As it turns out all of these bonds consisting of real debt and derivatives were another big banking and Wall Street lie .
The result is that it is impossible for any kind of bottom to be found in debt for a minimum of two years and probably in three to four years .
What sticks out like a sore thumb is the concentration of the issuance of debt by five legacy , money center banks that control 70 % of lending .
These are the bankrupts that the American taxpayer is being forced to keep from going bankrupt by pouring trillions of dollars into their balance sheets .
This is not a solution .
It is throwing good money after bad .
The solution is the 5,000 plus regional banks that are solvent .
They should be assisted in taking on part of the load and that these five big banks should be partly dismantled .
The big five Illuminist banks wo n’t lend and are cutting credit lines , which is exacerbating the situation and running the economy into the ground .
The economy needs liquidity not austerity .
All the taxpayer liquidity created has gone on the balance sheets of these banks .
All the Treasury and the Fed has done is rescue these banks and has allowed the economy to deteriorate .
Home prices will fall another 20 % as a result of overbuilding and a lack of any lending standards .
That will encompass the next few years .
If private credit is not extended to business , industry and to consumers the economy will contract that much faster .
Saving the big banks serves no useful purpose if we go into depression .
All the Illuminists care about is preserving their power and influence .
They have theirs and could care less about the American people .
This has to stop , but it wo n’t until the system collapses .
We are seeing the result of crass greed .
These so - called investment vehicles were not created to provide true value to the buyer , but to maximize profits by the lender via leverage .
It was all a giant scam .
No one calls it that , but that is exactly what it was .
When we said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were leveraged 100 to 1 , 4 - 1/ 2 years ago , we set a short at $ 69.00 a share .
We knew what they were doing would end in disaster , and it did .
We covered the short at $ 0.80 .
The big five legacy banks were leveraged at 20 to 30 to one and eventually that caught up with them thanks to CIBC , Oppenheimer ’s top equity analyst Meredith Whitney , who changed the course of history by stating the simple truth .
The game of structured finance reversed and de-leveraging began not only for these big five banks , but for hedge funds and the entire world economy .
We are now 18 months into the credit crisis and there is no solution in sight .
Congress continues to give taxpayer funds for bailouts of the gangster - banksters who made millions and billions creating this mess .
These funds are directed to all the elitists who created or benefited from the criminal activity .
A good part of investment banking is no longer a viable business model and that is a positive development .
Fraud is everywhere .
At Wachovia , Bear Stearns , Lehman , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Indy Bank and Washington Mutual , yet the SEC sees nothing .
No civil and no criminal charges .
Over and over we have pointed out there is two scales of justice :
One for the rich , connected elitists and the other for us .
It is no wonder Dick Cheney has $ 85 million invested in a prison company for the poor .
The rich are too big to go to jail and their banks , brokerage and insurance companies are too big to fail .
That may be the ultimate scam .
Securities fraud is now only found at small and mid-sized brokerage firms and with small brokers and with an occasional newsletter writer .
Our government is a disgrace .
The financial system is a great dark hole .
It has already collapsed .
The elitists are trying to hold it together with bailing wire and chewing gum , called money and credit and loans .
It wo n’t work .
The system is so seized up that lenders can no longer flog credit - card debt .
The well has run dry .
It is inflate or die .
Our problems as a nation and a world are far beyond the extremes of the 1930s .
All stops have been pulled .
The creation of fiat currencies and credit has gone berserk .

The big five legacy banks were leveraged at 20 to 30 to one and eventually that caught up with them thanks to CIBC , Oppenheimer ’s top equity analyst Meredith Whitney , who changed the course of history by stating the simple truth .
The game of structured finance reversed and de-leveraging began not only for these big five banks , but for hedge funds and the entire world economy .
We are now 18 months into the credit crisis and there is no solution in sight .
Congress continues to give taxpayer funds for bailouts of the gangster - banksters who made millions and billions creating this mess .
These funds are directed to all the elitists who created or benefited from the criminal activity .
A good part of investment banking is no longer a viable business model and that is a positive development .
Fraud is everywhere .
At Wachovia , Bear Stearns , Lehman , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Indy Bank and Washington Mutual , yet the SEC sees nothing .
No civil and no criminal charges .
Over and over we have pointed out there is two scales of justice :
One for the rich , connected elitists and the other for us .
It is no wonder Dick Cheney has $ 85 million invested in a prison company for the poor .
The rich are too big to go to jail and their banks , brokerage and insurance companies are too big to fail .
That may be the ultimate scam .
Securities fraud is now only found at small and mid-sized brokerage firms and with small brokers and with an occasional newsletter writer .
Our government is a disgrace .
The financial system is a great dark hole .
It has already collapsed .
The elitists are trying to hold it together with bailing wire and chewing gum , called money and credit and loans .
It wo n’t work .
The system is so seized up that lenders can no longer flog credit - card debt .
The well has run dry .
It is inflate or die .
We keep hearing of a bubble in US Treasuries .
What happens to the funds received by those who sold out ?
The only real option is gold and silver related assets and Swiss franc Treasuries .
RBC
Cash Consumer
Attitudes plunged to an all - time low – as bleak economic news appears daily .
Their Consumer and Spending by Household Index was 15.3 for December , 19.4 points below November ’s 34.7 level and almost at the all - time low of 14.6 reached in July 2008 .
There are 12 states on the brink of insolvency and 20 states are right behind them .
The states have to raise taxes and cut spending just to pay unemployment benefits .
You are about to see the value of the Swiss franc versus other currencies , especially the US dollar .
Now that 84.80 has been broken , the dollar is free fall to 71.16 .
That means the government can no longer effectively support the stock market .
The first alternative , of course , is gold and silver as hyperinflation and stagflation raise their ugly heads .
In the dollar and the Dow the technicals have collapsed .
On the other hand they are strengthening for gold , silver and the franc .
This opens up the next very dangerous chapter in this depression .
The Treasury has been borrowing short and lending long and will have a tough time selling 10 - year notes , and 7 - year and 30 - year bonds .
This is a sure recipe for bankruptcy .
As paper gets harder to sell , tax revenue is drying up .
Eventually next year interest rates will finally rise .
This is when the solvency of the US and the Treasury comes into play .
When that happens there will be a currency panic and devaluation .
If the US still has gold the value will be set at $ 2,000 or higher to back the dollar .
If there is no gold then anything goes .
The strongest underlying reason the Fed wants to issue bonds is so that it can bypass congressional approval on the debt level .
This is a method of undermining all constitutional checks and balances .
This makes us believe the US has no gold left .
A New York Times / Bloomberg poll has found 55 % of Americans say they do not believe the government should be responsible for funding a bailout plan ; 57 % want the government to do something about the problem by intervening to stabilize the economy .
Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG yesterday agreed to buy back a total of nearly $ 30 billion in risky auction - rate securities regulators said the banks marketed to customers as safe .
The Securities and Exchange Commission formally approved the accords with the two banking giants following preliminary deals reached in August .
Securities regulators in Texas and New York also disclosed details of final agreements with the banks .
Tens of thousands of the banks ' customers bought the securities before the $ 330 billion market for them froze in mid-February , the SEC said in revealing the final accords .
The new settlements were the largest return of customer money in the agency 's history and all the investors will be made whole , SEC chairman Christopher Cox said in a statement .
Citigroup and Switzerland 's UBS neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlements .
New York - based Citigroup agreed to buy back about $ 7 billion in the securities from affected customers , while UBS 's repurchase totaled $ 22.7 billion .
Again none of the connected go to jail .
Eight current and former Fidelity Investments employees will pay more than $ 1 million to settle federal charges they improperly received gifts from brokers seeking the Boston mutual fund company 's vast trading business , the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday .
They are among a group of 13 current and former employees charged with wrongdoing by the agency earlier this year for accepting $ 1.6 million worth of gifts and entertainment - free plane rides , golf outings , concert tickets - in violation of federal rules limiting such gifts .
All but two of the 13 have now settled .
Fidelity itself agreed in March to an $ 8 million settlement with regulators .
The family - controlled firm did not admit or deny wrongdoing .
Again none of the connected go to jail .
A $ 14 billion emergency bailout for U.S. automakers collapsed in the Senate Thursday night after the United Auto Workers refused to accede to Republican demands for swift wage cuts .
Talk about suicidal .
However , it was expected that GOP senators would prevent an automaker bailout .
Perhaps the bursting of a flimsy hope is enough to wreck fragile markets .
We think that the markets fear that the US Senate reluctance to bailout US automakers indicates that the massive US bailout movement is ending .
GM and Chrysler will probably declare bankruptcy .
This will force the UAW to renegotiate its contract .
Then the US Senate is likely to fund the rejuvenation of US automakers .

When the new Congress returns to Washington next month , one of the first items of business for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee may be to subpoena Karl Rove .
The move will put the new Obama administration in an unexpectedly dicey situation , as the next attorney general will have to decide whether or not to defend President Bush 's longtime political adviser should he tell the committee to bug off .
That ’s what Rove did over the summer after the committee asked him to come up to the Hill to answer questions about any role he might have played in pushing the prosecution of Alabama 's former Democratic governor Don Siegelman .
Critics had charged that the prosecution , which resulted in Siegelman 's conviction on bribery charges , had been politically motivated and orchestrated by the White House itself .
Rather than answer the committee 's questions , Rove left the country .
His lawyer argued that President Bush ’s exercise of executive privilege gave Rove " absolute immunity " from ever testifying before Congress ...

Something We All Can Agree On
This comic comes to us from Dueling Analogs ( reformatted it to fit my margins ) .
Regarding Henry
These days the changeling myth has lost much of its fearsomeness , although parents who learn of it probably have fleeting thoughts about how terrible it could be .
With The Stolen Child , author Donahue takes this ancient scenario out of the fantasy realm and into the real one .
To immerse one ’s self into the narratives of Henry , the stolen child now trapped in a time warp , and other Henry , the hobgoblin who stole his identity and his very life , is to delve into the profound psychological effects that such a switch , if possible , might cause .
Living forever and never aging sounds enticing , until the consequences , the gains and losses , are considered in their entirety .
Similarly , the strain of pretending to be , and ultimately becoming , somebody else , would be equally burdensome .
The Stolen Child is a tale that can be experienced on several other levels .
There is the practical , eg , how could such an exchange be accomplished ?
There is the philosophical , eg , how could one be one ’s self and someone else at the same time ?
And would it be worth trying to adjust to the changes ?
There ’s the emotional , leaving one ’s home / family / clan and breaking / forming different bonds .
And of course there ’s the simple adventure of it all .
Real Henry ’s situation is complex enough , but the substitute Henry must cope both with his new life and with several others as they become manifest to him .
Donahue is a skilled writer , creating enthralling characters , plots , dialog , and consciousness .
More than a coming of age story , it ’s a study of human nature and basic needs .
This debut novel is reminiscent of some of Neil Gaiman ’s work , though with less of the magical and more of the existential .
But like Gaiman , Donahue explores the archetypal themes of loss , love , identity , survival , and moving on .
Here ’s hoping for a new Donahue release sooner than later !
Brutal analysis of John McCain and his campaign from Thomas DeFrank at the New York Daily News :
The collapse of McCain ’s Hail Mary intervention capped a tumultuous week which saw the Arizona Democrat ’s lead over Obama evaporate and his running mate deliver a ragged and at times impenetrable TV interview .
With economic jitters playing to traditional Democratic dogma , McCain ’s Big Mo suddenly reverted to his challenger .
“ This is the attention - deficit - disorder campaign , ” said a bewildered senior Republican operative .
“ They ’ve had a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad week . ”
In the process , McCain invited questions about his judgment and ability to work his will in Washington if elected .
“ This raises the fundamental issue of how a guy who is hated by his own party can govern , ” fretted a GOP mandarin who worked for several Presidents .
“ If he ca n’t control the Republicans , how can he run a country ? ”

( Adds Sharp ’s withdrawal statement on stake in solar venture )
TOKYO , Nov 27 ( Reuters ) - Japan's Sharp Corp 6753.T , Italy's Enel SpA ENEI .
MI and a third partner are likely to invest more than $ 2.6 billion in Italian solar power ventures to tap growing demand for cleaner energy despite a global economic slowdown .
Top solar power firms are hurrying to expand capacity even as the sector smarts from a worsening global economy , which is drying up financing for new ventures , forcing smaller solar power firms to push back capex plans and putting pressure on big players to recoup their investments faster .
Sharp , the world ’s No.2 maker of solar cells , said on Thursday it and Italy ’s largest power company Enel planned to spend about 100 billion yen ( $ 1.05 billion ) to set up solar power generating plants in Italy with a total generating capacity of 189 megawatts by the end of 2012 .
The two and another manufacturer also plan to build a factory in Italy to produce thin - film solar cells , with an initial investment of at least 72 billion yen , it said .
That could grow to more than 150 billion yen when the factory reaches full capacity of about 1 gigawatts .
Sharp is stepping up investment and overhauling its business model in an effort to retake market share from No.1 solar cell maker Q - Cells QCEG.DE of Germany , whose aggressive capital spending plans outstrip those of its rivals .
The consumer electronics maker is reinventing itself as a device maker , supplying or planning to supply liquid crystal display panels to Japanese TV makers such as Sony Corp 6758.T , Pioneer Corp 6773.T and Toshiba Corp 6502.T .
It will now sell equipment to the joint venture and charge fees for its technology and solar operations know - how , in a step towards becoming an all - rounder in the solar power industry , its Executive Vice President Toshishige Hamano told a news conference .
Sharp , which cut its annual profit outlook by one - third in October , could boost its sales in the short - term by selling its technology and any equipment it develops in a joint venture with semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd 8035.T .
But that could hurt its brand and deplete its technological edge in the long - run , an analyst said .
“ With LCD prices sliding , Sharp is under more pressure to recover its initial investment quickly , and the temptation for a quick fix is understandable , ” said Yoshihisa Toyosaki , President of J - Star Global Inc , an IT consultancy in Japan .
“ But this raises the cost performance of rivals with lower personnel costs and government backing .
It is not a strategy for a company with decades of experience and an established brand , ” he said .
In the future , Sharp also plans to step up production of silicon wafers and tie - up with a major U.S. polysilicon supplier to help it secure a steady supply of silicon starting in 2010 .
Sharp previously said it would take a 34 percent in the solar power generating venture , with Enel holding the rest , but it later retracted the statement to say that nothing has been decided , other than that Sharp will take a minority stake .
Sharp will also take a minority stake in the solar cell venture , which will have an initial output of 480 megawatts .
Capex at Sharp , which also plans a solar plant in Japan at a cost of 72 billion yen with an initial output of 480 megawatts by March 2010 , still lags Q - Cells , which has said it plans to raise capacity to 1,000 megawatts in 2009 and 2,500 megawatts in 2010 .
The global downturn is beginning to hurt the industry , though .
No.3 solar cell maker Suntech Power Holdings Co STP.N of China cut its sales forecast last week .
[ ID :nN20347462 ]
Shares of Sharp ended up 3.7 percent , outperforming the Tokyo bourse 's electrical machinery index .
IELEC.T , which rose 0.9 percent .

The Reason Sonic Lost His
Way finally explains to us all why we have n’t had a good Sonic game in awhile .
I ’m not impressed with the response .
David Claymen , on an IGN Three Red Lights podcast , has this to say after talking with a developer for Sonic Unleashed : “ I asked one of the developers at TGS , you know I was like , come on everybody just wants Sonic running , like whats up with the werehog ?
And he was like , well , here ’s the deal … he runs at this miles per hour , kilometers per hour , and he laid out all of the statistics on how fast this hedgehog goes , and he was like
In order to make a game where Sonic is running and everybody enjoys the whole thing we ’d have to design this many miles of level , and it was some ungodly number .
And he ’s like and that would be like maybe a three hour game and I was like wow , well that kinda stinks and he ’s like yeah , so we gotta do this other stuff . ”
So basically , the developer said they ’re putting in filler to make the game longer .
This is not cool .
Countless people , fans and critics alike , have said that all of this experimental stuff is n’t working .
Ever since Sonic Heroes this has been happening , and Sonic Team is n’t listening .
Here it is one more time : Sonic the Hedgehog is about speed .
If you are n’t willing to put in the effort to make a game like that , pass it on to someone else .
Sonic Adventure was , on the whole , a very good game .
Strip out Knuckles ’ and Big ’s levels and you ’d have an even better game , and one that was still a good five hours long .
While that is incredibly short for a game these days , people replay fun games a lot .
As long as I can have fun playing through it a few times , there ’s no reason it has to be twenty hours long .
In fact , I ’d much rather have a short , awesome game that I can play through many times instead of a long , mediocre game with a few awesome parts to it .
If it has awesome parts in it , I know the team could have done better , but did n’t for some reason .
It also makes it harder to play through a game again when to get to the good parts you have to suffer through parts that just are n’t as much fun .
Of course , if designing large levels is too much work , you could also spend more time on each Sonic game .
A new Mario game comes out once a generation now , and while I ’m not a huge fan of the 3d Mario games in general , they are still well designed and fun for a playthrough .
Mario Galaxy even managed to buck the trend of the previous two games and bring the game back to platforming first , exploration second , which makes the game infinitely more fun .
Now , if Sonic
Team were to design one game a generation , or even one game every couple of years instead of every year , I bet they could find the time to put in lots more level to make sure there was a decent amount of game , even with Sonic running at high speeds .
Say , five to ten hours .
They did it for Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast , they can certainly do it now if they ’ll put in the effort .
What this developer had to say just smacks of laziness and wanting to get the product out the door instead of making sure it ’s a good product .
Come on Sega , I know you guys can do better than that .
You ’ve shown us you can before now , so bring back the magic .
Now that I ’ve had my rant , bear in mind I have n’t actually played Sonic Unleashed yet .
I hope it will still be fun , but I hear that the werehog levels really drag .
I guess I ’ll find out soon enough though .
I felt the need to write this now because what the developer had to say about the current design philosophy of new Sonic games struck me as very much trying to use gimmicks to replace quality gameplay and provide padding to game length .
This is not the way to design a game .
Hopefully Sega and Sonic Team will decide to fix this soon .

GOP budget plan : Slash $ 10 billion from schools Budget proposal also would ask voters to divert health funds

Republican state lawmakers unveiled their answer Monday to the state 's budget crisis - a $ 22 billion plan that would avoid raising taxes , cut deeply into education spending and dip into voter - approved funds intended to pay for mental health services and children 's health care .
The plan is the Republicans ' first comprehensive proposal since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called a special legislative session last month to try to solve the state 's fiscal crisis .
That special session ended without any action by lawmakers , prompting Schwarzenegger to declare a fiscal emergency Dec. 1 , the first day on the job for newly elected legislators , and to call another special session to fix the budget .
Senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill of Modesto insisted Monday that raising taxes was not the answer to California 's problems .
Republicans have refused to consider tax increases as California 's money problems piled up , and they can block any budget that includes increases because both the Assembly and Senate must muster two - thirds votes to approve a spending plan .
" We have said time and time again that because California taxpayers , quite frankly , are more burdened than the average taxpayer in this country , and the fact that we are ground zero as it relates to the economic realities that this country and the world face right now , we 've got to find a better way , " Cogdill said .
The GOP budget plan would raise $ 6.5 billion of new revenue for the general fund and reduce spending by $ 15.6 billion over the next 18 months , about two - thirds of it from K - 12 schools .
The proposed cut in education is far deeper than Schwarzenegger and legislative Democrats have called for in separate plans for reducing the deficit .
As part of their proposal , Republicans also suggested measures they said could stimulate the economy , such as granting tax credits to businesses , and relaxing environmental and labor regulations .
Those would include extending deadlines to retrofit diesel engines in trucks and changing the rules on overtime pay and meal breaks .
Schwarzenegger had expressed frustration with Republicans for bringing little to budget negotiating sessions other than a refusal to raise taxes .
In a sign of how frayed relations between GOP lawmakers and the Republican governor have become , Schwarzenegger 's office was as critical of the Monday 's proposal as legislative Democrats were .
" It 's simply a rehash of the tax cuts that have been on the table for months with some borrowing on top of that , " said Aaron McLear , Schwarzenegger 's spokesman .
" It 's not a negotiated compromise .
Until Republicans and Democrats negotiate with one another , our problem continues to get worse . "
Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , D - Santa Rosa , chairwoman of the Assembly Budget Committee , said the GOP plan balances the budget " on the backs of poor children and the mentally ill . "
Evans plans to convene a committee hearing today to consider the Republican plan .
If and when a vote is held , the Democrat - controlled panel is certain to reject it .
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) , said she would hold a floor session this afternoon to vote on a separate budget proposal , even though there was n't a deal in sight Monday .
Bass did not spell out what exactly was in the proposal , but she said it would include elements of plans put forward by Schwarzenegger and Democrats .
The governor has suggested nearly $ 10 billion in cuts and temporarily increasing the sales tax to help close the deficit , along with other revenue increases that would total around $ 12 billion .
Democrats have proposed a $ 17 billion mix of spending cuts and tax increases , including increasing the vehicle license fee .
Under the Republican lawmakers ' plan , the bulk of the new revenue - $ 6 billion - would be siphoned into the state 's general fund by asking voters to alter Proposition 63 , a 2004 measure that funded mental health services for homeless adults , and Proposition 10 , a tobacco tax approved in 1998 that pays for health care and education programs for young children .
A special election would be called to consider the changes .
The rest of the revenue would be generated by delaying certain loan payments and transferring money from other special funds .
The largest chunk of spending cuts , nearly $ 10 billion over the next 18 months , would come out of K - 12 education .
This year , the state is spending $ 58 billion on public schools .
Republicans also want to cut monthly payments for supplemental security income recipients - to $ 830 from $ 870 for singles , and to $ 1,407 from $ 1,524 from couples .
The Republican proposal also would reduce the Legislature 's operating budget across the board by 5 percent , including lawmakers ' salaries , and eliminate $ 6 million for Schwarzenegger 's plan to build an infrastructure to support hydrogen - powered cars .
The budget crunch is so bad that , unpleasant as they are , none of the proposals set forth by Schwarzenegger , Democrats and Republicans would eliminate a deficit now expected to hit $ 40 billion by June 2010 .
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer warned last week that budget problems were making it hard to sell voter - approved bonds that pay for public works projects .
Lockyer , state Controller John Chiang and Schwarzenegger 's finance director , Mike Genest , will decide Wednesday whether to halt spending on all such projects until lawmakers reach a budget solution .
With the state rapidly running out of cash , the need to find budget solutions quickly was one area that all sides seemed to agree on .
" If you keep doing business the way we 're doing business in California today , we 're heading for the cliff , " said state Sen.
Bob Dutton , R - Rancho Cucamonga ( San Bernardino County ) , vice chairman of the Senate Budget committee .
" We 've got to change . "
" And then we were promptly told where to go by the central stairway and again we were asked to wait with other guests while they checked other floors and checked other rooms and we all congregated into one space where they could protect us centrally . "

THERE is something weird and frightening about the sight of a modestly prosperous European country — assumed by most outsiders to have recovered from its rocky history of coups and civil strife — that is suddenly gripped by an urban uprising that the authorities cannot contain .
Greece 's travails seem all the odder after a recent economic record which , to judge by the basic numbers alone , looks tolerably good .
Could this take place in any seemingly stable democracy , or does the land of democracy 's birth have special features ?
Well , the incident that sparked Greece 's mayhem — the killing by police of a teenager — could have happened almost anywhere .
And there are many cities where an angry minority is ready to run amok : think of Budapest in 2006 or Paris in 2005 .
But in the Greek case a spasm of rage among youngsters and the bohemian underworld has laid bare a deeper seam of discontent : with corruption , maladministration and the sheer frustration of life at the bottom of the Athenian pile ( see article ) .
There are some proximate causes , including fury over scandals ( one involving a famous monastery ) that seem egregious even to a nation that reveres the church and often winks at petty larceny .
But far more important are problems that no Greek government has tackled .
To find out what they are , ask any of the Greek - born scholars , entrepreneurs , artists and other talented types who flourish all over the world but recoil at working in their homeland , much as they love it .
As any homesick Hellene can tell you , their country can be a maddening place for people with drive and flair .
The world 's universities are full of Greek academics , but the country 's own campuses are dogged by poor administration , strikes and a state monopoly on higher education .
In its university system Greece hews closer to the worst aspects of the Ottoman past ( such as bureaucracies that block innovation ) than does Turkey , with its fine range of public and private campuses .
In health , schooling and other public services , bad state provision fuels a huge under - the - counter market — creating in turn vested interests opposed to any change .
Life is tough for youngsters with energy and talent but no cash or connections .
To get anywhere , they spend all day in rotten state classrooms , then trek off to private night schools where the same teachers do a slightly better job in return for money .
Anybody who negotiates those hurdles must then face a dismal job market — either a dreary , dysfunctional public sector or a private sector crimped by crooked tax inspectors and crazed regulators .
Of course , none of this excuses the riots .
Indeed , many of the policies ( such as reinforcing the ban on private education ) that are advocated by self - appointed representatives of Greece 's angry young people would make their problems worse .
Serious as they are , many chronic woes have been masked , to some extent , by easy money : European Union subsidies , a boom in shipping , construction for the 2004 Olympics .
With the world recession , the mask is coming off , and Greece 's politicians face a dilemma .
Either they take on the vested interests that snarl things up , or the country risks forfeiting much of the economic and social progress that it has made .
Freedom depends on being courageous
To Greece 's rulers , the line of least resistance is often to do nothing , turning a blind eye to police corruption , or letting public servants pad out their salaries by taking money on the side .
But the cost of letting problems fester is now even greater than the cost of curing them .
Very soon one of Greece 's hard - pressed politicians — whether from the centre - right that now holds power , or the centre - left that leads in the opinion polls — will have to turn into a statesman .

But Jason Lawrence Cox , a local farmer , swore in an affidavit that he saw her on June 21 drive past piles of the Etheredges ’ belongings , dumped at the side of the road , and onto their farm .
The gang had looted the three family homes on the farm of all but the large mounted heads of an eland and a kudu , according to photos taken before and after the invasion .
They used a jackhammer to break through the foot - thick wall of the walk - in safe .
The haul from the homes and the farm included 1,760 pounds of ivory , 14 handmade guns , 14 refrigerators and freezers , 5 stoves , 3 tractors , a pickup truck and 400 tons of oranges , the family said .
Eleven days later , a far more violent farm invasion occurred at the home of Mike and Angela Campbell , also here in Chegutu .
Mr. Campbell , 76 , was the first farmer to take on Mr. Mugabe before the tribunal .
A gang came that Sunday afternoon , pouring out of a pickup truck and a bus , Mrs. Campbell said .
Her son - in - law , Ben Freeth , 38 , said that he was bludgeoned with rifle butts and that his skull and ribs were fractured .
Mike Campbell was also severely beaten .
Mrs. Campbell , 66 , said she was dragged by her hair , after her arm was broken in multiple places , and dumped next to her husband .
The doctor who treated them in the capital , Harare , signed affidavits confirming the severity of their injuries .
“ Mike was so battered , I hardly recognized him , ” Mrs. Campbell said .
“ I did n’t know he was alive until he groaned . ”
The three of them were loaded into the Campbells ’ truck and driven to a nighttime vigil of youth loyal to the ruling party at Mr. Moyo ’s base camp , she said .
Image Mr. Freeth circulated photographs of his injuries online after the invasion of his farm .
It was cold , and men poured freezing water over them .
Mr. Campbell drifted in and out of consciousness .
By the flickering light of bonfires , the youths denounced the Campbells as white pigs , Mrs. Campbell said , and ordered her to sing revolutionary songs .
She remembers singing a children ’s song instead , which enraged one of her intoxicated tormentors .
He charged at her , she said , trying to thrust a burning stick into her mouth .
Thursday , 13 Nov , 2008 Science
About 30 percent of women and 20 percent of men are afraid of spiders .
Scientists say that the obvious explanation is that people have obtained a fear of spiders due to the fact that we consider their bite poisonous .
A psychologist who works at the University of Würzburg , Germany , together with his team considers that if the upper stated theory is right then people should also be scared of insects that sting , such as , for example , bees and wasps , reports NewScientist .
In order to discover the truth that lies behind the fear of spiders , Georg Alpers and his colleagues carried out a survey asking 76 students to rate images of spiders , wasps , bees , beetles , butterflies and moths .
The participants had to rate the photos on three counts : the level of fear they inspired , how much fear they aroused and the level of disgust .
The study showed that students had much greater fear of spiders than other stinging insects .
They rated spiders as the most dangerous .
According to Stuart Hine , an entomologist at London 's Natural History Museum , being scared of spiders is a learned behavior .
He believes that it only takes a person to see someone standing on a chair yelling " Spider ! " and the individual will collect that fear .
" It stems back to the days of plagues when people suspected anything that crawled out of the thatch as carrying disease , " said Hine .
Two weeks before the Supreme Court will decide the fate of the Federal Communications Commission 's indecency policy , the head of the organization that broadcast the expletives behind the case offered a candid defense of his right to do so .
" If anyone had told me that my company would be before the US Supreme Court defending inane comments by Cher and Nicole Richie , I would have said you 're crazy , " News Corporation President and COO Peter Chernin told the Media Institute on Wednesday , accepting the group 's Freedom of Speech award .
On November 4 , the high court will decide whether News Corp 's Fox Television violated the FCC 's indecency rules by airing Cher and Richie 's off - the - cuff comments at the Billboard Music Awards , which included references to " cow shit " and use of the f-bomb .
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided in June of 2007 that the agency had not adequately explained why it suddenly abandoned its long - standing tolerance of " fleeting expletives " — unscripted dirty words said on the fly .
The FCC then appealed the decision to the Supremes , which , to the surprise of some First Amendment attorneys , agreed to take the case .
But crazy or not , Chernin warned that if the big nine back the FCC , it will make a big difference .
" If we are found in violation , just think about the radical ramifications for live programming – from news , to politics , to sports , " he warned .
" In fact , to every live broadcast television event .
The effect would be appalling . "
Pass on the whip cream
Still , Chernin could not help but distance himself from some of the indecency cases that are making their way through the FCC 's appeals process and the courts .
These include the agency 's crackdown on Married by America , a deservedly extinct TV show , one episode of which included some newlyweds partying at a strip club .
The FCC ruled that the scene was insufficiently pixelated .
Fox has refused to pay the fine and the case is in court .
" I 'll admit : some of the content we are defending is not particularly tasteful , " Chernin conceded .
" The expletives , the brief nudity , the carefully placed whipped cream and , of course , the pixels .
I would not have allowed my own children , when they were younger , to watch some of these shows . "
But Fox 's boss insisted that if the FCC wins on this issue , " it is the beginning of the steep slide toward censoring unpopular political content . "
Chernin noted that the FCC recently came pretty close in one instance to sanctioning a news program that included an expletive .
That was CBS 's Early Show , on which a guest declared that " I knew he was a bullshitter from Day One , " in an interview regarding another competitor in the Survivor TV series .
Originally the FCC wanted to sanction the program , then reversed course when CBS appealed the decision to the Second Circuit .
The Commission then conceded that the interview could be understood as a news feature and deserved First Amendment protection .
Nobody knows exactly why the Supreme Court took the Fox Billboard cases .
The justices could rule against the FCC narrowly , declaring that its new policy on fleeting expletives runs afoul of the Administrative Procedures Act .
The Supremes also could , as various former FCC chiefs have asked , take the opportunity to more strongly curtail the agency 's indecency powers .
Or the court could uphold the Commission 's new rulings .
Chernin told the Media Institute that , however the case gets resolved , Fox wo n't back down on this issue .
" As a media company , we have not just a right but a responsibility to stand up to the government when it crosses that First Amendment line in the sand–even if the content we are defending is in bad taste , " he said .
" And in the indecency context , that line has not only been crossed , it has been obliterated . "

Supermarkets talk up price cuts ... but hike prices by 21 %
Margin : Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons may be ' fattening up ' their profit margins at the expense of customers and suppliers .
Supermarkets have been accused of ' fattening up ' their profits while claiming they are cutting prices for shoppers .
A study reveals the stores have imposed alarming price increases on staple foods , despite advertising discounts on popular items .
The annual rate of increase in the cost of a typical shopping basket leapt to 21.3 per cent in November - adding more than £ 1,100 a year to family grocery bills .
The Liberal Democrats said supermarkets had ' no excuse ' for hiking prices at a time when their costs were coming down .
Falling commodity prices mean they are paying less to stock their shelves - but customers are being hit with price hikes for weekly essentials .
Critics claim the ' big four ' stores – Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons – may be ' fattening up ' their profit margins at the expense of hard - pressed customers and suppliers .
Yesterday , the Liberal Democrats said supermarkets had ' no excuse ' for hiking prices at a time when their costs were coming down .
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : ' There is clear evidence that oil , food and commodity prices are falling around the world .
These should be passed on by retailers .
' There really is no excuse for supermarkets to take advantage of the situation to fatten up their profit margins . '
Falling commodity prices mean they are paying less to stock their shelves – but customers are being hit with price hikes for weekly essentials .
Supermarket chains have seen a profits bonanza over the last 12 months .
Sainsbury 's last week revealed a 13.3 per cent hike in profits for the past six months .
Tesco , Asda and Morrisons have been doing just as well .
MySupermarket.com , which helped compile The Daily Mail Cost of Living Index , puts the annual rate of food and drink inflation at 6.2 per cent .
However the cost comparison site says it found ' drastic ' increases on a small group of items bought by households every week .
It means a typical family 's food bills shot up by 21.3 per cent this month .
In October the rate of increase was just 14.1 per cent .
A family spending £ 100 each week a year ago would have to find an extra £ 1,107 a year to put the same items on the table based on these figures .
This has fuelled suspicions that the stores are failing to pass on savings to customers .
But experts believe the latest inflation figures will be a watershed for the cost of living , heralding a wave up price cuts .
‘ October looks likely to post something of a reversal , ’ said Investec economist David Page , although Mr Page remains wary of the potential inflationary impact of the pound ’s sharp recent fall against the dollar and the euro .
But after wrestling with rising inflation for a year , the prospect of deflation is now the major threat to rate - setters as prices fall in a looming recession .
More interest rate cuts are set to come on top of the bold 1.5 per cent slash to 3 per cent two weeks ago as the Bank of England ’s latest forecasts show it undershooting its 2 per cent inflation target by more than 1 per cent if rates are held at current levels .
Bank Governor Mervyn King last week said it was ‘ very likely ’ that the wider Retail Prices Index measure will turn negative next year as mortgage payments fall .
Deflation is a serious threat because consumers and businesses can defer spending in expectation of falling prices , hitting the economy .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the Commons yesterday : ‘ Next year , the problem is deflation and the problem of inflation close to zero . ’
IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer expects CPI to stand at just 0.5 per cent next year .
‘ Inflation is poised to drop like a stone over the coming months due to lower oil , commodity and food prices , very favourable base effects and rapidly diminishing underlying inflation pressures , ’ he said .
Hot arguments about health benefits and / or negative effects of coffee are very common these days .
However , Scottish scientists recently announced a well - grounded reason on why this beverage should not be largely consumed by young ladies in particular .
They claim that coffee prevents female body from developing breasts at normal rate .
Coffee has been known for a long time for its numerous “ side effects “ .
First of all , regular consumption of coffee can lead to addiction such that the vegetative - vascular system refuses to work without caffeine .
Second of all , the drink contributes to a number of negative effects , such as yellow teeth , insomnia , gastritis , etc .
Yet , those facts can not stop the “ joe ” fans from enjoying the drink on a regular basis .
Around 2.5 milliard cups of coffee are consumed daily around the world .
The opponents of this “ addiction ” decided to make another strike , this time an aesthetic one .
A medical team from Lunds Universitet lead by Helena Jernström examined 270 young women who drink coffee regularly .
The study was aimed to prevent potential cancer threats .
In fact , earlier studies presented an interesting correlation between the breast cup size and the risk of breast cancer as well as a very rare form of heart cancer .
At the same time , however , scientists have determined that consumption of three cups of coffee per day increases the chances of avoiding those dangerous diseases .
Due to those observations , the scientists asked themselves what would happen if they excluded the intermediate link and examined the direct effect of coffee on the breast size .
Everything turned out to be exactly as they anticipated it to be .
They discovered statistically significant correlation between consumption of more than three cups of coffee per day during youth period and the cherished size during the prime - days .
Helena Jernström concludes that coffee definitely has impact on the cup size .
Yet , she adds that there is no need to fear complete disappearance of breasts , as the woman will still have them , however they will be slightly smaller than they would have been otherwise .
More detailed information on the results of the study can be accessed inside the British Journal of Cancer .

Samsung gave their point of view about OLED mobile displays in a keynote speech .
They like OLEDs because of the great picture quality , environmental issues and touchscreen compatiability .
Samsung says that by 2010 we will have OLED laptops - and 5 " and larger displays will be ' the mainstream '
In 5 years 28 % of laptops will use an OLED display ( yeah , exactly 28 % ) .
OLEDs will only cost 10 % more than LCDs by that time .
WASHINGTON  Federal officials are bringing far fewer prosecutions as a result of fraudulent stock schemes than they did eight years ago , according to new data , raising further questions about whether the Bush administration has been too lax in policing Wall Street .
Legal and financial experts say that a loosening of enforcement measures , cutbacks in staffing at the Securities and Exchange Commission , and a shift in resources toward terrorism at the F.B.I. have combined to make the federal government something of a paper tiger in investigating securities crimes .
At a time when the financial news is being dominated by the $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme that Bernard L. Madoff is accused of running , federal officials are on pace this year to bring the fewest prosecutions for securities fraud since at least 1991 , according to the data , compiled by a Syracuse University research group using Justice Department figures .
There were 133 prosecutions for securities fraud in the first 11 months of this fiscal year .
That is down from 437 cases in 2000 and from a high of 513 cases in 2002 , when Wall Street scandals from Enron to WorldCom led to a crackdown on corporate crime , the data showed .
You can almost hear the groans in the caves on the Afghan - Pakistan border .
" What 's going on ?!
Why can't they just keep rendering and torturing people ? ! "
A couple of years ago , the battle between American and al - Qaida propagandists for the Muslim world 's hearts and minds was an easy one for Osama Bin Laden 's men .
The group did n't have to do much apart from point out all those instances of death , destruction and torture that showed how what America said bared little resemblance to what it did .
Barack Obama 's victory challenges the perceptions that form the foundation of al - Qaida 's worldview , and it has left its supporters a little confused .
The group 's propaganda plays up the idea that the US is run by a coalition of rich , white , self - serving businessmen and politicians who use the word " freedom " to persuade the poor to fight for them .
In a message posted on the Counterterrorism Blog in January , al - Qaida 's Adam Gadahn repeated some of the organisation 's favourite themes : " Muslims , of course , are much better acquainted [ than the American public ] with what is right and who the victim is and realise that right is n't whatever is said , done and commanded by Western presidents , prime ministers , and televangelists .
" Muslims know what true values are … like liberating oneself and others from oppression , like honour , dignity and self - respect , like chastity and moral uprightness , like truth in word and deed , like showing mercy to the innocent , defenceless , and helpless , and fighting for them , and like giving one 's life for these values . "
The problem for al - Qaida is that the truth of America 's claim to social equality and rule of law looks evident in the deed of Barack Obama 's election .
With a president who is neither white nor from a rich and well - connected background , al - Qaida 's rhetoric is floundering .
The confusion is clear on websites used by the group 's supporters .
On the password - protected al - Hasbah website , one al - Qaida supporter , Abu Ahmed al Salafi wrote : " The election of this black man to the White House will improve the image of the new Rome in front of the world . "
It 's rare to hear al - Qaida backers talking forlornly about an American public relations coup .
It 's even less common to hear them say the achievement is acknowledged in Islamic tradition .
" Omar ( the second Caliph ) was right when he said Rome was the fastest to recover from a setback and that 's what 's happened with this black man , " adds Salafi .
The real game - changer here is that Obama challenges the higher moral ground al - Qaida assumes it commands when talking to its supporters .
Salafi later says : " According to my view , the election of McCain would have been been more useful to the Muslims than this black slave .
This is a Christian who is fanatically for the Jews . "
But the words Salafi has chosen in his state of confused frustration do n't sit well with other posters .
Later , another poster , Elhajgamal , asks ; " My noble brothers .
Because he is an infidel enemy we hate on behalf of God , is it permissible for us to address him by the colour of his skin ?
The answer from al - Nasr al - Islam : " We say he is black because he is not white .
There is no place for racism amongst Muslims . "
It 's often overlooked that al - Qaida promises a fairer society .
If its support is flagging , it 's because ordinary people have looked at its methods and wondered what sort of state it would run .
But the calls for an end to corruption , nepotism and restoration of pride , dignity and self - determination still resound just as they have for more than 100 years through other ideologies .
Al - Qaida 's brand has done well in the past seven years because of America 's mistakes rather than the group 's achievements .
By just proving its continued existence , it could assume an image on the streets of Cairo , Casablanca and Karachi as the plucky standard - bearer of Muslim pride .
The torture in Abu Ghraib and the detainees in Guantanamo were heaven - sent opportunities to say ; " Look !
Rule of law ?
Human rights ?
All lies .
None of that means anything to America . "
Since 9/11 , American public diplomacy in the Muslim world has been based on the assumption that over a billion people have unfortunately failed to realise that it is a force for good in the world .
The multimillion dollar answers have included Hi , a teen lifestyle magazine , and cheerleader television news station , al Hurrawhich aim to promote American interests .
But for all the telling , America was not showing the Muslim world how it lived up to its promises .
General public opinion in the Muslim world saw the same malevolent intention behind Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay that they blamed for Western support of Muslim dictators and Israeli excesses .
Al - Qaida simply tries to tap into that background sentiment and connect it to individuals ' own experiences .
When America starts showing that it can deliver social justice at home , it makes public opinion in the Muslim world wonder whether it can do so abroad .
However , the election only produces a window of opportunity for America , and Britain , to make a serious dent in al - Qaida 's rhetoric by proving their commitment to the ideas and principles for which they say they fight .
The Obama victory will require follow - up if he is to change perceptions .
Closing Guantánamo , as the president - elect has pledged , would be a great start .
BEIJING , Nov. 25 ( Xinhua ) -- China on Tuesday congratulated Obama 's economic team , saying the country would like to work with the new administration so as to promote bilateral ties .
" We noticed that U.S. President - elect Barack Obama had nominated some members of his government , and we express congratulations to them , " said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang at a regular briefing .
" We would like to strengthen cooperation with them so as to further promote the Sino - U.S. friendly and constructive cooperation in a wide range of fields . "
With the economy in crisis , Obama Monday unveiled his economic team to shore up financial markets and tackle the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
Timothy Geithner , the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , will become Secretary of the Treasury , and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will be head of the National Economic Council .
Meanwhile , Obama pledged he will propose a recovery plan for both Wall Street and the High Street , a plan " that stabilizes our financial system and gets credit flowing again , " while creating and saving 2 . 5 million jobs .
Obama 's team is putting together a new economic stimulus plan containing more than 500 billion U.S. dollars in federal spending and tax cuts over the next two years , Obama aides and advisers were quoted as saying .
Commenting on this " far more aggressive " recovery plan , Qin said each country should take measures based on its domestic situation to maintain a stable financial market , revive market confidence , and secure economic development .
" As the world 's biggest economy , the United States keeping its economic growth and financial stability matters much to the economic development of the world , " he said .
" We hope the U.S. economy can sustain development , which is good for China and the world .
The Chinese side will continuously coordinate and cooperate with the U.S. side to deal with the current international financial crisis . "
No deposit online casinos are the ideal solution for the first time gambler who is eager to see what the online gambling world has to offer , but is not quite sure whether to take the risk or not .
This may seem like a bold statement , but you will see for yourself when you sign up with any one of the many reputable online gambling establishments of this kind around that they do indeed offer a vast potential for risk free entertainment and enjoyment .
The main benefit of no deposit online casinos lies in the term “ no deposit ” .
What this simply means is that players are allowed to play a wide variety of some of the finest casino games in the industry without having to deposit any money for the privilege .
While there definitely many fine online gambling establishments on the Internet today , many of them will require you to place a certain amount of money into your online account before you can take in some of the action .
No deposit online casinos do away with this requirement and give you the opportunity to play with little more than a simple sign up process that anyone can complete within a matter of minutes .
Some no deposit online casinos do not even have this requirement , which means that getting started is a simple matter of logging on and clicking your way to superior casino enjoyment .
As you can imagine , such an offer is an attractive one indeed for the first time gambler who is eager to see what the fuss with online gaming is all about but is wary of taking the risks involved .
What kind of risks ?
Unfortunately there have been quite a few online casinos in the past that were little more than fronts for outright scam operations .
While these types of scam web sites are admittedly dwindling –the online casino industry is a strictly regulated one after all , with illegal web sites being shut down with regularity –it is inevitable that a few less than honest web sites would remain .
The prospect of losing money –sometimes considerable amounts–is something that anyone would like to avoid , all the more so the first time gambler who has little idea about what to expect from the online gambling scene .
No deposit casinos therefore serve as a safe entry point , a buffer or a test drive if you will , of what you can expect from a full blown online gambling experience , and you can try them out without risking a single cent of your own money .
No Deposit Rewards on Casino Games
In most case the gaming experience provided by no deposit online casinos is virtually indistinguishable from the “ real thing ” because they are in fact the “ real thing . ”
Many of these types of web sites offer a full range of casino games , services , rewards and amenities that would n’t be out of place in even the finest online gambling establishments .
Check them out for yourself and you will see that these are by no means cut down or crippled versions of full casino software packages with the only difference–perhaps benefit would be a better word–being they are absolutely free .
Stunning graphics , speaker shaking sounds , fast , intense game play , considerable rewards …all of these are common characteristics of the current crop of no deposit online casinos .
Now hold on for just a minute ; did we just say “ considerable rewards ” ?
Well , we did in fact , which brings up the question :
How are no deposit online casinos able to offer rewards–big ones at that –without requiring their players to deposit any money to begin with ?
You would think that with such a policy that no deposit online casinos would be doomed to bankruptcy in no time flat , instead of enjoying the booming business that they apparently do !
The fact of the matter is that with the many customers who are eager to try out what no deposit online casinos have to offer , a large number of them will likely enjoy what they see , and be sufficiently inspired to check out the other paid offerings of these online casinos .
Yes , that ’s right : in many cases no deposit online casinos serve as the front for other business operations … but in a good way .
Many paid online casinos build a no deposit online casinos section in order to attract first time gamblers to their web site in the hopes that they will become paying customers later on .
Of course it is a fairly risky move , the success of which depends in large part on the quality and excellence of the service that you can provide with the no deposit online casinos to begin with .
In any case , it seems to be paying off , and a large number of users do end up becoming paying regulars after starting out in the no deposit online casinos .
In this sense , no deposit online casinos can be seen as a marketing tool for the real bread and butter operations of an online gambling , and an effective one at that .
Special Perks , Cash and No Deposit Bonuses
No deposit online casinos are also virtual businesses at their core , based on the Internet and on software that simply mimics the operations of land based casinos .
This means that they have less bills to pay with regard to property or space rental , employee salaries , utility bills and a myriad other expenses that land based casinos typically have to deal with .
The bottom line of course is that they are able to turn a much larger profit than their land based counterparts , some of which they are able to five back to the players in the form of bonuses , perks and other rewards .
It is a win -win situation that on the side of the no deposit online casinos means hordes of new players that will be attracted to their services and wares , and on the side of the player a superior online gambling experience that comes with absolutely no risk whatsoever on top if the chance to win some truly staggering cash rewards .

New research by the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) has demonstrated for the first time that human activity is responsible for significant warming in both polar regions .
The findings by a team of scientists led by UEA 's Climatic Research Unit will be published online by the Nature Geoscience this week .
Previous studies have observed rises in both Arctic and Antarctic temperatures over recent decades but have not formally attributed the changes to human influence due to poor observation data and large natural variability .
Moreover , the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) had concluded that Antarctica was the only continent where human - induced temperature changes had yet to be detected .
Now , a newly updated data - set of land surface temperatures and simulations from four new climate models show that temperature rises in both polar regions are not consistent with natural climate variability alone and are directly attributable to human influence .
The results demonstrate that human activity has already caused significant warming , with impacts on polar biology , indigenous communities , ice - sheet mass balance and global sea level .
" This is an important work indeed , " said Dr Alexey Karpechko of UEA 's Climatic Research Unit .
" Arctic warming has previously been emphasized in several publications , although not formally attributed to human activity .
However in Antarctica , such detection was so far precluded by insufficient data available .
Moreover circulation changes caused by stratospheric ozone depletion opposed warming over most of Antarctica and made the detection even more difficult .
" Since the ozone layer is expected to recover in the future we may expect amplifying Antarctic warming in the coming years . "

The precarious state of relations with the nations at war in Europe , particularly Germany , made Wilson fear for national security in the event of an interregnum  which then , before the ratification of the 20th Amendment in 1933 , lasted more than a month longer than it does today .
A former professor of political science who had studied and admired parliamentary systems , Wilson decided upon a drastic plan to shorten this uneasy period .
Image Credit ... Luba Lukova
Two days before the election he had a sealed letter , which he had typed himself , hand - delivered to the secretary of state , who was then third in line of succession to the presidency .
Wilson wrote that if he lost he would immediately appoint his Republican opponent , Charles Evans Hughes , secretary of state , and then he and his vice president would resign , making Hughes president at once .
Wilson said he was proposing this plan because those were not “ ordinary times ” and “ no such critical circumstances in regard to our foreign policy have ever existed before . ”
But Wilson won California , by just 3,806 votes , and he stayed in office to lead the United States into World War I and make peace afterward .
His plan for a shortened interregnum never saw the light of day .
The only other people who even knew what he ’d proposed were his wife and the secretary of state , Robert Lansing , who first revealed it in his posthumously published memoirs in 1935 .
The revelation came too late to save the country from what has been called “ the interregnum of despair ” between Franklin Roosevelt ’s election in November 1932 and Herbert Hoover ’s departure from office on March 4 , 1933 .
Hoover had served under Wilson and admired him , and he might have adopted this plan if he had known about it .
Our current interregnum and its predecessor in 1933 have not been the only peril - filled transfers of power in our history  1861 was the scariest of them all  and there ought to be a way to avoid or at least shorten such anxious passages .
It is worth asking whether Woodrow Wilson ’s idea could be wisely applied now .
Back in Afghanistan , the mind turns to the small matter of savagery .
Not the routine cruelty of war but the deliberate inhumanity with which we behave .
The torture and killing of prisoners in this pitiful place – the American variety in Bagram and the Taliban variety in Helmand – is a kind of routine of history .
Even execution has to be made more painful .
A knife is more terrible than a bullet .
The cult of the suicide bomber in the Middle East began its life in Lebanon , moved to " Palestine " , arrived in Iraq , leached over the border here to Afghanistan and passed effortlessly through the Khyber Pass into Pakistan .
And New York .
And Washington .
And London ...
Are human beings at war – any kind of war – by definition bound to commit atrocities ?
The International Committee of the Red Cross tried to answer this question in a report four years ago .
Were combatants unaware of international humanitarian law ?
Unlikely , I would think .
They just do n't care .
The Red Cross enquiry interviewed hundreds of fighters in Colombia , Bosnia , Georgia – a bit of real prescience , there , on the part of the ICRC – and the Congo , and suggested that those who commit reprehensible acts see themselves as victims , that this then gives them the right to act savagely against their opponents .
Certainly , this might apply to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict , very definitely to the Serbs of Bosnia – I 'm not so sure about Georgia – and quite definitely to the Taliban ( not least when we 've been bombing more wedding parties ) .
Such cruelty is abetted with a bodyguard of clichés – " police operations " , " clean up " , " mop up " , " surgical strikes " – where you can kill by remote control , " especially when the media are not present to show the realities of a conflict " .
This is most certainly the case today , for what journalist will now dare to wander the village streets of Helmand or the city of Baquba in Iraq or , for that matter , the border towns of Pakistan ?
War has never , it seems , been so underreported .
And both the good guys and the bad guys like it that way ; they prefer to indulge in savagery unseen .

There is nothing new in all this .
At the Battle of Omdurman – where the British executed all the Arab wounded – the young Winston Churchill wrote of a sight which is familiar today in a land which was then called Mesopotamia and in another which was already called Afghanistan .
He described " grisly apparitions " , of " horses spouting blood , struggling on three legs , men staggering on foot , men bleeding from terrible wounds , fish - hook spears stuck right through them , arms and faces cut to pieces , bowels protruding , men gasping , crying , collapsing , expiring ... " .
To the men can now – this very week – be added the suicide - bombed schoolgirls of Baghdad .
In his earlier military campaign on the North West Frontier , Churchill saw how some of the Taliban 's ancestors dealt with a wounded British officer : the leader of " half a dozen Pathan swordsmen ... rushed upon the prostrate figure and slashed it three or four times with his sword .
I forgot everything else at this moment except a desire to kill this man .
I wore my long cavalry sword well sharpened ...
The savage saw me coming ... " .
Well there 's something for the ICRC to think about .
Yet it pays to remember that Afghan wars have always been dreadful .
Sir Mortimer Durand – he who created the Durand line which masquerades as the Afghan - Pakistani border , crossed with such impunity today by Americans and Taliban warriors in order to kill each other – witnessed the cruelty of the Afghan war at first hand .
" During the action in the Chardeh valley on the 12th of Dec 1879 , " he wrote , " two squadrons of the 9th Lancers were ordered to charge a large force of Afghans in the hope of saving our guns .
The charge failed , and some of our dead were afterwards found dreadfully mutilated by Afghan knives ... I saw it all ... "
Yet Durand himself objected profoundly to a statement from General Frederick Roberts – he of Kandahar fame – after the murder of the British mission diplomats in Kabul .
The killings had been " a treacherous and cowardly crime , which has brought indelible disgrace upon the Afghan people ... all persons convicted of playing a part in ( the murders ) will be dealt with according to their deserts " .
Durand confronted Roberts over this Victorian version of the message that George Bush would give to the Afghans 122 years later .
" It seemed to me so utterly wrong in tone and in matter , " Durand would later write , " that I determined to do my utmost to overthrow it ... the stilted language , and the absurd affectation of preaching historical morality to the Afghans , all our troubles with whom began by our own abominable injustice , made the paper to my mind most dangerous for the General 's reputation . "
Of course , it did Roberts no harm at all .
In the age of " shock and awe " – when a Canadian general can call his Taliban opponents " scumbags " – it still does n't seem to worry Nato officers .
They should know better .
Montgomery never cursed Rommel ; he kept a photograph of the Afrika Korps commander in his caravan to remind him of the man he was fighting .
But then again , did n't Montgomery fight in the age of the Holocaust , of industrial killing , of the Hamburg and Dresden firestorms ?
Indeed , the very Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 were supposed to end the mass destruction of human life .
And President Bush has torn them up .
I know it 's easy to ridicule the Red Cross .
There 's something very preachy about the post - war conventions .
But apart from the precedents of international law , it 's all we 've got .
Maybe a million Pushtu - language editions should be handed out to the Taliban and their followers as well as to the Nato combatants whom Barack Obama absurdly believes will win the Afghan war .
But I doubt it would do much good .
Victimhood sits easily on all our shoulders .
If Osama bin Laden had a conscience , it would be quickly eased by the destruction of the last Caliphate , the colonial occupation of the Muslim world , the deaths of millions of Arabs .
And if we have a conscience , what do we say ?
Remember 9/11 .
And so on we go .

I enjoy TED greatly .
The multidisciplinary approach is a perfect way to introduce yourself to new ways of thinking – and thinking in unconventional ways is something Paul Stamets has spent a lifetime doing .
Paul loves mushrooms – or more correctly , he loves fungi .
You can also download the MP4 , or add the video to iTunes .
I ’m not going to repeat the content of the video ( because you should watch it ! ) but I am going to highlight a few amazing thing I learned .
We are intimately related to fungi .
Animals and fungi are part of a larger group called Opisthokonta , that is , we share a common ancestor .
The same pathogens that attack fungi attack us – and some of the most promising and effective antibiotics come from fungi .
Unlike plants ( and like us ) fungi inhale oxygen and produce carbon dioxide .
Fungi used to rule the earth .
There ’s a common misconception that first there was life in the oceans , then plants grew around the oceans , and eventually basic animals wandered out somehow .
Not true .
Fungi were the first organisms to arrive on land , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
Why ?
Fungi can produce oxalic acid along with many other acids and enzymes in order to grab minerals they need to grow .
Where do they get these minerals ?
Well , as they moved out of the ocean they obtained them from rocks .
This slow process of calcium oxalate formation causes rocks to slowly crumble , and is the first step in producing the soil conditions necessary for plant growth .
So what , you may say – just more slime around a very old pond .
Well , not true !
This is the absolutely mindblowing part , and I was surprised that I ’ve never even heard of it before .
There are organisms called prototaxites which could reach sizes of up to 1 m ( 3 feet ) across and 8 m ( 24 feet ) high – all during a time when the largest plants were 2 feet tall .
The landscape of this early Earth must have been breathtaking .
The industrial potential of fungi has not yet been realized .
Not even close .
I think in this part of the talk he starts to run out of time , but what he manages to state is stunning .
Paul was involved in an experiment to gauge the effectiveness of various methods to remove petroleum waste .
Four piles of dirt were saturated with hydrocarbons .
One was left alone , one was treated with bacteria , the other with enzymes , and Paul ’s used fungi ( of course ) .
Fast forward six weeks – three of the piles remain “ dead , dark , and stinky ” , while the fungi - treated pile was covered in hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms .
Fast forward to eight weeks , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels ( a measure of the level of contamination of the soil ) went from 10,000 parts per million to 200 .
Not to mention that by the end of the experiment the fungi treated pile was the only one covered in grass …
There are more great examples in the talk itself .
I strongly recommend giving it a listen or three – it ’s about as far from my line of work as you could get , and I found myself absolutely fascinated .

Jean Charles de Menezes was not warned before he was shot dead by police , three witnesses told an inquest today .
The claim contradicts the police account that the innocent Brazilian was warned before being shot .
Ralph Livock and his girlfriend Rachel Wilson were sitting in a tube carriage opposite the 27 - year - old Brazilian , the inquest heard .
Nicholas Hilliard QC , counsel to the inquest , asked him if he heard the police shout a warning .
" Absolutely not , " Livock replied .
" And I remember that specifically because one of the conversations that Rachel and I had afterwards was that we had no idea whether they were police , whether they were terrorists , whether they were somebody else .
We just had no idea . "
Firearms officers involved in the operation have told the inquest they shouted " armed police " at De Menezes before shooting him .
Wilson also insisted she did not hear this and had no idea who the men who killed the Brazilian were .
Hilliard asked her : " Specifically , did you ever hear anybody shout ' armed police ' ? "
Wilson answered : " If I had heard that , I would have thought they were police , so no . "
Pressed on whether she heard anybody say anything during the shooting , she added : " That 's one of the things I recall the most - the silence . "
De Menezes was shot seven times in the head at point - blank range after being mistaken for failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman .
That morning , Livock got on to a northbound Northern Line train at Clapham North station with Wilson , the inquest heard .
While they were waiting at Stockwell station , he heard shouts from outside the train saying something like , " he 's here " .
Another commuter , Wesley Merrill , said he saw a man come on to the train and point at De Menezes , saying something like " that 's the guy " .
He could not recall hearing the officers say anything to De Menezes .
None of the passengers in the Tube train were called to give evidence at the Metropolitan Police 's Health and Safety trial over the shooting last year .
This is the first time they have spoken in public about what they saw .
The inquest continues .

Part 1
The contradictory meanings of Communism
There was a vision , called communism ,  which was held by Kropotkin and other anarchist - communists in the 19th and early 20th century .
Marx and Engels shared essentially the same goal .
In the stateless , classless , society of communism , the means of production would be held in common ( by the community ) , work would be carried out due to social motives rather than for wages , and consumer goods would be available to all according to their needs .
But during the Cold War , communism  came to mean something entirely different .
Great nations were ruled by self - named Communist Parties .
Their economies were managed by totalitarian states , their powerless workers produced commodities sold on the internal and international market , and they worked for wages ( that is , they sold their labor power as commodities to their bosses ) .
In that era ,  Communists  were mostly people who supported those types of state - capitalist tyrannies .
They included pro-Moscow Communist Parties , Maoists , other Stalinists , and most Trotskyists .
They called themselves  Communists ,  and so did most of their opponents .
On the other hand , anti-Communists  were not simply those who opposed such regimes but those who supported Western imperialism a group ranging from liberals to deranged fascists .
At the same time , the pro-Moscow types denounced libertarian socialists as anti-Communist as well as anti-Soviet .
Some people took to calling themselves anti-anti-Communists ,  as a way of saying that they did not endorse the Communists but were against the McCarthyite witchhunt .
Now we are in a new period .
The Soviet Union has collapsed , with its ruling Communist Party .
True , such states still exist , with modifications , in China , Cuba , and elsewhere .
Unfortunately , they inspire many people .
But overall , the number and weight of Communist Parties have diminished ..
In contrast , there has been an upswing in the number of people who identify with anarchism , with its mainstream in the anarchist - communist tradition .
Other people remain impressed by Marx , but look to libertarian and humanistic interpretations of his work .
How then shall we use the term communism today ?
Is its meaning the same as in earlier periods ?
I will review the history of the term and of its meanings .
While calling themselves socialists ,  the founders of the anarchist movement , Proudhon and Bakunin , denounced  communism . 
A typical statement by Proudhon is that communism is a dictatorial , authoritarian , doctrinaire system [ which ] starts from the axiom that the individual is subordinate to the collectivity ; the citizen belongs to the State  ( quoted in Buber , 1958 ; pp. 30 - 31 ) .
Bakunin wrote ,  I detest communism because it is the negation of liberty .
I am not a communist because communism necessarily ends with the concentration of property in the hands of the state ( quoted in Leier , 2006 ; p. 191 ) .
Proudhon called himself a  mutualist ;  Bakunin , a collectivist .
If we think of a monastery , or of an army ( where the soldiers are all given their food , clothing , and shelter ) , it is easy to see how communism ( of a sort ) can be imagined as inconsistent with democracy , freedom , and equality .
In his early writings , Marx denounced the program of crude communism  in which  the community is only a community of work and of equality of wages paid out by the community as universal capitalist 
( Marx , 1961 ; pp. 125-126 ) .
However , Marx and Engels did call themselves communists , a term they preferred to the vaguer socialist ,  although they used this also .
( They especially disliked the term social democratic ,  used by the German Marxists . )
Marxs concept of communism is most clearly explained in his  Critique of the Gotha Program . 
Communism would be  the cooperative society based on common ownership of the means of production  ( Marx , 1974 ; p. 345 ) .
In  the first phase of communist society ,  ( p. 347 ) there will remain scarcity and the need for labor .
 We are dealing here with a communist society as it emerges from capitalist society still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society  ( p. 346 ) .
In this lower phase of communism , Marx speculated , individuals would get certificates stating how much labor they had contributed ( minus an amount taken for the common fund ) .
Using their certificates , they can take means of consumption which used up the same amount of labor ; this is not money because it cannot be accumulated .
However , it is still a system of bourgeois rights and equality , in which equal units of labor are exchanged .
Given that people have unequal abilities and unequal needs , this equality still results in a certain degree of inequality .
Marx trumpeted ,  In a more advanced stage of communist society , when the enslaving subjugation of individuals to the division of labor , and thereby the antithesis between intellectual and physical labor , have disappeared ; when labor is no longer just a means of keeping alive but has itself become a vital need ; when the all - around development of individuals has also increased their productive powers and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly only then can society wholly cross the narrow horizon of bourgeois right and inscribe on its banner :
From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs ! ( p. 347 )
( For reasons known only to himself , Lenin re-labeled Marxs first phase of communist society  as socialism , and the more advanced stage of communist society  as communism .
Most of the left has followed this confusing usage . )
Despite his rejection of the term communism , Bakunin also advocated a two - phase development of the post - revolution economy , according to his close friend James Guillame .
Guillame wrote an essay in 1874 , summarizing Bakunins views .
 We should be guided by the principle , From each according to his ability , to each according to his need .
When , thanks to the progress of scientific industry and agriculture , production comes to outstrip consumption , and this will be attained some years after the Revolution , it will no longer be necessary to stingily dole out each workers share of goods .
Everyone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities .
In the meantime , each community will decide for itself during the transition period the method they deem best for the distribution of the products of associated labor .
( in Bakunin , 1980 ; p. 361-362 )
He mentions various alternate systems of remuneration for the transitional period ;  systems will be experimented with to see how they work out  ( p. 361 ) .
Todays proposals for Parecon ( participatory economics ) , in which workers are rewarded for the intensity and duration of their labor in a cooperative economy , would fit into Bakunins or Marxs concept of a transitory , beginning , phase , of a free society .
But unlike the Pareconists , Marx and Bakunin recognized that this was still limited .
For both Marx and Bakunin , then , full communism requires a very high level of productivity and potential prosperity , a post - scarcity economy , when there is plenty of leisure time for people to participate in decision - making , at work and in the community , ending the distinction between order - givers and order - takers .
However , neither Marx nor Bakunin described a social mechanism for moving from one phase to the other .
Kropotkin rejected the two - phase approach of the Marxists and the anarchist - collectivists .
Instead he proposed that a revolutionary society should transform itself immediately into a communist society ,  ( 1975 ; p. 98 ) , that is , should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the more advanced ,  completed , phase of communism .
Kropotkin and those who agreed with him called themselves anarchist - communists  ( or communist anarchists  ) , although they continued to regard themselves as a part of the broader socialist movement .
It was not possible , Kropotkin argued , to organize an economy partially on capitalist principles and partly on communist principles .
To award producers differentially by how much training they have had , or even by how hard they work , would recreate class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything .
Nor is it really possible to decide how much individuals have contributed to a complex , cooperative , system of production , in order to reward them according to their labor .
Instead , Kropotkin proposed that a large city , during a revolution , could organize itself on the lines of free communism ; the city guaranteeing to every inhabitant dwelling , food , and clothing in exchange for five hours work ; and all those things which would be considered as luxuries might be obtained by everyone if he joins for the other half of the day all sorts of free associations . ( p.p. 118-119 )
This would require the integration of agricultural with industrial work , and physical with mental labor .
There remained an element of coercion in Kropotkins proposal .
Presumably able - bodied adults who would not contribute five hours of work would not get the guaranteed minimum .
Anarchist - communism came to predominate among anarchists , so that it became rare to find an anarchist ( except for the individualist anarchists ) who did not accept communism , whatever other disagreements they may have had among themselves .
Meanwhile the Marxists had long been calling themselves social - democrats .
When World War I broke out , the main social democratic parties endorsed their capitalists  war .
Lenin called on the revolutionary wing of international social democracy to split from the traitors to socialism .
As part of this , he advocated that his Bolshevik Party and similar parties call themselves Communist Parties , going back to Marx .
Some of his followers complained that this would confuse the workers , making the Bolsheviks sound like the anarchist - communists .
Lenin declared that it was more important to not be confused with the reformist social democrats .
Lenin got his way ( as he usually did in his party ) .
The term communist had been taken back by the Marxists .
With the example of the Russian revolution , most revolutionary - minded people turned to the Leninists ; the anarchists became increasingly marginalized .
The term communist became mostly the label for Leninists .
Part 2 , published at the end of next month , will discuss whether anarchist - communism is possible , whether it requires a post - scarcity society , and whether ( and when and where ) anarchists should call ourselves communists . 

A minister apologised to parliament yesterday for telling MPs that 70 police officers were hurt during a climate change protest , after the Guardian revealed that most of the injuries were inflicted by insects or the heat .
Vernon Coaker , the Home Office minister , told MPs at Commons question time yesterday : " I was informed that 70 police officers were hurt and naturally assumed that they had been hurt in direct contact as a result of the protest .
That clearly was n't the case and I apologise if that caused anybody to be misled . "
The apology followed a freedom of information request from the Liberal Democrats , which showed that no officers in the £ 5.9 m police operation at Kingsnorth power station in Kent during August had been injured by protesters .
Instead , police records showed that their medical unit had dealt mostly with toothache , diarrhoea , cut fingers and " possible bee stings " .
David Howarth , the Lib Dem justice spokesman , asked Coaker to " revise his conclusion " that the policing was " proportionate and appropriate .
Large numbers of protesters were injured at the hands of the police , especially by baton injuries , " he said .
Coaker said that he would be meeting representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers to discuss the " lessons to be learned " from Kingsnorth , and the National Police Improvement Agency was carrying out an inquiry into the handling of the demonstration .
Labour 's David Taylor said : " When people expressed concerns about the vigour and resources devoted by the police to the Kingsnorth climate camp , we were told that it was justified because there were dozens of injuries that occurred .
Unless the protesters are to be held responsible for wasps and the weather , are n't we to conclude that the justification used at that time was wholly bogus and vacuous ? "
A spokesman for the climate camp welcomed the apology but said that activists were not surprised that the FoI requests had revealed no violence .
" We are a completely peaceful movement .
Yet for three years now we have been branded as a violent minority by the police and the government with no evidence whatever , " said Nick Thorpe .
" At last the truth is coming out .
" They cannot keep getting away with criminalising us and repressing the very people who are trying to do something about climate change . "
" We saw an utterly extraordinary blanket use of stop and search powers at the Kingsnorth climate camp in the summer , mass confiscation of everything from water pipes to marquees to crayons .
Unarmed protesters were beaten to the ground by riot police in order to protect the profits of an energy corporation .
" There will be more protests and more direct action , " he said .
Climate activists in Scotland yesterday blockaded the entrance to the Scottish Coal - operated Ravenstruther coal rail terminal in South Lanarkshire in protest against a growth in coal mining in Scotland .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , also apologised to MPs yesterday for last week 's premature release of data on knife crime , which provoked fierce criticism from Sir Michael Scholar , chairman of the UK Statistics Agency .
Scholar accused the government of " premature , irregular and selective " use of the statistics .
Smith told MPs : " I am sorry that I think we were too quick off the mark with the publication of one number in relation to the progress that had been made with tackling knife crime . "
For years , US consumers have expected that they can head online without worrying about how long they browse or how much they download , but those days may be coming to an end if various ISPs have their way .
Several of the major broadband providers are now experimenting with bandwidth caps , in which users will start to face fees once their total traffic exceeds a specified amount .
It 's safe to assume that users wo n't be thrilled about the change , so AT&T has apparently decided that the safest way to test its new billing system is by rolling it out in a market where the competition has already instituted usage caps of its own .
Although most ISPs have offered ( practically ) unlimited usage of their broadband connections , they do n't guarantee that all their users can start streaming movies at once .
Instead , they have budgeted for average use , a tactic that 's running into difficulties as more users are downloading or streaming said movies .
After Comcast 's flirtation with targeting P2P users did not go over well with the FCC , a number of ISPs have started considering charging their users for gobbling up too much bandwidth .
Comcast was one of the companies that announced limits on data transfers , although it set them at a fairly expansive 250GB .
Time Warner Cable has been notably less generous , trialing limits as stringent as 5 GB a month on its lowest tier of service .
At the moment , however , that trial is targeted to one area : sorry , Beaumont , Texas !
ISPs need some time to test the monitoring software , which needs to handle both the ISP 's billing and their users ' self - monitoring , and they want to see how customers react .
Time Warner 's decision apparently seemed like a gift to AT&T .
After having pioneered its own program in Reno , Nevada , Broadband Reports has found that AT&T is planning on rolling it out next in Beaumont , a town that is fast on its way to becoming an Internet sinkhole .
AT&T 's caps will fall somewhere between those of Comcast and Time Warner and will limit its lowest tier customers to 20 GB a month in traffic .
AT&T has also run into trouble guaranteeing that its U - verse service has enough bandwidth to support streams of high - definition TV , so it 's also using throttling to keep the bandwidth use down .
All of this , however , comes at the same time the company apparently has to compete with its fellow ISPs by offering more bandwidth to its customers .
At some point , these two trends will make it clear to consumers that the promised bandwidth will simply allow them to run up their bills faster .
The key question will be whether those consumers can find any service that offers either unlimited usage or reasonable traffic limits should they decide to look elsewhere .
It 's official - having big breasts is not an illness !
Naked wrestling Naked wrestling Erotic party debauchery hits Oxford The famous University of Oxford was rocked by scandal this week after hordes of students watched girls wrestling naked at an erotic party .
A court in the German state of Hessen has ruled that insurance companies do not need to cover the cost of breast reduction surgery as having a large bust is not a medical problem .
The decision means that insurers will only have to pay to correct breasts which are deformed .
The case was brought by a 38 - year - old woman who suffered orthopaedic and physical problems due to the weight of her boobs .
She had been advised by doctors to have breast reduction surgery .
But her insurance company did n’t see it as a necessity and therefore refused to cover the costs of the operation .
It claimed she was suffering from back problems because she was overweight and that her physical discomforts would be reduced if she trimmed down weight and built some muscle up .
The court agreed with the insurance company and the big - breasted woman lost her case .
Two and a half years ago , the court in Hessen rejected the case of a woman who thought her breasts were too small .
She wanted her medical insurance to cover a breast enlargement operation and claimed that she was physically harassed for her small boobs .
The court declared then that small breasts are not an illness .

The Iranian government has just closed down the popular Hamsarchat .
net internet dating service , accusing it of “ promoting prostitution . ”
The site advertised itself as a way to find a spouse .
Actually , the Iranian government has closed down internet dating services on other occasions in the past .
In 2003 , security forces arrested 68 young Iranians for actually going on dates that they had set up through the internet .
Dating and love marriages , as opposed to arranged marriages , are still controversial in much of Asia , especially in rural and small town environments .
Some Iranian observers believe Iranian young people , and young women in particular , are undergoing a crisis with regard to intimate relationships .
Some reports suggest that internet dating has allowed premarital relationships at younger and younger ages .

The Indians struck a three team deal yesterday with the Mets and Mariners involving seven players , the big name being former Mariner closer J.J. Putz who is now a Met .
Here ’s how the trade breaks down :
The Indians get : Pitcher Joe Smith from the Mets and infielder Luis Valbuena from the Mariners .
Smith , a third round draftee from 2006 , appeared in 82 games last season as a reliever for the Mets where he went 6 - 3 struck out 52 and had an ERA of 3.55 .
Valbuena made his debut in the majors last September and played in just 18 games with the Mariners .
He finished with five doubles , one RBI and a .245 batting average in 49 at bats .
The Mets get : J.J. Putz , fellow pitcher Sean Green and outfielder Jeremy Reed from the Mariners .
The Mariners get : Pitchers Aaron Heilman , Jason Vargas and Maikel Cleto , outfielders Endy Chavez and Ezequiel Carrera and utility man Mike Carp from the Mets as well as outfielder Franklin Gutierrez from the Indians .
Guttierrez had been an everyday outfielder for the Indians during the past two seasons when he played a combined 234 games .
His lifetime batting average is .258 , but he batted just .248 with 26 doubles , eight homeruns and 41 RBI last season .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Southeast Asia and South Pacific island nations face a growing threat from malaria and dengue fever as climate change spreads mosquitoes that carry the diseases and climate - change refugees start to migrate .

A new report titled “ The Sting of Climate Change , ” said recent data suggested that since the 1970s climate change had contributed to 150,000 more deaths every year from disease , with over half of the deaths in Asia .
“ Projections of the impact of climate change on malaria and dengue are truly eye - opening , ” said the Lowy Institute report released in Sydney on Thursday .
According to the World Health Organization , rising temperatures and higher rainfall caused by climate change will see the number of mosquitoes increasing in cooler areas where there is little resistance or knowledge of the diseases they carry .
The Lowy report said early modeling predicted malaria prevalence could be 1.8 to 4.8 times greater in 2050 than 1990 .
The share of the world ’s population living in malaria - endemic zones could also grow from 45 percent to 60 percent by the end of the century .
By 2085 , an estimated 52 percent of the world ’s population , or about 5.2 billion people , will be living in areas at risk of dengue .
It also said diseases will spread once climate change forces people to flee their homes , such as low - lying islands or coastal land swamped by rising sea levels .
For example , in the Pacific nation of Tuvalu , a ring of nine Polynesian islands , several thousand people have already left for New Zealand to restart their lives because of rising seas .
“ The number of environmental refugees as a whole may reach 50 million by 2010 , with small , low - lying island populations at the greatest risk .
Displaced people from lowland areas could well provide the human reservoir for the spread of malaria and dengue , ” said the report .
“ Global climate change will intensify the already significant malaria and dengue problems in maritime Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands , ” said the report .
“ Those countries with the fewest resources and poor public health infrastructure are likely to feel the impact of increasing disease the most acutely , ” said the report .
Up to half a billion new cases of malaria and as many as two million deaths , mostly children , are recorded each year .
There are an estimated 50 - 100 million cases of dengue fever annually and approximately 25,000 deaths .
MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM
Malaria is a major health problem for Indonesia , East Timor , the Philippines , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu .
Indonesia had an estimated 6 million to 15 million registered malaria cases in 2005 and it is estimated that almost half of its population of over 225 million people will eventually be at risk from malaria due to climate change , said the Lowy report .
Australia , free of malaria and dengue fever , is also at risk because it is a “ fringe country ” to the expanding endemic zone of mosquito - borne diseases to its north , said the report .
“ Mosquitoes are very sensitive to changes in climate .
Warmer conditions allow the mosquitoes and the malaria parasite itself to develop and grow more quickly , while wetter conditions let mosquitoes live longer and breed more prolifically , ” it said .
“ The sting of climate change is an international public health crisis being felt on Australia ’s tropical doorstep .
It may soon be pressing on Australia ’s northern shores as well . ”
Climate change also threatens to increase the spread of dengue fever .
The South Pacific ’s scattered island nations of Samoa , Tonga , New Caledonia , Kiribati , New Caledonia and Palau are currently struggling with an endemic of dengue , with more than 2,000 cases so far recorded in 2008 .
Modeling showed that dengue fever could increase by 20 to 30 percent in Fiji due to climate , said the Lowy report .
The Fear
The NDA is dead , yes , and good riddance , but there remain serious problems with the way Apple is managing the App Store .
It boggles my mind that there remain so many people who do n’t see this .
This piece by Dan Kimerling at TechCrunch is one example ; various of the reader comments on Jason Snell ’s piece for Macworld last week are another .
1
One factor , perhaps , is the tendency to see everything in terms of extremes .
Black or white , good or bad .
But this debate is not about wanting Apple to make radical changes , such as , say , changing the iPhone from a closed platform to a more open platform a la Android .
There are reasonable arguments to be made that a more open iPhone platform would be good not just for iPhone developers , but for Apple and its shareholders .
But those arguments are n’t what this debate is about .
This debate is about wanting Apple to make minor changes — a slight but very significant course correction .
Put another way , this is not about the big picture scope of what kind of hypothetical App Store ( or Stores , plural ) Apple should have created .
That train left the station long ago .
This is about the specific details of the App Store that actually exists , and the rules that govern it .
I believe that a closed , controlled App Store can work , but by definition that requires developers to place trust in Apple .
The problem is that Apple is managing the App Store in certain untrustworthy ways .
And I mean trust more in the sense of stability than honesty — like in the way you need to trust a ladder before you ’ll climb it .
Here is a complete list of what Apple must do to increase developers ’ trust in the App Store system :
State the rules .
Follow the rules .
That ’s it .
This is so clear that even those who are arguing the other side — that Apple ’s App Store stewardship is just fine as it stands today — have jumped through hoops in an attempt to argue that Apple ’s exclusion of Podcaster was in fact in accordance with the iPhone SDK Guidelines .
Kimerling , in his “ Stop Complaining About Apple and the App Store ” piece , writes :
When you create the platform , you set the rules .
If Apple wants to restrict iPhone applications to those that do not compete with features built into the iPhone , well , they can go right ahead and do so .
It is right in the SDK ’s user agreement .
That ’s just not true .
The iPhone SDK Agreement , at least by the standards of legal contracts , is written in clear , straightforward English .
( Apple ’s lawyers , in the opinion of yours truly at least , are good writers . )
The rules it lays down are clear .
And Podcaster does n’t break any of them .
Given any set of rules , there will always be edge cases .
Judgment must be rendered , and , inevitably , some will feel edge cases were judged the wrong way .
But the reason iPhone developers ( and prospective iPhone developers ) are appalled by Apple ’s rejection of Podcaster and MailWrangler is that neither app was near any edge defined in the SDK guidelines .
Podcaster was rejected for duplicating the podcast features in iTunes and the iPhone “ iPod ” app .
MailWrangler was rejected on the following grounds :
Your application duplicates the functionality of the built - in iPhone application Mail without providing sufficient differentiation or added functionality , which will lead to user confusion .
The word “ duplicate ” , in any conjugation , does not appear in the iPhone SDK Agreement .
Not a word about it .
And there is clearly no general rule about third - party apps duplicating the functionality of the iPhone ’s built - in apps .
PCalc , along with a handful of other calculator apps , duplicates every single feature of the built - in Calculator app .
There are dozens of note - taking apps that compete with Notes ; MagicPad goes so far as to use the same icon as Apple ’s Notes app , just with different colors .
There is an entire category in the App Store — an entire category — for weather apps , several of which “ duplicate ” the entire functionality of the built - in Weather app .
So , not only judging by the rules set forth in the iPhone SDK Agreement , but also by the existence proof of hundreds of apps currently published in the App Store that duplicate ( which is really to say compete with ) built - in iPhone apps , no reasonable person would have expected Podcaster or MailWrangler to be rejected .
So their rejection is problematic on three fronts .
First , the submission process is such that an app rejected at the conceptual level — one that cannot be tweaked or fixed to gain entry upon resubmission , but whose fundamental premise is rejected by Apple — such an app is only rejected after it has been written .
The developer does all of the work to produce the app and only then finds out it was all for naught .
Second , there are clearly rules which are not listed in the SDK guidelines .
Third , in its explanations for the rejections , Apple is not stating what these actual unpublished rules are , and is instead offering as the reason this “ it duplicates a built - in app ” rule which , given all the aforementioned counterexamples that have been accepted into the App Store , is n’t actually a rule at all .
The explanation is clearly false .
Taken together , these three factors lead to The Fear , which is that developers cannot trust the App Store process .
You can spend all of the time and effort it takes to build an app , follow every known rule , and still get rejected .
From Apple ’s perspective , especially , say , in upper management , it may be all too easy to look at what ’s going on with the store — thousands of published apps , a ton of money changing hands — and not see the problem .
In the big picture , from both a technical and marketing perspective , the App Store is a grand success .
The problem is that the apps that are the most interesting , the most important , are the ones that take the most work to create .
And the apps that take the most work to create are the ones that are most likely not even to be made in this environment , because the risk is greater .
The more work it takes to create an app , the more you lose if Apple rejects it .
Going back to the ladder analogy , the higher you ’re trying to climb , the more you need to trust the ladder before you start .
It ’s not about a handful of developers who ’ve had their apps rejected .
It ’s about all the other developers who are now spooked , and that the ones who are the most spooked are the ones who harbor the grandest , boldest , most innovative ideas .
Interpolation Regarding a Theory on Which Apps Apple Wo n’t Allow Developers to Compete With
In the absence of a revised iPhone SDK Agreement from Apple , we can attempt to guess what the unpublished rules are .
With Podcaster , for example , the “ follow the money ” rule of thumb leads to the conclusion that Apple will not allow any competition with iTunes , because iTunes is a profit source .
This is why MailWrangler ’s rejection is the one that puts The Fear in my heart .
As unjust as the Podcaster rejection appears , if Apple really wants to prohibit competition with iTunes , even anti-competitively , you can at least see the thinking behind the decision .
It ’s foolish and unnecessary — the fact that iTunes is wide open to competition on both Mac OS X and Windows has n’t hurt it at all — and it also quite possibly invites some sort of legal challenge , but at least there is a logical idea behind it .
But Mail ?
Why on earth should Apple care if some third - party email client for the iPhone becomes wildly popular ?
It makes no sense .
i Phone users who use the built - in Mail app do n’t pay extra to do so .
Mail does n’t tie users to Apple ’s own MobileMe service .
In fact , Mail offers specific setup help to work with Gmail , the service MailWrangler is optimized for .
If you can make a replacement for Notes and Weather and Calendar , why not Mail ?
I have a theory .
It is more , well , emotional than logical .
But it ’s the only theory I can think of that makes any sense at all and fits the available evidence .
The theory is that there is an unpublished rule that Apple — and in this case , where by “ Apple ” I really mean “ Steven P. Jobs ” — will not publish third - party apps that compete with or replace any of the four apps in the iPhone ’s default “ dock ” : Phone , Mail , Safari , and iPod .
Go back to Jobs ’s original iPhone introduction at Macworld Expo 2007 .
It was a masterful presentation .
Carmine Gallo , writing for BusinessWeek , calls it Jobs ’s greatest presentation ; I agree .
Gallo describes the moment it was unveiled :
After laying the groundwork , Jobs builds up to the new device by teasing the audience : “ Today , we are introducing three revolutionary products .
The first is a wide - screen iPod with touch controls .
The second is a revolutionary new mobile phone .
And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device . ”
Jobs continues to build tension .
He repeats the three devices several times then says , “ Are you getting it ?
These are not three separate devices .
This is one device … today Apple is going to reinvent the phone ! ”
The crowd goes wild .
This “ three revolutionary products ” pitch was inordinately effective .
For one thing , live , in the hall , Jobs completely fooled the crowd , yours truly included .
But then as he repeated the three product ideas over and over , while icons representing the three products rotated behind him on screen , faster and faster , it started dawning on us how we ’d been tricked .
By the time Jobs came out and said that it was just one device that encompassed all three products , everyone in Moscone West had come to that conclusion on their own — a nifty little way of making the crowd feel clever , as though we ’d figured out a riddle .
But this pitch also worked because it was true .
All three of those products sound good on their own .
All three in one device sounds insanely great .
Jobs was introducing the iPhone simply by describing precisely what it was .
A phone , a widescreen video iPod , and a breakthrough Internet communicator .
The icons in the iPhone ’s default dock represent the core functionality of the device .
Phone , Email , Web , iPod .
With nothing other than those four apps , the iPhone still would have been a hit .
Not as great , but , still , great .
Everything else the iPhone ’s built - in apps do could be done , to some extent , through Safari : notes , calendars , weather , maps , stocks .
There are a few minor exceptions .
SMS is one example , but that ’s really just an adjunct to the Phone app .
Anything that relates to the phone network — voice or SMS — is unavailable through the third - party iPhone SDK anyway .
You could n’t write your own SMS app even if you wanted to .
( Apple clearly has no problem with competing chat apps — there are several IM clients available in the App Store .
That ’s the same basic concept as SMS , but using IP networking . )
And so my guess is that while there may not be any logic , there ’s at least a notion , if only in Jobs ’s mind , that these four apps are sacrosanct because they define the iPhone .
Everything else , both from Apple and from App Store developers , is piffle , secondary to those four apps .
Harry McCracken ’s recent iPhone user survey indicates that iPhone users agree that those four apps account for the most - used features of the iPhone .
But the least essential of the four is Mail .
You cannot place phone calls or play music and video from your personal iTunes library using a web browser , but can read and send email through it .
2
Millions of people do just that every day , including , I ’m sure , many of you reading this essay .
And Google ’s iPhone - optimized version of Gmail shows just how well it can be done .
It ’s not just good for web - based mail , it ’s just good , period .
And so this idea that Apple seems to have that Mail is particularly special is misguided .
The Phone and iPod apps are special , because at a fundamental level they perform tasks that cannot be duplicated in a web app .
But there ’s nothing any more special about Mail than there is about , say , Calendar .
Calendar , if anything , is more closely tied to Apple ’s proprietary and commercial MobileMe service —
Mail works great with any IMAP server , including Gmail , but Calendar only works for online syncing with MobileMe or Exchange .
But Apple does n’t seem to have any problem allowing Calendar competitors into the App Store .
Notes Calendar is a $ 3 Lotus Notes calendaring client .
iExchange Remote Calendar is a $ 10 calendaring client for Exchange .
It ca n’t even be explained by some sort of anti-Google bias at Apple , because they ’ve also accepted SaiSuke , a $ 10 dedicated Google Calendar client .
If these are OK , why not a dedicated Gmail email client ?
The only explanation is that Mail is deemed untouchable and Calendar is not .
In short , my theory is that Mail is on the do - not - compete list not because there ’s any strategic reason for Apple to do so , but simply because of a vague notion that Mail is one of the iPhone ’s defining apps .
This notion is wrong .
Mail is important , but there ’s nothing about it that needs to be protected from competition .
End of Interpolation , Back to the Three Problems , Which , Due to the Grotesque Length of the Above Interpolation , I Will Remind You Are : ( 1 ) App Ideas Are Rejected Only After the Apps Are Actually Built ; ( 2 ) There Exist Secret Unpublished Rules Regarding What Is Allowed ; and ( 3 ) When Apps Are Rejected for Violating the Unpublished Rules , Apple Refuses to State Just What These Rules Are
One thing that would make a difference would be a submission process whereby developers could submit their application ideas to Apple in advance , to find out if they ’re OK .
That ’s how it works on game platforms from Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft — developers submit a detailed proposal and wait until they get the green light before actually building the game .
That sounds good , but there are problems with the idea .
For developers , it would require an additional level of trust in Apple .
Ideas are less valuable than actual implementations , but the more original an idea is , the less comfortable you are to share it .
And for Apple , it would require significantly more work .
They ’d still need to examine and approve the actual shipping applications , but now they ’d also have to examine and consider application proposals .
The world ’s hard drives are littered with abandoned unfinished software projects — there would surely be far more proposals submitted for consideration than there are actual iPhone applications .
As it stands today , Apple is already struggling mightily to keep up with the work of approving new and updated application submissions — the typical turnaround time is between one and two weeks .
Perhaps Apple could offer this as a service limited to ADC Select ( $ 499 ) or even Premier ( $ 3,499 ) members .
The service is needed most by the developers who are considering the biggest apps , most of whom either are already paid ADC members or would n’t bat an eyelash at the cost of joining .
It would n’t be democratic , but it might make it feasible .
Platforms like Wii and Xbox ship maybe a few dozen titles a month , tops .
The App Store has published 3,500 titles in just three months .
( And it costs far more to join the developer programs for gaming consoles than the $ 100 iPhone SDK fee . )
More important , though , is for Apple to address problems 2 and 3 , by publishing in the iPhone SDK Agreement all of the rules they ’re using to evaluate applications .
If we ’re not allowed to write email or podcast clients , say so .
If something unforeseen comes up , Apple should make a decision , and then publish the new rule .
Rules you disagree with are frustrating .
Rules you do n’t know about are scary .
Barclays Capital said the broader equity markets are already discounting the sorts of " savage declines " in corporate profits that were last seen in the Slump .

Montreal , December 10th , 2008 – Insufficient vitamin D can stunt growth and foster weight gain during puberty , according to a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism .
Even in sun-drenched California , where scientists from the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) and the University of Southern California conducted their study , vitamin D deficiency was found to cause higher body mass and shorter stature in girls at the peak of their growing spurt .
While lack of vitamin D is common in adults and has been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis , cancer and obesity , until this study , little was known about the consequences of insufficient vitamin D in young people .
The research team measured vitamin D in girls aged 16 to 22 using a simple blood test ( 25 - hydroxy vitamin D ) .
They also assessed body fat and height to determine how vitamin D deficiency could affect young women 's health .
" The high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in young people living in a sun-rich area was surprising , " says study lead author , Richard Kremer , co-director of the Musculoskeletal Axis of the MUHC .
" We found young women with vitamin D insufficiency were significantly heavier , with a higher body mass index and increased abdominal fat , than young women with normal levels . "
Vitamin D fosters growth , healthier weight
The researchers examined 90 Caucasian and Hispanic girls and discovered that young women with normal vitamin D levels were on average taller than peers deficient in vitamin D .
Yet in contrast to what 's been previously reported in older women , their investigation found no association between lack of vitamin D and bone strength .
" Although vitamin D is now frequently measured in older adults , due to a higher level of awareness in this population , it is rarely measured in young people – especially healthy adolescents , " says Dr. Kremer .
" Clinicians need to identify vitamin D levels in younger adults who are at risk by using a simple and useful blood test , " says the co-author , Dr. Vicente Gilsanz , head of musculoskeletal imaging at the Children 's Hospital Los Angeles of the University of Southern California .
" Because lack of vitamin D can cause fat accumulation and increased risk for chronic disorders later in life , further investigation is needed to determine whether vitamin D supplements could have potential benefits in the healthy development of young people , " added Dr. Gilsanz .

Here is an interesting deflationary twist on the state of the economy : Parents Pull Kids From Day Care as money tightens .
The nation 's economic troubles play out one family at a time at the New Horizons Learning Center in this struggling city two hours northwest of Chicago .
Some parents have been laid off and must pull their children out of the day care center until they can find a job .
Others ' employment hours have been cut , so they reduce their kids ' attendance to a few days a week .
And the stress shows on the faces of the children who can't understand why their friends , without explanation , stop coming .
" They act out more , cry a lot more , " said Diane Kesterton , director of New Horizons , where a 38 - child enrollment has been halved to 19 in just three months .
Day care costs average between $ 3,380 to $ 10,787 a year for just one preschooler , according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies .
Even before this year 's economic perils , the cost had climbed 5.2 percent between 2006 and 2007 , said Linda Smith , the association 's executive director .
And in every state in the country , the monthly child care bill for two children is higher than median rent payments and as high or higher than a mortgage .
" We are driving people into an unregulated system , " said Peggy Liuzzi , executive director of Child Care Solutions , a resource and referral agency in Syracuse , N.Y .
An example , said Liuzzi , was the woman in New York who , unable to find anyone to care for her 4 - year - old daughter while she went to work in a shoe store , simply left the girl outside in a car with a sandwich and water , checking on her every hour .
The woman 's decision , which came to light when someone spotted the child and called authorities , underscores the desperate situations facing a growing number of parents .
" People need to work , " Liuzzi said .
" They can't let their jobs go and they will make choices they will regret . "
State Of The Industry
Retail Sales Worst In Decades
Retail chains posted the worst October sales results in more than three decades as consumers cut spending sharply , stunned by a financial crisis that has derailed the U.S. economy .
The International Council of Shopping Centers called the retail sales environment " simply awful " and said the October results were the worst it had seen for that month in 35 years .
The ICSC said it pared its forecast for what were already expected to be dismal holiday season sales .
It now expect sales in November and December to rise 1 percent , down from its prior view for a gain of 1.7 percent .
[ Mish : Anyone forecasting a rise in sales year over year with unemployment soaring and consumer sentiment the worst on record must be forecasting from an alternate universe . ]
Thomson Reuters said its
October same - store sales index fell 0.7 percent , worse than its estimate for a 0.3 percent drop .
Based on results from 34 retailers , 56 percent missed estimates .
In a fresh sign of trouble , women 's apparel retailers Talbots Inc and AnnTaylor Stores Corp said they would restructure operations after posting steep sales drops .
Same - store sales fell 16.6 percent at upscale department store chain Saks Inc and dropped 15.7 percent at Nordstrom .
Saks said its shoppers were buying discounted items instead of full - priced merchandise , hurting its margins in the just - ended and current quarters .
At high - end teen apparel chain Abercrombie & Fitch , which has said it would not lower prices in an effort to maintain the status of its brand , same - store sales fell 20 percent , worse than the 14.4 percent drop analysts expected .
The tough environment snagged Costco , the largest U.S. warehouse club operator .
Its October same - store sales fell 1 percent , hurt in part by fewer purchases of discretionary items like jewelry or toys .
Thomson Reuters said the results were the worst since it began collecting estimates for Costco in 1997 .
Target 's same - store sales fell 4.8 percent , worse than the 2.8 percent drop forecast by analysts .
It forecast a drop of 6 percent to 9 percent in November same - store sales , attributing part of the decline to a calendar shift that leaves it with fewer busy holiday shopping days in the month .
Why Not Hyperinflation ?
Almost every day I get notes wondering , " Why not hyperinflation ? "
This is a good question .
I 'll try and explain why I believe a deflationary debt unwind is now underway , and why I believe it will be many years before we should start worrying about inflation again .
In fact , by the time inflation becomes a legitimate concern , I expect the vast majority of people will find it as outrageous to worry about inflation then as found it outrageous last year when I made deflation one of my Five Themes for 2008 .
While it is true , as those anticipating hyperinflation argue , the Fed and global central banks are making record amounts of credit available , that is only one side of the credit equation .
The assumption is that this record - breaking credit expansion means risk assets ( stocks , commodities , etc. ) will all skyrocket and the U.S. dollar will get destroyed .
But what hyperinflationists fail to realize is that for an inflation ( of either the tame or hyper variety ) to take place , one must have both the means ( credit from the fed and banks ) and the motive ( the desire to take on more debt ) for credit expansion .
For over a year now we have had record amounts of the former , but none of the latter .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Belgium ’s government collapsed on Friday after a top court found signs that it had sought to sway a legal ruling on the future of stricken bank Fortis .
Belgium 's Supreme Court first Chairman Ghislain Londers leaves the Office of Lower Chamber Chairman Herman Van Rompuy in Brussels December 19 , 2008 .

“ ( Belgian Prime Minister Yves ) Leterme put the proposal ( for a resignation of his government ) to the cabinet and they have agreed to it , ” Leterme ’s spokesman Peter Poulussen said .
King Albert , who under the constitution must decide whether to accept the resignation , held talks with Leterme in the palace but deferred an immediate decision .
“ The king is suspending his response and is immediately beginning consultations , ” the palace said in a statement of planned talks between the head of state and parties involved .
Leterme tendered his resignation a first time in July after failing to break a political deadlock among the country ’s linguistic groups , but the king refused it .
Observers said the likely next steps would be a reshuffled cabinet without Leterme or early elections , an option few of the ruling parties would want amid a deepening economic crisis and with the Fortis debacle on voters ’ minds .
“ We ’ll have to look at how we assure stability in our country -- political stability we do n’t have at the moment .
I hope that we ’ll at least find a way of managing things in 2009 , ” Finance Minister Didier Reynders told Belgian television .
Leterme had been under pressure to quit over accusations that his office had sought to influence an appeal court ruling that last week froze the break - up of Fortis .
Earlier , an eagerly awaited report by Belgium ’s Supreme Court did not specifically target Leterme but concluded :
“ All the above ( in the report ) of course does not offer ... legal proof of an attempt to interfere with the judiciary , but there are undoubtedly significant indications which point in that direction . ”
Leterme has denied trying to influence the appeal court , although he acknowledged that one of his officials had contacted the husband of one of the judges several times .
Fortis was carved up by the Dutch , Belgian and Luxembourg governments with France ’s BNP Paribas buying the Belgian operations after an 11.2 billion euro ( $ 16.1 billion ) cash injection failed to calm investor concerns over its health .

DISARRAY
Shareholders launched legal action , and the court victory has thrown the government ’s bailout plans into disarray .
They have seen their shares drop from almost 30 euros in April 2007 , when Fortis launched its ill - fated bid for Dutch rival ABN AMRO , to just over 1 euro now .
BNP , too , has suffered , its shares dropping some 30 percent this week on increasing speculation that a collapse of the Fortis deal could weaken the bank ’s capital position and force it to turn to shareholders for cash .
The addition of Fortis ’s retail customers would make BNP the biggest bank in terms of deposits in the 15 - country euro zone .
However , Fortis shareholders cheered mention of the court ruling at a meeting on Friday at which they voted to continue the company ’s business rather than liquidate the assets .
Leterme came to power in March after nine months of deadlock over the extent that powers should be devolved to Belgium ’s regions -- a key demand for Dutch - speaking Flemish parties .
The row reignited speculation the 178 - year - old country could break up .
— President - elect Barack Obama has won North Carolina , adding 15 electoral votes to his wide victory margin and a symbolic triumph in a state that had n't voted for a Democrat for president in more than a generation .
The Associated Press declared Obama the winner Thursday after canvassing counties in North Carolina to determine the number of outstanding provisional ballots .
That survey found there are not enough remaining ballots for Republican candidate John McCain to close a 13,693 - vote deficit .
Johnnie McClain of the State Board of Elections said the board does n't have a total number of provisional ballots , but officials estimate it will be around 40,000 .
Provisional ballots will be counted by individual counties in the coming days , and the state board will certify state totals on Nov. 25 , McClain said .
If Obama wins North Carolina , the state 's 15 electoral votes would bring his total to 364 – nearly 100 more than necessary to win the White House .
Missouri is the only other state that remains too close to call .
The win in North Carolina would be the first for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter won the state in 1976 .
Meanwhile Thursday , Democratic officials said U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel agreed to be Obama 's White House chief of staff .
Emanuel , a Democrat from Illinois who serves in the House Democratic leadership , served as a political and policy aide in the Clinton White House .
His selection is a shift in tone for Obama , who chose more low - key leadership for his first presidential campaign .
Obama advisers said he was selecting the leaders of the new government with a priority on care over speed , with no plans to announce Cabinet positions this week .
Other White House officials were being lined up , including Robert Gibbs as the likely pick for press secretary , several Obama aides said .
Gibbs , who attended North Carolina State University and whose parents live in Apex , has been Obama 's longtime spokesman and confidant and was at Obama 's side from his 2004 Senate campaign through the long days on the presidential campaign trail .
Obama plans his first public appearance since his presidential victory for Friday – a meeting with economic advisers to discuss the nation 's financial woes that Americans listed as their top concern on Election Day .
Obama plans to talk to the news media Friday afternoon following the meeting , aides said .
He and his wife , Michelle , will visit the White House on Monday at President Bush 's invitation , aides said .

Havana - based writer Yoani Sanchez was recently named by Time magazine as one the 100 most influential people in the world , and she won the 2008 Ortega y Gasset award for digital journalism .
But that did n’t stop Cuban authorities from directly threatening her with jail last week .
Or maybe that ’s precisely why the dictatorial Cuban regime finds the 33 - year - old Sanchez so intolerable .
Her lyrically and masterfully written blog , Generacion Y , is the most prominent online site in Cuba — if such a thing even exists .
Access to the Internet is severely restricted there , and the Havana government shows no hesitation in censoring a long list of sites , including Sanchez’s .
Now things are getting even tighter .
Just as Sanchez was preparing to travel to the western edge of the island to participate in a first - ever two - day blogging workshop this past weekend , she was summoned to appear before state security officials .
She posted the police warrant on her blog and then detailed the tongue lashing and direct threat she received when she showed up at the police station .
She reports on what she was told by the police , whom she referred to as “ intimidation professionals ” :
We want to warn you that you have transgressed all the limits of tolerance with your rapprochement and contacts with counter - revolutionary elements .
This totally disqualifies you for dialog with Cuban authorities .
The activities planned for the coming days cannot [ be ] carried out .
We , for our part , will take all measures , make the relevant denunciations and take the necessary actions .
This activity , in this moment in the life of the Nation , recuperating from two hurricanes , will not be allowed .
What recent natural disasters have to do with muzzling free speech is inexplicable .
It ’s not just Sanchez who got squeezed .
So did blogger Claudia Cadelo , who was also called into a meeting with state security but did n’t make an appearance due to illness .
Last week the Castro government also imposed a new measure ordering Internet service providers to “ prevent access to sites where the content is contrary to the social interest , morals or good customs ; as well as the use of applications that affect the integrity or security of the State . ”
The estimated 20 bloggers who planned to attend the workshop in the province of Pinar del Rio decided it would be more prudent to conduct their conference online instead of all showing up in one place and risking arrest .
Writing on her blog , Sanchez celebrated the ingenuity of her blogging comrades , saying , “ We ended up finding the cracks between the fingers of the censors , through which the fine sand of information and understanding managed to slip . ”
A press release on Sanchez ’s blog from the workshop participants promises a contest among Cuban blogs .
As it stands , Sanchez and other Cuban citizens can only indirectly blog .
She sends her dispatches from the island out by email to a network of foreign friends .
They , in turn , translate her writing into several languages and maintain her popular blog , which has a worldwide audience .
None of Sanchez ’s writing is overtly political .
She crafts mostly highly styled , often heartbreakingly simple descriptions of daily life in Havana , an existence often marked by longing , disappointment , and frustration aggravated by an ossified society .
Here are the moving words she wrote a few weeks ago , soon after the election of Barack Obama :
For weeks , there are words like “ ballot box , ” “ votes , ” and “ candidates ” that persecute us everywhere .
First there were the elections in the United States and now the issue has been revived with what happened on Sunday in Venezuela .
It ’s as if at the end of the year everything conspires to remind us of our condition as non-electors , our limited experience in deciding who leads us .
You become accustomed to not being able to choose what to put in your mouth , under which creed they will educate your children , or to whom to open the door , but that resignation shatters when you see someone else vote .
Because of this it has risen up , these days , the desire to fold the ballot , to push it into the slot and to know that with it goes my stentorian shout that demands : “ to choose . ”
In the recent past , the Cuban government has not flinched from jailing independent journalists it has accused of being “ counter - revolutionaries . ”
Until now , it has refrained from locking up bloggers .
But unless Sanchez and her fellow bloggers can mobilize support , they may soon face the full wrath of a regime that continues to criminalize free thought .
From his earliest days in office , Mr. Bush paired his belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone .
He pushed hard to expand homeownership , especially among minorities , an initiative that dovetailed with his ambition to expand the Republican tent  and with the business interests of some of his biggest donors .
But his housing policies and hands - off approach to regulation encouraged lax lending standards .
Mr. Bush did foresee the danger posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored mortgage finance giants .
The president spent years pushing a recalcitrant Congress to toughen regulation of the companies , but was unwilling to compromise when his former Treasury secretary wanted to cut a deal .
And the regulator Mr. Bush chose to oversee them  an old prep school buddy  pronounced the companies sound even as they headed toward insolvency .
As early as 2006 , top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming .
And when the economy deteriorated , Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn ; as recently as February , for example , Mr. Bush was still calling it a “ rough patch . ”
The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis .
“ There is no question we did not recognize the severity of the problems , ” said Al Hubbard , Mr. Bush ’s former chief economics adviser , who left the White House in December 2007 .
“ Had we , we would have attacked them . ”
Looking back , Keith B. Hennessey , Mr. Bush ’s current chief economics adviser , says he and his colleagues did the best they could “ with the information we had at the time . ”
But Mr. Hennessey did say he regretted that the administration did not pay more heed to the dangers of easy lending practices .
And both Mr. Paulson and his predecessor , John W. Snow , say the housing push went too far .
“ The Bush administration took a lot of pride that homeownership had reached historic highs , ” Mr. Snow said in an interview .
“ But what we forgot in the process was that it has to be done in the context of people being able to afford their house .
We now realize there was a high cost . ”
McCain camp will use ' legal remedies ' if election turns foul David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday November 2 , 2008

If the McCain campaign believes voter fraud from groups like ACORN tainted the result of Tuesday 's election , it will resort to " legal remedies , " McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said .
Fox 's Chris Wallace asked Davis the following : " But I just want to make it clear .
You reserve the right , if you feel that something has gone down wrong in any state in the country , that you 'll go to court . "
Davis responded : " Absolutely .
There 's no question that we 're going to monitor this election .
We have the largest election day operation in the history of our party 's activities to ensure that we have a fair and honest election . "
Alluding to past election fraud , Wallace asked Davis if allegations of Republicans suppressing voters could create a " blizzard of lawsuits " that would prevent a decisive tally for weeks after Tuesday .
" I think on Wednesday morning you 'll wake up and John McCain will be president elect , " Davis said .
When Wallace questioned Davis about recent allegations that Republicans are preventing thousands of eligible voters from casting their vote , Davis said the fault lies with " liberal activist groups . "
" What 's happened is a bunch of liberal activist groups like ACORN and others ... have taken it upon themselves to try and frame this election as anything but honest , " Davis said .
The GOP has denounced the accusations of voter suppression as a " reckless strategy " of the Obama campaign , which has released fliers warning of the issue .
Davis pointed to the federal investigation underway against ACORN as an example of liberals , and not Republicans , being guilty of fraudulent election practices .
" In fact , if there 's anything to look at , it 's the manipulation of these voter rolls before the election that 's caused so many problems , " Davis said .
" We 're not going to stand for it . "
But the Obama campaign is already fighting attempts by the GOP to suppress voters in battleground states like Indiana , said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe .
" Our opposition tried to limit the number of early vote sites , " Plouffe said .
" So our argument on this is simple .
We want it to be as easy as possible for people to vote .
We 're obviously going to monitor all the precincts and battleground states to make sure none of the normal suppression activities are effective . "

The iPhone Does n’t Appeal to Business Customers at All ?
$ 500 fully subsidized with a plan !
I said that is the most expensive phone in the world and it does n’t appeal to business customers because it does n’t have a keyboard , which makes it not a very good email machine … .
Right now we ’re selling millions and millions and millions of phones a year , Apple is selling zero phones a year .
In six months , they ’ll have the most expensive phone by far ever in the marketplace and let ’s see … what ’s the expression ?
Let ’s see how the competition goes . ”
— Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on the iPhone , January 2007
“ Apple ’s iPhone 3G , introduced in July , is the only reason smartphone growth did not slow in September . ”
This according to Needham analyst Charles Wolf , who in a research note today points out that the nearly seven million iPhones Apple ( AAPL ) shipped during the three - month period ending September account for all of the sequential shipment growth in the quarter .
Astonishing .
The iPhone now represents about 16.6 percent of the entire smartphone market worldwide , second only to Nokia ( NOK ) .
One phone .
One , maybe two , carriers per market .
Nearly 17 percent of the entire smartphone market worldwide in under two years .
What was that you said again , Steve ?

Nothing turns me on more then Jurassic Park themed role play .
You must be the animatronic dinosaur , and I must be the helpless child ( Tim or Lex ) stuck in the park at your mercy .
You will growl mechanically into my ear and stare threateningly .
I will feign panic and search for the flash light in the back seat of the visitor jeep .
You will sniff at the window slowly and then release a robotic roar into the night air .
I scream for Alan Grant , but your over sized robot jaws come crashing down through the overhead window , pinning me to the floor .
I cannot stress this enough however , you must play as a ROBOTIC dinosaur .
This is very specific , my interest lie entirely in animatronic dinosaurs , not real ones .
I thought I should mention this as there have been unfortunate miscommunications in the past , leading to performances that have left me without an orgasm .
Other situations could include you being the dilophasaurus and spitting in my face and then going for my jugular .
Or you could be the ill and moaning triceratops , and I would be Ellie Sadler , digging through your stool to find the source of the ailment .
More or less any scene from the film involving a mechanical dinosaur interacting with a human will do fine .
I do n't like wasting my time , so make sure you do your homework and watch the film and make sure you can fully embrace the mindset of an animatronic dinosaur .
I am an incredibly sexual person and I would make it a blockbuster night that you would never forget .
Here ’s a bit of cheery news from the Web 2.0 Summit : AT&T Mobility President and CEO Ralph De La Vega just told interviewer Michael Arrington that the company is working with Apple to let the iPhone serve as a tethered wireless modem for laptops soon .
And he says it ’ll be available “ soon . ”
There have been rumors that this was in the works for a while , but if anyone at AT&T or Apple has made it official until now , I managed to miss it .
There are at least two existing tethering options for the iPhone : NetShare and iModem .
The former was removed from Apple ’s iPhone App Store and the latter only works on jailbroken iPhones ; both violate AT&T ’s terms of service .
Even if AT&T wants more money for a tethering plan–and I ’m assuming it will charge something like $ 50 or $ 60 a month –I think a lot of people will sign up .
One major remaining question : Given that Internet access on an iPhone 3G can be pretty sluggish , just how quick will it be if a meaningful percentage of iPhone users are routing their connections to laptops and doing things that are even more bandwidth - hogging than typical iPhone tasks ?

Jacqui Smith today risked escalating the row over the arrest of Tory MP Damian Green when she insisted " no one is above the law " .
The home secretary told the Guardian that the police must be allowed to carry out their statutory investigation without " fear or favour " .
" It is serious when a senior politician is arrested , " she said .
" But what I am absolutely clear about is that no one is above the law and the police should carry out their statutory investigation without fear or favour . "
Smith 's comments are likely to anger opposition parties who have called on the home secretary to apologise over the incident .
Smith repeatedly dodged questions over whether she had known the investigation involved a member of parliament , insisting simply that she " did n't know the specifics of the investigation " .
Earlier today Jack Straw , the justice secretary , denied claims that Green 's arrest and the police raid on his office in the Commons meant Britain was " a police state " .
The justice secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " We are not in a police state .
A police state would be where ministers were directing a police operation . "
When Green , the shadow immigration minister , was arrested last week over allegations that he had procured leaked documents from a civil servant , the police were not following orders from ministers , Straw said .
" We have an independent police service .
What 's important here is that politicians do not interfere with the natural course of an investigation . "
Straw also said that he expected parliament to review the procedures that led to the police raiding Green 's office in the Commons .
Green strongly denies any wrongdoing .
With MPs from all parties still furious about the way the police were allowed to search Green 's office last week and take away his computer and details of constituency correspondence , Straw said that he was " pretty certain " that there would be a parliamentary inquiry into the affair when the case was closed .
The justice secretary also backed Smith 's decision not to apologise for what happened to Green .
" If any home secretary had offered an apology , there would have then been a huge furore about the fact that the home secretary was prejudging the actions and activities of the police without an investigation , " Straw said .
Straw said that if the Tories were unhappy about what had happened , they could complain to the independent police complaints authority .
MPs have complained that the raid on Green 's office in the House of Commons was a breach of parliamentary privilege – the principle the MPs are entitled to special protection to enable them to carry out their work as members of the Commons .
Straw said that he accepted that in this case competing constitutional principles were in play – the right of MPs being free to carry out " legitimate business " on behalf of their constituents , the independence of the police to investigate , and the importance of protecting secrecy and confidentiality " where it is necessary " in government .
Michael Martin , the Commons Speaker , will make a statement about the affair to MPs when the new session of parliament begins with the Queen 's speech on Wednesday .
Today Denis MacShane , the Labour former minister , said that Martin had to assure MPs that what happened to Green would not happen again .
" The police have made a mistake , I think the Home Office bureaucracy have made a mistake , and I think the Speaker on Wednesday has to say this will not happen again , " he told Today .
" The inner sanctum of our parliamentary democracy is the Palace of Westminster and , in the Palace of Westminster , MPs , yes they are protected under privilege when they speak in the House of Commons , but there is a broader constitutional privilege that says they can meet anyone , talk about anything , discuss their political passions , they can hold files , and the police , the agents of the state , do not storm in there and start breaking in or going into offices and taking away confidential files that all our constituents think will be treated confidentially . "
He suggested that the situation could not happen if the UK had its own written constitution : " In other countries ... the police would never be allowed into a parliament . "
But one of Britain 's leading constitutional experts , Vernon Bogdanor , professor of government at the University of Oxford , told the programme : " This does seem to me something of a storm in a teacup .
" The important principle is that MPs , apart from when they are speaking in the chamber and dealing with constituents ' correspondence , are as subject to the law as the rest of us .
" If the police decide not to take action against an MP which they would against an ordinary citizen then that would be discriminatory .
" Then people might say : ' Well , we are not living in a police state but a state where people , because they have been elected to parliament , have certain exemptions from the law . '
That can't be the case .
They are subject to the same laws as the rest of us . "
Argentina Recognizes Scientology as a Religion
Reading up on the blog from the President of the Church of Scientology of Madrid , Spain — I just found out that the Church of Scientology just got religious recognition in Argentina !
A resolution from the Director General National Register of Worship of Argentina , and in accordance with Article 14 of the Constitution of this country ( which establishes the right of every person to practice freely their religion ) , the President of the Church of Scientology of Argentina was notified last Thursday December 11 of this that Scientology “ has demonstrated its religious character ” and that is why the Secretary of Worship resolves “ Enroll in the National Register of Religions under No. 4006 at the Church of Scientology of Argentina .
This makes something on the order of 50 + countries which now recognize Scientology as a religion , something I take for granted here in the states as a matter of fact .
Constantly have to be reminded , though , that not all countries have such an emphasis on religious freedom as the USA .
If you speak Spanish , you can read the President of the Church of Scientology Madrid ’s blog post on the announcement .
But I think it ’s fantastic news for all of the Argentine Scientologists ( several of whom I ’m very good friends with ) .

One thing they have clearly demonstrated ; the children come first .
For the last year we have seen Reese on the arm of actor Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan often pictured with actress Abby Cornish .
Reese is the highest paid actress in Hollywood , commanding $ 15 to $ 20 million per movie .
Regarding her latest film , she told OK !
magazine :
" I just thought this was a different kind of Christmas movie .
I 'd never seen anyone do the idea of a blended family .
It 's a situation that my own children will have to deal with , so it was of interest to me . "
Four Christmases is a romantic comedy about a couple that have to spend the holiday 's with their divorced parents and their families .
The movie releases on November 26th .
We plan to check it out .... tis the Season !
More photos of Reese and Four Christmases official movie trailer below .
Talk about a crappy 2008 .
But do n't fret he 's still worth $ 16 bil , for now .
If you 're American , you might be asking , who 's this guy ?
Well , he 's a steel billionaire ( obviously , from the headline ) from India who in 2007 was Forbes ' 4th richest person in the world .
Looks like he 'll be a lot lower on the list next year .
Unless of course the other rich guys lose their money in tandem .
Trading Markets :
After braving the global financial crisis for months , the creaks are getting wider in the market value of steel empire created by the world 's richest Indian Lakshmi Mittal , with about USD 50 billion knocked off from the net worth of NRI business tycoon himself .
While the US and European markets started their downslide way back in August - September last year , ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steelmaker , continued to gain value till about five months ago and its share price scaled a life - time high of 104.77 dollars on June 5 at the US bourses .
However , the valuation has now dipped to below the one - fourth of its record high level and the company 's shares , which are listed at NYSE as well as on some European bourses , are currently trading near 25 dollars level .
During these five months , the company 's market capitalisation has also plummeted to 37.3 billion dollars , from a high of over 150 billion dollars .
Accordingly , the net worth of Lakshmi Mittal , who along with his family members hold a 43.02 per cent equity , has also dipped to just about 16 billion dollars from as high as about 66 billion dollars on June 5 .
According to the company 's latest shareholding data , the Mittal family owns 623.285 million shares of the company , while the remaining holding is in the form of public holding and treasury shares .
The earth is getting really hot .
Both oceans and land have become warmer than the results in the record - keeping that began in 1880 , and temperatures keep rising .
In a nutshell , this constant temperature is global warming .
It is a long - term increase in the average temperature of the climate system of the earth .
It is main part of climate change , and has been shown by measurements of different effects of the warming and direct temperature measurement .
Global warming takes place when carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , other air pollutants , and greenhouse gases gather in the air and absorb solar radiation and sunlight that escaped from the surface of the earth .
This radiation would normally escape and finds its way into space , but the pollutants that can stay in the atmosphere for centuries , hold the heat , causing the planet to heat up .
This is known as greenhouse effect .
How does electricity cause global warming ?
Electricity is one of carbon dioxide ’s major causes .
In Australia for example , as 73 % of the electricity is derived from burning of coal and 13 % of it comes from burning of gas .
The 14 % that is left comes from renewable energy sources such as solar , hydro , and wind , which do not produce carbon .
So , yes , electricity is a major factor that causes global warming .
Effects Of Global Warming On The Earth
Human activities on earth are causing changes to the natural greenhouse .
Over the last 100 years , the burning of fossil fuels such as oil or coal burning process has augmented the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ( CO2 ) .
This occurs because the oil or coal burning process mixes carbon with oxygen in the air to produce CO2 .
The clearing of land for agricultural purpose , industry building , and other activities , has to an extent increased the concentrations of greenhouse gases .
The effects changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse has on the earth are not easy to predict , but some effects seem possible :
Averagely , the Earth will become warmer .
Certain regions on the earth may welcome warmer temperatures , while others may not .
More evaporation and precipitation will occur everywhere has a result of the warmer conditions , but some regions will be wetter and others will be dryer .
Also , a very strong greenhouse effect will warm the oceans and melt the glaciers and other ice partially , causing an increase in sea level .
If ocean water warms , it will expand and this will contribute to further rise in sea level .
In the meantime , some crops and other plants may perhaps respond favorable to the increase in atmospheric CO2 , growing well and using water more effectively .
Also , shifting climate patterns and higher temperatures may change the places where crops grow well and disrupt the natural plant communities ’ makeup .
Measuring The Health Effects Of Global Warming
The measurement of the effects of global warming on the health can only be very approximate .
However , an assessment by WHO , taking into consideration only a subsection of the possible health effects , and assuming sustained growth in the economy and health progress , reported that global warming and climate change will cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths yearly between 2030 and 2050 .
The assessment concluded that 38 000 people would die as a result of heat exposure in aged people , 48 000 would die of diarrhea , 60 000 would die of malaria , and 95 000 would die as a result of childhood malnutrition .
How Do We Stop The Effect Of Global Warming ?
Healing the planet from the harsh effects of global warming starts in home ; your garage , at your dining - room table , and in your kitchen .
It is a very simple goal .
The worst enemy of climate is Carbon dioxide .
This enemy is released when we burn coal , oil , and other fossil fuels for energy – the energy humans use to power their cars , homes , and mobile phones .
Here are some very effective ways that we can all make a difference .
Use Renewable Energy to Power Your Home and Gadgets
Go for a utility company that getsa minimum of half of its power from solar or wind and is certified by an organization that assesses renewable power options .
If you cannot do this , check you electricity bill : a lot of utilities now list so many ways you can support renewable energy sources on their websites and monthly statements .
Buy Energy - efficient Home and Office Appliances
Since efficiency standards for products and appliances were first implemented , dozens of them have kept 2.3 million tons of CO2 out of the air .
That ’s around the same amount as the yearly carbon pollution that is caused by almost 440 million cars .
When you are buying appliances such as refrigerators , pressing iron , oven , washing machines , etc. , check for the Energy Star label on it .
The label will tell you which one is the most efficient .
Reduce water waste
Reducing water waste also reduces carbon pollution .
This is because a lot of energy is needed to pump , heat , and treat water .
To do this , do n’t take long showers and turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth .
Estimates by EPA shows that if only one out of every 100 homes in America were retrofitted with water - efficient fixtures , around 100 million kilowatt - hours of electricity would be saved every year — evading 80,000 tons of global warming pollution .
Invest In Better bulbs
Use LED Lightbulbs .
The energy they consume is up to 80 percent less than the conventional incandescent .
LED Lightbulbs are also cheaper ; you will save more than $ 125 if you replace your conventional 60 - watt bulb with a 10 - watt LED .
Invest in Carbon Offsets
You can reduce the carbon you produce by investing in carbon offsets , which represent clean power that replaces the power from fossil fuels .
However , all carbon offset companies are not equal , so it is important that you do a proper research to find the best before you buy .
Reduce the Amount of Hot Water You Use
You can reduce your hot water use by setting the water heater at 120 degrees .
This will help save energy .
You can use an insulating blanket to wrap your water heater if it is over five years old .
To reduce the use of hot water and save around 350 pounds of CO2 yearly , invest in low - flow showerheads .
Use warm or cold water when you are doing your laundry to reduce hot water use and the energy needed to produce it .
Doing this alone can save at least 500 pounds of CO2 every year in most homes .
Save C02 by using the energy - saving settings on your dishwasher and leave the dishes to air - dry .
How Is Global - Warming Linked To Extreme Weather ?
Scientists have come to the conclusion that the rising temperatures of the earth are fueling hotter and longer heat waves , heavier rainfall , more frequent droughts , and stronger hurricanes .
In 2015 , for instance , scientists stated that the draught that was ongoing in California , which was the state ’s worst shortage of water in 1,200 years had been made worse by 15 to 20 percent by global warming .
The scientists also claimed that the odds of more of that drought happing in years to come had doubled over the past 100 years .
Also , the National Academies of Science , Engineering , and Medicine in 2016 , announced that certain whether events such as some heat waves can now be attributed to climate change .
The earth ’s ocean temperatures are beginning to warmer as well — and this means that tropical storms are able to pick up more energy .
The implication is global warming could pick a category 3 storm and turn it into a more dangerous category 4 storm .
Scientist have also found out that since the early 1980s the North Atlantic hurricanes frequency has increase as well as the number of storms that reach up to categories four and five .
In 2005 , the costliest hurricane in the history of the U.S.A , Hurricane Katrina , struck New Orleans .
Hurricane Sandy , the second costliest hurricane hut the East Coast in 2012 .
It is no doubt that impacts of global warming are being felt throughout the world .
Too much of heat waves have led to tens of thousands of deaths throughout the globe in recent years .
Also , since 2002 , Antarctica , in a surprising sign of events to come , has been losing around 134 billion metric tons of ice every year .
The rate at which global warming affects the earth could speed up if we do not stop burning fossil fuels .
And this will cause sea levels to rise some meters as years go by , say , over the next 50 to 150 years .

Is A Degree In Political Science Worth It ?
Looking to bolster the fight against childhood lead poisoning , the Environmental Protection Agency last month approved a tough new rule aimed at clearing the nation ’s air of the toxic metal .
But at the last minute , federal documents show , the Bush administration quietly weakened a key provision , exempting dozens of polluters from scrutiny .
A new network of monitors that is to track lead emissions from factories has been scaled back .
Critics say the change undermines a rule that otherwise has been widely hailed as a powerful step in protecting children ’s health .
The federal rule was prompted by compelling research showing lead is more dangerous than had been thought .
Even low levels of the toxic metal in young children have been linked to learning disabilities , aggression and criminal behavior later in life .
Many scientists say there is no safe level of exposure .

Faced with a court order to act more aggressively , the EPA last month lowered the maximum amount of lead allowed in the air .
The new standard , 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter , is 10 times more stringent than the standard set in 1978 .
To help meet the new limit , the EPA had planned to require lead monitors next to any factory emitting at least half a ton of lead a year .
But after the White House intervened , the agency raised the threshold to a ton of lead or more , according to e-mails and other documents exchanged between the EPA and the Office of Management and Budget .
As a result , dozens of factories wo n’t be checked regularly .
Federal and state officials debate the exact number , but a review of EPA records found the number of U.S. plants monitored could drop by nearly 60 % , from 203 to 87 .
“ This sleight of hand by the administration ignores major sources of a dangerous neurotoxin , ” said S. William Becker , executive director of the National Assn. of Clean Air Agencies .

The Obama administration could try to amend the lead rule , but that process would take months .
National lead emissions have dropped 97 % under the old standard , largely because lead was removed from gasoline .
But cement plants , smelters , steel mills and other factories still emit about 1,300 tons of lead into the air each year , the EPA said .
After tiny lead particles settle to the ground , they can stay there for years .
Exposure can occur when people , especially children , handle or play with contaminated soil and then put dirty hands into their mouths .
“ If we can keep bringing down blood - lead levels in kids , there could be considerable benefits over the years to a wide swath of our population , ” said Bruce Lanphear , a researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia , Canada , and a member of a scientific panel that urged the EPA to set tougher lead standards .

Dozens of monitors scattered across the country already check lead levels in the air , but the EPA estimated that it would take dozens more to track emissions from polluters releasing at least half a ton of lead .
Industry lobbyists waged a fierce battle against the new standard and the additional monitoring .
They argued that lingering dust from leaded gasoline and lead paint are a much bigger threat to children than ongoing industrial emissions .
In written comments filed with the EPA and the Office of Management and Budget , lead battery manufacturers and recyclers said many of their facilities would fail to comply with the tougher standard .
If factories had to reduce lead emissions , they said , companies would be forced to move operations to countries with lax environmental policies .
The Assn. of Battery Recyclers wrote in comments to the Office of Management and Budget that a tougher lead rule would lead to “ environmental and human health risks attributable to mishandling , improper disposal and illegal export of millions of spent lead acid batteries . ”
Advertisement
A related organization , the Battery Council International , told the EPA that the more stringent monitoring standards would be “ unjustifiably low . ”
Last month , two weeks after lobbyists from the industry met with Bush administration officials , the White House ordered the EPA to raise the monitoring threshold to a ton or more , federal records show .
An industry lawyer declined to comment , saying the publicly filed comments “ speak for themselves . ”
EPA officials said states could add lead monitors if they thought it was necessary .

“ We selected an approach that would still ensure monitoring around those sources that have the potential to contribute to a violation of the standards , ” Cathy Milbourn , an EPA spokeswoman , said in a statement .

The California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) is today expected to adopt the most radical global warming plan in the U.S. , and possibly the world .
If passed , it will force individuals , as well as the state ’s utilities , refineries and large factories to fundamentally change the way they do business , and slash greenhouse gas emissions .
The plan will outline for the first time how people and businesses will be required to meet the state ’s 2006 ‘ Global Warming Solutions Act ’ and transform California into a global leader in the fight against climate change .
The board will be in session all day to consider approval of the AB 32 Scoping Plan to Reduce GHG Emissions in California .
Key aspects of the plan include :
The creation of a carbon - credit ‘ cap and trade ’ market designed to give the state ’s major polluters cheaper ways to cut emissions ;
A Low Carbon Fuel standard ;
Stringent transport related greenhouse gas targets ;
A target of generating 33 % of the states ’s electricity from renewable energy by 2020 ;
Ambitious vehicle efficiency measures ;
Implementation of a high speed rail system ;
A radical green building strategy .
It seems that , at least for today , the eyes of the global environmental movement will be firmly fixed on what unfolds in Sacramento …

A series of Apple patent filings published this week reveal the Mac maker has spent a considerable amount of time outlining a new multi-dimensional interface for Mac OS X that would make better use of screen real estate by increasing the number of virtual surfaces capable of housing application and interface elements .
The most extensive of those filings is labeled " Multi- Dimensional Desktop " and was submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office back in June of last year , around the same time the company took the wraps off the feature set for its upcoming release of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard .
None of the latest interface enhancements described in the June patent are present in current pre-release builds of Snow Leopard , however , suggesting they 'll be candidates for inclusion in versions of Mac OS X that would surface in years to come .
Generally speaking , the filings depict a 3D interface by which side walls , a top , and a floor all protrude from a back surface that resembles today 's two - dimensional Mac OS X desktop .
A few examples also suggest a radical departure from traditional interface design by which the Mac OS X menubar would be removed from the top of the screen and thrown into a stack or floating element .
An illustrated description of each of Apple 's proposed design changes can be found below :
In the example above , Apple portrays an exemplary multidimensional desktop environment that includes a back surface like today 's traditional two - dimensional desktop environment , which includes the Mac OS X menu bar and desktop surface .
Protruding from this surface would be one or more side surfaces capable of housing object receptacles , including a " floor " that would contain the Mac OS X Dock and icon stacks positioned in the background .
Other side surfaces would intersect with the floor , forming a three - dimensional box , though Apple says a " top " surface may not always be necessary .
Most of the diagrams in the filing show the multi-dimentional Finder with side surfaces , or " walls , " as shown above .
As is the case with the floor surface , object receptacles like the Dock can be placed along the walls at certain perceived depths .
The example above shows the Dock displaced behind the 3D icon stacks sitting on the floor , but could also be arranged closer to the viewing surface so that it displays in front of the icon stacks .
The 3D icon stacks in the multi-dimensional Finder would fan outwards as they do in today 's version of the Mac OS X but would not necessarily be tied to a linear path .
They could instead fan in a three - dimensional arch towards a central region of the display , producing the perception of depth .
Alternatively , a short stack of icons could instead expand into a two dimensional matrix that would also display behind other elements such as the Dock .
Apple adds that the stack items could corresponding to the categories of online buddies and music , which could be controlled contextually .
For example , a stack item can automatically appear when the Finder receives a notification that an event associated with another user that is designated as an " online buddy " has occurred , such as an " online buddy " logging onto a network .
Apple in another example goes on to explain that the floor can be vast and sprawling , with only a portion of the surface displayed at any given time .
" For example , upon a selection of the surface , [...] the surface can be scrolled in the directions indicated by the arrows , " the company said .
" The floor surface can include a scroll ingress and a scroll egress in which a scroll direction transitions from the scroll ingress to the scroll egress . "
More specifically , the intersections of the two side walls may define a scroll ingress and a scroll egress for a left - to - right scroll direction , or the left edge and the right edge of the reflection region may define a scroll ingress and a scroll egress for a left - to - right scroll direction .
During a scroll , the stack items can be displaced from the floor surface by fading from view or by a failing effect .
Meanwhile , application windows can be dragged to one of the side walls , where they 'd appear in thumbnail form , or as stacks of windows .
The windows could be restored to their traditional form by dragging them back to the back surface ( Desktop ) or through a simple double - click .
The side walls could also be colored to emphasize the back surface and the reflection regions of the interface .
For example , the side surfaces could be black in color , or respective patterns , colors , or images can be rendered on each side surface .
Other differentiation schemes including color schemes and image schemes can also be applied , Apple said .
A lighting aspect could also be employed to generate an illumination effect from window thumbnails or widgets placed on the side walls .
For example , the illumination effect could comprise a simulated sunbeam emanating from one of the window thumbnails or widgets on the left wall .
The illumination effect could change according to local environmental states .
For example , it could track across the surfaces according to a local time , or its intensity could be modulated by local weather conditions that are received over the network — high intensity for sunny days , low intensity for overcast days and during the early evening .
Each element on the side walls could also cast its own shadow on subsequent interface elements to emphasize a depth aspect and an overall user interface relationship .
The above example shows how stack items on the floor can move in response to the addition of a new stack item .
As the new stack item drops onto the surface , the stack items already on the surface can move in response to the displacement induced by the new stack item , shifting those stack items forwards , backwards , to the right or left .
" In one implementation , a maximum number of stack items can be displayed on the surface .
If the addition of a new stack item causes the number of displayed stack items to be exceeded , then a stack item nearest a surface intersection can be displaced from the surface , " Apple explained .
" For example , if the maximum number of stack items to be displayed is four , then [ one of the stacks ] can continue to move to the edge of the surface , where [ it would be ] displaced , e.g. , fades from view , atomizes , etc . "
Another example shows a three - dimensional Finder that lacks a traditional menubar on the back surface .
In this case , a stack item could be utilized to access menu items traditionally found at the top of the Mac OS X dektop .
Alternatively , selection of the menu stack item could throw a traditional menubar back into place at the top of the screen , or display menu items on the back surface , or one of the walls .
The same diagram shown above also depicts a running application by which one or more application control elements — such as palettes — can be displayed on one or more side walls .
For example , a tool bar or layers palette can be displayed on the side walls when Photoshop is running .
The above diagram expands on the concept of having application control elements reside on the walls of a multi- dimensional Finder by portraying those elements as 3D icons , which would expand their functionality .
For example , each three - dimensional function icon could include a separate function command on each surface , and each three - dimensional function icon could be be rotated , positioned , and manipulated through the use of an input device , such as a mouse .
Additional 3D icons could be added to the surface by use of a menu , while removing one of the 3D icons can cause the remaining icons to " fall " in a downward direction on the surface wall .
Apple said 3D icons can also be used to transition between work spaces , or to transition between a 2D Finder and a 3D Finder .
Windows in a 3D Mac OS X interface can also be dragged or displaced across one or more surfaces .
For example , windows can transition out of view by sliding across the back surface and side walls .
Side surfaces could also be used to implement a deletion characteristic .
" For example , the last access time for icons and other system object representations can be monitored .
If the last access time for an icon or other system object representation exceeds a first threshold , the icon or other system object representation can be automatically transitioned to the surface implementing the deletion characteristic , " Apple said .
" Additionally , if the last access time for the icon or other system object representation located on the surface exceeds a second threshold , the icon or other system object representation can be automatically deleted from view . "
One final multidimensional desktop environment described in the filing includes an arcuate back surface with side surfaces defined by arcuate regions having curvature intersections .
" Other multidimensional desktop environment geometries can also be used .
For example , in one implementation , the multidimensional desktop environment can conform to a tetrahedron - shaped environment in which a front surface of the tetrahedron defines a viewing surface , and the remaining three surfaces define a left surface , a bottom surface , and a side surface , " Apple said .
" In another implementation , the multidimensional desktop environment can conform to a triangular environment , in which one axis of the triangle defines the viewing surface and the remaining two sides of the triangle define a left surface and a right surface . "
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
The only surviving suspect in last month 's attacks in Mumbai has written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission , or embassy , seeking legal aid , CNN 's sister network in India reported Saturday , quoting a Mumbai police official .
Flames and smoke gush from the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai , India , on November 27 .
Investigators said that Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is from Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan 's Punjab province and that the other nine attackers also are from Pakistan .
Pakistani officials have denied that assertion , blaming instead " stateless actors . "
Rakesh Maria , Mumbai 's joint police commissioner of crime , said Saturday that Kasab 's three - page letter was written in Urdu .
In the letter , Kasab confesses his role in the attacks , CNN - IBN said .
The letter is to be delivered to the commission 's New Delhi , India , office , possibly Monday , the network reported .
Maria paraphrased parts of the letter at a news conference but did not release a copy to the media , CNN - IBN said .
More than 160 people were killed in the three - day Mumbai siege that started November 26 and targeted 10 sites , including two luxury hotels , a train station and other landmarks .
Of the 10 suspects , only 21 - year - old Kasab survived , according to police .
This week , Pakistani authorities banned a charity linked to the attacks and placed its leader under house arrest , Pakistan 's information minister told CNN .
The move came after the U.N. Security Council designated the charity , Jamaat - ud - Dawa , as a terrorist organization because of its links to Lashkar - e - Tayyiba ( known by the acronym LeT ) and placed sanctions on the group .
India has blamed LeT for training the attackers who carried out the Mumbai attacks .

Comic Book Legal Defense
Fund to assist in man 's defense
The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund ( CBLDF ) has announced on Thursday that it is serving as a special consultant to the defense of Christopher Handley , an Iowa collector charged with the alleged possession of obscene manga .
Handley faces up to 20 years in prison .
Handley had received a package of seven manga that the Postal Inspector intercepted and determined to contain objectionable images .
With a search warrant , the agents from the Postal Inspector 's office , Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency , Special Agents from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation , and officers from the Glenwood Police Department followed Handley home from the post office and seized his collection of over 1,200 manga volumes ; hundreds of DVDs , VHS tapes , and laser discs ; seven computers ; and other materials .
However , Handley is being charged for only part of his collection .
CBLDF 's United Defense Group team , led by Eric Chase , has successfully petitioned District Judge Gritzner to drop some of Handley 's charges and rule parts of a controversial law unconstitutional .
Handley was initially charged under the United States Code , which was amended by section 504 of the PROTECT
Act to prohibit distribution or possession of " a visual depiction of any kind , including a drawing , cartoon , sculpture , or painting , " that —
• ‘( 1 ) ( A ) depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct ; and • ’ ( B ) is obscene ; or • ' ( 2 ) ( A ) depicts an image that is , or appears to be , of a minor engaging in graphic bestiality , sadistic or masochistic abuse , or sexual intercourse , including genital - genital , oral - genital , anal - genital , or oral - anal , whether between persons of the same or opposite sex ; and • ' ( B ) lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value ;
Gritzner ruled that the last two clauses were unconstitutional as they restricted protected speech .
Handley still faces charges under the obscenity clause , if the court determines that the material meets the Supreme Court 's Miller Test .
The Miller Test dictates that material is only obscene if a jury determines that it meets all of the following three criteria :
whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest
whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law
whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value
CBLDF Executive Director Charles Brownstein notes , " In the past , CBLDF has had to defend the First Amendment rights of retailers and artists , but never before have we experienced the Federal Government attempting to strip a citizen of his freedom because he owned comic books . "
Update :
In July , the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa posted the ruling that struck down some of charges against Handley .
Handley was originally charged on May 8 , 2007 .

FEARS that James Packer 's Crown misjudged its investment into the US gambling market have triggered an analyst to write off a $ 414 million investment as worthless .
A gambling industry analyst with Citi , Jenny Owen , said the small stakes in two debt - laden US casino companies were now worth nothing " due to the highly leveraged nature of the private - equity - owned casino operators and the downturn in industry revenue " .
Crown spent $ 172 million on a 2.5 per cent stake in Harrah 's Entertainment in January and $ 242 million on a 4.9 per cent stake in Station Casinos Group in August last year .
The purchases were made at the top of the market and before the casinos were hit by the worst of the fallout of the credit crisis .
In August Crown was forced to write them down by $ 258 million , blaming their exposure to the ailing Nevada gambling market and their high debt levels .
Since then both have had further falls in visitor numbers and rising debt costs .
In recent weeks they have been busily trying to renegotiate their heavy debt loads , asking their bondholders to swap their notes for new ones that have a lower value but will be easier to redeem if they collapse .
Twitter yesterday announced the acquisition of small - time Web 2.0 startup Values of N , creator of the utilities I Want Sandy and Stikkit .
We ’ve covered both companies here previously at Mashable , and I ’ve spoken several times about my general love for I Want Sandy as a unique and valuable approach to the virtual personal assistant problem .
I Want Sandy is a virtual personal assistant that ’s integrated with your email so that keeping track of appointments and such is a slightly less stressful fact of every day life [ … ]
I Want Sandy works by offering you your own email address .
This is good because it means you can send something to your account from any email address , and it does n’t need to come directly from your registered email address in order to add items .
Likewise , CC’ing Sandy on an email sent to another person will also be integrated for your account .
There are a few things that you can ask Sandy to do , like remind you of a project that needs to be turned in next Friday , add items to your to - do list , or add things to your calendar .
The acquisition is widely regarded as a personnel acquisition , rather than a technology acquisition .
In Ev Williams announcement on the Twitterblog , he mentioned some of the details of the acquisition :
Values of n will be shutting down existing products .
However , the technology behind the scenes will live on and potentially re-emerge as part of Twitter ’s systems , services , user experience , or open source libraries .
Nothing specific in this regard is planned but there is some smart work in there by the newest member of our engineering team .
I struggled to come up with a unique angle on this story since I heard the news yesterday , since we do n’t typically write up what essentially amounts to hirings of engineers here at Mashable .
Then I saw a particularly interesting tidbit mentioned by MG Siegler over at Venturebeat , immediately followed by a post by Dave over at Evil Genius Chronicles .
MG points to a correlative personal blog post from the engineer for whom the acquisition was made , spilling a little more detail regarding the future of I Want Sandy :
While Twitter has no immediate plans to incorporate Sandy or Stikkit ’s feature sets into its core product , those who know our apps well may notice familiar - feeling bits and bobs appearing in your Twitter experience .
While I was heartened by the fact that I Want Sandy may or may not completely disappear , I could n’t help but empathize with the sentiments expressed by Dave at EGC :
I kept building a slow burn on this until I decided I ’m done .
I had been pushing my FriendFeed updates to Twitter since they added that functionality but now I ’m turning it off .
I do n’t want to do anything to that builds value for Twitter .
I ’m withdrawing my participation from them . [… ]
I used Sandy and l liked it a lot .
In fact , the main reason I stopped using it on a daily basis and started using Google Calendar and documents for that kind of work is when Twitter took IM access away .
I ’m highly pissed about this .
It makes no sense to me why even if Twitter acquired Value of N they ca n’t leave the services up and running with a skeleton crew .
This just reinforces the idea that you should be careful what services you commit your time and energy to , because Web 2.0 companies will screw you and make you waste your time building value that they cash out and leave you holding the bag .
He has a strong point , and while I still enjoy Twitter enough that I ca n’t see myself getting rid of the service , I did very much enjoy I Want Sandy , and just like Dave , relied on it exclusively for scheduling until Twitter disabled IM functionality .
I never found the parser that functioned from the e-mail side to be that strong , and without the Twitter interface , I do n’t see how it could at all be a useful service .
The convenience of the service relied on it being integrated into my daily workflow , as it was showing up in my GMail .
Twhirl , my current client , is a great Twitter client , but it ’s a window I occasionally check , not something I keep always on top .
So the idea that Twitter may have purchased a business model here ( offering the former utility of I Want Sandy and Stikkit ) is one that fails , in my opinion .
Twitter had already knee - capped the biggest draw to these services , and any attempts to bring back the functionality without IM interface will be fruitless .

Obama ’s Team Claims Rahm Emanuel Only Had One Conversation With Blagojevich
President - elect Obama had an internal investigation on his staff and on Rahm Emanuel in particular to find out if there was any wrong doing within his staff in the pay to play scheme that Democrat governor Rod Blagojevich was conducting to fill Obama ’s vacant senate seat .
Guess what he found ?
He found that Rahm Emanuel only had one conversation with the disgraced governor of Illinois and it did n’t involve talk about Obama ’s senate vacancy .
Who woulda thunk it ?
And we know that this must be true because it is being reported here by the non-partisan George Stephanopoulos .
( I ca n’t even type that with a straight face )
Evidently Obama ’s internal investigation missed this story about Rahm Emanuel being caught on tape 21 times talking with Blagojevich .
That is n’t surprising because his internal investigation also missed this story about Rahm Emanuel having direct talks with the governor about Obama ’s senate seat .
President - elect Obama is in spin mode .
He assured us that nobody on his staff had ANY conversations with Blago and that was a lie , now he is saying that yes Rahm did talk to Blago but only once and not about his senate seat .
All the while Emanuel is on tape talking to Blago about the seat .
But much like all of Obama ”s other controversial associations that some of us knew about despite the medias attempt to hide it , the media will also hide this .
Does anyone else out there find it odd that Patrick Fitzgerald stopped Blagojevich before the deal actually went down ?
Usually when there is a sting operation nobody moves in until the deal is complete , yet this was stopped before it ever happened .
Why ?
We are talking about the man who continued the Plame leak investigation for a year after he know who leaked Plame ’s name just so that he could get a process crime , yet he stopped this before the actual crime was committed .
This was going to go all the way to Obama if it was allowed to proceed so it was stopped .
That is the only conclusion I can come to .
Now Obama is admitting that a member of his staff DID in fact contact Blago but he is spinning it so that it sounds like just a routine conversation took place regardless of the evidence to the contrary .
And we will never know the true extent of Obama ’s involvement because Fitzgerald conveniently stopped the pay to play scheme before it ever reached it ’s conclusion .
In an about face , the U.S. Marshals Service says it now wants to apply for an exotic dance permit and liquor license from the city to operate the Crazy Horse Too .
The change in attitude comes as the value of the Crazy Horse Too has plummeted by millions of dollars since the Marshals Service allowed the liquor license to lapse June 30 without finding a buyer to run the topless club .
At the time , U.S. District Judge Philip Pro criticized the Marshals Service for not applying for a liquor license to take over the club in the absence of a buyer to retain the value of the property .
The Marshals Service said at the time it did not want to get into the topless club business .
The strategy to run the Crazy Horse Too also comes as a California Bank has filed court papers asking Pro to lift a stay prohibiting the bank from foreclosing on the government - seized strip club to satisfy a $ 5 million loan it made to former owner Rick Rizzolo .
Security Pacific Bank told Pro the value of the Crazy Horse Too declined from roughly $ 30 million to $ 4.6 million under the marshals ' control .
In court papers Thursday , the government disputed that appraisal , saying its own appraisal has put the property 's value at $ 7 million without a liquor license and $ 11 million with a license .
And that does not include any potential business income , the government said .
The government seized the Crazy Horse Too in September 2007 after Rizzolo failed to sell the club on his own as part of a deal to resolve a criminal case with the government .
Rizzolo pleaded guilty to tax evasion and spent roughly 10 months in prison .
The Marshals Service has been trying to sell the club so that Rizzolo can pay off some $ 29 million in debts associated with the property .
Rizzolo owes the government millions of dollars in fines and back taxes , as well as $ 9 million to a Kansas City area man who was let paralyzed following a 2001 fight at the Crazy Horse too .
In its court papers , the government said the marshals have hired a private law firm that specializes in land use issues to help it persuade the city to give it a liquor license to run the club .
There is some precedence for the government to get involved in the adult business .
In the early 1990s , the government operated the Mustang Ranch briefly after it was seized by the IRS .
The government also ran the Bicycle Club , a Southern California card club seized in a drug trafficking case , in the 1990s .
Although I have a chiropractic degree from Life University in Marietta , Georgia , I do not encourage students to enter the profession .
It took me a long time to learn the extent to which chiropractic is riddled with problems .
Students and prospective students may not realize this because the schools and many practitioners paint an overly optimistic picture of what awaits new chiropractic graduates in the real world .
At the time I attended , Life encouraged its alumni to recruit prospective students from their practices .
Successful alumni were given rewards such as a white distinctive blazer with the school ’s crest .
My own chiropractor was one of these supporters .
She told me that chiropractic was based on legitimate scientific principles and that I would receive the best chiropractic education at Life .
Admissions materials from the school described it as providing a thorough education in the diagnosis and care of patients so that their health would be improved by removing nerve interference .
These assertions were all false .
My Chiropractic School Experience
During my college years , the only negative information I encountered about chiropractic was Ralph Lee Smith ’s book At Your Own Risk : The Case Against Chiropractic in the local library .
But my chiropractor advised me to disregard it because it was inspired by a “ witch hunt ” against chiropractic by the American Medical Association .
She also said that a recent verdict in an antitrust suit against the AMA had proved this was true .
Years later , I learned that this was completely untrue and that the judge had actually remarked that the AMA had had legitimate grounds to attack improper chiropractic practices .
Career almanacs and handbooks favorably describe chiropractic as a promising career and do not mention any negative information .
Because I encountered almost no negative information and trusted the fact that the college was accredited , I did not think to question the validity of chiropractic theory .
Later I learned that most of the information in these career guides originates from chiropractic organizations themselves and portrays the profession in an unrealistically positive light .
Students at Life University ( and many other chiropractic schools and postgraduate programs ) get an intense indoctrination into the chiropractic belief system .
They are exposed to contradictory chiropractic systems and are encouraged to find one that they can support even if they disbelieve the others .
My instructors taught that all the techniques were effective and encouraged us to use whatever method we liked , based on personal preference and patient responses measured with chiropractic assessments .
Whether or not methods were evidence - based was irrelevant .
Accreditation standards say that one objective of chiropractic education is to acquire the ability to critically evaluate research .
However , I have observed just the opposite .
For example , after taking several postgraduate seminars , I realized that several commonly used chiropractic analysis procedures had been proven unreliable .
But when I tried to share this information with my classmates , they immediately discounted all negative research as fraudulent .
Instructors at the college actually taught them how to do this in chiropractic philosophy indoctrination classes .
Before long , my well - intentioned discussions resulted in excommunication as a heretic by many of my classmates .
My program at Life program seemed like that of any other school and I had no major problems until about halfway into the curriculum .
During the eighth quarter of the 14 - quarter system , the program became much more adversarial as we entered the outpatient clinic .
This was our internship , where we were supposed to gain our clinical experience by treating the public .
In earlier quarters , the school had taken extra effort to make us feel welcome .
We were treated to free lunches , guided tours of the campus by friendly enthusiastic students , and free lodging when touring the campus .
The clinic atmosphere was different .
The instructors made it very clear that unless a long list of rules was followed , we would face suspension from the clinic and possible failure of that quarter ’s clinical internship .
Infractions were outlined in a student handbook .
Violations would result in either a warning or a suspension — known as a “ pink slip . ”
This system was unbelievably harsh .
Students could find themselves suspended from clinic for such minor mistakes as forgetting to empty a cup of urine , not filling out a form completely , missing an appointment because of a miscommunication with a patient about the appointment date , or even wearing casual slacks rather than dress slacks .
In addition to this harsh system of rules , students were kept constantly busy by the demands of the clinic , academic classes , and national boards .
My typical day would be to arise at 6 am , arrive early in the clinic in order to secure a place on a walk - in list for new patients .
After doing this I would sit on a stool at one of four telephone stations where I and up to three other students would take turns answering the clinic ’s one telephone with the hope of finding new patients to treat .
Students who were not recruiting enough patients to pass the course became desperate .
A large wooden sign hung in the hallway with carved letters that read “ Whatever It Takes . ”
Instructors advised us to use direct solicitation .
They encouraged us to visit drugstores and to target people in pain .
This approach was often difficult , because many local residents had been solicited so often that Life students were regarded as desperate and fanatical .
Successful students targeted faculty and families with young children who could receive care at discounted rates .
Many students paid their patients ’ clinic fees out of desperation .
In retrospect , this system of strict rules and harsh punishments resembles descriptions of how cults operate .
Since students were kept busy , they had little time to question the teachings of the group ; and the Draconian punishments encouraged conformity .
Up to 30 % of students failed this class and had to pay to retake it .
Like many other students , I was unable to find enough patients to pass that first clinic and was very frustrated .
This problem , combined with the school president ’s prohibition against many common treatment methods that I wanted to learn , led me to consider transferring to the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic .
I found , however , that despite having excellent grades , I would lose an entire year of school if I did that .
Wishing to keep expenses to a minimum , I decided to finish the program .
As I reached my final terms , I wondered why , despite being in the upper part of my class , I found the diagnosis sections of the National Boards difficult .
Ten months after graduation I was shocked when — despite graduating Magna Cum Laude and spending eight months studying — I failed Part IV of final national board exams , a requirement for practice in most states .
After completing a review course , I retook and passed the test and began seeking employment , expecting to work with chiropractors skilled in rehabilitation and gain valuable clinical experience to compensate for the limited training I had received in school .
Unfortunately , this proved incorrect , because the chiropractors who hired me misrepresented themselves .
My Work Experience
The first chiropractor I worked for — also a Life graduate — used me and other new graduates as a front to bilk insurance companies out of millions of dollars .
He never told me that the guidelines he had us follow for treating auto accident patients were illegal .
It must have been a lucrative scam for him , because the state board investigators told me that he caused the licenses of two associates to be revoked for fraudulent billing .
Luckily , I stayed in close contact with the board and his license ended up being revoked , not mine .
I subsequently worked for two other chiropractors .
One was a Scientologist who tried to get me to join Scientology in Los Angeles .
This man told patients that chiropractic adjustments could cure multiple sclerosis , acne , and heart disease .
The board revoked his license after learning that he had tried to conceal a license revocation in another state .
The other chiropractor , who ran a clinic for patients with chronic back pain , ordered me to overutilize expensive nerve - conduction tests to boost the clinic income .
When I balked at ordering unnecessary tests , I was fired .
The Kentucky chiropractic licensing board was not interested in prosecuting him .
I once believed that I could teach myself differential diagnosis and follow scientific treatment guidelines .
Later I learned that this was not possible without exposure to expert faculty and actual patients .
Refusing to be a quack or a thief , I had serious doubts about whether to remain a chiropractor .
In 2003 , I gave it one more try by accepting a position with a graduate of National University of Health Sciences ( one of the better chiropractic schools ) who was certified in “ chiropractic sports medicine . ”
But I soon learned that :
He routinely used scare tactics , such as warnings about “ subluxations ” and “ nerve interference , ” to promote lifetime maintenance care , even for small children .
Everything he said to patients was carefully scripted to induce compliance .
He falsely coded patient records so he could be paid for treatment that insurance companies considered unnecessary .
His x-ray films were of poor quality .
His office manager told me that the chiropractor had failed to identify the cause of her mother ’s back pain , which turned out to be a cancer that caused her death .
I suspect that better - quality x-rays might have revealed that the pain had been caused by metastatic tumor .
So , despite this chiropractor ’s training at a more academically inclined school , he performed no better than the rest .
Disgusted with his unethical conduct , my own lack of training in differential diagnosis , and the anti-science orientation of the field , I resigned and quit the profession for good .
Further Observations and Beliefs
While reflecting on my experiences , I remembered the glowing claims from the admissions materials that Life had initially sent me and decided to revisit them .
I now believe that the school was training unknowing students to engage in practices that were unethical and dangerous .
Life University has been teaching that chiropractors should not perform differential diagnosis ( listing possible medical conditions and doing what is necessary to determine whether they are present ) — a policy that places patients at considerable risk .
Concerned about this problem , I encouraged students to seek corrective action .
One article I posted on Chirobase encouraged graduates to challenge these problems with a class - action lawsuit .
This caused quite a commotion at the college and encouraged faculty and students to speak out against policies of Sid E. Williams , D.C. , the school ’s president .
Life ’s heavy - handed response triggered complaints to the school ’s accreditor , the Council on Chiropractic Education ( CCE ) , which performed a site visit and revoked Life ’s accreditation status .
Unfortunately , in 2002 , Life claimed unfair treatment and sued the accreditor for $ 100 million dollars .
The suit ended in a confidential settlement where Life ’s accreditation was restored and the accreditation agency claimed that all of the problems had been corrected for later classes .
At the time of Life ’s 2002 accreditation troubles , I submitted my own complaints which illustrated how the same problems existed as early as 1992 when I began classes .
I estimated that 8,000 Life graduates were inadequately trained in diagnosis , posing a serious threat to their patients because they might not refer patients to medical practitioners in a timely manner .
As students , these chiropractors were also taught to take unnecessary x-rays of pain - free areas ( to find “ subluxations ” ) and to advise patients to discontinue prescription medications .
The handling of my complaints provides a lesson in how ineffective the current regulatory system is .
My initial complaint to Life went unaddressed .
A follow - up complaint to the CCE regarding Life ’s lack of action was stonewalled for months .
My subsequent complaint to the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) regarding CCE ’s excessive stonewalling , which violated DOE ’s guidelines , forced CCE to verify that my complaints against Life were valid and produced a statement that they had corrected the problems in the present .
Alarmed that past graduates were not warned that they would be held personally liable for malpractice , I asked DOE to have CCE retroactively strip the accreditation of the program for the affected students and offer some kind of remediation .
DOE responded that they do not require accreditation agencies to do such things .
The end result is that the CCE and the DOE have covered up the fact that thousands of Life graduates have entered practice without even a rudimentary knowledge of how to diagnose properly .
The Bottom Line
Having personally observed the activities of scores of chiropractors and their organizations , I am convinced that :
Chiropractic ’s legitimate scope of practice is too limited and its adherence to pseudoscience is too entrenched to promote optimal physical medicine
Many chiropractic institutions encourage ( or fail to discourage ) unethical practices .
Despite years of education , most chiropractors lack the knowledge and ability to provide quality care and many have enormous student loan debts .
( Chiropractic graduates have the highest student loan default rate among the health professions , with Life ’s graduates having the highest number of defaulters and the highest total amount . )
For these reasons — and more — students who are interested in manual medicine would be much wiser to pursue physiatry , osteopathy , or physical therapy as as career .
Dr. Botnick attended Life College from 1992 to 1996 .
His article about the school ’s assemblies provides a vivid description of the school ’s atmosphere .
His Chirotalk Forum contains additional views about whether chiropractic should be abandoned .
Reader Response , 2/9/04
My experiences in chiropractic school and in the field have been remarkably similar to yours .
After a year of practicing on my own , have decided to quit chiropractic for good .
This has been a very difficult time for me , and my decision is based on many actors — philosophic as well as economic .
I opened my clinic in April 2003 with the idea of becoming a reformer who would tell the “ truth ” about chiropractic .
Quite honestly , people just do n’t seem to care very much .
I still owe $ 135,000 on my student loan .

An Outline of Money revisited
Geoffrey Crowther wrote about the Great Depression in the final chapter of his book An Outline of Money [ 1 ] .
Despite being written in the 1940's , what he had to say has more relevance to the current economic crisis than anything else I have read on the subject .*
" If the economic relationships between nations are not , by one means or another , brought fairly close to balance , then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos . " [ 2 ]
The Great Depression was the almost inevitable consequence of events that preceded it . [ 3 ]
Over the course of the 1920's , large balance of payments surpluses built up , primarily in the USA , which were recycled back into the global economy in the form of loans overseas . [ 4 ]
In the normal course of events , international transfers of funds are in the form of loans and the repayment of loans for investment purposes or of investments and the repatriation of profits .
Any excesses or deficits of consumption are transitory and will tend to even out between countries over time .
But in the period leading up to the Great Depression , the number of sound investment opportunities could not possibly keep pace with the growing size of the global imbalances of payments .
International loans were increasingly used to fund not investment but consumption and did nothing to increase the industrial capacity of the borrowers . [ 5 ]
As the quality of loans deteriorated and the insolvency of debtors grew more likely , investors eventually took fright and started to draw in their loans .
By early 1929 , US investors had largely stopped making long - term loans overseas , effectively ending US capital investment abroad .
Instead , without an overseas outlet , surplus funds were redirected into the US stock market , which reached unsustainably high levels in the summer of 1929 before crashing in the autumn of that year . [ 6 ]
Short term loans continued throughout 1930 , but eventually stalled in 1931 . [ 7 ]
At that point , balance of payments deficits could no longer be funded by short - term loans and could only be rectified by changes in the balance of trade , i.e. by an increase in exports or a decrease in imports — or by default .
In 1931 , the UK — caught between its long term loans and short term debts — came off the gold standard [ 8 ] and sterling dropped by a quarter .
Germany , meanwhile , chose default .
Creditor nations in turn were faced with the loss in the value of their overseas investments as well as a fall in international competitiveness , leading to a loss of export markets , and increased competition from overseas producers in their domestic markets .
In these circumstances , it was no longer possible to be both a creditor and a net exporter , as the US had become .
It was crucial that creditor countries — and particularly the US — should recognize that this was the case , but they did not .
Instead they imposed import tariffs to protect their domestic industries .
The inevitable result , beginning in 1931 , was a series of retaliatory measures by other countries and a precipitous decline in global trade that did not recover until decades — decades — later . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
The similarities between then and now are remarkable .
This time , there is a large build up of balance of payments surpluses in China , Japan and elsewhere .
Again , sound investment opportunities have been unable to absorb all the surplus capital and the consequence has been a deterioration in the quality of investments and loans .
Again , investors are taking fright and long term lending is contracting .
One interesting side effect of the contraction in lending is that the US dollar is increasing in value .
This is the logical consequence of the increase in demand for dollars caused by the liquidation of loans and assets , almost all of which are denominated in US dollars
This is happening despite the fact that the US — now the world 's greatest debtor nation — will have to , at some point in this cycle , reverse its balance of payments deficit — which it cannot conceivably do with its currency at the current level .
However , the dollar cannot fall until the forces of dollar - denominated asset liquidation are overtaken by the need for the US to balance its payments .
At the point this happens , it is quite likely that short - term lending in dollars will effectively cease .
The United States , with large direct investments in East Asian companies and large loans from their central banks , will be caught — like the UK in the 1930 's — borrowing short and lending long .
The dollar will fall precipitously , and with nobody willing to lend in it , the dollar will no longer — at least in the short term — be able to function as an international reserve currency .
It may be possible — although politically inadvisable — to slow the descent by ruinously high interest rates or by a fire sale of US assets to foreign buyers , but at some point — and preferably sooner than later — the terms of trade will have to rebalance .
At this point , the question becomes : will China and Japan be prepared to run trade deficits — will the engines of international trade for the past 30 years be prepared to import more goods than they export ?
But right now , after the imbalances in world trade have already built up , it is important to realise that there are strict limits to what any government can do to alter the course of events .
The time for affecting the broad course of the current crisis has passed , well before its affects have become obvious — just as was the case in the run up to the Great Depression .
Events have to play out until such time as the Chinese and the Japanese are faced with the same choice the US faced in the early 1930's : whether or not to allow trade to continue on terms wholly different to those to which they have become accustomed .
" No words are too strong to condemn the idiocies of this period .
But condemnation alone will not be of much profit .
The panic once started , no nation could afford to be left out of it ... nor should we lay all the blame on panic alone .
An orderly retreat would indeed have had less catastrophic results ; but a reduction of foreign lending and a readjustment of their Balance of Payments by both creditors and debtors was inevitable .
Borrowing on the lines of 1927 - 9 could not in any case have continued .
The loans were on too large a scale , to the wrong borrowers , and for purposes that made no provision for repayment .
In the last analysis the blame must be laid on the pre-crisis world " [ 11 ]
This whole medical marijuana debate in New Jersey is confusing to me .
I just do n't get how any policy maker in Trenton , or any state capital , would stand in the way of people who are suffering chronic pain doing anything medically necessary to reduce that pain and improve the quality of their lives .
Recently , a bill to allow for the legal use of marijuana -- The New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act -- passed the Senate Committee and is moving to the Senate floor for a vote .
To date , 13 states have adopted a similar law and there is no reason why New Jersey should n't be the 14th to do so .
If the law is passed as it is currently written , anyone who wanted to get access to legal marijuana for medicinal purposes must have a physician clearly document the need for such use .
Stringent safeguards are in place including patients being required to carry a state identification card verifying their enrollment , as well as patients and their primary caretakers must not have a history of drug convictions .
There is little evidence that in the 13 states where marijuana has been legalized for medicinal purposes that abuse of the drug is occurring .
Further , countless medical and clinical professionals have argued that marijuana can be extremely helpful to patients , particularly those suffering from such debilitating medical conditions such as MS , cancer , diabetes , glaucoma , HIV and AIDS .
Opponents will argue that legalizing marijuana for medical use may send the wrong message about drug use .
Yet , according to Bruce Mirken , director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project ; " Twelve states have had medical marijuana laws in place long enough to have data on teen marijuana use from both before and after their medical marijuana laws took effect , and in every single one , teen marijuana use has gone down , not up . "
The federal government , through the Bush Administration , has further complicated things by saying that only the feds can allow for the legal use of marijuana for medical purposes .
That is a crock .
When it suits them , the Bush Administration says that the states should decide on certain controversial policies like stem cell research .
However , when they pick and choose on issues like this , they only create more confusion and chaos .
Further , the fact that the Bush Administration has prosecuted people in California who were legally distributing marijuana in accordance to state law just makes things worse .
One wonders , with all the problems facing the White House , why it would be such a high priority to go after medical professionals who are only looking to help their suffering patients who are simply looking for some relief .
As for others who argue that smoking marijuana could potentially increase the risk of respiratory problems , closer examination of this argument is needed .
How could the feds or any other serious government official involved in health care talk about marijuana creating respiratory problems when there has never been a serious discussion about banning the sale and use of cigarettes -- a known carcinogen which also wreaks havoc on others through second hand smoke .
And just consider that in Atlantic City , after the effort to ban smoking in casinos was approved , the policy was later undone because there were concerns that such a ban would hurt casino revenues .
So let me get this straight , we will allow for cancer causing cigarettes in casinos because it makes some casino moguls a few bucks , but we wo n't allow for people suffering chronic diseases to get just a little relief through a highly regulated and controlled program to allow for the medicinal use of marijuana .
Talk about having your priorities out of whack .
The time is now .
Pass this law .
Help those suffering to reduce their pain .
Anyone who stands in the way of it should come up with a much better argument than those that have been raised so far .
If not , opposition to the medical distribution of marijuana is nothing more than mean spirited and hypocrisy .
What do you think ?

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama 's advantage over John McCain in the presidential race has again widened to 10 percentage points among registered voters , 52 % to 42 % , in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Oct. 16-18 .
This is the first Gallup Poll Daily tracking report based on data collected entirely after Wednesday night 's third and final presidential debate .
McCain 's current 42 % support level is at the midpoint of the 41 % to 43 % range he has received over the past 18 days .
Obama 's 52 % is at the upper end of the 48 % to 52 % range of support he has received over the same time period .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
With 1 % of registered voters saying they will vote for another specific candidate , only 6 % remain undecided , one of the smallest levels to date .
A Tighter Race Among Likely Voters
Gallup is also looking at the race according to two likely voter scenarios .
One , the traditional Gallup approach , takes into account voters ' intention to participate in the current election as well as their voting history in previous presidential elections .
Among this group , Obama leads McCain by three points , 49 % to 46 % .
This is similar to Obama 's standing among traditional likely voters over the past five days .
An alternate approach to defining likely voters uses only voters ' self - professed likelihood to vote in 2008 , and does not factor in whether they voted in past elections .
This model assumes that new registrants and infrequent voters will be more heavily represented in the pool of voters who turn out on Election Day than has been the case historically .
Among this more broadly defined likely voter group , Obama leads by seven points , 51 % to 44 % . -- Lydia Saad
( Click here to see how the race currently breaks down by demographic subgroup . )
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 16 - 18 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,798 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,590 " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,277 more broadly defined likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The retrial of five officials of the Holy Land Foundation , the largest Islamic charity in the U.S. shut down by the government weeks after 9/11 , concluded on November 24 with guilty verdicts on all 108 counts .
Federal prosecutors had charged that Holy Land officials had conspired to provide material support to terrorists and served as the fundraising arm of Hamas in the U.S. , which raised more than $ 12 million after Hamas had been designated a terrorist organization in 1995 .
The implications of these guilty verdicts are staggering in their importance .
The most immediate is that federal prosecutors have proved they can win these kinds of complicated terrorism financing cases .
Monday ’s guilty verdicts are in sharp contrast to the first trial in this case , which ended in October 2007 in a mistrial and victory celebrations by the defendants and their supporters .
In response , prosecutors streamlined their case , dropped a number of lesser charges , and prepared new exhibits to help jurors understand the scope of the conspiracy .
This does not bode well for those subject to other ongoing terrorism support inquiries , most especially officials associated with the International Institute for Islamic Thought ( IIIT ) .
IIIT was included in the widespread Operation Green Quest raids in March 2002 , and is the focus of an ongoing federal grand jury investigation .
Convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader and former University of South Florida professor Sami Al - Arian was indicted in June for refusing to provide testimony regarding the funding of his U.S. - based terrorist front operation by IIIT , the World and Islam Studies Enterprise ( WISE ) .
IIIT was the primary financial backer for WISE .
Officials for another closed Islamic terror charity , KindHearts , should also be concerned .
The Toledo , Ohio - based KindHearts had its assets frozen by the Treasury Department in February 2006 , specifically identifying the group ’s support for terrorism .
KindHearts was identified as the successor organization to the Holy Land Foundation and another closed terror charity , the al - Qaeda - affiliated Global Relief Foundation .
No charges have been filed against KindHearts officials as of yet , but the success of the Holy Land Foundation prosecutions very well might change that .
Another lasting impact of the Holy Land Foundation trial will be the exhibits made public which tie some of the most prominent Islamic institutions in America to the international terrorist support network .
In June 2007 , the New York Sun reported that a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the case included the Islamic Society of North America ( ISNA ) , the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , and the North American Islamic Trust ( NAIT ) .
ISNA claims to be the largest Islamic organization in the country , and CAIR claims to be the largest Muslim “ civil rights ” group .
NAIT is known for holding the deeds for more than 300 mosques in the U.S. and for its ties to the Saudi Wahhabi religious establishment .
What the Holy Land trial exhibits showed is that all of these organizations had been founded to serve as arms of the Muslim Brotherhood , the largest Islamic extremist group in the world .
The terrorist group Hamas is the self - declared Palestinian affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Court documents showed that CAIR was founded as the political and lobbying arm of the Muslim Brotherhood ’s Palestine Committee .
The lasting impact of these organizations ’ role in the terrorism finance conspiracy is that they are regularly courted by some of the highest - ranking officials of the U.S. government , including the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Justice , and FBI .
These agencies have come under intense criticism , sometimes from within their own agency , for partnering with these organizations while they were simultaneously named as unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation trial .
With the guilty verdicts , any continued cooperation with these organizations will prove to be difficult and increasingly controversial .
The biggest bombshell of the recent trial was a strategic memo made public that was authored by a leading U.S. - based Muslim Brotherhood leader , Mohamed Akram , entitled “ On the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America . ”
While the memo was dated May 1991 , it stated that the strategy itself had already been approved by the North American Muslim Brotherhood leadership in 1987 .
What this memo explains is that the general strategic goal of the Muslim Brotherhood network in the U.S. is to wage a “ grand jihad ” to destroy the West from within by means of a “ civilizational - jihadist process ” :
The Ikhwan [ the Muslim Brotherhood ’s name for itself ] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and “ sabotaging ” its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and Allah ’s religion is made victorious over all other religions . …
They are then to work to employ , direct , and unify Muslims ’ efforts and powers for this process .
In order to do that , we must possess a mastery of the art of “ coalitions , ” the art of “ absorption , ” and the principles of “ cooperation . ”
With the convictions in the Holy Land Foundation trial and the exhibits used to accomplish those convictions , it is reasonable to conclude that the Muslim Brotherhood , while not yet engaging in violence , is continuing to actively promote their own brand of Islamic supremacism and working to destroy our fundamental freedoms and liberties while exploiting the same .
Thus , the Muslim Brotherhood network , its organizations identified in an appendix to the Akram memo , ought to be considered a “ threat organization ” for national security purposes and authorities ought to be on guard .
This has already been the conclusion by several prominent analysts who had studied the many trial exhibits , including my colleagues LTC Joe Myers and former Pentagon J2 analyst Stephen Coughlin .
So the Holy Land Foundation trial may finally be concluded , but its potential impact beyond the prison terms that will be handed out for the convicted could continue for the foreseeable future .
Not only may more terrorism finance and terrorism support cases be forthcoming , but more critical inquiry into those individuals and organizations who aided the Holy Land Foundation conspiracy .
For many observers , both are long overdue .
Charles Darwin wasted no time applying his theory of evolution to human psychology , following On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) with The Descent of Man ( 1871 ) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .
Ever since , the issue has n’t been whether evolutionary theory can illuminate the study of psychology but how it will do so .
Still , a concerted effort to explain how evolution has affected human behavior began only in the 1970s with the emergence of sociobiology .
The core idea of sociobiology was simple : behavior has evolved under natural and sexual selection ( in response to competition for survival and reproduction , respectively ) , just as organic form has .
Sociobiology thereby extended the study of adaptation to include human behavior .

The Grinches that comprise the family / membership of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kansas have a knack for turning stomachs .
Whether they ’re brandishing signs at gay pride parades condemning gays and lesbians to hell or protesting the funerals of U.S. soldiers , they seem to be spreading rage and distaste wherever they appear .
Now , the WBC folks are on the warpath in Washington State against the big guy himself – Santa Claus .
Westboro Baptist Church has jumped into the fray over the atheist sign at Washington ’s Capitol building by requesting its own sign announcing that “ Santa Claus will take you to hell . ”
In a letter faxed today to Gov. Chris Gregoire and state legislative officials , the church asked that its sign be placed next to the nativity display and the sign posted by atheist group Freedom From Religion .
Westboro ’s sign rewrites the lyrics to popular holiday tune “ Santa Claus is Coming To Town ” to proclaim instead that belief in Santa Claus is responsible for the faltering economy and soldiers ’ deaths .
If you have n’t had a meal recently , you might
take a gander at some of the lyrics the creative brain trust at Westboro has cooked up , like :
Do n’t leave your kids with this red fright Just like the priests , he ’ll rape ’em at night Oh , Santa Claus will take you to hell
Mel White , a former ghostwriter for the likes of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ( until he came out and founded Soulforce years later ) , tells the story of riding in a limo with Falwell and coming up on some protestors .
Falwell laughed at them and remarked how they helped his cause .
“ If they were n’t here , ” White quotes him , “ we ’d have to hire some . ”
The Westboro crowd is so beyond the pale I can’t help but believe they are simply an over - the - top parody group of hate groups .
Even their Web site at godhatesfags.com looks like a deft parody of hate sites .
In fact , compare WBC ’s Santa attack to a similar piece over at Landover Baptist , an openly stated religious parody site .
If WBC ’s goal is to turn America against gays and lesbians , Iraq veterans and now Santa , they have been woefully incompetent .
However , they do tend to foster more tolerance , and even some acceptance .
Ask even the most virulently anti-gay Christian about Phelps and his clan and they ’ll soundly condemn them and their tactics .
Which is fine with WBC – they ’ve condemned many right wing leaders , like Falwell , for not being Christian enough .
We ’ve been reading WBC and its antics all wrong over the years .
They ’re not a hate group , merely a parody of a hate group .
So , the next time you see WBC out picketing , stop by , laugh at their display to show you appreciation then thank them for their work creating more tolerance in the world .
Yes , they will call you names and shout at you but do n’t take it personally .
They just do n’t want to blow their cover .
President - elect Obama — allegedly a ' man of the people '— is allegedly buying a fancy $ 30,000 ring for his fancy wife , allegedly !
It was in the trusty Daily Mail , and now it 's the top story on Drudge , meaning it is the single most important news story in all the world .
Elitist Obama drops 30 K on bling for his wife during a recession — and this bling will be made out of rhodium , the world 's most expensive metal !
This story is almost certainly bullshit , and we will tell you exactly why .
[ Updates below — we were right ] :
1 . The setup — Say , for argument 's sake , that Obama did order an expensive , custom - made ring to thank his wife for her help in the campaign .
Would the chosen designer of that ring run out and immediately tell the press all about it ?
Not just the press , but the Daily Mail , a sleazeball London tabloid ?
No , because that designer would subsequently be destroyed by Barack Obama , the president of the US .
2 . The story itself — What 's the sourcing for this big story ?
Did Obama sheepishly acknowledge his gift with a smile once it broke ?
No .
The sole source is a " spokesman " for the " designer " of the ring .
Who also gave this ridonkulous quote :
' For obvious privacy reasons I cannot reveal the cost of the ring but bearing in mind it is made from rhodium or black gold and encrusted with diamonds you can be sure it will cost thousands of pounds . '
Mmm hmm .
Classy .
It 's also painfully clear that the story is filled out by fun facts about rhodium pulled off some press release .
Did you know that " rhodium was chosen as the material for the disc presented to Beatle Paul McCartney for being history 's all - time best - selling songwriter and recording artist " ?
Barack Obama obviously did , which is why he insisted on ordering this here ring !
3 . The designer — Supposedly Obama has ordered this ring to be specially made by Giovanni Bosco , an " A - list " Italian designer .
Really ?
If he 's so A - list , why has his name never — never !— appeared in Nexis , the database of all things media ?
If he 's so A - list , why does his website look so D - list ?
And why does the " Press " section seem to be full mostly of his own ads ?
Decidedly non-Presidential .
So the worldwide media has bitten big - time on a story that was almost certainly planted by this jewelry designer himself , or a very enterprising flack .
And everybody wins ( " everybody " meaning " Right wing media outlets " and " Giovanni Bosco " ) !
Good show , Giovanni Bosco .
Thanks to all this press you will probably be able to sell some rings that are real .

「設定」画面でカレンダーを選んだときに出てくる画面の「カレンダーの情報」タブのところの一番下に、「非公開URL:」という項目がある。そこには、「これはこのカレンダーの非公開
URL です。このカレンダーのすべての予定を他のユーザーに見せたい場合を除き、このアドレスを他のユーザーと共有しないでください。」という説明書きがあるが、何のことやらよくわからない。ここで、「XML 」「 ICAL 」 「 HTML 」 と書かれた部分 の「 HTML 」のところをクリックすると次の画面が出る。
ここで、表示されているURLのリンクをクリックしてはいけない。
マップとカレンダーでちぐはぐな設計
これがいったい何なのかは、「ヘルプ」に書かれている。（「非公開URL」なのか「個人用URL」なのか名称すらちぐはぐだが、同じものを指していると思われる。）
" 個人用 URL " について教えてください。 カレンダー のXMLかiCalフォーマット の " 個人用 URL " では、 Googleカレンダーにログインすることなく、他のアプリケーションを使って読み取り専用のカレンダーが表示できます。このURL を使用すると、フィードリーダー（例 : Google Reader）やiCalフォーマットに対応した他の製品（例 : iCal for Mac）から、カレンダーを簡単に表示できます。カレンダーのHTMLフォーマットの" 個人用 URL " では、Googleカレンダーにログインすることなく、読み取り専用のカレンダーを表示できます。
（略） 注 : 個人用URLはご自身のみがご利用になるアドレスですので、他のユーザーと共有しないでください。お使いのカレンダーを他のユーザーに公開する場合は、カレンダーの公開URL（または [ カレンダ ー URL ]
）を共有してください。誤って個人用URLを共有した場合には、[非公開
URL をリセット ]リンクをクリックして個人用アドレスを再生成してください。
" 個人用 URL " について教えてください。 - カレンダー ヘルプ センター , Google
この説明文では明確には書かれていないが、これは、非公開設定のカレンダーであってもこのURLさえあれば誰でも閲覧できるという意味である。「ログインすることなく他のアプリケーションを使って」表示できるとはそういう意味だ。何のために必要となる機能かは、フィードリーダの例がわかりやすい。非公開のカレンダーの更新状況を（認証機能を持たない）フィードリーダで確認したい場合にはこれを使うしかないというわけだ。
このURLの取り扱いに注意が必要であることは、去年の8月に話題になっていた。
「非公開URL」によるアクセス・コントロールについて考える , 技術者視点のユーザビリティ考 , 水野貴明 , 日経ソフトウェア , 2007年8月22 日 今回この話題を取り上げたのは，「Googleカレンダー」に用意されている「非公開URL」という機能を見たからです。Googleカレンダーでは，標準ではカレンダーは「非公開」，つまり自分以外は内容を見られないように設定されます。しかし，この「非公開URL」にアクセスすると，特に認証が無くても，つまり誰でも，カレンダーの内容を閲覧できるようになっています。
なぜこんなものが用意されているのでしょうか。
理由の一つは，他のスケジュール管理ソフトや携帯電話やPDAなど（略） もう一つの理由は，知り合いにだけデータを見せたい，といった場合に便利だからでしょう。非公開URLさえ知らせれば，パスワードなどを知らせなくても見てもらうことが可能だからです。
Google Calendarの非公開URLは文字通り他人と共有するものじゃないどすえ〜 , My Little Hip By MyPROFILE , 2007 年8月24 日 Google Calendarの非公開URLは設定画面のヘルプの飛び先にも書いてある通り本当に自身が利用するためのURLで、他人との共有目的で使う前提で議論するのがそもそもおかしい。
ツッコミが入っている通り、Googleカレンダーの「非公開URL」（別名「個人用URL」）は、少人数であっても他人に知らせて使うものとして想定されていない。これは、Googleマイマップの「限定公開」（旧称「非公開」）設定のマイマップにおけるURLとは、設計趣旨が異なっている。
GoogleマイマップとGoogleカレンダーとでこのように設計が異なっていることが人々を混乱させるのか、実際には、Googleカレンダーのこの「非公開URL」（別名「個人用URL」）を他人に知らせて使っている人もいるようだ。Web検索で「pvttk」などで検索すると、そのような事例がたくさんヒットする。
そのような誤った使い方は、Googleマイマップで「限定公開」（旧称「非公開」）設定で秘密情報を登録するのと同じ理由で誤った行為である。
では、他人に知らせることなくこの「非公開URL」（別名「個人用URL」）機能を使うのは間違っていないのかというと、先に書いたように、図2のURLをクリックしてはいけない。
クリックしてはいけないのは、このURLがどこかに漏れて公開されたら終わりだからだ。漏れる原因としてよく言われるのは、ブラウザのReferer機能であるが、他にもいろいろがあり得る。URLは基本的に公開情報として捉えるべきで、Webの仕組みはそれを前提に設計されている。Webアプリケーション側はURLに秘密情報を含める設計を避けるべきである。
Pathtraqと共存しえない
特に、サイボウズラボ の 「 Pathtraq（パストラック）」サービスを利用している場合は、ほぼ確実にURLが漏洩し、公開状態に持って行かれてしまうので、図2の画面でURLを絶対にクリックしないようにしなければならない。
「 Pathtraq 」とは 、 「 あなたのブラウザのサイドバーからいつでも今人気のページを追跡OK !
[ 今すぐ参加する ]
」と説明されたツールバーを導入すると、ブラウザがアクセスする各URLをそのままPathtraqサイトに送信するようになるもので、これを用いて、Pathtraqサイト側が送られてくる利用者のアクセス先URLを集計して、「注目」「人気 」
「定番」といったアクセスランキングを提供するサービスである。
当然、このようなツールバーを導入するとプライバシーが損なわれるわけで、万人が導入するものではないと思うが、サイボウズラボとしては、利用者の同意があればやってよいサービスだというスタンスなのだろう。
そして、こ のPathtraqツールバーを導入している人が、図2のリンクをクリックすると、そのURLがPathtraqサイトに掲載されてしまう。図3は、Pathtraqの「定番」検索で、GoogleカレンダーのURLを検索した際の様子である。
この検索結果を適当にクリックしてみたところ、URLに「
pvttk=」を含むものがあった。特に、WIDE幹部の予定表がこれによって公開状態となっていたのには驚いた。WIDE幹部関係者でさえ、この程度のITリテラシーだということを意味する。
ここに 「 2 hits」とあるのは、2回しかクリックしていない（Pathtraqのツールバーを導入している人が図2のリンクを2回クリックした）という意味である。2回クリックしただけで、公開され、内容まで閲覧可能になってしまう。
こうなると 、Pathtraqのページ がWebクローラに捕捉されてどこかの検索エンジンに登録されることも起こり得るわけで、通常のWeb検索でも見つかるようになってしまう。
これはまずいと思ったので、すぐにサイボウズラボに通報して、「pvttk=」を含むURLは検索に出ないようにして頂いた。11月17日以降は出なくなっている。この通報は、Pathtraqヘルプの次の記述に基づくものである。
URL とセキュリティについて パストラックが取り扱 うURLはhttp://で始まるもののみです。以下のようなサイトは、パストラックのログサーバに送信・保存され、パストラックサイトにて公開されることはありません。 HTTPS ( SSL ) プロトコルによって暗号化されたページ

ブラックリストで除去しているというのだが、不完全なものとならざるを得ないことは容易に想像されるところである。この「ブラックリスト」とはいったいどういう仕組みなのか。ヘルプには「ブラックリストの詳細につきましては、こちらをご覧ください」とあるが、そのリンク先を見てもそれらしきことはどこにも書かれていない。
このような事態の大元の原因は、URL中に秘密情報を含めてしまうWebアプリケーションにあるわけだが、それをほぼ確実に公開状態に持って行くPathtraqツールバーがその危険を加速させていて、かつ、Pathtraqのブラックリストは不完全で、どういうものなのかも説明されていない。RefererはWebの標準機能だからしかたがないと言えるが、後から導入させるツールバーでこの状況というのはどうなのか。
Googleマイマップの 「限定公開」は全く限定されていない
こうした事態は 、Googleマイマップの「限定公開」（旧称「非公開」）設定でも同様に起きる。Pathtraq で 「 http://maps.google.co.jp/」で検索すると、ごく普通に「限定公開」設定のマイマップもぞろぞろと出てくる。
これは、Googleマイマップの仕様であるから、Pathtraq側がブラックリストで排除するべきものとは言えない。また、URLで見分けがつかないため排除することもできない。
自分 がPathtraqツールバーを導入していなくても、「限定公開」先として特定少数の誰かにURLを伝えたときに、その誰かの一人がPathtraqツールバーを利用していたら、このように公開されてしまう。
Googleマイマップを非公開用途に使えるかのように宣伝していたのはグーグル社員だった
このことからもわかるように、Googleマイマップは全く秘密に使うことのできないサービスである。にもかかわらず、マイマップが発表された当初、まるで非公開目的に使えるかのように宣伝されていた。

Googleカレンダーを使い続けるなら
もし図2のリンクをクリックした覚えがあるなら、図1の「非公開URLをリセット」というリンクをクリックして、そのURLを新しいものに置き換える操作をした方がよい。これにより、古いURL（の「
pvttk=」）は無効になり、流出してURLが公開状態にあるとしても、古いURLではアクセスできなくなる。
それにしても、たったこれだけの操作でカレンダーが公開状態になるのは、怖くて非公開用途で使う気がしない。たとえば、Googleにログインしたままの状態で席を離れた隙に、何者かにここをクリックされ（あるいはどこかに貼付けられ）たら、数日後にはWeb検索で見つかる状態になってしまう。
そもそもこの機能を存在しない状態にしたいわけだが、これは、Google Apps版のGoogleカレンダーでなら可能なようだ。
管理者ユーザで 「 サービスの設定」から「カレンダー設定」の画面に行くと、図7のように「共有オプション」として、「ドメイン外部」（ドメイン関係者以外の）利用者からのアクセスに対するアクセス権限の最大値（一般ユーザが設定できるカレンダーの公開レベルの範囲）を設定できるようになっており、デフォルト設定では「空き状況のみ」となっている。
この設定の場合、ユーザが各カレンダーの設定画面に行っても、図8のように、「非公開URL」（別名「個人用URL」）を使うことができないようにされている。
Google は 「 非公 開URL 」（別名「 個人用URL」）にセキュリティ上の問題が存在することの認識はあるようだ。

As previously reported on MusicRadar , Joe Satriani is suing Coldplay , claiming the UK band 's Grammy - nominated song Viva La Vida uses one of his melodies .
In court papers filed on 4 December 2008 , Satriani 's legal team alleges Viva La Vida , the title track of Coldplay 's current album , copies " substantial original portions " of his song If I Could Fly .
Satriani's song was included on his 2004 album Is There Love In Space ?
Speaking exclusively to MusicRadar on 6 December , Joe Satriani recalls the exact emotion he felt when he first heard Coldplay 's Viva La Vida .
" The second I heard , I knew ... "
" I felt like a dagger went right through my heart .
It hurt so much , " Satriani says .
" The second I heard it , I knew it was [ my own ]
If I Could Fly . "
As it turned out , Satriani was n't the only one who noticed the similarity between If I Could Fly and Viva La Vida .
" Almost immediately , from the minute their song came out , my e-mail box flooded with people going , ' Have you heard this song by Coldplay ?
They ripped you off man . '
I mean , I could n't tell you how many e-mails I received .
" Everybody noticed the similarities between the songs .
It 's pretty obvious . "
Joe Satriani
" Everybody noticed the similarities between the songs .
It 's pretty obvious .
It 's as simple as that - when you listen to a song and you say , ' Wow , that 's a real rip - off . ' "
What makes the situation especially painful for Satriani is that If I Could Fly is n't just any song .
It 's a composition he'd been laboring over for well over 10 years before he recorded it .
" I started writing it on the Flying In A Blue Dream tour back in 1990 .
But because of the way I write , sometimes songs take a while , as this one did .
In 2003 I started demoing it in earnest .
I played it on the acoustic guitar on a demo so I could sing the melody , then I demoed it on electric to get the sound .
And the performance turned out to be so spontaneous , so right and so emotional , that it wound up being a keeper . "
Joe Satriani is suing Coldplay , alleging Viva La Vida uses his melody from If I Could Fly
Satriani feels " really hurt "
Since
If I Could Fly came out in 2004 , Satriani has been gratified by the reaction it 's received from his fans , many of whom have called it one of his most captivating songs .
" That was the intent all along , " he says .
" It was a love letter to my wife , Rubina - a simple , direct expression of feeling .
" That 's what really hurts about this whole thing .
That I spent so long writing the song , thinking about it , loving it , nursing it , and then finally recording it and standing on stages the world over playing it - and then somebody comes along and plays the exact same song and calls it their own . "
" Coldplay did n't want to talk about it .
They just wanted this whole thing to go away . "
Joe Satriani
Since it was announced on 4 December 2008 that Satriani is suing Coldplay for alleged plagiarism , seeking a jury trial and " any and all profits " connected to Viva La Vida , his life has been turned upside down .
" This has been the weirdest thing I 've ever been involved in , " he says .
" The media attention has been bizarre and surreal .
I really can't explain how I 've felt over the past day or two . "
" I did everything I could to avoid a court case "
Satriani stresses that his motives are ruled by artistic purity and an overriding sense of right and wrong .
" Everybody 's assumes I 'm trying to go after these guys in Coldplay , as if I 'm doing this with malice , " he says " That 's the furthest thing from my mind .
I 'm just doing what I need to do as an artist , to protect what 's mine , to protect those feelings I put down in song .
" I did everything I could to avoid a court case with this situation .
But Coldplay did n't want to talk about it .
They just wanted this whole thing to go away .
Maybe they figured this little guitar player guy will leave them alone after a while , I do n't know .
" But we 're talking about a piece of art that I created , and that 's something I feel is important .
I think everybody should feel that way . "
And now , Satriani 's team will ask a jury to decide .

The best electric guitars under £ 300 and The top 10 stompboxes we can't live without
Enlarge By Jacquelyn Martin , AP For $ 35 , a type of carp called garra rufa , or doctor fish , will help exfoliate your feet at Yvonne Hair and Nails salon in Alexandria , Va. ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( AP )  Ready for the latest in spa pampering ?
Prepare to dunk your tootsies in a tank of water and let tiny carp nibble away .
Fish pedicures are creating something of a splash in the D.C. area , where a northern Virginia spa has been offering them for the past four months .
John
Ho , who runs the Yvonne Hair and Nails salon with his wife , Yvonne Le , said 5,000 people have taken the plunge so far .
" This is a good treatment for everyone who likes to have nice feet , " Ho said .
He said he wanted to come up with something unique while finding a replacement for pedicures that use razors to scrape off dead skin .
The razors have fallen out of favor with state regulators because of concerns about whether they 're sanitary .
Ho was skeptical at first about the fish , which are called garra rufa but typically known as doctor fish .
They were first used in Turkey and have become popular in some Asian countries .
But
Ho doubted they would thrive in the warm water needed for a comfortable footbath .
And he did n't know if customers would like the idea .
" I know people were a little intimidated at first , " Ho said .
" But I just said , ' Let 's give it a shot . ' " Customers were quickly hooked .
Tracy Roberts , 33 , of Rockville , Md. , heard about it on a local radio show .
She said it was " the best pedicure I ever had " and has spread the word to friends and co-workers .
" I 'd been an athlete all my life , so I 've always had calluses on my feet .
This was the first time somebody got rid of my calluses completely , " she said .
First time customer KaNin Reese , 32 , of Washington , described the tingling sensation created by the toothless fish : " It kind of feels like your foot 's asleep , " she said .
The fish do n't do the job alone .
After 15 to 30 minutes in the tank , customers get a standard pedicure , made easier by the soft skin the doctor fish leave behind .
Ho believes his is the only salon in the country to offer the treatment , which costs $ 35 for 15 minutes and $ 50 for 30 minutes .
The spa has more than 1,000 fish , with about 100 in each individual pedicure tank at any given time .
Dennis Arnold , a podiatrist who four years ago established the International Pedicure Association , said he had never heard of the treatment and doubts it will become widespread .
" I think most people would be afraid of it , " he said .
Customer Patsy Fisher , 42 , of Crofton , Md. , admitted she was nervous as she prepared for her first fish pedicure .
But her apprehension dissolved into laughter after she put her feet in the tank and the fish swarmed to her toes .
" It 's a little ticklish , actually , " she said .
Ho said the hot water in which the fish thrive does n't support much plant or aquatic life , so they learned to feed on whatever food sources were available — including dead , flaking skin .
They leave live skin alone because , without teeth , they can't bite it off .
In addition to offering pedicures , Ho hopes to establish a network of Doctor Fish Massage franchises and is evaluating a full - body fish treatment that , among other things , could treat psoriasis and other skin ailments .
Ho spent a year and about $ 40,000 getting the pedicures up and running , with a few hiccups along the way .
State regulations make no provision for regulating fish pedicures .
But the county health department — which does regulate pools — required the salon to switch from a shallow , tiled communal pool that served as many as eight people to individual tanks in which the water is changed for each customer .
The communal pool also presented its own problem :
At times the fish would flock to the feet of an individual with a surplus of dead skin , leaving others with a dearth of fish .
" It would sometimes be embarrassing for them but it was also really hilarious , " Ho said .

Useless Limbs ?
One of the last photographs taken of Charles Darwin , circa 1878 .
' Darwin , ' the most in - depth exhibition ever mounted on this highly original thinker , starts November 19 , 2005 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
( Image credit : © From the Richard Milner Archive )
In Charles Darwin's
On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) and in his later works , he referred to several " vestiges " in human anatomy that were left over from the course of evolution .
These vestigial organs , Darwin argued , are evidence of evolution and represent a function that was once necessary for survival , but over time that function became either diminished or nonexistent .
The presence of an organ in one organism that resembles one found in another has led biologists to conclude that these two might have shared a common ancestor .
Vestigial organs have demonstrated remarkably how species are related to one another , and has given solid ground for the idea of common descent to stand on .
From common descent , it is predicted that organisms should retain these vestigial organs as structural remnants of lost functions .
It is only because of macro-evolutionary theory , or evolution that takes place over very long periods of time , that these vestiges appear .
The term ? vestigial organ ?
is often poorly defined , most commonly because someone has chosen a poor source to define the term .
The Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) defines vestigial organs as organs or structures remaining or surviving in a degenerate , atrophied , or imperfect condition or form .
This is the accepted biological definition used in the theory of evolution .
In the never - ending search for scientific truth , hypotheses are proposed , evidence is found , and theories are formulated to describe and explain what is being observed in the world around us .
The following are ten observations of vestigial organs whose presence have helped to flesh out the structure of the family tree that includes every living creature on our planet .
The Human Appendix
Leonardo da Vinci 's sketch of the intestines that included the appendix .
In plant - eating vertebrates , the appendix is much larger and its main function is to help digest a largely herbivorous diet .
The human appendix is a small pouch attached to the large intestine where it joins the small intestine and does not directly assist digestion .
Biologists believe it is a vestigial organ left behind from a plant - eating ancestor .
Interestingly , it has been noted by paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer in his text The Vertebrate Body ( 1949 ) that the major importance of the appendix " would appear to be financial support of the surgical profession " , referring to , of course , the large number of appendectomies performed annually .
In 2000 , in fact , there were nearly 300,000 appendectomies performed in the United States , and 371 deaths from appendicitis .
Any secondary function that the appendix might perform certainly is not missed in those who had it removed before it might have ruptured .
Male Breast Tissue and Nipples
Oh yeah , really handy those ...
The subject of male nipples is a sensitive , and maybe confusing , topic to many .
Those who wish to invalidate evolutionary theory might pose the question , " Was man descended from woman ? "
The answer , of course , is no .
Both men and women have nipples because in early stages of fetal development , an unborn child is effectively sexless .
Nipples are present in both males and females ; it is only in a later stage of fetal development that testosterone causes sex differentiation in a fetus .
All mammals , male and female , have mammary glands .
Male nipples are vestigial ; they may perform a small role in sexual stimulation and a small number of men have been able to lactate .
However , they are not fully functional and , because cancer can grow in male or female breast tissue , the tissue can be dangerous .
Fake Sex in Virgin Whiptail Lizards ( Vestigial Behavior )
Feminist lizards take the male out of the picture .
Only females exist in several species of the lizards of the genus Cnemidophorus , which might seem like a problem when it comes time to propagate the species .
The females do n't need the males though , they reproduce by parthenogenesis , a form of reproduction in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual .
So basically , the females do n't need the males ; they just produce clones of themselves as a form of reproduction .
Despite the fact that it is unnecessary and futile to attempt copulation with each other , the lizards still like to try , and occasionally one of the females will start to " act like a male " by attempting to copulate with another female .
The lizards evolved from a sexual species and the behavior to copulate like a male -- to engage in fake sex -- is a vestigial behavior ; that is , a behavior present in a species , but is expressed in an imperfect form , which in this case , is useless .
The Sexual Organs of Dandelions
Send in the clones ...
Dandelions , like all flowers , have the proper organs ( stamen and pistil ) necessary for sexual reproduction , but do not use them .
Dandelions reproduce without fertilization ; they basically clone themselves , and they are quite successful at it .
Look at any lawn for the proof .
If dandelions were to revert to sexual reproduction , they might not retain whatever traits they have that allow them to be pests to gardeners everywhere .
If flowers can begin reproducing in this manner , does that mean animals , even humans could too ?
Asexual reproduction can be a good strategy in an environment that is constant if a species is well suited to those conditions .
It does n't take a scientist to figure out that humans would n't last long if the condition set forth was no sexual contact with others .
Therefore , the human sexual organs are probably in no danger of becoming vestigial .
Wisdom Teeth in Humans
They need regular brushing .
With all of the pain , time , and money that are put into dealing with wisdom teeth , humans have become just a little more than tired of these remnants from their large jawed ancestors .
But regardless of how much they are despised , the wisdom teeth remain , and force their way into mouths regardless of the pain inflicted .
There are two possible reasons why the wisdom teeth have become vestigial .
The first is that the human jaw has become smaller than its ancestors - and the wisdom teeth are trying to grow into a jaw that is much too small .
The second reason may have to do with dental hygiene .
A few thousand years ago , it might be common for an 18 year old man to have lost several , probably most , of his teeth , and the incoming wisdom teeth would prove useful .
Now that humans brush their teeth twice a day , it 's possible to keep one 's teeth for a lifetime .
The drawback is that the wisdom teeth still want to come in , and when they do , they usually need to be extracted to prevent any serious pain .
The Blind Fish Astyanax Mexicanus
Astyanax Mexicanus : growing up in the wrong neighborhood .
In an experiment designed by nature , the species of fish known as Astyanax mexicanus , dwelling in caves deep underground off the coast of Mexico , can not see .
The pale fish has eyes , but as it is developing in the egg , the eyes begin to degenerate , and the fish is born with a collapsed remnant of an eye covered by flap of skin .
These vestigial eyes probably formed after hundreds or even thousands of years of living in total darkness .
As for the experiment , a control is needed ; and luckily for us , fish of the same species live right above , near the surface , where there is plenty of light , and these fish have fully functioning eyes .
To test if the eyes of the blind mexicanus could function if given the right environment , scientists removed the lens from the eye of the surface - dwelling fish and implanted it into the eye of the blind fish .
It was observed that within eight days an eye started to develop beneath the skin , and after two months the fish had developed a large functioning eye with a pupil , cornea , and iris .
The fish were blind , but now they see .
The Human Tailbone ( Coccyx )
The human tailbone does n't do much , but really hurts if you land on it .
These fused vertebrae are the only vestiges that are left of the tail that other mammals still use for balance , communication , and in some primates , as a prehensile limb .
As our ancestors were learning to walk upright , their tail became useless , and it slowly disappeared .
It has been suggested that the coccyx helps to anchor minor muscles and may support pelvic organs .
However , there have been many well documented medical cases where the tailbone has been surgically removed with little or no adverse effects .
There have been documented cases of infants born with tails , an extended version of the tailbone that is composed of extra vertebrae .
There are no adverse health effects of such a tail , unless perhaps the child was born in the Dark Ages .
In that case , the child and the mother , now considered witches , would 've been killed instantly .
Erector Pili and Body Hair
When a rabbit is scared , its hair stands on end .
When a human is scared , he or she calls the police .
The erector pili are smooth muscle fibers that give humans " goose bumps " .
If the erector pili are activated , the hairs that come out of the nearby follicles stand up and give an animal a larger appearance that might scare off potential enemies and a coat that is thicker and warmer .
Humans , though , do n't have thick furs like their ancestors did , and our strategy for several thousand years has been to take the fur off other warm looking animals to stay warm .
It 's ironic actually that an animal , sensing danger is near , would puff up its coat to look scarier , but the human hunter would see the puffier coat as a warm prize , leaving the thinner haired weaker looking animals alone .
Of course , some body hair is helpful to humans ; eye brows can keep sweat out of the eyes and facial hair might influence a woman 's choice of sexual partner .
All the rest of that hair , though , is essentially useless .
Hind Leg Bones in Whales
Whale skeleton showing pelvis and thigh bones ( see inset ) .
Biologists believe that for 100 million years the only vertebrates on Earth were water - dwelling creatures , with no arms or legs .
At some point these " fish " began to develop hips and legs and eventually were able to walk out of the water , giving the earth its first land lovers .
Once the land - dwelling creatures evolved , there were some mammals that moved back into the water .
Biologists estimate that this happened about 50 million years ago , and that this mammal was the ancestor of the modern whale .
Despite the apparent uselessness , evolution left traces of hind legs behind , and these vestigial limbs can still be seen in the modern whale .
There are many cases where whales have been found with rudimentary hind limbs in the wild , and have been found in baleen whales , humpback whales , and in many specimens of sperm whales .
Most of these examples are of whales that had only leg bones , but there were some that included feet with complete digits .
It was reported recently that whales and hippos were distantly related .
The Wings on Flightless Birds
The Cassowary , the sexier , but less - well - known flightless bird .
In 1798 , sixty years before Charles Darwin 's first book was published , a French anatomist , É´ienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire , traveled to Egypt with Napoleon where he witnessed and wrote about a flightless bird whose wings appeared useless for soaring .
The bird that Hilaire described was an ostrich , but he described it as a " cassowary " , a term used back then to describe various birds of ostrich - like appearance .
Ostriches and cassowaries are among several birds that have wings that are vestigial .
Besides the cassowary , other flightless birds with vestigial wings are the kiwi , and the kakapo ( the only known flightless and nocturnal parrot ) , among others .
In general , wings of a bird are considered complex structures that are specifically adapted for flight and those belonging to these flightless birds are no different .
They are , anatomically , rudimentary wings , but they could never give these bulky birds flight .
The wings are not completely useless , as they are used for balance during running and in flagging down the honeys during courtship displays .
The Bush administration with a last minute ruling is set to stop Wisconsin 's new law that mandates hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims .
The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has set a " provider conscience rule " in motion which allows doctors , nurses and health care providers to refuse to aid in procedures because of their religious and moral beliefs .
Rea Holmes , executive assistant of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services said , " It would in essence nullify our compassionate care law . "
Under current federal and state law provisions doctors and nurses can opt out of conducting abortions while the new rule now encompasses all health care workers who can now refuse to provide information , including a referral , to patients seeking an abortion .
Many experts say the new rule could mean that the hospital and clinic workers could refuse to provide birth control and other health services .
New York Gov. David Paterson said that this could go beyond reproduction and include vaccinations and HIV / AIDS treatments .
" The new HHS rule is President Bush 's parting shot at women 's access to basic health care , " Caroline Fredrickson , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU Washington Legislative Office , said in a news release .
" This administration has continually put politics and ideology before science and patients ' health . "
U. S. Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin said she was " deeply troubled by the Bush administration 's latest attack on patients ' rights and the doctor - patient relationship . "
Medical care , she added , " must be based on science and the patients ' best interest , not the providers ' religious , political or other philosophical views . "
While imposing the new rule the administration cited a 2007 Connecticut law that requires hospitals to offer emergency contraception to rape victims and hospitals that object to it can use independent providers for the procedure .
Nicole Safar , legal and policy analyst at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said , " Any state that has patient protections against health care denials based on ideology wo n't be able to enforce those laws . "
Rumors of such a ruling leaked out in the summer which had Gov. Jim Doyle in a letter in late September to Michael Leavitt , secretary of the department ; express his " strong opposition " to the proposal .
He said the proposed regulation " effectively nullifies " Wisconsin 's compassionate care law .
He said , " Allowing HHS to impose a federal conscience clause effectively creates a culture of health care refusal , whereby patients can be denied access to any number of services , including HIV / AIDS and fertility care . "
Opponents to the rule are hoping President - elect Barack Obama and Congress , once in office would either block the rule or ask for it to be amended .
" There is indication on the federal level this is one of the first things they are going to be taking up , " said Holmes .
As the published rule leaves abortion undefined it makes it difficult to enforce the compassionate care act while it is in effect .
" By taking out the definition of abortion you have the whole debate of when life begins and so emergency contraception could be swept into there , " Holmes said .
" You could have somebody ready to go into a clinic , ask for E. C. and that provider would have the right to deny the victim . "
For more than two decades , Abdulkarim Soroush has been Iran ’s leading public intellectual .
Deeply versed in Islamic theology and mysticism , he was chosen by Ayatollah Khomeini to “ Islamicize ” Iran ’s universities , only to eventually turn against the theocratic state .
He paid a price for his dissidence .
Vigilantes and other government - supported elements disrupted his widely attended lectures in Iran , beat him and reportedly nearly assassinated him .
In a country where intellectuals are often treated like rock stars , Soroush has been venerated and reviled for his outspoken support of religious pluralism and democracy .
Now he has taken one crucial step further .
Shuttling from university to university in Europe and the U.S. , Soroush is sending shock waves through Iran ’s clerical establishment .
The recent controversy began about eight months ago , after Soroush spoke with a Dutch reporter about one of Islam ’s most sensitive issues : the divine origin of the Koran .
Muslims have long believed that their holy book was transmitted word for word by God through the Prophet Muhammad .
In the interview , however , Soroush made explicit his alternative belief that the Koran was a “ prophetic experience . ”
He told me that the prophet “ was at the same time the receiver and the producer of the Koran or , if you will , the subject and the object of the revelation . ”
Soroush said that “ when you read the Koran , you have to feel that a human being is speaking to you , i.e. the words , images , rules and regulations and the like all are coming from a human mind . ”
He added , “ This mind , of course , is special in the sense that it is imbued with divinity and inspired by God . ”
As Soroush ’s words spread thanks to the Internet , Iran ’s grand ayatollahs entered the battlefield .
In their rebuttal , the clerics pointed to the Koranic verses that state “ this is a book we have sent down to you ( O Muhammad ) . ”
They ask ,
Do n’t these verses imply that God is the revealer and Muhammad the receiver ?
They also point out that there were times when Muhammad waited impatiently for the revelation to come to him and that in more than 300 cases the prophet is commanded to tell his people to do one thing or another .
This demonstrates , the argument goes , that the commands are coming from elsewhere rather than from the heart or the mind of the prophet himself .

Soroush , in turn , responds by saying that the prophet was no parrot .
Rather , Soroush told me , he was like a bee who produces honey itself , even though the mechanism for making the honey is placed in him by God .
This is “ the example the Koran itself sets , ” says Soroush , citing the Koran : “ And your Lord inspired to the bee : take for yourself among the mountains , houses . . . then eat from all the fruits . . . there emerges from their bellies a drink . . . in which there is healing for people . ”

Kurt Schrimm , head of the special German prosecutors ' office that has hunted Nazis since 1958 , said he believes transport lists of prisoners that arrived at Sobibor during John Demjanjuk 's seven - month tenure at the camp can be used as evidence of his alleged involvement in their deaths .
A New Zealand woman drove a man who raped her in the back of his car to a police station after he fell asleep , news reports say .
A jury found Vipul Romik Sharma , 22 , guilty of abduction and two counts of rape yesterday after a four - day trial in the Auckland District Court .
The court was told Sharma raped the woman , whom he met in a city bar in February 2006 , after driving her to a park .
Nearly 20 years ago the US armed forces in Panama used the music of Guns N' Roses and Elvis Presley , played at maximum volume over loudspeakers , to try and drive the country 's leader , Manuel Noriega , to surrender .
A tactic was born .
Since then , music played at unbearable volumes has been frequently deployed in Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere by the CIA , as part of a sophisticated portfolio of torture against detainees .
Now the music world is hitting back .
A collective of bands and artists , including some whose recordings have been used against their wishes , have come together to demand the US stops using their work as an instrument of war .
Bruce Springsteen has already voiced anger at how Born in the USA has been devalued in this fashion .
Now , on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , he has been joined by artists including Massive Attack , Elbow , Rage Against The Machine 's Tom Morello , UNKLE 's James Lavelle , Matthew Herbert , the Magic Numbers and Bill Bailey .
Their protest will include minutes of silence at concerts and festivals .
" What we 're talking about here is people in a darkened room , physically inhibited by handcuffs , bags over their heads and music blaring at them , " said musician David Gray .
" That is nothing but torture .
It does n't matter what the music is .
It could be Tchaikovsky 's finest or it could be Barney the Dinosaur .
It really does n't matter , it 's going to drive you completely nuts . "
Amongst the songs most used are : Metallica 's Enter Sandman , Eminem 's White America , AC / DC's Hells Bells and the Sesame Street theme song .
One of the reasons for using loud music in this way is that it leaves no marks on the body .
Binyam Mohamed , the British resident held in Guantánamo Bay , who was tortured by having his penis slit with a razor blade while detained in a secret jail in Morocco , said that the constant loud music made him feel that he was losing his sanity .
He told his lawyer and director of legal charity , Reprieve , Clive Stafford Smith , that while being hung up and deprived of sleep " there was loud music .
[ Eminem's ] Slim Shady and Dr Dre for 20 days ... plenty lost their minds .
I could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off . "
Some prisoners have said it can be even worse than more traditional methods of physical torture , including waterboarding .
The UN and the European court of human rights have already banned the use of loud music in interrogations .
Stafford Smith said the Bush administration had portrayed the practice as harmless .
" Binyam Mohamed put it best when I spoke with him in Guantánamo Bay : ' Imagine you are given a choice , ' he said .
' To lose your sight or lose your mind .
While having your eyes gouged out would be horrendous , there is little doubt which you would choose . ' "
Another former prisoner , Donald Vance , said he was subjected to near - constant hard rock music .
" There was a lot of Nine Inch Nails , " he said .
" I could n't tell you how many times I heard Queen 's We Will Rock You . "
Two years after his release , he said he now keeps his home " very quiet " .
The campaign , Zero dB , was launched yesterday by Reprieve , which represents more than 30 prisoners in Guantánamo Bay .
Many of the detainees there and others held in secret locations have reported being subjected to deafening music for hours , in an attempt to break them .
Zero dB is backed by the Musicians Union , which urged British musicians to voice their anger about the use of music as torture .
But not all musicians are opposed to the use of their music .
Drowning Pool 's Stevie Benton , whose song Bodies has been used , said : " I take it as an honour to think that our song could be used to quell another 9/11 attack . "
Prison playlist
US military interrogators have often blasted music at detainees in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay .
The styles of music used range from heavy metal to pop .
According to the British legal charity Reprieve , these are among the songs they have used most frequently : Enter Sandman Metallica , Bodies Drowning Pool , Shoot to Thrill and Hells Bells AC / DC , I Love You from the Barney & Friends children 's television show .
Born in the USA Bruce Springsteen
Babylon David Gray , White America Eminem .
Sesame Street , theme tune from the children 's television show .
Other bands and artists whose music has been frequently played at US detention sites include : Aerosmith , Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , Don McLean , Lil ' Kim , Limp Bizkit , Meat Loaf , Rage Against the Machine , Red Hot Chili Peppers and Tupac Shakur

Please join our campaign to raise money to defeat Prop 8 in California .
It ’s a religious right / Mormon initiative that would repeal the marriages of thousands of gay couples in that state .
The latest news reports show that , while we were winning , we ’re now losing .
Folks working on the battle tell us that it ’s all a matter of money .
The bad guys have $ 10 million more than us ( thanks to the Mormons ) .
If we can only raise enough on our side , we can win .
Please use the box to the left , just click on it , to donate to the campaign .
100 % of your donation goes to the campaign , you can give as much as you want , and it ’s 100 % secure .
You guys donated an amazing $ 20,000 in only one day .
Let ’s see if we can make it 50k .
And now for the rest of the story …
The untold story of the battle over Proposition 8 is how , yet again , the Mormon Church is butting its nose into a gay civil rights debate in a state that is n’t Utah .
I ’ve been following gay civil rights issues since the early 1990s , and you ’d be amazed at how many times the Mormon Church has dumped its money into a state not - its - own in order to bash gays and lesbians .
A very nasty church .
Markos has more on the Prop 8 battle and why it matters :
The US often hears echoes of worldwide hostility against the application of its foreign policy , but seldom are they reached by the voices of those who experience first hand how close we are to the USA .
In spite of contextual political differences and conflicting interests that generate friction , we do share the same fundamental values – and when push comes to shove that is what really counts .
Through the eyes of that French OMLT ( Operational Mentoring Liaison Teams ) infantryman you can see how strong the bond is on the ground .
In contrast with the Americans , the French soldiers do n’t seem to write much online – or maybe the proportion is the same but we just have less people deployed .
Whatever the reason , this is a rare and moving testimony which is why I decided to translate it into English , so that American people can catch a glimpse of the way European soldiers see them .
Not much high philosophy here , just the first hand impressions of a soldier in contact – but that only makes it more authentic .
Here is the original French article June 2011 update : the site of the original article is long dead – it disappeared not long after this translation was published and I was therefore unable to satisfy those who wanted proof of source .
I just found out that Archive.org has captured a snapshot of the site as it was in September 2008 – so there , you can now read the original !
Here is my translation :
“ We have shared our daily life with two US units for quite a while – they are the first and fourth companies of a prestigious infantry battalion whose name I will withhold for the sake of military secrecy .
To the common man it is a unit just like any other .
But we live with them and got to know them , and we henceforth know that we have the honor to live with one of the most renowned units of the US Army – one that the movies brought to the public as series showing “ ordinary soldiers thrust into extraordinary events ” .
Who are they , those soldiers from abroad , how is their daily life , and what support do they bring to the men of our OMLT every day ?
Few of them belong to the Easy Company , the one the TV series focuses on .
This one nowadays is named Echo Company , and it has become the support company .
They have a terribly strong American accent – from our point of view the language they speak is not even English .
How many times did I have to write down what I wanted to say rather than waste precious minutes trying various pronunciations of a seemingly common word ?
Whatever state they are from , no two accents are alike and they even admit that in some crisis situations they have difficulties understanding each other .
Heavily built , fed at the earliest age with Gatorade , proteins and creatine – they are all heads and shoulders taller than us and their muscles remind us of Rambo .
Our frames are amusingly skinny to them – we are wimps , even the strongest of us – and because of that they often mistake us for Afghans .
Here we discover America as it is often depicted : their values are taken to their paroxysm , often amplified by promiscuity lack of privacy and the loneliness of this outpost in the middle of that Afghan valley .
Honor , motherland – everything here reminds of that : the American flag floating in the wind above the outpost , just like the one on the post parcels .
Even if recruits often originate from the hearth of American cities and gang territory , no one here has any goal other than to hold high and proud the star spangled banner .
Each man knows he can count on the support of a whole people who provides them through the mail all that an American could miss in such a remote front - line location : books , chewing gums , razorblades , Gatorade , toothpaste etc. in such way that every man is aware of how much the American people backs him in his difficult mission .
And that is a first shock to our preconceptions : the American soldier is no individualist .
The team , the group , the combat team are the focus of all his attention .
And they are impressive warriors !
We have not come across bad ones , as strange at it may seem to you when you know how critical French people can be .
Even if some of them are a bit on the heavy side , all of them provide us everyday with lessons in infantry know - how .
Beyond the wearing of a combat kit that never seem to discomfort them ( helmet strap , helmet , combat goggles , rifles etc. ) the long hours of watch at the outpost never seem to annoy them in the slightest .
On the one square meter wooden tower above the perimeter wall they stand the five consecutive hours in full battle rattle and night vision goggles on top , their sight unmoving in the directions of likely danger .
No distractions , no pauses , they are like statues nights and days .
At night , all movements are performed in the dark – only a handful of subdued red lights indicate the occasional presence of a soldier on the move .
Same with the vehicles whose lights are covered – everything happens in pitch dark even filling the fuel tanks with the Japy pump .
And combat ?
If you have seen Rambo you have seen it all – always coming to the rescue when one of our teams gets in trouble , and always in the shortest delay .
That is one of their tricks : they switch from T - shirt and sandals to combat ready in three minutes .
Arriving in contact with the ennemy , the way they fight is simple and disconcerting : they just charge !
They disembark and assault in stride , they bomb first and ask questions later – which cuts any pussyfooting short .
We seldom hear any harsh word , and from 5 AM onwards the camp chores are performed in beautiful order and always with excellent spirit .
A passing American helicopter stops near a stranded vehicle just to check that everything is alright ; an American combat team will rush to support ours before even knowing how dangerous the mission is – from what we have been given to witness , the American soldier is a beautiful and worthy heir to those who liberated France and Europe .
To those who bestow us with the honor of sharing their combat outposts and who everyday give proof of their military excellence , to those who pay the daily tribute of America ’s army ’s deployment on Afghan soil , to those we owned this article , ourselves hoping that we will always remain worthy of them and to always continue hearing them say that we are all the same band of brothers ” .
At 9:46 p.m. , blogging on his site FiveThirty Eight.com , Nate Silver called the presidential election for Barack Obama .
The television networks followed suit about an hour and 15 minutes later after most polls in Western states closed .
Of course , Mr. Silver had a head start : he had forecast that Senator Obama would beat Senator John McCain back in March .
In an election season of unlikely outcomes , Mr. Silver , 30 , is perhaps the most unlikely media star to emerge .
A baseball statistician who began analyzing political polls only last year , he introduced his site , FiveThirty Eight.com , in March , where he used his own formula to predict federal and state results and run Election Day possibilities based on a host of factors .
Other sites combine polls , notably RealClearPolitics and Pollster , but FiveThirtyEight , which drew almost five million page views on Election Day , has become one of the breakout online stars of the year .
Mr. Silver recognized that people wanted to play politics like they played fantasy baseball , and pick apart poll numbers for themselves instead of waiting for an evening news anchor to interpret polls for them .
A lesson I 've learned from working on Chrome is how core tradeoffs are to engineering .
Working on it as a public project has made me especially aware of how non-obvious that is .
This thread serves as a nice example .
Few would dispute that showing a preview of a feed would be nice ; but to do so means you need a feed parser , itself an enormous task , and in the Chromium world parsing complicated document formats means you need to do the parsing a sandboxed subprocess .
It 's not unimaginable to implement ( one of the boring things about this sort of project is that you can see the end from the start , and the journey is just a bunch of typing ) , but in doing so you have n't implemented any number of other things .
Another way to phrase that is to say that to warrant implementing extra feature X , it would be reasonable to state feature Y that will not be implemented because of the time spent on X .
I think of this when I think of our sad lack of a Linux port , the project I joined the team for .
Working on such on thing would not only have meant I could n't have implemented e.g. the new tab page and the history snippeting system ; it would also mean that the rest of the team would have felt the drag that we are feeling now as any checkin can break the build on two other platforms , sometimes requiring you to patch your change over to those platforms to diagnose it on each .
So what would I have cut ?
You could argue the new tab page is on the frivolous end of things , and maybe we did n't need history search , though we got a lot of flak for our lack of features already as well as the weak bookmarking system which in fact was the result of this sort of cutting ( as was feed support , for what it 's worth -- I implemented some of it ) .
Or maybe something more fundamental : maybe we could 've gotten away without sandboxing since we 're such a small target .
But never in any discussion of pet feature X is a discussion like that : what should have been cut to make that feature happen ?
In that light I laugh at many comments like this one , on the release :
Where the FUCK is the autoscrolling feature that every other browser has ?
Yes , even I.E. has it .
In reality , a huge amount of invisible work was put into stability in particular : so maybe that person would 've been appeased with something that could autoscroll * and would crash just a little bit more often .
But that 's not how they think about it .
They are instead personally slighted ( internet - enraged ! wrote FUCK in CAPS ! ) about missing features .
More briefly , this is yet another instance of " you ca n't please everyone " .
I myself am also not pleased that I have n't yet been able to run Chromium on my computer , but working on this project has been a good lesson in the sorts of hard decisions that are made to get something this huge out the door .
So now when Boodman recently posted about whether extensions should work per-profile or per-install , I can realize the thread will be fruitless in that it was read as " should we implement feature A , B , or both ? "
And the answer to that : both , always .

Vampire Fact # 6 : They enjoy killing people .
Drinking blood out of a rhinestone - encrusted 40 oz .
bottle is all well and good for ritual purposes , but it 's a pale substitute for the real thing : fresh blood drained from a bunch of drunk party animals , preferably while they 're listening to Aerosmith and spraying beer around a beachside bonfire .
But why limit yourself to the jugular vein ?
It may be a quick and easy way to feed , but it's also a bit tired and predictable , no ?
Traditions were made to be broken , and as a vampire who may very well live forever , you should do everything in your power to switch it up and keep things fresh .
Why not try the Kiefer Sutherland approach ( as demonstrated at 0:52 ) and simply bite through your victims ' skulls ?
Remember : there 's blood in there !

Vampire Fact # 7 : They can really do a number on your plumbing .
While the vampire 's internal chemistry has n't been studied extensively , there are clearly a number of significant physiological differences between them and mere mortals to bear in mind .
For example , while the average person might describe being dunked into a bathtub full of garlic and holy water as " unpleasant " or " another day , another garlic - and - holy - water bath " ( again , this all depends on who you ask ) , they probably are n't going to react particularly strongly to it .
Vampires , on the other hand , will emit a bloodcurdling scream , their flesh will melt , blood will shoot out of all of your sinks and pipes , and your toilet will violently explode for no good reason whatsoever .
With that being said , you may want to avoid this method of vampire slaying altogether unless it can be executed in a kiddie pool in the backyard , or somewhere else that is n't hooked up to your house 's pipes .
After all , in these tough economic times , who wants to have to hire a plumber to scrape melted vampire out of their pipes ?

The ruse is named after Charles Ponzi , a 1920s crook who promised investors in New England a 40 pc return on their investment in just 90 days , compared with 5 pc in a savings account .
Ponzi had planned to make money by taking advantage of the difference in exchange rates between the dollar and other currencies to buy and sell international mail coupons at a profit .
His scheme was an amazing success , and by May 1920 , he had made $ 420,000 ( $ 5.13 million in 2017 money ) .
By June 1920 , people had invested $ 2.5 million in Ponzi 's scheme and by July , he was raking in a million dollars per week and rising .
By the end of July , he was approaching a million dollars per day .
When the house of cards inevitably collapsed , it turned out he had only ever purchased about $ 30 worth of the mail coupons on which the scheme was based .
HOUSTON ( AP ) — Hurricane
Ike appears to have destroyed a number of oil production platforms and damaged some of the pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico , federal officials said Sunday .
Fly - overs revealed that at least 10 production platforms were destroyed by the storm , said Lars Herbst , regional director for the U.S. Minerals Management Service .
“ It ’s too early to say if it ’s close to Katrina - and Rita - type damage , ” Mr. Herbst said .
There are about 3,800 production platforms in the Gulf , including 717 with full - time staff aboard .
The MMS says Hurricane Katrina destroyed 44 platforms three years ago , and soon after , Hurricane Rita destroyed 64 .
Mr. Herbst stressed the assessments were preliminary , but the damage appeared far worse than that caused by Hurricane Gustav two weeks ago .
Specifics about the size and production capacity of the destroyed platforms were not immediately available .
In additional to pummeling platforms , Katrina and Rita also damaged about 150 pipelines that gather and transport oil and natural gas from offshore wells .
Mr. Herbst said the aerial inspections showed Ike damaged several large pipelines , but the extent of the damage was not known .
Since just before Gustav ’s arrival two weeks ago , nearly 100 percent of Gulf Coast crude production had stopped , or about 1.3 million barrels per day .
About 98 percent of all natural gas production is on hold .
There was limited production between storms , but that ended as Ike approached .
Word that Ike did more damage than Gustav left open the question about how high gas prices would go , and how long they would remain there .
A gallon of regular gas soared past $ 5 per gallon in some areas , notably in regions that rely directly on a link to the mass of Gulf refineries that usually produce millions of gallons of gasoline each day .
More than half of Texas ’ refineries have been shut down because of Ike , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .

Obama emphasizes economic proposals in first press conference RAW STORY
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama addressed reporters for the first time since winning the presidential election in a press conference that took stock of the deepening economic crisis and set goals for his administration .
" This morning we woke up to more sobering news about our economy , " Obama said , referring to abysmal 6.5 percent unemployment rate , the higest in 14 years .
He called the current fiscal downturn " the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime . "
Obama outlined a series of goals , including relief for the middle class and plans to help the struggling auto industry .
This morning , I met with members of my Transition Economic Advisory Board , who will help guide the work of my transition team in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis .
We discussed several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus on in the days and weeks ahead :
First , we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provides relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear .
A particularly urgent priority is a further extension of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who cannot find work in the increasingly weak economy .
A fiscal stimulus plan that will jump - start economic growth is long overdue  and we should get it done .
Second , we must address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on other sectors of our economy : small businesses that are struggling to meet their payrolls and finance their holiday inventories ; and state and municipal governments facing devastating budget cuts and tax increases .
We must also remember that the financial crisis is increasingly global and requires a global response . [...]
Third , we will review the implementation of this Administrations financial program to ensure that our governments efforts are achieving their central goal of stabilizing financial markets while protecting taxpayers , helping homeowners and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance .
It is critical that the Treasury work closely with the FDIC , HUD and other government agencies to use the substantial authority they already have to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes .
Finally , as we monitor and address these immediate economic challenges , we will be moving forward in laying out a set of policies that will grow our middle - class and strengthen our economy in the long - term .
We cannot afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that I identified during the campaign , including clean energy , health care , education and tax relief for middle class families .
" I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead , " Obama said , flanked by his team of economic advisers .
The president - elect said he would like to see Congress pass another financial rescue package " sooner rather than later , " but he promised that it would be his top priority if nothing is completed before Inauguration Day .
Obama emphasized that he was working with President Bush , who he noted would still be in charge for the next few months .
" I am not president , and I wo n't be until January 20th , " Obama said .
Obama offered no clues about whom he would appoint to top cabinet posts like Treasury Secretary .
The transition team will " move with all deliberate haste , " in vetting appointees , he said .
" But I want to emphasize deliberate as well as haste . "
With stock markets once again in freefall , Obama convened a meeting of his high - powered panel of economic advisers before the first press conference since his triumph in Tuesday 's election against Republican John McCain .
He spoke Thursday with the leaders of nine US allies -- Australia , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Israel , Japan , Mexico and South Korea -- as the center of political gravity shifted away from President George W. Bush .
Obama , a 47 - year - old senator from Illinois serving his first term in Congress , was mulling over top cabinet picks including the all - important job of Treasury secretary as fears of a recession intensify .
Several names mentioned as potential Treasury overseers to command a 700 - billion - dollar bailout for Wall Street were to attend Friday 's meeting here of Obama 's economic lieutenants .
They include former Treasury secretary Larry Summers , ex-Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and Laura Tyson , chairwoman of the National Economic Council under Clinton .
New York Fed chief Timothy Geithner is also in the media running for Obama 's Treasury secretary , after supervising the US central bank 's unprecedented explosion of intervention in the markets .
Bush said he had directed " unprecedented " cooperation between the White House and Obama before the Democrat is inaugurated on January 20 , in the first presidential handover since the September 11 attacks of 2001 .
The president - elect , who has spent the past two days catching up with his young family and thanking his exhausted campaign staff in Chicago , is already receiving classified CIA intelligence as he prepares to take over .
Obama received his first post-election national security briefing from Mike McConnell , Director of National Intelligence , at the FBI building in downtown Chicago Thursday .
ABC News meanwhile reported that Obama 's campaign chief strategist David Axelrod , one of the main architects of his election victory , had agreed to become a senior advisor in the White House .
But campaign communications czar Robert Gibbs told AFP that reports he would become the Obama administration 's public face as White House press secretary were " premature . "

Editor 's Note :
This story , originally printed in the September 1999 issue of Scientific American , is being posted due to a new study showing that nerve cells can be regenerated by knocking out genes that typically inhibit their growth .
For Chinese gymnast Sang Lan , the cause was a highly publicized headfirst fall during warm -ups for the 1998 Goodwill Games .
For Richard Castaldo of Littleton , Colo. , it was bullets ; for onetime football player Dennis Byrd , a 1992 collision on the field ; and for a child named Samantha Jennifer Reed , a fall during infancy .
Whatever the cause , the outcome of severe damage to the spinal cord is too often the same : full or partial paralysis and loss of sensation below the level of the injury .
Ten years ago doctors had no way of limiting such disability , aside from stabilizing the cord to prevent added destruction , treating infections and prescribing rehabilitative therapy to maximize any remaining capabilities .
Nor could they rely on the cord to heal itself .
Unlike tissue in the peripheral nervous system , that in the central nervous system ( the spinal cord and brain ) does not repair itself effectively .
Few scientists held out hope that the situation would ever change .
Then , in 1990 , a human trial involving multiple research centers revealed that a steroid called methylprednisolone could preserve some motor and sensory function if it was administered at high doses within eight hours after injury .
For the first time , a therapy had been proved to reduce dysfunction caused by spinal cord trauma .
The improvements were modest , but the success galvanized a search for additional therapies .
Since then , many investigators — including us — have sought new ideas for treatment in studies of why an initial injury triggers further damage to the spinal cord and why the disrupted tissue fails to reconstruct itself .
In this article we will explain how the rapidly burgeoning knowledge might be harnessed to help people with spinal cord injuries .
We should note , however , that workers have also been devising strategies that compensate for cord damage instead of repairing it .
In the past two years , for example , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two electronic systems that regulate muscles by sending electrical signals through implanted wires .
One returns certain hand movements ( such as grasping a cup or a pen ) to patients who have shoulder mobility ; another restores a measure of control over the bladder and bowel .
A different approach can also provide grasping ability to certain patients .
Surgeons identify tendons that link paralyzed forearm muscles to the bones of the hand , disconnect them from those muscles and connect them to arm muscles regulated by parts of the spine above the injury ( and thus still under voluntary control ) .
Further , many clinicians suspect that initiating rehabilitative therapy early — exercising the limbs almost as soon as the spine is stabilized — may enhance motor and sensory function in limbs .
Those perceptions have not been tested rigorously in people , but animal studies lend credence to them .
The Cord at Work
The organ receiving all this attention is no thicker than an inch but is the critical highway of communication between the brain and the rest of the body .
The units of communication are the nerve cells ( neurons ) , which consist of a bulbous cell body ( home to the nucleus ) , trees of signal - detecting dendrites , and an axon that extends from the cell body and carries signals to other cells .
Axons branch toward their ends and can maintain connections , or synapses , with many cells at once .
Some traverse the entire length of the cord .
The soft , jellylike cord has two major systems of neurons .
Of these , the descending , motor pathways control both smooth muscles of internal organs and striated muscles ; they also help to modulate the actions of the autonomic nervous system , which regulates blood pressure , temperature and the body ’s circulatory response to stress .
The descending pathways begin with neurons in the brain , which send electrical signals to specific levels , or segments , of the cord .
Neurons in those segments then convey the impulses outward beyond the cord .
The other main system of neurons — the ascending , sensory pathways — transmit sensory signals received from the extremities and organs to specific segments of the cord and then up to the brain .
Those signals originate with specialized , “ transducer ” cells , such as sensors in the skin that detect changes in the environment or cells that monitor the state of internal organs .
The cord also contains neuronal circuits ( such as those involved in reflexes and certain aspects of walking ) that can be activated by incoming sensory signals without input from the brain , although they can be influenced by messages from the brain .
The cell bodies in the trunk of the cord reside in a gray , butterfly - shaped core that spans the length of the spinal cord .
The ascending and descending axonal fibers travel in a surrounding area known as the white matter , so called because the axons are wrapped in myelin , a white insulating material .
Both regions also house glial cells , which help neurons to survive and work properly .
The glia include star - shaped astrocytes , microglia ( small cells that resemble components of the immune system ) and oligodendrocytes , the myelin producers .
Each oligodendrocyte myelinates as many as 40 different axons simultaneously .
The precise nature of a spinal cord injury can vary from person to person .
Nevertheless , certain commonalities can be discerned .
When Injury Strikes
When a fall or some other force fractures or dislocates the spinal column , the vertebral bones that normally enclose and protect the cord can crush it , mechanically killing and damaging axons .
Occasionally , only the gray matter in the damaged area is significantly disrupted .
If the injury ended there , muscular and sensory disturbances would be confined to tissues that send input to or receive it from neurons in the affected level of the cord , without much disturbing function below that level .
For instance , if only the gray matter were affected , a cervical 8 ( C8 ) lesion — involving the cord segment where the nerves labeled C8 originate — would paralyze the hands without impeding walking or control over the bowel and bladder .
No signals would go out to , or be received from , the tissues connected to the C8 nerves , but the axons conveying signals up and down the surrounding white matter would keep working .
In contrast , if all the white matter in the same cord segment were destroyed , the injury would now interrupt the vertical signals , stopping messages that originated in the brain from traveling below the damaged area and blocking the flow to the brain of sensory signals coming from below the wound .
The person would become paralyzed in the hands and lower limbs and would lose control over urination and defecation .
Sadly , the initial insult is only the beginning of the trouble .
The early mechanical injury triggers a second wave of damage — one that , over the subsequent minutes , hours and days , progressively enlarges the lesion and thus the extent of functional impairment .
This secondary spread tends to occur longitudinally through the gray matter at first before expanding into the white matter ( roughly resembling the inflation of a footballshaped balloon ) .
Eventually the destruction can encompass several spinal segments above and below the original wound .
The end result is a complex state of disrepair .
Axons that have been damaged become useless stumps , connected to nothing , and their severed terminals disintegrate .
Often many axons remain intact but are rendered useless by loss of their insulating myelin .
A fluid - filled cavity , or cyst , sits where neurons , other cells and axons used to be .
And glial cells proliferate abnormally , creating clusters termed glial scars .
Together the cyst and scars pose a formidable barrier to any cut axons that might somehow try to regrow and connect to cells they once innervated .
A few axons may remain whole , myelinated and able to carry signals up or down the spine , but often their numbers are too small to convey useful directives to the brain or muscles .
First , Contain the Damage
If all these changes had to be fully reversed to help patients , the prospects for new treatments would be grim .
Fortunately , it appears that salvaging normal activity in as little as 10 percent of the standard axon complement would sometimes make walking possible for people who would otherwise lack that capacity .
In addition , lowering the level of injury by just a single segment ( about half an inch ) can make an important difference to a person ’s quality of life .
People with a C6 injury have no power over their arms , save some ability to move their shoulders and flex their elbows .
But individuals with a lower , C7 injury can move the shoulders and elbow joints and extend the wrists ; with training and sometimes a tendon transfer , they can make some use of their arms and hands .
Because so much damage arises after the initial injury , clarifying how that secondary destruction occurs and blocking those processes are critical .
The added wreckage has been found to result from many interacting mechanisms .
Within minutes of the trauma , small hemorrhages from broken blood vessels appear , and the spinal cord swells .
The blood vessel damage and swelling prevent the normal delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cells , causing many of them to starve to death .
Meanwhile damaged cells , axons and blood vessels release toxic chemicals that go to work on intact neighboring cells .
One of these chemicals in particular triggers a highly disruptive process known as excitotoxicity .
In the healthy cord the end tips of many axons secrete minute amounts of glutamate .
When this chemical binds to receptors on target neurons , it stimulates those cells to fire impulses .
But when spinal neurons , axons or astrocytes are injured , they release a flood of glutamate .
The high levels overexcite neighboring neurons , inducing them to admit waves of ions that then trigger a series of destructive events in the cells — including production of free radicals .
These highly reactive molecules can attack membranes and other components of formerly healthy neurons and kill them .
Until about a year ago , such excitotoxicity , also seen after a stroke , was thought to be lethal to neurons alone , but new results suggest it kills oligodendrocytes ( the myelin producers ) as well .
This effect may help explain why even unsevered axons become demyelinated , and thus unable to conduct impulses , after spinal cord trauma .
Prolonged inflammation , marked by an influx of certain immune system cells , can exacerbate these effects and last for days .
Normally , immune cells stay in the blood , unable to enter tissues of the central nervous system .
But they can flow in readily where blood vessels are damaged .
As they and microglia become activated in response to an injury , the activated cells release still more free radicals and other toxic substances .
Methylprednisolone , the first drug found to limit spinal cord damage in humans , may act in part by reducing swelling , inflammation , the release of glutamate and the accumulation of free radicals .
The precise details of how it helps patients remain unclear , however .
Studies of laboratory animals with damaged spinal cords indicate that drugs able to stop cells from responding to excess glutamate could minimize destruction as well .
Agents that selectively block glutamate receptors of the so - called AMPA class , a kind abundant on oligodendrocytes and neurons , seem to be particularly effective at limiting the final extent of a lesion and the related disability .
Certain AMPA receptor antagonists have already been tested in early human trials as a therapy for stroke , and related compounds could enter safety studies in patients with spinal cord injury within several years .
Much of the early cell loss in the injured spinal cord occurs by necrosis , a process in which cells essentially become passive victims of murder .
In the past few years , neurobiologists have also documented a more active form of cell death , somewhat akin to suicide , in the cord .
Days or weeks after the initial trauma , a wave of this cell suicide , or apoptosis , frequently sweeps through oligodendrocytes as many as four segments from the trauma site .
This discovery , too , has opened new doors for protective therapy .
Rats given apoptosisinhibiting drugs retained more ambulatory ability after a traumatic spinal cord injury than did untreated rats .
In the past few years , biologists have identified many substances , called neurotrophic factors , that also promote neuronal and glial cell survival .
A related substance , GM - 1 ganglioside ( Sygen ) , is now being evaluated for limiting cord injury in humans .
Ultimately , interventions for reducing secondary damage in the spinal cord will probably enlist a variety of drugs given at different times to thwart specific mechanisms of death in distinct cell populations .
The best therapy would not only reduce the extent of an injury but also repair damage .
A key component of that repair would be stimulating the regeneration of damaged axons — that is , inducing their elongation and reconnection with appropriate target cells .
Although neurons in the central nervous system of adult mammals generally fail to regenerate damaged axons , this lapse does not stem from an intrinsic property of those cells .
Rather the fault lies with shortcomings in their environment .
After all , neurons elsewhere in the body and in the immature spinal cord and brain regrow axons readily , and animal experiments have shown that the right environment can induce axons of the spinal cord to extend quite far .
Then , Induce Regeneration
One shortcoming of the cord environment turns out to be an overabundance of molecules that actively inhibit axonal regeneration — some of them in myelin .
The scientists who discovered these myelin - related inhibitors have produced a molecule named IN - 1 ( inhibitorneutralizing antibody ) that blocks the action of those inhibitors .
They have also demonstrated that infusion of mouse - derived IN - 1 into the injured rat spinal cord can lead to long - distance regrowth of some interrupted axons .
And when pathways controlling front paw activity are severed , treated animals regain some paw motion , whereas untreated animals do not .
The rodent antibody would be destroyed by the human immune system , but workers are developing a humanized version for testing in people .
Many other inhibitory molecules have now been found as well , including some produced by astrocytes and a number that reside in the extracellular matrix ( the scaffolding between cells ) .
Given this array , it seems likely that combination therapies will be needed to counteract or shut down the production of multiple inhibitors at once .
Beyond removing the “ brakes ” on axonal regrowth , a powerful tactic would supply substances that actively promote axonal extension .
The search for such factors began with studies of nervous system development .
Decades ago scientists isolated nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , a neurotrophic factor that supports the survival and development of the peripheral nervous system .
Subsequently , this factor turned out to be part of a family of proteins that both enhance neuronal survival and favor the outgrowth of axons .
Many other families of neurotrophic factors with similar talents have been identified as well .
For instance , the molecule neurotrophin- 3 ( NT - 3 ) selectively encourages the growth of axons that descend into the spinal cord from the brain .
Luckily , adult neurons remain able to respond to axon-regenerating signals from such factors .
Obviously , however , natural production of these substances falls far short of the amount needed for spinal cord repair .
Indeed , manufacture of some of the compounds apparently declines , instead of rising , for weeks after a spinal trauma occurs .
According to a host of animal studies , artificially raising those levels after an injury can enhance regeneration .
Some regeneration - promoting neurotrophic factors , such as basic fibroblast growth factor , have been tested in stroke patients .
None has been evaluated as an aid to regeneration in people with spinal cord damage , but many are being assessed in animals as a prelude to such studies .
Those considering neurotrophic factors for therapy will have to be sure that the agents do not increase pain , a common long - term complication of spinal cord injury .
This pain has many causes , but one is the sprouting of nascent axons where they do not belong ( perhaps in a failed attempt to address the injury ) and their inappropriate connection to other cells .
The brain sometimes misinterprets impulses traveling through those axons as pain signals .
Neurotrophic factors can theoretically exacerbate that problem and can also cause pain circuits in the spiral cord and pain - sensing cells in the skin to become oversensitive .
After axons start growing , they will have to be guided to their proper targets , the cells to which they were originally wired .
But how ?
In this case , too , studies of embryonic development have offered clues .
During development , growing axons are led to their eventual targets by molecules that act on the leading tip , or growth cone .
In the past five years especially , a startling number of substances that participate in this process have been uncovered .
Some , such as a group called netrins , are released or displayed by neurons or glial cells .
They beckon axons to grow in some directions and repel growth in others .
Additional guidance molecules are fixed components of the extracellular matrix .
Certain of the matrix molecules bind well to specific molecules ( cell adhesion molecules ) on the growth cones and thus provide anchors for growing axons .
During development , the required directional molecules are presented to the growth cones in specific sequences .
Establish Proper Connections
At the moment , no one knows how to supply all the needed chemical road signs in the right places .
But some findings suggest that regeneration may be aided by supplying just a subset of those targeting molecules — say , a selection of netrins and components from the extracellular matrix .
Substances already in the spinal cord may well be capable of supplying the rest of the needed guidance .
A different targeting approach aims to bridge the gap created by cord damage .
It directs injured axons toward their proper destinations by supplying a conduit through which they can travel or by providing another friendly scaffolding able to give physical support to the fibers as they try to traverse the normally impenetrable cyst .
The scaffolding can also serve as a source of growth - promoting chemicals .
For instance , researchers have implanted tubes packed with Schwann cells into the gap where part of the spinal cord was removed in rodents .
Schwann cells , which are glia of the peripheral nervous system , were chosen because they have many attributes that favor axonal regeneration .
In animal experiments , such grafts spurred some axonal growth into the tubes .
A second bridging material consists of olfactory - ensheathing glial cells , which are found only in the tracts leading from the nose to the olfactory bulbs of the brain .
When those cells were put into the rat spinal cord where descending tracts had been cut , the implants spurred partial regrowth of the axons over the implant .
Transplanting the olfactory - ensheathing glia with Schwann cells led to still more extensive growth .
In theory , a biopsy could be performed to obtain the needed olfactory ensheathing glia from a patient .
But once the properties that enable them ( or other cells ) to be competent escorts for growing axons are determined , researchers may instead be able to genetically alter other cell types if desired , giving them the required combinations of growthpromoting properties .
Fibroblasts ( cells common in connective tissue and the skin ) are among those already being engineered to serve as bridges .
They have been altered to produce the neurotrophic molecule NT - 3 and then transplanted into the cut spinal cord of rodents .
The altered fibroblasts have resulted in partial regrowth of axons .
Along with encouraging axonal regrowth , NT - 3 stimulates remyelination .
In these studies the genetically altered fibroblasts have enhanced myelination of regenerated axons and improved hind limb activity .
Replace Lost Cells
Other transplantation schemes would implant cells that normally occur in the central nervous system .
In addition to serving as bridges and potentially releasing proteins helpful for axonal regeneration , certain of these grafts might be able to replace cells that have died .
Transplantation of tissue from the fetal central nervous system has produced a number of exciting results in animals treated soon after a trauma .
This immature tissue can give rise to new neurons , complete with axons that travel long distances into the recipient ’s tissues ( up and down several segments in the spinal cord or out to the periphery ) .
It can also prompt host neurons to send regenerating axons into the implanted tissue .
In addition , transplant recipients , unlike untreated animals , may recover some limb function , such as the ability to move the paw in useful ways .
What is more , studies of fetal tissue implants suggest that axons can at times find appropriate targets even in the absence of externally supplied guidance molecules .
The transplants , however , are far more effective in the immature spinal cord than in the injured adult cord — an indication that young children would probably respond to such therapy much better than adolescents or adults would .
Some patients with long - term spinal cord injuries have received human fetal tissue transplants , but too little information is available so far for drawing any conclusions .
In any case , application of fetal tissue technology in humans will almost surely be limited by ethical dilemmas and a lack of donor tissue .
Therefore , other ways of achieving the same results will have to be devised .
Among the alternatives is transplanting stem cells : immature cells that are capable of dividing endlessly , of making exact replicas of themselves and also of spawning a range of more specialized cell types .
Various kinds of stem cells have been identified , including ones that generate all the cell types in the blood system , the skin , or the spinal cord and brain .
Stem cells found in the human adult central nervous system have , moreover , been shown capable of producing neurons and all their accompanying glia , although these so - called neural stem cells seem to be quiescent in most regions of the system .
In 1998 a few laboratories also obtained much more versatile stem cells from human tissue .
These human embryonic stem cells ( in common with embryonic stem cells obtained previously from other vertebrates ) can be grown in culture and , in theory , can yield almost all the cell types in the body , including those of the spinal cord .
Stem Cell Strategies
How might stem cells aid in spinal cord repair ?
A great deal will be possible once biologists learn how to obtain those cells readily from a patient and how to control the cells ’ differentiation .
Notably , physicians might be able to withdraw neural stem cells from a patient ’s brain or spinal cord , expand the numbers of the still undifferentiated cells in the laboratory and place the enlarged population in the same person ’s cord with no fear that the immune system will reject the implant as foreign .
Or they might begin with frozen human embryonic stem cells , coax those cells to become precursors , or progenitors , of spinal cells and implant a large population of the precursors .
Studies proposing to examine the effects on patients with spinal cord injuries of transplanting neural stem cells ( isolated from the patients ’ brains by biopsy ) are being considered .
Simply implanting progenitor cells into the cord may be enough to prod them to multiply and differentiate into the needed lineages and thus to replace useful numbers of lost neurons and glial cells and establish the proper synaptic connections between neurons .
Stem cells transplanted into the normal and injured nervous systems of animals can form neurons and glia appropriate for the region of transplantation .
Combined with the fetal tissue results , this outcome signifies that many important cues for differentiation and targeting preexist in the injured nervous system .
But if extra help is needed , scientists might be able to deliver it through genetic engineering .
As a rule , to be genetically altered easily , cells have to be able to divide .
Stem cells , unlike mature neurons , fit that bill .
Scenarios involving stem cell transplants are admittedly futuristic , but one day they themselves may become unnecessary , replaced by gene therapy alone .
Delivery of genes into surviving cells in the spinal cord could enable those cells to manufacture and release a steady supply of proteins able to induce stem cell proliferation , to enhance cell differentiation and survival , and to promote axonal regeneration , guidance and remyelination .
For now , though , technology for delivering genes to the central nervous system and for ensuring that the genes survive and work properly is still being refined .
Until , and even after , cell transplants and gene therapies become commonplace for coping with spinal cord injury , patients might gain help through a different avenue — drugs that restore signal conduction in axons quieted by demyelination .
Ongoing clinical tests are evaluating the ability of a drug called 4 - aminopyridine to compensate for demyelination .
This agent temporarily blocks potassium ion channels in axonal membranes and , in so doing , allows axons to transmit electrical signals past zones of demyelination .
Some patients receiving the drug have demonstrated modest improvement in sensory or motor function .
At first glance , this therapy might seem like a good way to treat multiple sclerosis , which destroys the myelin around axons of neurons in the central nervous system .
Patients with this disease are prone to seizures , however , and 4 - aminopyridine can exacerbate that tendency .
Neurotrophic factors , such as NT - 3 , that can stimulate remyelination of axons in animals could be considered for therapy as well .
NT - 3 is already entering extensive ( phase III ) trials in humans with spinal cord injury , though not to restore myelin .
It will be administered by injection in amounts capable of acting on nerves in the gut and of enhancing bowel function , but the doses will be too low to yield high concentrations in the central nervous system .
If the drug proves to be safe in this trial , though , that success could pave the way for human tests of doses large enough to enhance myelination or regeneration .
The Years Ahead
Clearly , the 1990s have seen impressive advances in understanding of spinal cord injury and the controls on neuronal growth .
Like axons inching toward their targets , a growing number of investigators are pushing their way through the envelope of discovery and generating a rational game plan for treating such damage .
That approach will involve delivery of multiple therapies in an orderly sequence .
Some treatments will combat secondary injury , some will encourage axonal regrowth or remyelination , and some will replace lost cells .
When will the new ideas become real treatments ?
We wish we had an answer .
Drugs that work well in animals do not always prove useful in people , and those that show promise in small human trials do not always pan out when examined more extensively .
It is nonetheless encouraging that at least two human trials are now under way and that others could start in the next several years .
Limiting an injury will be easier than reversing it , and so treatments for ameliorating the secondary damage that follows acute trauma can be expected to enter human testing most quickly .
Of the repair strategies , promoting remyelination will be the simplest to accomplish , because all it demands is the recoating of intact axons .
Remyelination strategies have the potential to produce meaningful recovery of function , such as returning control over the bladder or bowel — abilities that uninjured people take for granted but that would mean the world to those with spinal cord injuries .
Of course , tendon - transfer surgery and advanced electrical devices can already restore important functions in some patients .
Yet for many people , a return of independence in daily activities will depend on reconstruction of damaged tissue through the regrowth of injured axons and the reconnection of disrupted pathways .
So far , few interventions in animals with well - established spinal cord injuries have achieved the magnitude of regrowth and synapse formation that would be needed to provide a hand grasp or the ability to stand and walk in human adults with long - term damage .
Because of the great complexities and difficulties involved in those aspects of cord repair , we cannot guess when reconstructive therapies might begin to become available .
But we anticipate continued progress toward that end .
Traditionally , medical care for patients with spinal cord injury has emphasized compensatory strategies that maximize use of any residual cord function .
That focus is now expanding , as treatments designed to repair the damaged cord and restore lost function — science fiction only a decade ago — are becoming increasingly plausible .
Cutting and scratching is the most common form of self harm
The idea that self - harm is almost exclusively a problem among teenage girls is wrong , research suggests .
Almost 1,000 people with a history of self - harm responded to a survey by UK mental health charity Sane .
More than 10 % were male , and the researchers said it was possible that boys simply concealed their self - harm more than girls .
In addition , some respondents said they did not start harming themselves until they were in their fifties .
MOST COMMON METHODS
Cutting and scratching : 93 % Buring the skin : 28 % Overdosing : 20 % Bruising the body : 17 % Others reported that they first started to harm themselves when they were as young as four .
Almost half of the 532 people who were still self - harming when they answered the survey had been harming for more than five years , and a quarter for at least 11 years .
Of those , 20 % were hurting themselves daily and 30 % were harming themselves weekly .
The survey also suggests far from being a way to seek attention , self - harm is generally hidden , often out of fear about the impact on family and friends .
Some 84 % of respondents tried to hide their behaviour from their family , and 66 % tried to hide it from friends .
Many said they chose to damage a part of their body that was easy to conceal from others , or where the injury could be most easily explained away as an accident .
BODY PARTS HARMED Arms : 83 % Thighs or legs : 50 % Stomach : 19 % Wrists : 14 % Only one person in eight said their first act of self - harm was motivated by a desire for others to take notice and care , and this figure dropped to one in 12 for subsequent acts of self - harm .
Many people said they did not expect those closest to them to understand why they had self harmed .
Suicide risk
While people who harm themselves do appear at higher risk of suicide , the survey found most of the time self harm is actually an attempt to alleviate suicidal thoughts .
Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of Sane , said the study showed a wide mix of people harmed themselves .
She said : " What is alarming is the numbers of those taken to A&E departments who are sent home without any follow - up help .
" We need doctors and teachers to be more alert to the potential risks , and many more therapists available , to prevent the vicious cycle of relief by painful self - harm . "
Ian Hulatt , mental health adviser at the Royal College of Nursing , welcomed the report for focusing on how to care for people who have harmed themselves .
He said : " Self - harm remains a challenging and often unspoken subject . "
Research suggests the UK has the highest rate of self harm in Europe .
The number of children admitted to hospital due to self - harm rose by a third in five years to 2007 .

RAIN POUNDS against the open tailgate of my car , where I ’ve taken shelter from the worst of the storm .
Water pours from the hemlocks onto the devil ’s club .
From maple bole to bole , raindrops bounce , splattering salmonberry and sorrel .
I shrug into my rain gear , shoulder my pack , and splash across the parking lot .
Rain bells off cars , smacks against my hood , beats on my shoulders , and drums on the garbage bag covering my pack .
Against all instinct , I ’m going to backpack into the clattering teeth of this North Pacific gale , in search of silence .
It ’s not easy to find silence in the modern world .
If a quiet place is one where you can listen for fifteen minutes in daylight hours without hearing a human - created sound , there are no quiet places left in Europe .
There are none east of the Mississippi River .
And in the American West ?
Maybe twelve .
One of these is in the temperate rainforest along the Hoh River in Olympic National Park .
At the Hoh River trailhead , where a path disappears into the gloom under giant , lichen - draped Douglas fir and western red cedar , I meet up with Gordon Hempton .
He stands calm and dry under an umbrella , comfortable in the wool and cotton clothes he has chosen for their silence .
Middle - aged , limber , and weather - tanned , Gordon is a man on a mission to record the natural sounds of the world before they are drowned out by human noise .
For years , he has searched for the quiet places where falling water and wren song can still be clearly heard .
This weekend , he is taking me to one of the few remaining quiet spots in the United States .
Gordon leads me into the dense forest where rain and wind are muffled by moss .
Even so , on the path to this silent place , the natural sounds are deafening .
“ In a forest like this , ” he says , leaning close to my ear , “ a drop of rain may hit twenty times before it reaches the ground , and each impact — against a cedar bough , a vine - maple leaf , a snag — makes its own sound . ”
He crouches beside a fern - banked stream .
“ You can hear the treble tones , ” he says , “ but do you hear the bass undertones as well ? ” I kneel on the moss beside him , soaking through the knees of my rainpants .
I ’ve never listened to water quite this way before , with such close attention to its music .
“ You can change the pitch of a stream by removing a stone . ” I lift a cobble out of the water .
The chord loses some of its brightness , picks up a drone I did n’t hear before .
“ A stream tunes itself over time , ” Gordon says , “ tumbling the rocks into place . ”
A channel gouging through the mud that remains after a hillside has been logged is “ only noise .
But an old mossy stream ?
That ’s a fugue . ”
Once , he tells me , he heard wind move up the Hoh valley , knocking dry leaves off the bigleaf maple trees .
“ It sounded , ” he says , “ like a wave of applause . ”
For love of sounds like these , Gordon has begun a campaign to protect the silence of the national parks .
Even though silence and the natural soundscape are listed as natural resources in National Park Service documents , and even though park officials are charged with managing the land so as to protect its natural resources , no park has a plan to protect its stillness .
So Gordon took the responsibility on himself .
He calls his project “ One Square Inch of Silence . ”
Following leads , crisscrossing the country , he searched for one square inch where he could listen for fifteen minutes and not hear a human sound but the whisper of his pencil on wet paper .
In Olympic National Park , where 95 percent of the land is protected as wilderness , he found the “ widest diversity of soundscapes and the longest periods of natural quiet of any unit within the national park system . ”
On Earth Day , 2005 , Gordon marked the site with a small red stone , and this tiny space of silence he vowed to defend .
He has asked Congress to designate a square inch of silence in ten other national parks as well .
“ Think about finding one place in a park that you can visit , where there will be no trucks heard , no planes flying over , no man -made machinery , no human noise , ” he says .
“ Would n’t that be a beautiful thing ? ”
It ’s a powerful idea .
As Gordon knows , sound travels .
If he can protect the silence of even an inch , he calculates that , in effect , he will be protecting the natural soundscape of approximately one thousand square miles of surrounding land .
It ’s a first step toward his goal of preventing the extinction of silence .
PAST THE FIRST MILEPOST toward One Square Inch , we cross a glade that borders the Hoh River .
After so many days of rain , the Hoh is in full flood .
Gray water roars over torn - out root wads , ramming logs against the shore , undercutting the banks , and rolling rocks downstream .
Gordon pulls out his sound - level meter , a machine that looks like a hand - held radio but measures sound in decibels .
“ Sixty - three decibels . ”
The river has the same sound level as ocean surf in a storm .
This , Gordon says , is one - tenth the volume of the traffic noise outside the Fifth Avenue entrance to the Seattle Public Library .
Cities drown us in sound .
Buses grinding gears and motorcycles grumbling , woofers thudding , endless engines combusting , trucks beeping , and street - corner preachers calling down damnation on it all — what does it do to the human being , whose ears evolved as a warning system ?
In daylight , our eyes can warn us of danger in front of us .
But our ears alert us to opportunity and danger twenty - four hours a day , from every direction , even through dense vegetation and total darkness .
Some linguists believe that the oldest word is hist — listen !
When predators are on the prowl , birds and frogs , even insects , fall silent .
No wonder humans are drawn to places where the birds feel safe enough to sing .
No wonder we smile to hear a frog chorus in the dark .
But in the cacophonous city , Gordon believes , we are always on edge , always flinching , the way a deer trembles when it drinks from a noisy river .
People continuously assaulted by high levels of traffic noise have suppressed immune systems and significantly increased risk of high blood pressure and heart attacks .
A city will be comfortable for a human , Gordon says , only when it ’s quiet enough to hear shoe leather touch cement , only when lovers can talk without shouting at each other .
I know what he means .
I ’m still on edge from the noise of the drive up I - 5 through Portland .
When trucks roared past me , they threw rain with such a thud against the windshield that it drowned out even my shirring tires , the smacking wipers , and on my CD player , Pink Floyd ’s bass guitar .
However , it ’s not noise in the cities that most concerns Gordon , but the extinction of silence in wild places .
It ’s the way that human sounds drown out the music of the natural world that breaks his heart — and gets his back up .
Even national parks are not always able to protect the music of a morning wind in pines , the echo of a woodpecker tapping a hollow trunk , the thrum of distant surf .
Dawn in a national park often begins with the brown noise of automobile traffic and swells with the awakening sounds of RV generators , jet overflights , sightseeing helicopters , and “ It ’s a Small World After All ” playing in the next camp over .
Human noise also damages animals , whose behaviors are exquisitely tuned to songs and other auditory signals they use to hunt and to escape , to establish territories and find mates .
Scientists have documented the harmful effects of mining blasts on elk , passenger jets on bald eagles , the Navy ’s submarine - hunting sonar on dolphins and whales and roaring dune buggies on kangaroo rats trying to avoid sidewinder snakes .
Just as animals have ecological niches , they have aural niches , defined by the soundscapes they live in .
The onslaught of noise destroys that aural habitat .
Birdsongs , especially the low - pitched sounds , are lost along highways , which are , in effect , wide swaths of loud , low - pitched noise reaching deep into the forests and meadows , reducing bird habitat — and sometimes eliminating it entirely .
It ’s a loss to humans too .
Just as artificial lights drown out the stars , our engines drown out the birdsongs , and our experience of the world ’s beauty is that much more impoverished .
AT 1.4 MILES , we turn off the trail to check a possible campsite , but the hollow where we would pitch tents is a muddy puddle .
We hike on , splashing along the trail , past dark skunk - cabbage sloughs , over trickling rivulets , under the boughs of cedar so tall their crowns are lost in fog .
I ’m glad for my rubber boots , because the trail has become a stream , and the rocky steps are small waterfalls .
We stop often to listen , putting our ears close to the dark decaying hollow of a stump , or a green carpet of bunchberry , or a fallen log whose crosscut section shows more than three hundred growth rings .
Gordon stops next to an enormous tree and listens intently .
“ Do you hear the thrum of the river resonating in the trunks of the Sitka spruce ? ” he asks .
“ This is a tree whose wood is chosen for the finest violins . ”
I try , but all I hear is the noise of my own mind — what I should have done , what I should n’t have said , and will I ever be warm or dry again ?
And this gray noise , the static that comes from my own ears .
Gordon is sympathetic .
He knows from experience that when people are long enough away from the “ chemical whining ” of caffeine , aspirin , and alcohol , and from the damage done to their hearing by the noise of the car that brings them here , their ears will silence themselves — and so will my mind .
“ Silence is like scouring sand , ” he says .
“ When you are quiet , the silence blows against your mind and etches away everything that is soft and unimportant . ”
What is left is what is real — pure awareness , and the very hardest questions .
Many years ago , Gordon was a botany student in Wisconsin .
As he was driving back to school from the West Coast , night came on , and he stopped to sleep in an Iowa cornfield .
Lying on the ground , he listened to crickets scratch their crisp fiddles and corn stalks rasp against their leaves .
He heard thunder rumble .
The crickets and the corn went silent , and the storm rolled over him .
He heard raindrops smack into soil , and hail rattle the stalks .
Then the thunder was growling far away and crickets were singing again .
How could it be that he had never before heard , really heard , the sounds of the Earth ?
From that time forward , how could he do anything but listen ?
How should he live his life ?
“ Whatever came next , ” he told me , “ had to measure up to the honesty of that night . ”
Gordon dropped out of school and took a job as a bike messenger in Seattle .
Everything he earned went into the microphones and tape machines that would train his ear .
Now he travels the world , recording sounds with a microphone that has the shape and acoustic characteristics of a human head .
He produces CDs from these recordings — the pure sounds of the natural world , unadorned by human music , uninterrupted by the human voice .
He has become the SoundTracker , whose recordings caught the attention of composer John Cage , earned him an Emmy Award , and landed him contracts to record the soundtracks for PBS specials , movies , and even Microsoft computer games .
His most famous recording project is Dawn Chorus .
As dawn moves across the curve of the slowly turning planet and erases the darkness with light , birds cry out , tentatively at first , insects chime , melting snow strikes stone , a light wind rises , and the whole Earth begins to sing .
To his ears , it is a song of astonishment and gratitude .
Astonishment and gratitude are an important part of what the future stands to lose under the shouting engines of human ambition .
When humans silence nature , drowning out the small voices , we subordinate it to our own presumed power .
Anyone who has felt the oppression in a classroom or boardroom or marriage when only some are free to speak will understand what it means to be silenced — to have no voice , to be seen and not heard , to be told to “ pay attention , ” which means do not pay attention to any voice but one .
Human noise is yet one more oil - fired expression of modernity ’s claim of sovereignty and control over the natural world .
It speaks also of separation .
The seventeenth - century philosopher René Descartes drew a sharp distinction between humans and the rest of creation .
Humans , the thinking beings , have the power of intelligent speech , he wrote .
But all other beings — birds , frogs , even dogs — are material substance only , machines that may tick like clocks or squeal like dry bearings , but can never think or feel .
Is it any wonder that Western civilization babbles and roars humanity ’s isolation from the other creatures of the Earth ?
Is it any wonder we are reckless with the world ?
But silence ?
Silence creates an opening , an absence of self , which allows the larger world to enter into our awareness .
It brings us into contact with what is beyond us , its beauty and mystery .
Silence is not the absence of sounds , but a way of living in the world — an intentional awareness , an expression of gratitude , to make of one ’s own ears , one ’s own body , a sounding board that resonates in its hollow places with the vibrations of the world .
When wind plays across the maple leaves and sets them in motion , it ’s we who are most deeply moved .
No one knows why natural sounds speak so directly to the human spirit , but it ’s possible to imagine what they say — that we are not separate from the world , not dominant or different .
Like stone , like water , like wrens , we carry the shape of the world in our rustling .
We are all music , we are all matter in motion , all of us , together sending our harmonies into a black and trembling sky .
AT MILEPOST 2.3 , we sling off our packs and pitch tents .
The rain seems to have let up , here under the shelter of a Douglas fir whose trunk is nine feet across .
We ’re not far now from One Square Inch .
As I tighten the ropes on my tarp , Gordon tells me about his efforts to defend the silence of that place .
Every month , Gordon sits by the stone to listen .
If he hears a human - created sound , he documents its volume , locates the source , and makes an official complaint :
On April 16 , 2006 , an aircraft later identified as a Boeing B767 with tail number N582HA flying at an altitude of 36,972 ´ and registered to Hawaiian Airlines produced an audible noise impact of 44 dB ( A ) at One Square Inch .
Hawaiian Airlines wrote back , explaining that the offending flight was only a test flight and promising to avoid the area in the future .
Alaska Airlines has not been quite as forthcoming .
Thirty - seven Alaska flights fly over the Olympic National Park every day , dragging cones of noise through the forest .
“ It ’s physically impossible for a jet to fly high enough that its engines ca n’t be heard on Earth , ” Gordon says , but that ’s not the point .
The point is that these flights are still gaining altitude , so their thrusters are roaring as the jets power over the seven - thousand - foot peaks of the Brothers Wilderness in the heart of the park .
Alaska has agreed to “ enact a policy ” that encourages flight crews to avoid the park on nonroutine flight operations such as maintenance and test flights .
But they will not reroute passenger jets .
“ Deviations from [ the FAA preferred routing ] would increase delays , ” they wrote to Gordon , “ causing higher fuel burn and increased emissions . ”
They do n’t explain why this has to be so .
Alaska passenger jets still pour noise onto the glacier - etched peaks and deep forests of the Olympic peninsula .
Even so , Gordon sees progress in soundscape management .
The Federal Aviation Administration has rerouted planes from runway 25 at Denver International Airport to avoid disturbing bald eagles .
In response to a suit by the National Resources Defense Council , a federal court has prohibited the Navy from conducting sonar exercises off California in complete disregard for the whales and the laws that would protect them .
And Olympic National Park ?
Public information officer Barbara Maynes believes the park ’s management has for many years been aligned with Gordon ’s goals , although they are not working together .
“ Protection of natural soundscapes is part of everything we do , ” Maynes says .
She points out that while Gordon is protecting one square inch of silence , the park is charged with protecting five trillion square inches and a host of sometimes conflicting values .
The park welcomes the visitors who come to experience One Square Inch , even as Maynes expresses “ concern for possible resource damage ” caused by that concentration of attention .
But Maynes affirms the park ’s commitment to strive in everything they do for the “ least impact ” on natural sounds .
It seems that Gordon has tapped into a wellspring of human yearning for stillness and concern for the commonweal of natural sounds .
The Noise Pollution Clearinghouse cites several hundred organizations working to prevent the harm that noise causes , from the Alaska Quiet Rights Coalition to the World Health Organization .
They argue that the air is a commons , a public good , shared and cared for by all .
Like secondhand smoke or elevated mercury levels , dumping noise into the air damages the well - being and health of the many , in order to benefit the few — a violation of the ethic of the commons .
AT 3.2 MILES , Gordon steps onto a path that leads to the left through an arch formed by the straddling legs of a great cedar .
From here , we follow an elk trail into the woods .
We ’re approaching the One Square Inch of silence now , and Gordon asks only one thing of me .
Silence .
We walk in — not far , maybe seventy - five yards — through a shallow swale , over shaggy hummocks , to a shoulder - high log fallen so long ago that its bark is coated with moss and hemlock seedlings root in the duff on its back .
Here , at 47° 51.959 ´ N , 123° 52.221´ W , is a square red stone that marks the inch of silence .
How shall I describe the beauty of this place ?
It ’s an open glade , like the nave of a cathedral , carpeted in deep green moss and deer ferns .
There are huckleberry bushes , their bare green branches standing in the rosy litter of their own fallen leaves .
The bunchberry leaves have turned red , but the wood sorrel is intensely green .
From the forest floor , the columns of the trees rise impossibly high , closing at last in a vaulted green ceiling .
Everything glitters with scattering rain .
Even the air twinkles , as if it were champagne .
And what do I hear ?
A tiny lisp — a bushtit maybe .
Tick , tap , pock of waterdrops , different sounds for every surface they strike .
I hear a drop of water pop when it hits a maple leaf forty feet way .
There is the faraway rustle of the river .
Time passes , unmeasured .
Then the quiet is filled with the clatter of a bald eagle , a sound like stones shaken in a tin pot .
Sitting on his heels in the damp moss , Gordon grins , but does n’t speak .
Next to him , almost hidden under the log , is a small metal canister .
This is the Jar of Quiet Thoughts .
Gordon put it here , an invitation to people who visit One Square Inch to record their responses to the silence .
I open the jar and pull out crumpled scraps of paper .
Many wrote of love .
One couple came here to be married , a person came to pray , another found deep connection here , in the call of a thrush .
Others wrote of wonder , to hear the voices of the deep quiet .
I realize that One Square Inch has become a sacred place — silence has made it so .
Quiet is a kind of reverence .
A small wind shakes a huckleberry bush .
A crow calls from the crown of an alder .
A hemlock needle falls on my shoulder , and I turn , astonished to have heard it land .
Behave at school and you 'll be given a PlayStation or plasma TV , pupils are told
Pupils are being offered TVs , PlayStations and iPods in return for good behaviour as part of a reward points scheme expected to be operating in 1,000 secondary schools
within two years .
Tens of thousands of pounds are being spent on prizes to cajole pupils to turn up on time to lessons and behave when they get there .
Youngsters collect Vivo points as if they were shopping at a supermarket or making regular flights and trade them for desirable gifts from an online catalogue .
Truants and classroom troublemakers can get in on the act simply by demonstrating improvements in attendance or behaviour .
Children can earn a PlayStation by performing well in school
Schools taking part in the scheme insist that gold stars , house points and traditional incentives no longer influence children ’s behaviour .
But critics claim the prizes amount to ‘ bribes ’ and encourage pupils to play the system rather than learning the true value of turning up and working hard .
Children are being led to expect prizes for good behaviour that would previously have been considered the norm , it was claimed .
A school which is spending £ 15,000 on prizes had to fight objections from one of its own pupils that it was ‘ paying students to learn ’ .
The scheme is already operating at half a dozen secondary schools and the outfit behind it – Vivo Miles , a link - up between a teacher and technology experts – has been
inundated with inquiries .
At least 200 secondary schools are expected to be operating it by September next year and 1,000 by the end of that academic year .
A version designed for primary schools
is also in the pipeline .
Pupils are given an online account , which allows them to check how many Vivos they have been awarded , and a credit - style card they can use to access their accounts at special kiosks .
Some schools allow staff to punish pupils by removing Vivos from their account .
Schools typically spend between £ 2 and £ 20 per pupil a year to take part in the scheme .
Rod Boswell , assistant vice - principal at Westminster Academy and a key player in developing Vivo Miles , said : ‘ Schools have always had awards . ’
His school spends
£ 3,000 to £ 4,000 a year on prizes .
Barnfield South Academy , in Luton , spends £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 a year on prizes .
Principal Patrick Hannaway said : ‘ One member of the student council was concerned
about “ paying students to learn ” ; the debate was launched , the arguments were had .
‘ An overwhelming majority of learners , parents , carers and staff accepted that this platform simply reflected real life and prepared young people for associating the ideas of “ lifelong learning ” with “ achieving and maintaining economic well - being ” . ’
But Anastasia de Waal of think - tank Civitas , said : ‘ The whole point of going to school is to come out better educated with more opportunities – pupils need to recognise
that in itself is valuable . ’
A report for the National Union of Teachers found ‘ little sign ’ reward systems led to improvements in pupil behaviour .
According to the programme Joseph Goebbels , leader of the Nazi Party 's propaganda unit , realised the potential of the visual image : " The advantage of a visual image over the audible broadcast is the audible becomes a visual image with the help of an individual 's imagination , which can't be kept under control .
Regardless , each will always see his own . "
If drugs can safely give your brain a boost , why not take them ?
And if you do n't want to , why stop others ?
In an era when attention - disorder drugs are regularly — and illegally — being used for off - label purposes by people seeking a better grade or year - end job review , these are timely ethical questions .
The latest answer comes from Nature , where seven prominent ethicists and neuroscientists recently published a paper entitled , " Towards a responsible use of cognitive - enhancing drugs by the healthy . "
In short : Legalize 'em .
" Mentally competent adults , " they write , " should be able to engage in cognitive enhancement using drugs . "
Roughly seven percent of all college students , and up to 20 percent of scientists , have already used Ritalin or Adderall — originally intended to treat attention - deficit disorders — to improve their mental performance .
Some people argue that chemical cognition - enhancement is a form of cheating .
Others say that it 's unnatural .
The * Nature * authors counter these charges : Brain boosters are only cheating , they say , if prohibited by the rules — which need not be the case .
As for the drugs being unnatural , the authors argue , they 're no more unnatural than medicine , education and housing .
In many ways , the arguments are compelling .
Nobody rejects pasteurized milk or dental anesthesia or central heating because it 's unnatural .
And whether a brain is altered by drugs , education or healthy eating , it 's being altered at the same neurobiological level .
Making moral distinctions between them is arbitrary .
But if a few people use cognition - enhancing drugs , might everyone else be forced to follow , whether they want to or not ?
If enough people improve their performance , then improvement becomes the status quo .
Brain - boosting drug use could become a basic job requirement .
Ritalin and Adderall , now ubiquitous as academic pick - me-ups , are merely the first generation of brain boosters .
Next up is Provigil , a " wakefulness promoting agent " that lets people go for days without sleep , and improves memory to boot .
More powerful drugs will follow .
As the Nature authors write , " cognitive enhancements affect the most complex and important human organ and the risk of unintended side effects is therefore both high and consequential . "
But even if their safety could be assured , what happens when workers are expected to be capable of marathon bouts of high - functioning sleeplessness ?
Most people I know already work 50 hours a week and struggle to find time for friends , family and the demands of life .
None wish to become fully robotic in order to keep their jobs .
So I posed the question to
Michael Gazzaniga , a University of California , Santa Barbara , psychobiologist and Nature article co-author .
" It is possible to do all of that now with existing drugs , " he said .
" One has to set their goals and know when to tell their boss to get lost ! "
Which is not , perhaps , the most practical career advice these days .
And University of Pennsylvania neuroethicist Martha Farah , another of the paper 's authors , was a bit less sanguine .
" First the early adopters use the enhancements to get an edge .
Then , as more people adopt them , those who do n't , feel they must just to stay competitive with what is , in effect , a new higher standard , " she said .
Citing the now - normal stresses produced by expectations of round - the - clock worker availability and inhuman powers of multitasking , Farah said , " There is definitely a risk of this dynamic repeating itself with cognition - enhancing drugs . "
But people are already using them , she said .
Some version of this scenario is inevitable — and the solution , she said , is n't to simply say that cognition enhancement is bad .
Instead we should develop better drugs , understand why people use them , promote alternatives and create sensible policies that minimize their harm .
As Gazzaniga also pointed out , " People might stop research on drugs that may well help memory loss in the elderly " — or cognition problems in the young — " because of concerns over misuse or abuse . "
This would certainly be unfortunate collateral damage in the 21st century theater of the War on Drugs — and the question of brain enhancement needs to be seen in the context of this costly and destructive war .
As Schedule II substances , Ritalin and Adderall are legally equivalent in the United States to opium or cocaine .
" These laws , " write the Nature authors , " should be adjusted to avoid making felons out of those who seek to use safe cognitive enhancements . "
After all , according to the law 's letter , seven percent of college students and 20 percent of scientists should have done jail time — this journalist , too .

ELECTRONICS and whitegoods retailers have been accused of using high - pressure tactics and making misleading claims while adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of big - ticket items .
Retail staff receive commissions on the extended warranties they sell , which can top up the manufacturer 's guarantee for up to five years on appliances .
An investigation by Choice found that many of the warranties were unnecessary , overpriced and riddled with exclusions , while the accompanying sales pitches often involved false or misleading claims over the extent of the extra cover offered .

ENTITLEMENT CONFUSION ….
The Bush Doctrine is n’t the only thing Sarah Palin does n’t recognize .
She ’s not up to speed on entitlements , either .
ABC News edited the video a bit , but according to the official transcript released by the network , Gibson asked where a McCain / Palin administration would cut in the federal budget .
Palin responded by explaining why “ veterans ’ programs ” would be “ off the table . ”
Gibson pressed further , asking , “ Do you talk about entitlement reform ?
Is there money you can save in Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid ? ” Palin responded , “ I am sure that there are efficiencies that are going to be found in all of these agencies . ”
Gibson had to break the bad news to Palin : “ The agencies are not involved in entitlements .
Basically , discretionary spending is 18 percent of the budget . ”
Palin responded , “ We have certainly seen excess in agencies , though . ”
Look , I realize Palin is new to this .
She ’s clearly in over her head , she has n’t learned much about the federal government , and two weeks of cram sessions can only prepare her to talk about so much .
That said , Palin is the chief executive of a state , and she ’s accepted a role that might put her one heartbeat from the presidency .
And yet , she does n’t have the foggiest idea what she ’s talking about .
She thinks the Bush Doctrine is the president ’s “ worldview . ”
She thinks entitlement spending can be curbed through “ agency efficiencies . ”
She thinks the problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stem from them becoming “ too expensive to the taxpayers , ” despite the fact that neither were receiving public funds .
These are fairly basic facts that a person who reads a newspaper every day would have some familiarity with .
Put aside the notion of whether candidates for national office should be policy wonks or not , and consider the fact that Sarah Palin apparently does n’t keep up on current events .
She is one of the most popular paintings in the National Gallery , whose rather unfortunate looks inspired illustrations for Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .
But one question has always puzzled : did the poor lady really look like this ?
Today the Guardian can reveal that she did and was suffering from an exceptionally rare form of Paget 's disease - an abnormality of the metabolism that enlarges and deforms the bones .
The portrait , An Old Woman , painted by the Flemish artist Quinten Massys in 1513 , is popularly known as The Ugly Duchess and will be part of the National Gallery 's eagerly awaited exhibition Renaissance Faces : Van Eyck to Titian , which opens next Wednesday .
Curators are particularly excited about this painting because two important discoveries have been made in recent research : firstly , the portrait is truthful and she almost certainly looked like that , and secondly , a long held historical theory that the painter was copying Leonardo da Vinci is wrong .
The medical research shows that she was suffering from an advanced form of Paget 's disease - osteitis deformans - which enlarged her jaw bones , extended her upper lip and pushed up her nose .
It also affected her hands , eye sockets , forehead , chin and collarbones .
" This woman must have been very , very unfortunate , " said Michael Baum , emeritus professor of surgery at University College London who , with his student Christopher Cook , investigated the portrait .
" I 've always been intrigued by this painting .
It 's fascinating because it is so meticulously and lovingly painted .
You think , why would someone go to so much trouble in order to paint such a grotesque image ?
I always suspected there was something more to it than just a study in grotesquery . "
Baum regularly takes medical students on his " National Gallery ward round " and gave Cook the task of proving his Paget 's disease theory .
" He did the most meticulous research , I gave him top marks .
It was a beautiful piece of work , utterly convincing . "
Paget 's disease is named after Sir James Paget , the British surgeon who first described it in the late 19th century , and more commonly affects the lower body such as the pelvis and femur .
When it does affect the skull it is normally just the cranium so the woman - whoever she is - was suffering from a particularly rare form .
" I have certainly never seen a full - blown case like this , " said Baum .
In all probability , the condition would have happened later in life so she may even have been a beauty before the condition set in .
Aside from the effect on her looks , she may have suffered no more than headaches and a damaged pituitary gland , said Baum .
Baum is also convinced that the sitter would have been " a very powerful woman and may even have been a real duchess " .
He said : " I reckon the artist was paid a princely sum to do it because who is going to buy a painting like that ?
Artists had to make a living .
I think the painting is probably quite a close likeness . "
It remains one of Baum 's favourites .
" You either love it or you hate it and I love it , it 's part of the background of London , part of London 's iconography . "
The other research is important in an art historical context .
Experts have often written about how similar the Massys painting is to two Leonardesque drawings that are supposed to reflect a lost original by Leonardo from about 1490 .
The assumption has been that Massys imitated the works but the National Gallery research suggests that this was not the case .
Susan Foister , curator of Renaissance Faces , said : " We can now say with confidence that Leonardo - or , at least , one of his followers - copied Massys 's wonderful painting , not the other way around .
This is a very exciting discovery . "
Foister said they had discovered that Massys made amendments as he went along , suggesting he was making a study from close quarters .
Also , in the two Leonardo copies , the forms of the body and clothes are oversimplified and the woman 's left eye is not in its socket .
" It was always assumed that a lesser known northern European artist would have copied Leonardo and it has not really been thought that it could have been the other way round , " said Foister .
She added that both artists were known to be interested in ugliness and exchanged drawings " but credit for this masterful work belongs to Massys " .
Foister is less convinced that the woman was necessarily a powerful noblewoman but said it could not be ruled out and she welcomed the debate .
" He must have spotted this unfortunate old lady and chose her as the perfect model to paint from the flesh . "
The painting - one of the most popular in the National Gallery , according to Foister - inspired Victorian illustrator John Tenniel to make the Duchess ( the unpredictable , Cheshire Cat- owning baby abuser ) one of the most grotesque characters in his illustrations of the Lewis Carroll classic .
Massys painted The Old Woman as part of a pair .
The other , The Old Man , is being lent to the National Gallery and will hang alongside The Old Woman for the first time in 150 years .
Rather unfairly from the duchess 's point of view , the exhibition will include portraits of some of the prettiest and most porcelain - skinned women painted , including Palma Vecchio's La Bella .
The Ugly Duchess may not have been a beauty but , as Foister points out , " it is a beautiful painting " .

DoJ blocking Obama team from docs on torture , wiretapping Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email This The Justice Department has evaded a request from President - elect Barack Obama 's transition team for documents about the secret programs of U.S. intelligence agencies .
The team asked to " review classified legal opinions related to secret CIA and National Security Agency programs , " but the inquiry has been denied .
Among the information requested are official documents about the " legal rationale " for the secret wiretapping and torture programs conducted by the two agencies .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey addressed the issue with reporters , saying that his department was reluctant to give up the documents without permission from the two agencies involved .
" And so what we try to do is determine whether , and to what extent , we can clear that information and try to do it as quickly as we can so as to get it to the transition team so that they 're aware of all the things that they need when they take over on the 21st , " Mukasey said , according to a transcript provided by the department .
An editorial demanded Friday that Obama fulfill his promise to end torture .
" He can begin to fulfill this pledge by signing an executive order that bans torture and inhuman treatment .
In doing so , he would end the legal double - speak clouding U.S. policy and send a clear message to all Americans that torture and ill - treatment of detainees will not be tolerated . "
A former interrogator wrote in a new book that the US militarys use of torture is responsible for the deaths of thousands of US soldiers by inspiring foreign fighters to kill Americans .
I just ran across this aand thought it would be worth posting as it is of interest .
I. IntroductionAnarcho - primitivists comprise a subculture and political movement that , generally , advocates hunting and gathering as the ideal human subsistence method ( from the point of view of sustainable resource use ) and the band as the ideal human social structure ( for its features of egalitarianism ) .
While the goal may seem improbable , a primitivist would contend that more modest goals are either undesirable or unachievable within the system .
The past 10,000 years have after all been largely a history of “ solutions ” to the problems of an agricultural society .
This critique of “ civilization ” inherently rejects less radical ideals and claims to go uniquely to the heart of all social discontent .
It is multi-faceted , drawing on several traditions of thought .
These include the nineteenth century social speculators , anthropology of hunter - gatherers , situationism , anarchism , radical ( deep ) ecology , and anti-technological philosophy .
The potential problem of implementation is largely solved by a growing consensus that an end to “ economic growth ” is fast approaching , making revolutionary change inevitable .
The direction of that change is the focus of anarcho - primitivist interest .
Anarcho - primitivism is subtly influencing society in several ways .
The Unabomber ’s “ manifesto ” enunciated many of the central tenets of anarcho - primitivism ( e.g. rejection of liberalism and industrialism ) .
Primitivists were among the protesters participating in window - smashing , spray - painting , and other vandalism at the Seattle WTO protests in December 1999 .
They are probably among those elusive “ eco-terrorists ” who carry out property destruction in the name of the Earth Liberation Front .
The popular novel Fight Club ( 1996 ) , which became a feature film , portrayed a group of alienated young men who reject consumerist culture and attempt to bring it to an end through massive sabotage .
While anarcho - primitivism may not seem worthy of much thought or attention because it falls far outside the mainstream of political discourse , it ought not to be dismissed .
It merits substantial attention solely on the basis of its harmonious integration of several historically disparate lines of thought .
II .
AimsThe prefix “ anarcho ” signifies the anarchist rejection of the state in favor of small - scale political structures .
Additionally , as primitivist icon John Zerzan ( 2002:67 - 68 ) explains , “ I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination . ”
So a key distinction must be made between anarcho - primitivists and anarchists generally because , “ [ f ] or example , some Anarchists do n't see the technological imperative as a category of domination .
” In the most general terms , they reject “ civilization ” in favor of “ wildness . ”
More specifically , they call for the abandonment or destruction of industrial ( and possibly agricultural ) technology in favor of subsistence that is not based on the industrial “ forces of production ” — hence , the adoption of the “ primitive ” label .
This means that primitivists reject even forms of production based on collective management and ownership because any production exceeding immediate subsistence needs is seen as incompatible with long - term sustainability .
Derrick Jensen ( 2000:143 ) explains :
Make no mistake , our economic system can do no other than destroy everything it encounters .
That ’s what happens when you convert living beings to cash .
That conversion , from living trees to lumber , schools of cod to fish sticks , and onward to numbers on a ledger , is the central process of our economic system .
III .
Influences and Precedentsa .
Anarcho - primitivism ’s internal coherence lies in its complementary and self - reinforcing synthesis of several previous modes of thought .
The oldest and most pervasive of these is the romantic idea of the noble savage .
This idea , popularized in the eighteenth century by Rousseau ( 2001 ) , has persisted ever since ( recall the Iron Eyes Cody anti-litter advertising campaign ) .
This romanticism was adopted by the nineteenth century transcendentalists like Emerson , Thoreau , and Margaret Fuller ( Pearce 146-150 ) .
However , these early radical thinkers , while admiring of the “ primitives ” and favoring social change , did not seek to emulate their societies :
“ The fact is , ” Thoreau wrote , “ the history of the white man is a history of improvement , that of the red man a history of fixed habits of stagnation . ” ( Pearce 1965:149 ) .
The white man ’s “ history of improvement ” was the focus of another group of speculators , including Comte , Tylor , Powell , Morgan , and Spencer , who advocated unilineal cultural evolution ( Bettinger 1991:1 - 29 ) .
The most prominent of these was Morgan who outlined the progression from savagery to barbarism to civilization .
These stages were defined by increasing technological progress ( originating with stone - age hunter - gatherers ) resulting in a corresponding decrease in reliance on nature and the increasing opportunity for managerial and artistic pursuits ( Bettinger 1991: 4 ) , but only for an elite class .
Although Morgan ’s categories of society roughly correspond to some of those still in use today , the idea of unilineal evolution is of no more than historical interest to anthropologists today , who no longer endorse sweeping generalizations without significant supporting evidence .b.
It was not until the 1960s that the negative stereotype of “ savagery ” was challenged .
In 1966 , the first international conference on hunting and gathering societies ( entitled “ Man the Hunter ” ) was held in Chicago ( Bettinger 1991:48 ) .
The significance of this conference was to overturn the longstanding assumption that hunter - gatherers ’ lives were “ nasty , brutish and short , ” in the enduring words of Thomas Hobbes .
Marshall Sahlins famously made the case in his paper , " Notes on the Original Affluent Society , " which consolidated brand new ethnographic research from Africa and Australia .
He concluded that hunter - gatherers ( of the most mobile sort ) could be characterized as affluent on the basis that their few and simple wants were easily met .
He called this economy the “ Zen way ” ( 1972:29 ) .
Although significant problems with his source data are recognized now , his essay is still commonly assigned in introductory anthropology courses because of a lingering sense that he “ had a point ” ( Bird - David 1992:26 ) .
Since Man the Hunter , there has been no shift in the scholarly literature back toward the negative stereotypes of hunter - gatherers .
( A shift away from stereotypes in general is an obvious trend , however . )
Richard Lee , a co-organizer of the 1966 conference , still publishes work propounding the study of the “ primitive communism ” phenomenon ( Lee 1995 ) .
Participants in this revolution of hunter - gatherer studies certainly were and are aware of the romantic stereotype of the noble savage , and , if only unconsciously , they had brought it up - to - date with modern scholarship , giving it significant credibility .
This primitivist trend attracted many to the study of hunter gatherers , and certainly formed a foundation for the appearance of anarcho - primitivism in the ensuing decades .c .
In a novel critique of modern society that we would now recognize as postmodernism , Guy Debord expressed in The Society of the Spectacle ( 1995 ) the vacuity of life within industrial society in terms of “ the spectacle ” — his term for symbolic representation run amok .
In Thesis 1 he says , “ All that once was directly lived has become mere representation . ” ( 1995:12 ) .
Debord was part of a revolutionary French art movement of the 1960s , Situationism , which rejected the substitution of representation for direct experience .
Like previous art movements had done , Situationsists sought to bridge the divide between art and everyday life .
Primitivist Kevin Tucker ( 2003 ) makes clear that , in the decades since Debord presented his critique , the dominance of his “ spectacle ” has grown exponentially with the development of audio - video recording technology and the internet as mediums of communication ( “ medium ” is a key word here , suggesting “ mediate ” ) that replaces the direct interaction of individuals .
As in the early primitivism of the Transcendentalists , Debord ’s situationism implied a desire for social change , a desire that he makes explicit in a preface to a recent edition ( 1995:10 ) .
The above quotation of Thesis 1 also illustrates Debord ’s primitivism .
In lamenting the loss of a perceived past in which direct experience was universal , he paved the way for anarcho - primitivism , which would paint a clearer picture of that implicit alternative .
Debord and his contemporaries were aware of political movements that had historically exhibited similar critical attitudes to social and political norms ( “ Situationism ” 2002 ) .
Among these was anarchism.d.
Anarchism , also called libertarian socialism , has a long and complicated history beginning in Europe approximately 200 years ago “ in the climate of reason ” that simultaneously gave rise to libertarian and authoritarian socialism ( Bose 1967:77,379 ) .
At the end of the nineteenth century , it was taking hold in the US and Europe among organized laborers .
It was at this time that the stereotype of the bomb - throwing anarchist was born , fueled by events such as the Haymarket Affair ( Bose 1967:253,392 ) .
However this stereotype does injustice to the idealistic motives of anarchists as explicated by its numerous philosophical proponents .
The chaos they are so frequently accused of desiring is arguably the antithesis of their true motives : the widespread ( socially accepted and internalized ) disorder of war , oppression , greed , hunger , depression that stalks hierarchical societies is the object of anarchists ’ assault .
As Howard Zinn ( 1997:644 ) explains , It is these conditions that anarchists have wanted to end : to bring a kind of order to the world for the first time .
We have never listened to them carefully , except through the hearing aids supplied by the guardians of disorder — the national government leaders , whether capitalist or socialist .
The ultimate aim of anarchists is hardly different than that of other idealists throughout history .
But anarchists ’ optimism — their faith in the ability of human beings to voluntarily cooperate with each other — sets them clearly apart from all the others , who unfailingly require some authoritarian class for the maintenance of “ order .
” It was perhaps a lapse in this long - standing faith , stemming from the lost optimism of the 1960s , that led some anarchists in search of a historical basis for their convictions — a search that led back to the origins of the first states — that is , to the beginning of “ civilization ” itself .
These primitivist themes began to appear in anarchist publications in the 1980s , and they explicitly referenced the 1960s anthropology of hunter - gatherers ( e.g. Sahlins 1972 ) ; the egalitarian band structure seemed to exemplify the anarchist solution to social disorder .
The environmental movement also flourished into the 1970s , and this is reflected in the anarchist - leaning fiction of Edward Abbey.e.
Abbey ’s 1975 novel , The Monkey Wrench Gang ( 1976 ) , centered on a small group of radical , mostly young individuals dedicated to sabotaging the infrastructure that allowed for the taming of the “ wilderness ” of the American west .
They are sympathetically portrayed as the underdogs in a country where political power is held by no - good despoilers of nature .
The uncompromising sentiment for “ eco-defense ” ( a novel concept itself ) expressed by Abbey reflected a radical environmental ethic that was totally new and would become known as “ deep ecology . ”
This ethic is summed - up well by its recognized founder , Arne Næss : “ The flourishing of human and non -human life on Earth has intrinsic value .
The value of non -human life forms is independent of the usefulness these may have for narrow human purposes . ” ( 1999 ) It was in this context of Abbey ’s advocacy of “ monkey wrenching ” and Næss ’s eco-philosophy that the name “ Earth First ! ” was given in 1989 to a new movement dedicated to defending the natural world by any means necessary ( “ About Earth First ! ” n.d. ; “ Earth First ” 2005 ) .
Derrick Jensen ( 2000:188 ) expresses “ the central question ” that environmental activists face : “ What are sane and appropriate responses to insanely destructive behavior ? ”
He continues , “ So often environmentalists … are capable of plainly describing the problems … , yet when faced with the emotionally daunting task of fashioning a response … , we generally suffer a failure of nerve and imagination . ”
Earth First !
reflected the first attempt to overcome this failure of nerve , but the challenge drove others to take more extreme measures .
The large - scale property destruction ( glorified in Edward Abbey ’s novels ) of the Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) was one response to the ineffective “ reformist ” measures taken by many activists .
The first actions claimed by the ELF occurred during the 1990s in the UK and US .
Examples include the 1998 arson of the Vail Mountain ski resort , the 2003 arson of a San Diego condominium construction site , and multiple examples of vandalism at car dealerships , particularly of sport utility vehicles ( “ Earth Liberation Front ” 2005 ) .
The radical environmental movement was compatible with primitivist ideas , as the popular portrayal of Indians as ecologists demonstrates .
“ Primitive ” people , especially mobile hunter - gatherers , are directly dependent on the land for their subsistence and , presumably , have a more “ ecocentric ” worldview than is possible in modern industrial society .
There has been some dispute over this point in recent years from scholars who seem “ intent on demonstrating that it is ‘ human nature ’ to be environmentally destructive ” ( Hunn 2002 ) .
Eugene Hunn attempts to put the debate into perspective concluding , “ by the excellent condition of the continent when the first Europeans arrived , ” that Native Americans had done something right .
He continues , That the continent was not ‘ pristine wilderness ’ is undeniable , since it had long been home to millions of Indian peoples .
That Indian peoples had cared well for this land , had conserved its biodiversity , is also undeniable .
To dispute the reality of ‘ The Ecological Indian ’ … is to blind us to the damage done since , in the name of progress and of profit .
Thus , environmental problems came to be seen as a symptom of the far larger problem of “ civilization , ” which has demonstrated unconcern for any limits to “ growth ” to the detriment of the natural world .
One individual responding to some of the same concerns with a more anti-technological focus was Theodore Kaczynski , widely known as “ the Unabomber . ” f .
A 34,000 - word paper entitled “ Industrial Society and Its Future ” was published in September 1995 by the Washington Post .
The Post was complying with an anonymous offer from the “ Unabomber ” to stop his 17 - year bombing campaign in exchange for the publication of his revolutionary treatise .
Sixteen mailed bombs were sent by Kaczynski , resulting in the deaths of three and injuring 23 more ( Goldberg 1996 ) .
The “ manifesto , ” as the media called it , decries the ever - increasing dominance of technology within modern society .
It calls for a revolution , not against political structures , but against “ the economic and technological basis of the present society ” ( Kaczynski 2003:3 ) .
This tendency to aggressively challenge technological innovation can be traced back to early eighteenth - century England when advances in textile manufacturing technology threatened to make obsolete centuries of tradition .
These detractors of technology , popularly called Luddites , from 1811 to 1812 sabotaged this new machinery creating an uproar in English society ( Sale 1995a ) .
Their name derives from the mythological figure , Ned Ludd , whose name served as a pseudonym in their letters of threat of and explanation for their vandalism ( Sale 1995a:77-78 ) .
Modern philosophers including Jacques Ellul , Lewis Mumford , and Chellis Glendinning — so - called neo-Luddites ( Sale 1995a:237-240 ) — continue to promote the skepticism toward “ progress ” that has surely existed as long as technological innovation itself .
The difference between neo-Luddites and their predecessors is that , in the nineteenth century , new technologies were only a social threat , whereas today technology threatens the biological systems that form the basis of human existence ( Sale 1995a:266-267 ) .
Kaczynski’s text is very clearly informed by neo -Luddite thought , although he does not cite the influence of any previous thinkers within it ( Sale 1995b:305 ) .
Elsewhere he has said , “ Technology , above all else , is responsible for the current condition of the world and will control its future development . ”
The ideology of the Luddites and their modern counterparts provides a crucial pillar of anarcho- primitivism .g.
A final pillar supporting the primitivist ethos demonstrates the unsustainability of industrial society .
This body of work refutes those arguments that claim science will provide the solutions necessary to sustain current First World living standards in the face of massive resource degradation and depletion .
It also provides anarcho - primitivists a safe , simple answer to the challenge , “ How are you going to get there ? ”
The 1972 book , Limits to Growth ( LTG ) , was the first systematic assessment of the sustainability of modern society .
More than a decade of environmentalism still had not popularly integrated ubiquitous environmental problems into a coherent message for public consumption .
Earlier works like Erlich ’s The Population Bomb and Carson ’s Silent Spring had focused on specific bite - sized issues .
LTG offered a satisfying , yet disturbing complete picture .
It was the product of a research project commissioned by the Club of Rome , an international , informal group of “ businessmen , statesmen , and scientists ” ( Meadows , et. al. 2004 : ix ) who wanted an assessment of the sustainability of the overall course of human society .
The final report predicted that unless widespread measures were taken to reduce consumption and pollution sufficiently early , human society would overshoot global carrying capacity and ultimately face a collapse , defined as “ an uncontrolled decline in both population and human welfare ” ( Meadows , et. al. 2004 : xi ) .
The research group reached this conclusion through the use of a computer model which was able to factor in multiple variables and the interaction between them .
LTG was the first attempt to present the environmental crisis as a whole and show that it required a systematic response ( Kassiola 1990:17 ) .
Resource shortages have become a serious concern in recent years among limits - to - growth theorists .
By far , the most popular and far - reaching of the theories of resource depletion concerns petroleum .
“ Peak oil ” refers to the point at which total oil extraction ( in a particular oil - field , a region , or the planet ) reaches its highest point along the slope of a bell curve .
From that moment on , supply begins to drop while demand persists .
This phenomenon has been observed for decades , but the global economy has been able to sufficiently redistribute oil to regions where the supply has long been exhausted ( e.g. Texas ) .
The consequences of the global peak of oil extraction are only recently being considered : when global supply is unable to meet global demand , oil ’s market value will begin rising ever - faster .
Anything and everything that depends on oil ( try imagining some aspect of out society that does not ) will become increasingly expensive , and eventually industrial society will grind to a halt .
It must be added , few if any of the scholars who promote limits - to - growth critiques are excited about the end of “ civilization ” they foresee ( most hope to avert it ) , but , for an anarcho - primitivist , their scenarios provide a near - panacea .
The seven influences outlined above are by no means universally recognized among all anarcho - primitivists , but they are clearly visible throughout the available “ anti-civilization ” literature .
The key writers , including John Zerzan , Derrick Jensen , and Daniel Quinn , all come from different backgrounds — the labor movement , the environmental movement , or entirely non-political — but they each synthesize elements of the above influences and add their own unique contributions .
IV . SynthesisJohn Zerzan ( 1994,2002 ) adds the most academic voice to the chorus .
While his writing style is the least accessible , his critique is by far the deepest .
He seeks the root of all domination , and this path leads him deeper into prehistory than even the origins of agriculture .
Art , language , number , time , and even symbolic thought have been subjects of Zerzan ’s interrogation .
For him , each of those serves to mediate humans from the direct experience of the world that Guy Debord elegized .
Daniel Quinn ’s Ishmael ( 1995 ) , is undoubtedly the most widely read book questioning the basis of civilization .
It is a novel that revolves around a Socratic - style dialogue in which the reader learns how civilization came to be and what humanity has forgotten as a result .
Derrick Jensen provides a uniquely psychological analysis of modern civilization , drawing on the work of R. D. Laing and Erich Fromm .
He uses his own experience of child abuse to show how the same types of relationships are manifested on a larger scale throughout society ( 2000 ) .
He also assesses the psychology of hate groups in terms of its relationship the dominant culture ( 2002 ) .
All of these individuals agree that civilization was a mistake that has had disastrous consequences for human and non-human life , and it will continue to wreak havoc until people decide to stop it or until it collapses under it own weight .
After one of these events occurs , the planet will finally be able to begin recovering from 10,000 years of human domestication .
Picture yourself planting radishes and seed potatoes on the fifteenth green of a forgotten golf course .
You 'll hunt elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center , and dig clams next to the skeleton of the Space Needle leaning at a forty - five degree angle .
We 'll paint the skyscrapers with huge totem faces and goblin tikis , and every evening what 's left of mankind will retreat to empty zoos and lock itself in cages as protection against the bears and big cats and wolves that pace and watch us from outside the cage bars at night ....[ Y] ou 'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life , and you 'll climb the wrist - thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower ....
[ T ] he air will be so clean you 'll see tiny figures pounding corn and laying strips of venison to dry in the empty car pool lane of an abandoned superhighway stretching eight - lanes - wide and August - hot for a thousand miles .
( Palaniuk 1996:124-125 ) The above quotation from the popular novel Fight Club is a vivid description ( some might say caricature ) of a world in which industrial civilization has been survived by the kinds of small - scale societies to which anarcho - primitivists aspire .
There are two modes of thought on how people can affect this outcome .
The first , advocated by Daniel Quinn ( 2000 ) , is that it can only be accomplished through the dissemination of a new “ vision ” through society , which will inevitably result in the radical transformation of civilization necessary to end the destruction of the natural world .
Quinn feels that without first “ changing minds ” all other efforts will be fruitless .
However , this strategy has been criticized for a lack of urgency .
Derrick Jensen ( 2000:182 ) conveys this urgency well :
Many perceive the pain of denuded forests and extirpated salmon directly in their bodies : part of their personal identities includes their habitat — their human and nonhuman surroundings .
Thus they are not working to save something out there , but responding in defense of their own lives .
This is not dissimilar to the protection of one ’s family : why does a mother grizzly bear charge a train to protect her cubs , and why does a mother human fiercely fight to defend her own ?
” The more common response among primitivists reflects this urgency and calls for direct action that will bring an end to the destruction wrought by industrial technology as quickly as possible .
A legitimate objection to destruction of the infrastructure of industrial society is that it would inevitably lead to the deaths of millions .
Aside from the high probability that such a scenario will eventually occur , if current trends continue , without any help from saboteurs ( Meadows , et. al. 2004 ) and that the sooner that catastrophe occurs the less “ disastrous the results … will be ” ( Kaczynski 2003:3 ) , an anarcho - primitivist would argue that such objections exhibit naïveté about the reality of technological progress .
You ca n't get rid of the " bad " parts of technology and retain only the " good " parts .
Take modern medicine , for example .
Progress in medical science depends on progress in chemistry , physics , biology , computer science and other fields .
Advanced medical treatments require expensive , high - tech equipment that can be made available only by a technologically progressive , economically rich society .
Clearly you can't have much progress in medicine without the whole technological system and everything that goes with it .
( Kaczynski 2003:121 )
The increasing incidence of cancer is probably the most ironic consequence of this “ progress . ”
In terms of the human health that modern medicine ostensibly improves , the cancer epidemic provides a striking wake - up call to advocates of medical technology .
It generally agreed that cancer is a disease caused primarily by the lifestyle of Western Civilization ( Moss n.d. ; Ransom 2002 ) .
All the same , life expectancy has increased in the last 100 years ( “ Life Expectancy ” n.d. ; Stobbe 2005 ) .
This begs the question of which is more important , quantity or quality of life .
The consequences of modern technology are certainly far greater for nonhumans , as they are not its intended beneficiaries .
The present global rate of extinction is estimated between 100 and 1000 times the ( normal ) background rate ( Levin and Levin 2002 ) .
As a result of large - scale logging , less than two percent of U.S. forests were more than 200 years old in 1997 ( “ U.S. Forestland ” n.d. ) .
Every introductory environmental science textbook describes in detail the seemingly endless atrocities perpetrated against the natural world .
Fisheries are being harvested at rates far in excess of the maxim sustainable yield .
The same chemicals responsible for the human cancer epidemic transform diverse productive land and water habitats into barren waste dumps .
Anarcho - primitivism seeks a return to a wild life free from the culture that seems to be doing its best to destroy the planet , a life that humanity successfully realized for nearly all of our time on this planet ( Rosman and Rubel 2004:181 ) .
What this entails in the modern context is a small scale society that is independent from the global industrial economy , but said society would also not be restricted by the modern constraints of property and imaginary borders .
It would be self - sufficient , subsisting successfully on the local land as well as any scraps which civilization ( or what is left of it ) provides .
It would lack the desire to control or subdue the life forms upon which it depended .
But most importantly , such a community would have a visceral sense of and relationship to a physical place .
V. ProspectsMuch of the anarcho - primitivist community is restricted to the pages of anarchist magazines and websites .
This is community in a very loose , virtual sense , but in the modern context this form of “ community ” is almost surely a prerequisite of any new zeitgeist .
These are real individuals writing , reading , and thinking about anarcho - primitivism across the world , and their common interest connects them .
This “ community ” is only significant insofar as it has the potential to lead to face - to - face interaction , however .
There are some signs of actual emerging communities which advocate and apply ( to an extent ) the principles of an anarcho - primitivist philosophy .
The first large - scale secular movement that exhibited some “ primitivist ” themes was the outbreak of communes during the late 1960s ( Houriet 1971 ) .
The hippie subculture idolized the Native American cultures of the southwest like the Pueblo , Hopi , and Zuni ( 1971:198 ) .
Synonymously called the “ back to the land ” movement , these intentional communities emphasized that the land was true basis for the economy ( 1971:153 , 181 ) .
The hippies advanced few of the philosophical and none of the empirical arguments that have become available in the last 35 years as justification for a non-civilized life , and their communities have all but disintegrated .
In the early 1980s , the various threads of primitivism began to cohere into the independent worldview outlined above .
Today there are a few groups of people who actively seek out community that approximates ( as closely as is feasible ) an anarcho - primitivist alternative .
Most loosely connected to anarcho - primitivism are so - called primitive skills gatherings , at which attendees camp in an undeveloped area and learn a few skills of self - sufficient survival including bow and arrow making , friction fire - starting , edible wild plant identification , animal tracking , and shelter construction ( “ Primitive Skills ” n.d. ) .
For some , the interest in these meetings may be more hobby - oriented than ideological , but the skills they teach would be of definite use where the necessities of life are not provided by a global industrial economy .
Wildroots is the name of a self - described “ radical homestead ” in North Carolina .
One resident participated in a brief interview ( Anon. 2005 ) providing the following information .
It began with only two individuals and the population has since doubled .
Two are from the “ upper middle class , ” one from the “ middle class , and the other from the “ working class . ”
Visitors are welcome and typically stay for a few weeks in the spring and summer .
“ There are n't really rules , except that if anyone new wanted to live there long - term and build a dwelling , the four of us would all have to agree on that . ”
There are also no “ economic limits to ‘ membership ’ . ”
The group lives on 30 - acres of lush land which is owned outright .
All of the members have spent time at larger intentional communities , and one member has lived at one .
“ We are pretty heavily influenced by many of the same ideas even if we have n’t all read the same books .
Many of us are into Chellis Glendinning and Derrick Jensen . ”
Clearly , Wildroots is philosophically rooted in anarcho - primitivism .
The resident said that Wildroots was not the only attempt at a primitive community and cited two examples in Washington state ( “ the Institute for Applied Piracy and the Feral Farm ” ) .
It should be clear , by now , that there is a reasonably solid canon of anarcho - primitivist philosophy available , which provides the seeds for what could potentially blossom into a movement .
Several periodicals ( Green Anarchy , Species Traitor , Green Anarchist , Fifth Estate , Live Wild or Die , The Final Days , Green Journal , Disorderly Conduct , Cracks in the Empire , Do or Die , and Quick ! ) are dedicated to anarcho - primitivist theory , and the most widely circulated American anarchist magazine , Anarchy : A Journal of Desire Armed , frequently features primitivist viewpoints ( Zerzan 2002:3 ) .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation apparently sees the potential of a radical environmental movement , since it has deemed eco-terrorism the number one domestic terrorist threat .
The small communities currently in existence may represent the budding of this movement or they may not .
In either case , the arguments in favor of anarcho - primitivism should be evaluated openly by mainstream society because , if its claims are valid , their implications are immediate and uncommonly far - reaching .

A key issue facing the new Obama administration is to what extent the economic stimulus should take the form of spending increases versus tax reduction .
One way to think about the issue is the size of the fiscal policy multipliers .
The multipliers measure bang for the buck -- the amount of short - run GDP expansion one gets from a dollar of spending hikes or tax cuts .
So what are these multipliers ?
In their new blog , Bob Hall and Susan Woodward look at spending increases from World War II and the Korean War and conclude that the government spending multiplier is about one : A dollar of government spending raises GDP by about a dollar .
Similarly , the results in Valerie Ramey 's research suggest a government spending multiplier of about 1.4 .
( Valerie does not present her results in multiplier form , but she emails me this translation : " The right column of figure 5A of my paper shows that for a log change of government spending of 1 , log GDP rises by 0.28 , implying an elasticity of 0.28 .
To back out the implied multiplier , we can use the fact that government spending averages around 20 % of GDP .
This implies a multiplier of 1.4 . " )
By contrast , recent research by Christina Romer and David Romer looks at tax changes and concludes that the tax multiplier is about three : A dollar of tax cuts raises GDP by about three dollars .
The puzzle is that , taken together , these findings are inconsistent with the conventional Keynesian model .
According to that model , taught even in my favorite textbook , spending multipliers necessarily exceed tax multipliers .
How can these empirical results be reconciled ?
One hypothesis is that that compared with spending increases , tax cuts produce a bigger boost in investment demand .
This might work through changing relative prices in a direction favorable to capital investment -- a mechanism absent in the textbook Keynesian model .
Suppose , for example , that tax cuts are not lump - sum but instead take the form of cuts in payroll taxes ( as suggested by Bils and Klenow ) .
This tax cut would reduce the cost of labor and , if labor and capital are complements , increase the demand for capital goods .
Thus , the tax cut stimulates demand not only by increasing disposable income and consumption spending ( the textbook Keynesian channel ) but also by incentivizing more investment spending .
A similar result might obtain if the tax cut included , say , an investment tax credit .
This hypothesized channel seems broadly consistent with the empirical findings of Blanchard and Perotti Alesina and Ardagna , and Alesina , Ardagna , Perotti , and Schiantarelli .
The results of all these authors suggest you need to go beyond the standard Keynesian model to understand the short - run effects of fiscal policy .
My advice to Team Obama :
Do not be intellectually bound by the textbook Keynesian model .
Be prepared to recognize that the world is vastly more complicated than the one we describe in ec 10 .
In particular , empirical studies that do not impose the restrictions of Keynesian theory suggest that you might get more bang for the buck with tax cuts than spending hikes .
Naked man dies after 4 taser shocks David Edwards

This A naked man wandering around an apartment complex near Houston , Texas died after police shocked him with a taser four times .
Texas ' KPRC reports , " A naked man who banged on doors and cars at a north Harris County apartment complex died after he was shocked by a Taser gun , deputies told KPRC Local 2 .
An autopsy will determine the cause of the man 's death . "
The article continues , " The deputies involved have been put on administrative duty pending the outcome of investigations by the internal affairs and homicide divisions . "
The Houston Chronicle provides the police account of what transpired : " The resident ' did not know who he was , ' said Lt. John Legg of the Sheriff 's Office .
The first deputy arrived within minutes .
' He was immediately confronted by the suspect , who ran toward his patrol car , opened the front passenger door and climbed in , ' Legg said . "
The Houston Chronicle story continues , " The deputy ordered the man out , but the man ignored his commands , yelling and flailing his arms , Legg said .
' He was incoherent , ' the lieutenant said .
' The deputy said his eyes appeared glassed over . '
The deputy 's Taser had little , if any , effect , officials said .
After the man got out of the patrol car and pulled out the stun gun 's prongs , the deputy fired it again while struggling with the man , officials said .
Another deputy arrived and ordered the naked man to back away , then used his Taser , investigators said . "
Earlier this year , members of the NYPD 's Emergency Unit tasered an emotionally disturbed man who was waving a fluorescent light while standing naked on a a building ledge , who then fell over ten feet to his death .
The tasering " violated departmental guideline , " but no charges were brought against the officers involved .
Not long after , the NYPD lieutenant who ordered the tasering committed suicide .
" Torturing and killing the mentally ill with tasers is becoming commonplace , " Hullabaloo 's Digby blogs , " There must be a better way . "
Tasers have have killed more than 400 people in the United States and Canada since 2001 , according to a recent study .
" Taser International , based in Arizona , dismissed the study as flawed , " Nick Juliano recently reported for Raw Story .
" The company maintains that its weapons are safe . "

Decisions in this vital swing state are made in two different realities , one adherent to facts and science , the other rooted in conspiracies and political dogma .
Smokers in the United States have been given the go ahead to sue tobacco companies for their allegedly deceptive marketing of light cigarettes .
The US Supreme Court has ruled that smokers may use state consumer protection laws to sue cigarette makers for the way they promote " light " and " low tar " brands .
The tobacco companies had argued that the lawsuits were barred by federal cigarette labelling laws , which forbids states from regulating cigarette advertising .
But in a five - to - four decision , the court ruled that tobacco firms could be sued under state law .
The case that went to the Supreme Court involves three smokers from the north - east state of Maine , who puffed on cigarettes for 15 years .
They have been arguing that they have a right under state law to sue the companies for deceiving them that light cigarettes were healthier .
Do you find that Planet Of The Apes , its four movie sequels , movie remake , TV series , cartoon show and books have n’t left you satisfied ?
Do you often get irritated because , even though you could literally drown in all the different versions of Planet Of The Apes that have been made over the years , nobody ’s ever bothered to tell you what happened on the planet almost 2,000 years before the events of the original movie ?
If you do , we have two pieces of advice for you – 1 ) hold onto your hat , because Fox is apparently very close to starting production on that exact Planet Of The Apes prequel , entitled Genesis : Apes , set 1,969 years before the original movie , and 2 ) stop wasting your life , you friendless nincompoop .
Aside from inexplicably continuing to give Vin Diesel work , Hollywood loves nothing more than overloading a hot trend until its wheels fall off .
And the hottest trend of the moment would appear to be the utterly needless prequel .
Looking at the production schedules , we can see that there ’s a Wolverine prequel coming out soon , plus a Star Trek prequel , the prequel to Lord Of The Rings and a Terminator movie that ’s a sort of prequel but not really .
But that ’s nothing , because there ’s a Planet Of The Apes prequel coming out , and if you judge a prequel ’s quality on the space of time between the setting of the prequel and the original , then it ’s going to be the best prequel ever made .
The original Planet Of The Apes was set in the year 3978 , but if you want to trace back to the exact moment which set off the chain of events that ended up with Charlton Heston wailing around on his knees like a sandy bellend , you need to go back 1,969 years to – oh , this is a coincidence – 2009 .
That ’s apparently the plot of new Planet Of The Apes prequel Genesis : Apes .
And to prove we ’re not making any of this up , here ’s a quote about it from Fox ’s Tom Rothman , as found on CHUD :
We are very close at Fox on a new Apes script - this one a kind of prequel story before the first story , with a return to the social thematics that mark the first one , but with an entirely contemporary setting – Earth 2009 .
So , just to make this clear , the new Planet Of The Apes sequel wo n’t be set on the ape planet as we know it , nor will it feature very many clever monkeys .
Maybe there ’ll be a chimpanzee with a metal colander on its head who can talk through a machine , but apart from that there ’ll be a bunch of grumpy humans listening to Katy Perry and not much else .
Who knows why Planet Of The Apes is getting this prequel .
Maybe it ’s because strong sales of Planet Of The Apes DVDs proves that demand for the new movie is there .
Or maybe someone at Fox is friends with Tim Burton and deliberately wants to make a Planet Of The Apes movie that ’ll make Tim ’s 2001 remake look less crap in comparison .
Or maybe people just think they ’ll get rich if they cynically knock out a massively unnecessary Planet Of The Apes prequel without putting much thought in .
Let ’s hope the last one is n’t the case , because if Genesis :
Apes is successful then we ’re going to be overloaded with prequels set thousands of years before the original .
And a trend that logically concludes with a Four Christmases prequel where Vince Vaughn ‘s great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather hits Reese Witherpoon ‘s great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandmother over the head with a club and then insincerely marvels at the invention of fire is not a good trend at all .

ORLANDO , Florida ( CNN ) --
Authorities cordoned off the home of missing toddler Caylee Anthony 's grandparents on Thursday , hours after the remains of a small child were found nearby .
Investigators have sealed off the Anthony home , which shows a large Caylee poster .
The sheriff 's office in Orange County , Florida , said it is seeking a warrant to search the home of George and Cindy Anthony .
Sheriff Kevin Beary said the home has been secured " pending more investigation . "
The house has the " possibility of being more of a crime scene later , " he added .
A child 's skull was found at about 9:30 a.m. by a utility meter reader who alerted authorities , sheriff 's spokesman Jim Solomons said .
Investigators , including those from the Anthony case , rushed to the scene , he added .
Watch investigators swarm the scene »
CNN affiliate WFTV reported that the meter reader picked up a plastic bag at the site and a skull fell out .
The remains have been removed by the medical examiner and will be sent to the FBI lab at Quantico , Virginia , Sheriff Beary said .
The agency has told its lab analysts that the case is top priority , Beary added .
" If they have to work through the weekend , they 'll work through the weekend . "
" Bottom line , it 's real simple , folks , " Beary said .
" We 've recovered this human skull , it appears to be that of a small child , and now the investigation continues .
We 've got a lot of lab work to do , a lot of DNA work to do , a lot of crime scene work to do .
We could be here all night . "
Watch the sheriff talk about what needs to be done »
Prosecutors have asked police not to disclose many details surrounding the discovery , Beary said .
Caylee Anthony , 3 , has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention .
Casey
Anthony , the child 's 22 - year - old mother , was charged last month with murder and other offenses .
She is being held at the Orange County Jail .
The area where the remains were found had been searched as part of the investigation into Caylee 's disappearance , he said .
But the precise spot where a county meter reader found them -- " 45 , 50 , 60 feet back " from the street -- was flooded at the time of the search .
No clothes were found with the remains , Beary said .
Asked whether the remains could belong to another child , Beary said , " Not that we know of , but that 's always a possibility , and that 's why we 've got a lot of work to do on this case still . "
Earlier , authorities said the Anthony family had been notified of the discovery .
The remains were found " in very close proximity " to the Anthony home , Solomons said .

An attorney for Casey Anthony filed legal papers Thursday afternoon seeking a court order to preserve all evidence collected , and to permit the defense to conduct its own forensic testing .
A hearing has been scheduled for Friday morning .
In a court hearing earlier Thursday , 9th Circuit Judge Stan Strickland postponed Casey Anthony 's trial at the request of defense attorney Jose Baez .
The attorney said he had not received all the evidence due him from prosecutors and was not ready to proceed with the January 5 trial .
Baez asked Strickland whether the trial could be delayed until March .
The judge scheduled a hearing January 15 to consider a new trial date as well as a possible change of venue .
Casey Anthony remains in protective custody and has no contact with other inmates , corrections officials said .
" She has been seen by a Corrections Health Services psychologist and her status was reviewed , " officials said in a statement , adding Anthony was under psychological observation -- which is not the same as suicide watch .
Baez arrived at the jail just before noon Thursday and stayed about an hour and a half , officials said .
Prosecutors said this month that they would not seek the death penalty against Casey Anthony .
If convicted of murder , she could be sentenced to life in prison .
Authorities have said Casey Anthony waited about a month before telling her family that Caylee was gone .
Cindy Anthony -- Caylee 's grandmother and Casey Anthony 's mother -- called the Orange County sheriff 's office July 15 , saying her daughter would not tell her where Caylee was .
When questioned , Casey Anthony gave conflicting statements to police , including some that were later disproved , according to hundreds of documents and investigative reports released in the case .
She claimed that she dropped Caylee off with a baby - sitter , but when police checked out her story , they learned that the address Casey Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks .
The woman Casey Anthony named as her baby - sitter told police she did not know her .
Investigators have said that cadaver dogs picked up the scent of death in Anthony 's car , as well as in her parents ' backyard .
They also said air quality tests conducted by the FBI found evidence consistent with human decomposition and chloroform in the car 's trunk .
A neighbor told police Anthony had asked to borrow a shovel .
Also , an analysis of Anthony 's computer found that she had visited Web sites discussing chloroform and had done Internet searches on missing children , according to information released in the case .
" There is n't a motive , and they have n't found a motive , " Cindy Anthony said Wednesday night on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
Watch Cindy
Anthony insist her daughter is innocent »
She added , " They told us they thought it was an accident , and she 's scared and tried to cover it up .
They do n't feel there 's a motive . "
Cindy
Anthony stressed that five searches for the girl 's body have " come up with nothing .
There 's nothing that they have found that , you know , has given them any evidence that Caylee is no longer with us . "
The Anthonys said they believe that the girl is still alive and that someone has her , noting several reports of sightings .
Last month , Strickland denied prosecutors ' request to impose a gag order in Anthony 's case , saying he could not state that continued publicity would pose a threat to her trial or even that a gag order would stem the flood of media attention .
CNN 's John Couwels and " Nancy Grace " producer Natisha Lance contributed to this story .

( CNN ) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reversed plans Wednesday to hold a test vote on an automakers ' bailout bill on Thursday .
Reid had planned to move on legislation that would have taken $ 25 billion from the $ 700 billion already approved for Wall Street and diverted it to the big three automakers .
Filmmaker Michael Moore says the collapse of General Motors could mean the loss of millions of jobs .
CNN 's Larry King talked Wednesday with Michael Moore , a filmmaker with deep ties to the auto industry .
Moore 's father worked for General Motors for 35 years .
In 1989 , Moore became an international figure for his film , " Roger and Me , " which centered on the declining auto industry in his hometown of Flint , Michigan and the ripple effect on the town 's residents .
The following is an edited version of the interview .
Larry King : Michael , was ( the movie ) prophetic ?
Michael Moore :
When I made that film , there were still 50,000 people working at General Motors in Flint .
I mean they had eliminated 30,000 jobs , but there were still some jobs there .
Today , I think there 's less than 12,000 working in the area , so it has devastated Flint .
Flint was one of the first towns to go .
When I made that movie almost 20 years ago , I hoped that the film would be a warning to other cities that this corporation was intent upon removing jobs from this country and taking them to Mexico and Brazil and other places .
When I made that movie that year , General Motors made a profit of over $ 4 billion , and they were still laying off people simply to make a bit more money , the people who helped to build the company , the workers in their hometown of Flint , Michigan , they just forgot about them and took the money and ran .
King :
Since the principle was , ' We 'll have the cars built elsewhere and many of the cars are built elsewhere now , ' what went wrong if they were paying less out of the country to build them ?
Moore :
Well , what really went wrong is that General Motors has had this philosophy from the beginning that what 's good for General Motors is good for the country .
So , their attitude was we 'll build it and you buy it .
We 'll tell you what to buy .
You just buy it .
Eventually , the consumer got smart and said , ' You know what , I 'd like a car that gets a little better gas mileage .
I 'd like a car that 's safer on the road , ' so they started to buy other cars .
General Motors still would n't change .
They still kept building the wrong cars , and more and more people stopped buying them .
Watch how Moore feels about auto bailout »
At a certain point , you know , General Motors lost such a large part of the market share that there probably was a point of no return .
Now , here we are on the verge of this collapse .
If General Motors collapses , then there goes hundreds of thousands of jobs , if not millions of jobs of the ripple effect of this .
King :
And the same is true of Ford and Chrysler ?
Moore : Absolutely .
I 'll tell you , it was hilarious just watching these CEOs there ( Tuesday ) and ( Wednesday ) testifying in Congress , saying that , you know , that the problem was n't theirs , you know , the cars they were building .
It was the financial situation that we 're in now .
Watch automakers get grilled on Capitol Hill »
The problem is the cars they 've been building .
They 've never listened to the consumers .
They 've just gone about it their own wrong way .
I 'll tell you , you know , I 'm of mixed mind about this bailout , Larry , because I do n't think these companies , with these management people , should be given a dime , because that 's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries .
GM is currently building a $ 300 million factory in Russia right now to build SUVs , right outside of St. Petersburg .
That 's where your money 's going to go , no matter what they say .
King :
Why ( do you have ) mixed feelings ?
Moore :
Well , because we can't let all these people lose their jobs because of the bad decisions , the stupid decisions made by the management of these auto companies .
I think what has to happen here is that Congress needs to pass some legislation , and our president - elect needs to do what Roosevelt did .
When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country , Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford , you 're not going to build cars anymore .
You 're going to build airplanes and tanks and guns and the things that we need for this war because we have a national crisis .
General Motors had to do what Roosevelt told them they had to do .
King :
What do you want them to do now ?
Moore : President - Elect Obama has to say to them , yes , we 're going to use this money to save these jobs , but we 're not going to build these gas - guzzling , unsafe vehicles any longer .
We 're going to put the companies into some sort of receivership and we , the government , are going to hold the reigns on these companies .
They 're to build mass transit .
They 're to build hybrid cars .
They 're to build cars that use little or no gasoline .
iReport.com : New emissions standards , other improvements needed
We 're facing a national crisis , not just an economic crisis , but a crisis of the polar ice caps are melting .
There 's only so much oil left under the Earth .
We 're going to run out of that , if not in our children 's time , our grandchildren 's time .
There 's got to be a plan set out to find other ways to transport ourselves in other ways than using fossil fuels .

First comes the gate , a heavy metal barrier that halts visitors ' cars about 100 feet from Clinton Portis ' waterfront condo in Miami .
It 's manned by a security guard who reaches out from behind thick glass to check the ID of each driver and passenger , while high - tech cameras snap pictures of their faces and license plates , before allowing them to pass .
The immaculately groomed grounds of cobblestone and palm trees are fortified with well - disguised cameras by the front door , the loading dock , the concierge desk and the private guest elevator .
After navigating past those , plus a metal door secured with a dead bolt and a wall - mounted computerized alarm system , guests are finally allowed entry into Portis ' sanctuary in the sky .
Enjoying a rare weekend off , the NFL 's second - leading rusher is on his couch , yawning constantly while watching college football .
He 's wearing pajama pants , orange footies and a white T - shirt emblazoned with a picture of friend and departed Skins teammate Sean Taylor .
Favoring a sore left knee , Portis shuffles across his marble floor to show off the views .
To the east , windsurfers ride the glassy waters of the bay .
To the west , Miami 's skyline .
And behind the blinds to the north : another shiny condo tower , where a woman stands on her balcony , peering directly at a startled Portis .
The moment perfectly captures how NFL players feel these days .
On Nov. 26 , 2007 , Taylor was shot by intruders in the bedroom of his Miami home while his girlfriend and 18 - month - old daughter hid under the covers .
The botched robbery attempt was another horrific chapter of a crime wave against pro athletes , one that 's shocked NFL players into a paradigm shift in self - awareness and security .
Yet no matter how closely they protect themselves , many still can't shake the feeling that someone is out there , just beyond the blinds , lurking .
" I do n't think the NFL is gonna ever be the same , " says Portis .
" As a football player , Sean thrived on instilling fear in people on the field .
Then you wake up in the middle of the night , and you hear something rattling around in your house , and in a split second — now the fear is in you . "
You can see the impact of Taylor 's death in the body language of 315 - pound Chiefs rookie Branden Albert as he leaves a club , checking and rechecking his rearview mirror to make sure he is n't being followed .
It 's in the nervous laughter of Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger when he recalls the time a weapon was waved in his face .
It compels Jaguars running back Fred Taylor to use the car with the less showy factory rims when he goes out at night .
It 's in the candid conversations Titans center Kevin Mawae says happen in every locker room around the league .
And it's in the near whisper of Texans cornerback Dunta Robinson as he talks , for the first time publicly , about his own home invasion .
When asked about their fears , players cite the same frightening flashpoints : New Year 's Day 2007 , when Broncos defensive back Darrent Williams was shot and killed outside a Denver nightclub while riding in his limo ; November 2007 , when Taylor was murdered ; June 2008 , when Oakland receiver Javon Walker was robbed and beaten unconscious near the Vegas strip ; and September 2008 , when Jaguars lineman Richard Collier was paralyzed and had to have his leg amputated above the knee after he was shot 14 times in what police say was a retaliatory shooting .
" We are targets , " says Buccaneers corner Ronde Barber .
" We need to be aware of that everywhere we go . "
Violence against athletes is not new , of course , and not isolated to the NFL .
Just last summer in Chicago , NBA players Antoine Walker and Eddy Curry were robbed in their homes .
But more than any other league 's , the culture of the NFL — the wealth , fame , brutality and air of invincibility — makes its players vulnerable .
Broncos security chief Dave Abrams , who was hired full - time shortly after Williams was shot , says the hardest part of his job is convincing players of their own mortality .
To excel at such a violent sport , he explains , they must be fearless ; they think of themselves as the kind of untouchable warrior who would never require the protection of a bodyguard , an alarm system or even a locked door .
The night he was murdered , Sean Taylor had neglected to turn on his home security system , even though his house had been burglarized just nine days earlier .
The NFL is attempting to flip this it - can't - happen - to - me mindset .
The league provides a security consultant to each team , and most teams also have their own head of security .
At his State of the League address before Super Bowl XLII , commissioner Roger Goodell said that players becoming targets was " a big issue . "
" We have to do everything we can to educate our players of the simple things they can do to protect themselves " Goodell said .
Portis has gotten the message .
Security measures that used to be an afterthought are now part of his daily routine .
Alarms that used to go unused are now turned on each night .
Doors are dead - bolted .
Windows are locked .
Others are taking even more drastic steps .
Robinson recently became a gun owner .
Roethlisberger uses bodyguards for public appearances .
Mawae , the NFLPA president , runs background checks on potential babysitters .
Fred Taylor , meanwhile , has equipped his Jacksonville home with every conceivable security apparatus .
" I still do n't think I have enough , " he says .
" Who knows what 's enough ?
I would n't say I 'm safe .
" I do n't know what safe is . "

The inspector general of the Interior Department has found that agency officials often interfered with scientific work in order to limit protections for species at risk of becoming extinct , reviving attention to years of disputes over the Bush administration ’s science policies .
In a report delivered to Congress on Monday , the inspector general , Earl E. Devaney , found serious flaws in the process that led to 15 decisions related to policies on endangered species .
The report suggested that at least some of those decisions might need to be revisited under the Obama administration .
Among the more significant decisions was one reducing the number of streams that would be designated as critical habitat for the endangered bull trout and protected from commercial use .
That rule is already the subject of a lawsuit by environmentalists .

All rights reserved � WITH A 36 - YEAR LAG ( Part 2 of 2 ) The way to resolve the credit crisis : Recapitalize the banks with gold Antal E. Fekete Gold Standard University Live Privatizing profits , socializing losses
The 0.7 trillion dollar bailout plan of Treasury Secretary Paulson must be seen for what it is : a scheme to privatize profits while socializing losses .
The scare tactics with which he was trying to railroad it through Congress has failed and the world is better for it .
The malady has to be diagnosed properly .
I summarize the popular diagnosis in five points .
( 1 ) The bursting of the housing bubble has led to a surge of defaults and foreclosures which has , in turn , led to a plunge in the value of mortgage - backed securities ― assets which are in effect capitalized mortgage payments .
( 2 ) These losses have left many banks short on capital account .
Their problems were compounded by the fact that as their capital ratios were shrinking , rather than reducing their debt exposure they aggressively increased it .
( 3 ) � Leveraging � is the word to describe the deliberate shrinking of capital ratios , i.e. , making smaller capital support a larger amount of risks .
Aggressive leveraging was characteristic of the pre-crisis boom .
( 4 ) When they recovered after the dizzying ride , banks needed a microscope to read their capital ratios and they reacted in a predictable way .
They were unwilling ( unable ? ) to fulfill their mission to provide the credit that the national economy needs for its day - to - day operation .
( 5 ) As a defensive measure financial institutions have been belatedly trying to pay down their debt by selling assets , including mortgage - backed securities , but as they were doing it simultaneously , they drove down asset prices .
This has damaged their balance sheets even more .
A vicious circle is engaged that some call the �paradox of de-leveraging .�
Capital destruction I should hasten to say that I disagree with this popular diagnosis which puts the cart before the horse .
My diagnosis , described in the first part of this article , identifies the destruction of capital as the cause , and the credit crisis as the effect .
The problem goes back to the U.S. government foolish decision to destabilize the interest - rate structure ( and , hence , bond prices ) in 1971 .
As a consequence , long - term interest rates shot up to 16 percent per annum by the early 1980�s , from where they started their long descent that still continues .
Falling interest rates destroy capital as they raise the liquidation - value of debt contracted earlier at higher rates .
By �liquidation value� is meant the sum that will liquidate the debt , should it be necessary to pay it off before maturity .
In a falling interest - rate environment it will take a larger sum to retire the same debt .
Why ?
Because the scheduled stream of interest payments is now capitalized at a lower rate of interest and , therefore , it falls short in liquidating the debt .
This means that , paradoxically , falling interest rates do not alleviate but aggravate the burden of debt .
All observers miss this point as they blithely assume that debt is automatically refinanced at the lower rate .
It is not .
Falling interest rates create a deficiency on capital account since it takes a bigger bite to service existing debt than originally provided for , and the deficit is made up at the expense of capital .
Over - leveraging is not the cause ; it is the effect .
What it shows is that the banks do not pay heed ; they persist in error .
They simply ignore shrinking capital ratios .
This ultimately causes wholesale bankruptcies , leading to the vicious downwards spiral .
The banks should have made provision to compensate for eroding capital as interest rates were falling .
None of them did .
None of them understood the insidious process of capital erosion in the wake of declining interest rates .
They reported losses as profits .
Then they were hit by the negative feedback : capital eroded further .
When the truth dawned upon them , it was already too late .
Interest rates have been falling for the past 28 years .
The liquidation value of outstanding debt has been increasing by leaps and bounds .
It reached the tipping point in February , 2007 as indicated by the unprecedented jump in the price of credit - default swaps .
It revealed that any further decline in the rate of interest would plunge bank capital into negative territory .
At this point capital dissipation stops : there is nothing more left to dissipate .
For the banks , this is sudden death .
No commentator could explain why banks have all run out of capital at the same time , while making obscene profits .
My explanation is simple .
There have been no profits , obscene or otherwise .
The banks were paying out phantom profits in the belief that their capital accounts were in good shape .
They weren�t .
The banks were unaware that the falling interest rate structure has been making inroads on their capital .
Since all banks have been working with microscopic capital ratios as a result of 28 years of capital erosion , the failure of one single bank would trigger the �domino - effect� on the rest .
Why gold ?
This puts the role of gold into high relief .
Had gold been retained as a component of bank capital , credit - default swaps would have never been invented .
Gold is unique among financial assets in that it has no corresponding liability in the balance sheet of others .
Gold is the only financial asset that will survive any consolidation of bank balance sheets , in contrast with paper assets that are subject to annihilation ( e.g. , when the bank is consolidated with its counterparty holding the liability side of that asset ) .
Suppose we consolidate the balance sheets of the global banking system .
Then all assets will be wiped out with the sole exception of gold .
But since the global banking system as it is presently constituted has no gold assets , under any consolidation the banks will be denuded of assets while note and deposit liabilities to the public remain .
This is why the regime of irredeemable currency is susceptible to collapse that could be violent , taking place with lightening speed .
It can also be seen that trying to save banks from collapsing through consolidation , mergers , takeovers , and shotgun marriages is pouring oil on the fire : it accelerates the meltdown of bank capital , rather than retarding it .
Implosion of the derivatives monster
My thesis also explains the explosive growth of the derivatives markets .
First round insurance against decline in the value of bonds in the banks � portfolio can be had by selling bond futures .
Those writing first - round insurance need to cover their assumed risk in the form of second - round insurance , they do so by selling call or buying put options on bond futures .
But those writing second - round insurance also need to cover their risk : they do it in the derivatives market by purchasing credit - default swaps .
The point is that an infinite chain of credit - default swaps is being built on every bond in the banks � portfolio , as shown by the derivatives monster�s more than doubling in size every other year , already having reached the size of one half quadrillion dollars and still counting .
Why is the derivative monster so dangerous ?
Because it is subject to implosion that could destroy an inordinate amount of bank assets .
If the derivatives tower is consolidated , then its value collapses to zero as claims are wiped out by counter - claims .
It is possible that this implosion has already started , but the banks ( and their supervisory agencies ) keep the lid on this information to avoid a world - wide panic .
The earth quakes badly under the foundations of the Derivatives Tower of Babel .
Its toppling may be imminent .
If gold had been retained as a component of the bank capital structure , then there would have been no derivatives monster to fret about .
Those who explain the proliferation of derivatives by the popularity of �dry swaps� , that is to say , swaps created for the sole purpose of speculative profits they promise in view of their ultra - low price - to - reward ratio , are wrong .
All those credit - default swaps were purchased by actual insurers insuring actual risks going with bond ownership , in trying to hedge their own risks .
Recapitalizing banks with gold
The credit crisis could be solved through the recapitalization of banks with gold .
The Treasury should pledge to match subscriptions of new private capital , in gold , at the ratio of two to one .
This means that two gold shares of capital stock subscribed by the private sector ( individuals , firms , and institutions ) shall invite one share of capital stock subscribed by the Treasury .
Gold subscribed by the private sector should be constitutionally guaranteed against capital levy and confiscation .
There is no better use to which Treasury gold can be put which has been foolishly idled for the past 36 years .
What is needed is the mobilization of gold hoarded by the Treasury , as well as of gold hoarded by the private sector .
The trouble is that much of the privately owned gold is in hiding and won�t surface for reasons of lack of confidence in the monetary system .
But as soon as there is a market for the shares of the recapitalized banks , private gold can be coaxed out of hiding and made to participate actively in the great task of rebuilding world credit .
Capital stock of the recapitalized banks would pay dividend , in gold , at the rate of one tenth of one percent per annum to stockholders , exempt of all taxes .
This would make it possible , even for people of modest means , to acquire gold earning a safe return in gold .
The maliciously false propaganda of the past decades that gold is a sterile asset in that it earns no interest is easy to refute .
Gold has been lent and borrowed at interest ( facetiously called the �lease rate� ) without interruption , in spite of its so - called �demonetization� by the government .
In fact , the gold rate of interest is the benchmark on which all other interest rates are still based , after adding a risk - premium reflecting the risk that the monetary unit may lose its gold exchange value .
The tax - exempt feature of dividends has great merits to recommend it , especially if no other exemptions across the economic landscape are granted .
You could look at it as society�s protection of widows and orphans , and other members of society who are unable to fend for themselves in a competitive environment , to live in dignity away from the hurly - burly of the investment world .
What is the use of recapitalizing banks with irredeemable promises to pay ?
It has been tried for the past 36 years ; it doesn�t work .
No chain is stronger than its weakest link
The newly recapitalized banks must offer their old assets for sale to the public , in exchange for the gold shares of capital stock , through competitive auctions .
In this way the true value of the old paper assets can be determined , and whatever can be salvaged will be salvaged .
The market for bank assets , presently frozen , would be made liquid once more .
If a bank wants to retain a part of its old assets in the balance sheet , it must bid for it in the same way as if it were buying from another bank through competitive auction .
If an asset can not be disposed of in this way , then it must be written off .
Any delay in validating bank assets through the sieve of competitive auction will only prolong and deepen the crisis .
The �securitization� of bank assets was an idiotic strategy motivated by the fraudulent idea that in lumping sub - prime assets together with valid assets would somehow impart value to the former , and the marketability of the product would be enhanced .
This , of course , is just a ploy to cheat the buyer .
It is like trying to make a chain containing a weak link stronger by adding any number of strong links .
The weak link must be replaced with a strong one .
No chain can be stronger than its weakest link .
The re-liquefying of bank assets is a first order of business in the present runaway global credit crisis .
We are past the point that the wild - fire can be localized .
Mobilization of gold is the only way .
Save the pension funds !
This crisis is a warning , possibly the last one , that the recapitalization of banks with gold cannot be further postponed without risking the total collapse of the financial system .
If there was some hope that the Treasury might have a contingency plan to mobilize gold in case of a crisis such as this , the Paulson bailout plan has dispelled it .
When the moment for the �break - the - glass� rescue plan has arrived , what did we find behind the broken glass ?
More irredeemable promises to pay , to augment bank capital .
All chaff , no grain .
Global credit collapse would bring enormous hardship in its train for ordinary people who have worked hard and saved hard through a lifetime only to see the fruits of their efforts going up in smoke .
The result could be total social chaos and lawlessness .
At risk are all the insurance companies , pension funds , money market funds .
Also at risk is the taxing power of the government , as a prostrate economy won�t be able to bear the tax burden , but will spawn a grey economy that finds ways to evade taxes .
The rejection by the U.S. House of Representatives of Paulson�s bailout plan can be viewed as a taxpayer revolt .
Is it the first , with more to come ?
Close of Keynes� and Friedman�s system Understandably , it will be hard for policy - makers , academia and media , and the accountants � profession to admit that they have been wrong all along about gold and its essential role in the economic bloodstream and in accounting .
They have fallen victim to the charm of John Maynard Keynes , the prankster who invented the idea that gold was a barbarous relic , and the gold standard was a �contractionist fetter� upon the world economy .
Now we have proof that the blame for the contraction should be assigned , not to the use but to the misuse of gold .
The debt collapse is the burial ground for Keynesianism .
After Keynes was gone , policy - makers , academia and media , and the accountants � profession fell under the spell of another visionary and adventurer talking with a forked tongue , Milton Friedman .
He was fond of posing as a free - market man , but in promoting irredeemable currency he did more than anybody , save Keynes , to destroy the free market .
Friedman promoted the spurious idea that gold is superfluous in the international monetary system as floating foreign exchanges rates can mimic the operation of the gold standard and will balance the trade accounts .
But as the record shows , Friedmanite nostrums have ruined the dollar , as well as the once flourishing and peerless American productive apparatus .
Politicians , academia and media , and the accountants � profession must swallow their pride and get the confession off their chests that their prognostication , policies , and advice about gold have been in error .
If they fail to do this , and continue to block the way of gold to make a return to the economic bloodstream , then their responsibility for the suffering caused by the credit collapse in this country and in the world will be total .
They will be shown as doctrinaire wreckers of human cooperation under the system of division of labor , who muzzled their critics and usurped unlimited power , while paving the way to a world disaster akin to that of the Bolshevik revolution .
After the close of Marx� system , the close of Keynes� and Friedman�s system is inevitable .
But the wounds they have caused would take a long , long time to heal .

" The Netherlands went further in allowing all sorts of liberties than many other countries .
The test is severe .
There is a feeling that our tolerance is the principal cause of many of the problems we experience now .
The debate is about where liberty and tolerance should end and where order should begin . "
DETROIT  Opponents of a Congressional bailout for Detroit auto companies and the United Automobile Workers union traded charges Friday over who was responsible for the defeat of legislation that would have provided temporary financing until the automakers restructured .
Senator Bob Corker , a Republican of Tennessee , suggested the fault lay with the U.A.W. ’s president , Ron Gettelfinger , whose union declined to agree to allow wage concessions in 2009 as part of a deal .
But at a news conference Friday morning , Mr. Gettelfinger said the union feared that it was “ being set up ” by Mr. Corker , who he said was asking the union for concessions that were not sought from other participants in the talks .
Mr. Gettelfinger called on the Treasury and the White House to release financing and “ prevent the imminent collapse of the automakers and the devastating consequences that would follow . ”
Until now , the White House had resisted such a move , but said Friday morning that it would consider using money from the $ 700 billion financial bailout to help the automakers .
The young miner already recognised the sound of dogs as a terrifying harbinger of death but the dull thud of the helicopter blades was something new .
Minutes later a Zimbabwean air force helicopter swept over the hundreds of fleeing illegal diamond miners and mowed down dozens with machine - gun fire .
After that the police arrived and unleashed the dogs that tore into the diggers , killing some and mutilating others .
The police fired teargas to drive the miners out of their shallow tunnels and shot them down as they emerged .
How many died in the assault two weeks ago is not clear but the miners say it was at least scores .
Some bodies remain unclaimed and unidentified in Mutare hospital mortuary .
" First we heard the helicopter and we knew it would n't be good but I thought it would just deliver soldiers , " said the young miner , a former student who gave his name only as Hopewell .
" Then it came over us and started shooting .
There was a man next to me , he had been digging near me , and the bullet went right through his head .
Everyone was in panic .
People ran but they did n't want to leave their finds behind so they were stopping to grab them and getting shot ...
The police were waiting for us with the dogs .
I was lucky .
A dog ran for me but there was this woman , she was slower than me and it attacked her .
I do n't know what happened to her .
I went back to my diggings a few days later but she has n't come back . "
The police and military have for weeks been conducting a bloody campaign , which Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights has described as " resembling a war " , to drive thousands of illegal miners out of a recently discovered diamond field that some in the industry believe might be the richest in years .
The miners say hundreds have died .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change says it has the names of 140 people killed although there is common agreement that many have been buried without a word .
The diamond fields around Chiadzwa , about 20 miles north - west of the town of Mutare in Zimbabwe 's eastern Manicaland province , are a collection of shallow tunnels and open gullies dug out after the discovery of gems close to the surface two years ago set off the rush .
Thousands of illegal diggers moved in - estimates run between 10,000 and 30,000 including foreigners from across southern Africa - spending days or even weeks to discover only tiny diamonds worth no more than a couple of hundred US dollars .
But that is several months ' pay for many Zimbabweans as their country collapses under the weight of hyperinflation .
Many of the miners are professionals , such as teachers and civil servants , who have abandoned jobs that do not pay enough to feed their families .
Others are students who have dropped out of university in the hope of making a quick fortune and subsistence farmers whose land has not produced a crop in years .
And some have got very rich .
Mutare , on the border with Mozambique , has taken on the air of a frontier town filled with brash young men touting US dollars and an air of menace .
The hotels are filled with miners and dealers .
Luxury cars prowl the streets .
Shops have filled with imported goods sold for American dollars and South African rand .
Spend any amount of time in a hotel bar and periodically someone will approach with diamonds for sale .
The governor of Zimbabwe 's central bank , Gideon Gono , has estimated there are more than 500 syndicates handling more than $ 1bn a month in illegally dug diamonds that are swiftly smuggled out of the country .
Now Zimbabwe 's government , or at least members of its discredited ruling elite , are apparently trying to take control .
The military and police have moved in to try to drive the illegal diggers out of plots the miners say are claimed by Grace Mugabe , the president 's wife , and Joice Mujuru , the vice - president .
Both areas are now known by the women 's names .
Legal and opposition political sources in Mutare say the prime mover behind the military assault is the Zimbabwean air force chief , Perence Shiri , the former commander of the notorious Fifth Brigade which massacred about 20,000 people in Matabeleland in the mid-80s .
Shiri oversaw the bloody military campaign of beatings and killings in Manicaland earlier this year that terrorised voters into supporting Robert Mugabe in June 's presidential election .
He sent the helicopter gunships into the diamond fields three weeks ago .
The police were already letting loose ferocious dogs , killing some miners and maiming others .
One police tactic is to use teargas to drive them out of the tunnels , causing stampedes in which some have been crushed .
The miners say that in some cases the police shoot down the men , blinded by teargas , as they flee .
One described how there is shooting nearly every day and particularly at night .
" There were three of us mining together .
In the night a policeman came and shot my friend , twice in the chest .
We ran away but came back .
He was still alive .
We carried him to a hospital but he died , " he said .
A policewoman working in Chiadzwa said she saw a pile of 50 bodies after one helicopter attack .
" There were a lot of bodies .
They were piled up .
I do n't know what happened to them .
Some of the dead are just buried secretly , " she said .
" Miners are killed every day .
The orders to the police are to shoot them if they find them digging but many of the police do not want to carry out those orders .
These are ordinary people like us . "
The situation has got so bad that some miners are now arming themselves and fighting back .
The state - run press has reported that several police officers have been killed in shoot - outs .
But none of that deters the men who continue to work the diamond fields .
" The risks are worth it , " said Hopewell .
" Some miners have run away but most of us do n't leave for long .
We hear stories of giant diamonds .
I 've already sold enough to make more money than I have made in five years .
I have bought food for my mother and father .
I have bought a television and a DVD from South Africa .
Next I will buy a car .
If they do n't kill me , " he says , and laughs .
A De Beers subsidiary held the exploitation rights to the fields but let them expire in 2006 because , according to industry sources , it believed the diamonds to be of poor quality .
A British firm , African Consolidated Resources , bought the rights but it was ousted by the government when large quantities of high quality diamonds were discovered a short dig under the surface .
Theoretically the diamond fields were then taken over by the state - owned Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation but the illegal diggers moved in so fast it was unable to assert control .
Some economists speculate that Zimbabwe 's rulers look on the diamond fields as a new source of US dollars now that the country 's foreign reserves have largely been spent and the collapse of agriculture , industry and tourism means there is little new money coming in .
But given the bitter experience of recent years Zimbabweans have little reason to believe that if the ruling elite gets control of the diamond fields , the revenues will be used to rescue the country .
" Deliberate employment of weapons of mass destruction or other catastrophic capabilities , unforeseen economic collapse , loss of functioning political and legal order , purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency , pervasive public health emergencies , and catastrophic natural and human disasters are all paths to disruptive domestic shock . "
Titled " Known Unknowns : Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense Strategy Development , " the report warned that the U.S. military and intelligence community remain mired in the past as well as the need to accommodate government policy .
Freier , a former Pentagon official , said that despite the Al Qaida surprise in 2001 U.S. defense strategy and planning remain trapped by " excessive convention . "
" The current administration confronted a game - changing ' strategic shock ' inside its first eight months in office , " the report said .
" The next administration would be well - advised to expect the same during the course of its first term .
Indeed , the odds are very high against any of the challenges routinely at the top of the traditional defense agenda triggering the next watershed inside DoD [ Department of Defense ] . "
The report cited the collapse of what Freier termed " a large capable state that results in a nuclear civil war . "
Such a prospect could lead to uncontrolled weapons of mass destruction proliferation as well as a nuclear war .
The report cited the prospect of a breakdown of order in the United States .
Freier said the Pentagon could be suddenly forced to recall troops from abroad to fight domestic unrest .
" An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long - secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home , " the report said .
The report said the United States could also come under pressure from a hostile state with control over insurgency groups .
The hostile state could force American decision - makers into a desperate response .
" The United States might also consider the prospect that hostile state and / or nonstate actors might individually or in concert combine hybrid methods effectively to resist U.S. influence in a nonmilitary manner , " the report said .
" This is clearly an emerging trend . "
" The aforementioned are admittedly extreme , " the report said .
" They are not , however , implausible or fantastical . "
On the day that Americans turned out in near record numbers to vote , a record was set halfway around the world .
In Afghanistan , a US Air Force strike wiped out about 40 people in a wedding party .
This represented at least the sixth wedding party eradicated by American air power in Afghanistan and Iraq since December 2001 .
American planes have , in fact , taken out two brides in the last seven months .
And do n’t try to bury your dead or mark their deaths ceremonially either , because funerals have been hit as well .
Mind you , those planes , which have conducted 31 % more air strikes in Afghanistan in support of US troops this year , and the missile - armed unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) now making almost daily strikes across the border in Pakistan , remain part of George W. Bush ’s Air Force , but only until January 21 , 2009 .
Then , they  and all the brides and grooms of Afghanistan and in the Pakistani borderlands who care to have something more than the smallest of private weddings  officially become the property of President Barack Obama .
That ’s a sobering thought .
He is , in fact , inheriting from the Bush administration a widening war in the region , as well as an exceedingly tenuous situation in devastated , still thoroughly factionalized , sectarian , and increasingly Iranian - influenced Iraq .
There , the US is , in actuality , increasingly friendless and ever less powerful .
The last allies from the infamous “ coalition of the willing ” are now rushing for the door .
The South Koreans , Hungarians , and Bulgarians  I ’ll bet you did n’t even know the latter two had a few troops left in Iraq  are going home this year ; the rump British force in the south will probably be out by next summer .
The Iraqis are beginning to truly go their own way ( or , more accurately , ways ) ; and yet , in January , when Barack Obama enters office , there will still be more American troops in Iraq than there were in April 2003 when Baghdad fell .
Winning an election with an antiwar label , Obama has promised  kinda  to end the American war there and bring the troops  sorta , mostly  home .
But even after his planned 16 - month withdrawal of US “ combat brigades , ” which may not be welcomed by his commanders in the field , including former Iraq commander , now Centcom Commander David Petraeus , there are still plenty of combative non-combat forces , which will be labeled “ residual ” and left behind to fight “ al - Qaeda . ”
Then , there are all those “ advisors ” still there to train Iraqi forces , the guards for the giant bases the Bush administration built in the country , the many thousands of armed private security contractors from companies like Blackwater , and of course , the 1,000 “ diplomats ” who are to staff the newly opened US embassy in Baghdad ’s Green Zone , possibly the largest embassy on the planet .
Hmmmm .
And while the new president turns to domestic matters , it ’s quite possible that significant parts of his foreign policy could be left to the oversight of Vice President Joe Biden who , in case anyone has forgotten , proposed a plan for Iraq back in 2007 so filled with imperial hubris that it still startles .
In a Caesarian moment , he recommended that the US  not Iraqis  functionally divide the country into three parts .
Although he preferred to call it a “ federal system , ” it was , for all intents and purposes , a de facto partition plan .
If Iraq remains a sorry tale of American destruction and dysfunction without , as yet , a discernible end in sight , Afghanistan may prove Iraq squared .
And there , candidate Obama expressed no desire to wind the war down and withdraw American troops .
Quite the opposite , during the election campaign he plunked hard for escalation , something our NATO allies are sure not to be too enthusiastic about .
According to the Obama plan , many more American troops ( if available , itself an open question ) are to be poured into the country in what would essentially be a massive “ surge strategy ” by yet another occupant of the Oval Office .
Assumedly , the new Afghan policy would be aided and abetted by those CIA - run UAVs directed toward Pakistan to hunt down Osama bin Laden and pals , while undoubtedly further destabilizing a shaky ally .
When it comes to rising civilian casualties from US air strikes in their countries , both Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari have already used their congratulatory phone calls to President - elect Obama to plead for an end to the attacks , which produce both a profusion of dead bodies and a profusion of live , vengeful enemies .
Both have done the same with the Bush administration , Karzai to the point of tears .
The US military argues that the use of air power is necessary in the face of a spreading , ever more dangerous , Taliban insurgency largely because there are too few boots on the ground .
( “ If we got more boots on the ground , we would not have to rely as much on airstrikes ” was the way Army Brig .
Gen. Michael Tucker , deputy commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan , put it . )
But rest assured , as the boots multiply on increasingly hostile ground , the military will discover it needs more , not less , air power to back more troops in more trouble .
So , after January 20th , expect Obama to take possession of George Bush ’s disastrous Afghan War ; and unless he is far more skilled than Alexander the Great , British empire builders , and the Russians , his war , too , will continue to rage without ever becoming a raging success .
Finally , President - elect Obama accepted the overall framework of a “ Global War on Terror ” during his presidential campaign .
This “ war ” lies at the heart of the Bush administration ’s fantasy world of war that has set all - too - real expanses of the planet aflame .
Its dangers were further highlighted this week by the New York Times , which revealed that secret orders in the spring of 2004 gave the US military “ new authority to attack the Qaeda terrorist network anywhere in the world , and a more sweeping mandate to conduct operations in countries not at war with the United States . ”
At least twelve such attacks have been carried out since then by Special Operations forces on Pakistan , Somalia , most recently Syria , and other unnamed countries .
Signed by Donald Rumsfeld , signed off on by President Bush , built - upon recently by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , these secret orders enshrine the Pentagon ’s right to ignore international boundaries , or the sovereignty of nations , in an endless global “ war ” of choice against small , scattered bands of terrorists .
As reporter Jim Lobe pointed out recently , a “ series of interlocking grand bargains ” in what the neoconservatives used to call “ the Greater Middle East ” or the “ arc of instability ” might be available to an Obama administration capable of genuinely new thinking .
These , he wrote , would be “ backed by the relevant regional players as well as major global powers  aimed at pacifying Afghanistan ; integrating Iran into a new regional security structure ; promoting reconciliation in Iraq ; and launching a credible process to negotiate a comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab world . ”
If , however , Obama accepts a War on Terror framework , as he already seems to have , as well as those “ residual ” forces in Iraq , while pumping up the war in Afghanistan , he may quickly find himself playing by Rumsfeld rules , whether or not he revokes those specific orders .
In fact , left alone in Washington , backed by the normal national security types , he may soon find himself locked into all sorts of unpalatable situations , as once happened to another Democratic president , Lyndon Baines Johnson , who opted to escalate an inherited war when what he most wanted to do was focus on domestic policy .
Previews for a Political Zombie Movie
Domestically , it ’s clear enough that we are about to leave the age of Bush  in tone and policy  but what that leave - taking will consist of is still an open question .
This is especially so given a cratering economy and the pot - holed road ahead .
It is a moment when Obama has , not surprisingly , begun to emphasize continuity and reassurance alongside his campaign theme of “ change we can believe in . ”
All you had to do was look at that array of Clinton - era economic types and CEOs behind Obama at his first news conference to think : been there , done that .
The full photo of his economic team that day offered a striking profile of pre-Bush era Washington and the Washington Consensus , and so a hint of the Democratic world the new president will walk into on January 20 , 2009 .
How about former Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Larry Summers , those kings of 1990s globalization , or even the towering former Fed chief from the first Bush era , Paul Volcker ?
Did n’t that have the look of previews for a political zombie movie , a line - up of the undead ?
As head of the New America Foundation Steve Clemons has been writing recently , the economic team looks suspiciously as if it were preparing for a “ Clinton 3.0 ” moment .
You could scan that gathering and not see a genuine rogue thinker in sight ; no off - the - reservation figures who might represent a breath of fresh air and fresh thinking ( other than , being hopeful , the president - elect himself ) .
Clemons offers an interesting list of just some obvious names left off stage : “ Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz , Jeffrey Sachs , James Galbraith , Leo Hindery , Clyde Prestowitz , Charlene Barshefsky , C. Fred Bergsten , Adam Posen , Robert Kuttner , Robert Samuelson , Alan Murray , William Bonvillian , Doug & Heidi Rediker , Bernard Schwartz , Tom Gallagher , Sheila Bair , Sherle Schwenninger , and Kevin Phillips . ”
Mobilizing a largely Clintonista brain trust may look reassuring to some  an in - gathering of all the Washington wisdom available before Hurricane Bush / Cheney hit town , but unfortunately , we do n’t happen to be entering a Clinton 3.0 moment .
What ’s globalizing now is American disaster , which threatens to level a vulnerable world .
In a sense , though , domestic policy may , relatively speaking , represent the good news of the coming Obama era .
We know , for instance , that those preparing the way for the new president ’s arrival are thinking hard about how to roll back the worst of Bush cronyism , enrich - yourself - at - the - public - troughism , general lawlessness , and unconstitutionality .
As a start , according to Ceci Connolly and R. Jeffrey Smith of the Washington Post , Obama advisers have already been compiling “ a list of about 200 Bush administration actions and executive orders that could be swiftly undone to reverse White House policies on climate change , stem cell research , reproductive rights and other issues , ” including oil drilling in pristine wild lands .
In addition , Obama ’s people are evidently at work on ways to close Guantanamo and try some of its prisoners in US courts .
However , if continuity domestically means rollback to the Clinton era , continuity in the foreign policy sphere  Guantanamo aside  may be a somewhat different matter .
We wo n’t know the full cast of characters to come until the president - elect makes the necessary announcements or has a national security press conference with a similar lineup behind him .
But it ’s certainly rumored that Robert Gates , a symbol of continuity from both Bush eras , might be kept on as secretary of defense , or a Republican senator like Richard Lugar of Indiana or , more interestingly , retiring Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel might be appointed to the post .
Of course , many Clintonistas are sure to be in this lineup , too .
In addition , among the essential cast of characters will be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Michael Mullen , and Centcom Commander David Petraeus , both late Bush appointees , both seemingly flexible military men , both interested in a military - plus approach to the Afghan and Iraq wars .
Petraeus , for instance , reportedly recently asked for , and was denied , permission to meet with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
All these figures will represent a turn away from the particular madness of the early Bush years abroad , one that actually began in the final years of his second term .
But such a national security lineup is unlikely to include fresh thinkers , who might truly reimagine an imperial world , or anyone who might genuinely buck the power of the Pentagon .
What Obama looks to have are custodians and bureaucrats of empire , far more cautious , far more sane , and certainly far more grown - up than the first - term Bush appointees , but not a cast of characters fit for reshaping American policy in a new world of disorder and unraveling economies , not a crew ready to break new ground and cede much old ground on this still American - garrisoned planet of ours .
Breathless in Washington
Let ’s assume the best : that Barack Obama truly means to bring some form of the people ’s will , as he imagines it , to Washington after eight years of unconstitutional “ commander - in - chief ” governance .
That  take my word for it  he ca n’t do without the people themselves expressing that will .
Of course , even in the Bush era , Americans did n’t simply cede the public commons .
They turned out , for instance , in staggering numbers to protest the President ’s invasion of Iraq before it ever happened , and again more recently to work tirelessly to elect Obama president .
But  so it seems to me  when immediate goals are either disappointingly not achieved , or achieved relatively quickly , most Americans tend to pack their bags and head for home , as so many did in despair after the invasion was launched in 2003 , as so many reportedly are doing again , in a far more celebratory mood , now that Obama is elected .
But hard as his election may have been , that was surely the easy part .
He is now about to enter the hornet ’s nest .
Entrenched interests .
Entrenched ideas .
Entrenched ideology .
Entrenched profits .
Entrenched lobbyists .
Entrenched bureaucrats .
Entrenched think tanks .
An entrenched Pentagon and allied military - industrial complex , both bloated beyond imagining and virtually untouchable , along with a labyrinthine intelligence system of more than 18 agencies , departments , and offices .
Washington remains an imperial capital .
How in the world will Barack Obama truly begin to change that without you ?
In the Bush years , the special interests , lobbyists , pillagers , and crony corporations not only pitched their tents on the public commons , but with the help of the President ’s men and women , simply took possession of large hunks of it .
That was called “ privatization . ”
Now , as Bush & Co. prepare to leave town in a cloud of catastrophe , the feeding frenzy at the public trough only seems to grow .
It ’s a natural reaction  and certainly a commonplace media reaction at the moment  to want to give Barack Obama a “ chance . ”
Back off those critical comments , people now say .
Fair ’s fair .
Give the President - elect a little “ breathing space . ”
After all , the election is barely over , he ’s not even in office , he has n’t had his first 100 days , and already the criticism has begun .
But those who say this do n’t understand Washington  or , in the case of various media figures and pundits , perhaps understand it all too well .
Political Washington is a conspiracy  in the original sense of the word : “ to breathe the same air . ”
In that sense , there is no air in Washington that is n’t stale enough to choke a president .
Send Obama there alone , give him that “ breathing space , ” do n’t start demanding the quick ending of wars or anything else , and you ’re not doing him , or the American people , any favors .
Quite the opposite , you ’re consigning him to suffocation .
Leave Obama to them and he ’ll break your heart .
If you do , then blame yourself , not him ; but better than blaming anyone , pitch your own tent on the public commons and make some noise .
Let him know that Washington ’s is n’t the only consensus around , that Americans really do want our troops to come home , that we actually are looking for “ change we can believe in , ” which would include a less weaponized , less imperial American world , based on a reinvigorated idea of defense , not aggression , and on the Constitution , not leftover Rumsfeld rules or a bogus Global War on Terror .

The IMF has warned Iceland 's economy could contract by 10 % next year The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has approved a $ 2.1 bn ( £ 1.4bn ) loan for Iceland , after the country 's banking system collapsed in October .
The loan is meant to help the country " restore confidence and stabilise the economy " , the IMF said in a statement .
Iceland is the first Western European nation to get an IMF loan since 1976 .
Following the IMF announcement , Finland , Sweden , Norway and Denmark said they would lend Iceland an additional $ 2.5 bn .
" We stress that , as outlined in the IMF program , an ambitious multiyear fiscal consolidation program will help Iceland stabilise the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium - term , " finance ministries from the four countries said in a statement .
The contribution from each country has yet to be decided , but Finnish Finance Ministry spokesman Martti Hetemaki said Finland would need to borrow funds to provide the loan .
The move comes after Iceland 's Prime Minister Geir Haarde told Nordic countries that Iceland needed about $ 6bn to handle the meltdown .
Last month the IMF said it would provide Iceland with $ 2.1bn and help it access $ 3.9 bn from other countries .
The IMF 's two - year loan , which is subject to quarterly review , allows the country to withdraw about $ 827 m now , and the rest in eight instalments of some $ 155 m .
The loan was designed to help the country cope with what the IMF described as " a banking crisis of extraordinary proportions " .
Contracting economy Iceland was forced to take over three of its biggest , debt - laden banks last month .
The Nordic nation 's troubles have had severe repercussions elsewhere in Europe .
In the UK , individual savers and local councils have been unable to access funds deposited in Icelandic banks .
Iceland 's currency , the krona , has almost halved in value this year and banking transactions with other countries have almost completely frozen .
The IMF has warned the country 's economy could contract by as much as 10 % next year .
Iceland has said the IMF funds will be used to stabilise its currency , reintroduce a flexible interest rate regime and to overhaul its financial regulation system , especially insolvency laws .
Before going to the IMF , it had been in talks with Russia for a $ 4bn loan , but discussions broke down .

Here ’s some video of Anonymous members leaving a protest in the L.A. area and being followed for two miles by Scientologists .
Kinda creepy , kinda Scientology - like .
Sure , back in 1999 , I did follow Dan Murnan but I was specifically trying to get an answer from him as to why a few hours earlier he and fellow Scientologist Mark Perkins came to my apartment complex and lied to my neighbors about being “ friends from out of state ” to find out which apartment I lived in .
Intimidation and investigation have been hallmarks of Scientology since Hubbard invented his paranoid organization .

Happy Friday to all of you , we wanted to share some of our picks from the beloved Unsplash site filled with free high - resolution photos that you can download and do whatever you want with it .
September 21 , 2020
Their work has inspired and enlightened millions of people around the world and across generations .
Their passionate advocacy for reason and their unapologetic questioning of religion and superstition have broken taboos and changed the cultural landscape .
On October 24 , these two champions of science and secularism will come together for the first time , as evolutionary …
I want to sketch [ 4 ] a rival ( or perhaps a complement ) to these accounts , one in which the products of value creation are objective roughly in the sense that so - called secondary properties are objective .
Nadeem Hussain considers Nietzschean value creation to be a fictionalist enterprise :
When we engage in evaluative practices , we take ourselves to be pretending that things really have value " in themselves , " fully aware though that in reality nothing has value in itself . [ 1 ]
For Brian Leiter , Nietzschean value creation is best construed as a form of subjective projectionism , in which though nothing has value in itself , " things do have ... whatever value we project upon them . " [ 2 ]
Maudemarie Clark and David Dudrick argue ( pace Hussain and Leiter ) that Nietzschean value creation is objective , but they locate the objectivity in certain second - order commitments that flow from norms implicit in the practice of judging rather than in the objects of evaluation themselves . [ 3 ]
First , I 'm going to start off with a thought experiment .
Remember that we see a red apple as red because of the physical constitution of both the apple and our visual system .
So red in a sense exists only in light of the fact that there are perceivers with the right sort of perceptual apparatus .
Suppose then that you discover a new way to exercise your color receptors and make them sensitive to light frequencies outside the normal range of human vision .
And suppose no other organism was suitably equipped to see bee purple ( say ) .
So you start your daily regimen of eye - robic exercise ( sorry about that ) .
And lo ! , after six weeks , you are able to see bee purple .
I want to say that in something close to Nietzsche 's sense , you 've " invented " bee purple , viz. , by becoming the kind of organism capable of seeing it .
To see how how well this modified color vision analogy might fit Nietzschean value creation , I 'll now lay out what I see as Nietzsche 's Four - Step Program for " creating values . "
I 've included some supporting textual material underneath each step ( I 'll probably update with other supporting and countervailing material , just to have a place to organize it all [ and of course suggestions are welcome ] ) :
1. Explore and inhabit different evaluative " perspectives . "
" There is only a perspectival seeing , only a perspectival ‘ knowing ’ ; and the more affects we allow to speak about a matter , the more eyes , different eyes , we know how to bring to bear on one and the same matter , that much more complete will our ‘ concept ’ of this matter , our ‘ objectivity ’ be . "
( GM III :12 )
" Nothing in existence should be excluded , nothing is dispensable — the aspects of existence condemned by Christians and other nihilists rank infinitely higher in the order of values than anything the instinct of decadence is able to approve , to call good . "
( EH BT:2 )
" [ T ] here are a hundred ways to listen to your conscience . "
( GS 335 )
“ As adventurers and circumnavigators of that inner world called ‘ man , ’ as surveyors and gaugers of that ‘ higher ’ and ‘ one upon the other ’ that is likewise called ‘ man ’ — penetrating everywhere , almost without fear , disdaining nothing , losing nothing , asking everything , cleansing everything of what is chance and accident in it and as it were thoroughly sifting it — until at last we had the right to say , we free spirits : ‘ Here — a new problem !
Here a long ladder upon whose rungs we ourselves have sat and climbed — which we ourselves have at some time been !
Here a higher , a deeper , a beneath - us , a long ordering , an order of rank which we see : here — our problem ! ” ( HH I Preface 7 )
2. Evaluate those perspectives with determined independence , according to their " usefulness for life . "
One must develop " the capacity to have one ’s pro and contra in one ’s power , and to shift them in and out : so that one knows how to make precisely the difference in perspectives and affective interpretations useful for knowledge . "
( GM III : 12 )
We must " resist [ ] accustomed value feelings [ Werthgefühlen ] in a dangerous way ; and a philosophy that risks this would be that token alone place itself beyond good and evil . ” ( BGE 4 )
" Let us ... limit ourselves to the purification of our opinions and value judgements and to the creation of tables of what is good that are new and all our own . "
( GS 335 )
" As for the question whether these fruits of ours taste good to you , what does that matter to the trees !
What concern is that of ours , we philosophers ! " ( GM Prologue II )
See also HH I Preface 7 , under Step 1 above .
3 . Incorporate the most valuable perspectives into one 's way of life — " embody " new values .
" ' What I went through , he [ the free spirit ] tells himself , [ sic ] must be gone through by everyone in whom there is a task that wants to be embodied [ eine Aufgabe leibhaft werden ] and to come into the world . '
The secret power and necessity of this task will rule among and in his particular destinies like an unconscious pregnancy — long before he himself has glimpsed this task and knows its name . "
( HH I P7 - internal punctuation omitted )
4. " Create " or " give birth " to new values , " present " these values to the world , viz. , by becoming the kind of being capable of so valuing . [ 5 ]
" We , however , want to become who we are — human beings who are new ,
unique , incomparable , who give themselves laws , who create themselves !
To that end we must become the best students and discoverers of everything lawful and necessary in the world . "
( GS 338 )
unique , incomparable , who give themselves laws , who create themselves !
To that end we must become the best students and discoverers of everything lawful and necessary in the world . "
( GS 338 ) " Change of values —
" Peoples were the first creators , and only in later times individuals ; verily , the individual himself is the latest creation . " (
that means , change of creators .
Always he destroys , he who would be a creator .
" Peoples were the first creators , and only in later times individuals ; verily , the individual himself is the latest creation . "
( Z I:15 -- H/T Rob Sica .)
Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself , according to its nature — nature is always value - less , but has been given value at some time , as a present — and it is we who gave and bestowed it .
Only we have created the world that concerns human beings !
( GS 301 )
“ Begetting ” and “ giving birth ” are the “ two most valuable functions of man . ” ( BGE 206 )
“ the ‘ work ’ ... invents the man who has created it , who is supposed to have created it .... ” ( BGE 269 )
“ Many a soul one will never discover , unless one first invent it . ”
( Z I : VIII - " The Tree on the Hill " )
" What [ Goethe ] aspired to was totality ; he strove against the separation of reason , sensuality , feeling , will ... ; he disciplined himself to a whole , he created himself .... " ( TI " Expeditions " 49 )
I think that this is a good start of an account , but ( as I say ) it 's very sketchy , and leaves at large a number of tensions .
For instance , it 's not clear how on this account the higher man would “ experienc[e ] itself as determining values . ” ( BGE 260 ) I intend to address these and other tensions , and otherwise fill out this " transformationist " ( I might call it ) account of value creation , as I go along .

A growing breed of online marketplaces offering to rent everything from baby prams to bulldozers have seen a boom in business as the credit crunch bites from consumers and companies discovering the rental market can save and make you money .
Online rental marketplaces provide an Internet platform for individuals and hire companies to rent out their wares -- like a rental version of eBay .
Gary Cige , 28 , co-founder of Zilok ( uk.zilok.com ) , says individuals are renting out more and more of their personal belongings to earn pocket money .
A Paris - based member of his website has rented his single lens reflex camera out several times , earning around 800 euros ( $ 1,015 ) in 9 months .
Another member has made around 600 euros in 3 to 4 months by renting his camera , roller blades and game console .
Cige says the website has been growing around 25 percent a month since it was founded one year ago , and he thinks the credit crisis will likely boost growth .
“ People have difficulties making ends meet at the end of the month , they try to find ways to save money and to earn a little more , ” he said .
Items available for rent on Zilok include dog costumes , a candy floss maker and an inflatable castle .
Zilok , who has taught macroeconomics at university , believes that the success of online rental marketplaces is symptomatic of a general shift of society away from valuing ownership toward valuing usage .
Other examples of this shift were the “ velib ” bike hire scheme launched in Paris and the car - sharing networks now in place worldwide .
Such schemes enable people to be more ecological , by providing monetary motivation , he said .
Dominique Bourg , a French philosopher who has written about the so - called economy of functionality , told Reuters :
“ It costs a lot less to rent an object you do not intend to use much than to buy it .
And if you own that object you can also earn money by renting it out .
So there is a double advantage , both for the person who owns and for the person who does n’t . ”
NICHE
The concept of renting out a luxury handbag when you are on a tight budget first enamored fashionistas worldwide when it featured in the summer hit movie “ Sex and the City . ”
But , while bag rental companies have existed as a niche service in the United States for several years , online rental marketplaces are seeking to make this service mainstream and universal .
The founders of these marketplaces say consumers are increasingly preferring to rent rather than buy in order to save both money and the environment -- a trend that has been boosted by the ongoing credit crisis .
“ People say -- ‘ I could afford to buy a Prada handbag for this sum of money , but I would rather rent it out , and also get a stretch limousine , a convertible and some other things ’ , ” said Chris Moeller , the 36 - year old founder of German online rental marketplace Erento ( www.erento.co.uk).
Prada handbags can be rented out on Erento for 10 pounds ( $ 15.44 ) a week and a limousine can cost 120 pounds an hour .
Moeller told Reuters that companies , which are currently struggling to obtain bank loans to finance the purchase of heavy machinery , are also looking to rent .
“ At the moment , some companies ca n’t get credit from banks because the latter are very skeptical , so the company says , ‘ okay , I need this machine for some jobs I have to do ’ , and then they hire it out , ” he said .
Moeller said Erento , which he founded in 2003 and which now has around 470,000 registered hirers , has been profitable since its second year online and is expanding abroad rapidly .
As a private company , it does not disclose profits , but it says it brings hire companies about one million euros of rental business each day .
Wind , water and sun beat other energy alternatives , study finds
LM Glasfiber
Wind power is the most promising alternative source of energy , according to Mark Jacobson .
The best ways to improve energy security , mitigate global warming and reduce the number of deaths caused by air pollution are blowing in the wind and rippling in the water , not growing on prairies or glowing inside nuclear power plants , says Mark Z. Jacobson , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford .
And " clean coal , " which involves capturing carbon emissions and sequestering them in the earth , is not clean at all , he asserts .
Jacobson has conducted the first quantitative , scientific evaluation of the proposed , major , energy - related solutions by assessing not only their potential for delivering energy for electricity and vehicles , but also their impacts on global warming , human health , energy security , water supply , space requirements , wildlife , water pollution , reliability and sustainability .
His findings indicate that the options that are getting the most attention are between 25 to 1,000 times more polluting than the best available options .
The paper with his findings will be published in the next issue of Energy and Environmental Science but is available online now .
Jacobson is also director of the Atmosphere / Energy Program at Stanford .
" The energy alternatives that are good are not the ones that people have been talking about the most .
And some options that have been proposed are just downright awful , " Jacobson said .
" Ethanol - based biofuels will actually cause more harm to human health , wildlife , water supply and land use than current fossil fuels . "
He added that ethanol may also emit more global - warming pollutants than fossil fuels , according to the latest scientific studies .
The raw energy sources that Jacobson found to be the most promising are , in order , wind , concentrated solar ( the use of mirrors to heat a fluid ) , geothermal , tidal , solar photovoltaics ( rooftop solar panels ) , wave and hydroelectric .
He recommends against nuclear , coal with carbon capture and sequestration , corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol , which is made of prairie grass .
In fact , he found cellulosic ethanol was worse than corn ethanol because it results in more air pollution , requires more land to produce and causes more damage to wildlife .
To place the various alternatives on an equal footing , Jacobson first made his comparisons among the energy sources by calculating the impacts as if each alternative alone were used to power all the vehicles in the United States , assuming only " new - technology " vehicles were being used .
Such vehicles include battery electric vehicles ( BEVs ) , hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ( HFCVs ) , and " flex - fuel " vehicles that could run on a high blend of ethanol called E85 .
Wind was by far the most promising , Jacobson said , owing to a better - than 99 percent reduction in carbon and air pollution emissions ; the consumption of less than 3 square kilometers of land for the turbine footprints to run the entire U.S. vehicle fleet ( given the fleet is composed of battery - electric vehicles ) ; the saving of about 15,000 lives per year from premature air - pollution - related deaths from vehicle exhaust in the United States ; and virtually no water consumption .
By contrast , corn and cellulosic ethanol will continue to cause more than 15,000 air pollution - related deaths in the country per year , Jacobson asserted .
Because the wind turbines would require a modest amount of spacing between them to allow room for the blades to spin , wind farms would occupy about 0.5 percent of all U.S. land , but this amount is more than 30 times less than that required for growing corn or grasses for ethanol .
Land between turbines on wind farms would be simultaneously available as farmland or pasture or could be left as open space .
Indeed , a battery - powered U.S. vehicle fleet could be charged by 73,000 to 144,000 5 - megawatt wind turbines , fewer than the 300,000 airplanes the U.S. produced during World War II and far easier to build .
Additional turbines could provide electricity for other energy needs .
" There is a lot of talk among politicians that we need a massive jobs program to pull the economy out of the current recession , " Jacobson said .
" Well , putting people to work building wind turbines , solar plants , geothermal plants , electric vehicles and transmission lines would not only create jobs but would also reduce costs due to health care , crop damage and climate damage from current vehicle and electric power pollution , as well as provide the world with a truly unlimited supply of clean power . "
Jacobson said that while some people are under the impression that wind and wave power are too variable to provide steady amounts of electricity , his research group has already shown in previous research that by properly coordinating the energy output from wind farms in different locations , the potential problem with variability can be overcome and a steady supply of baseline power delivered to users .
Jacobson 's research is particularly timely in light of the growing push to develop biofuels , which he calculated to be the worst of the available alternatives .
In their effort to obtain a federal bailout , the Big Three Detroit automakers are increasingly touting their efforts and programs in the biofuels realm , and federal research dollars have been supporting a growing number of biofuel - research efforts .
" That is exactly the wrong place to be spending our money .
Biofuels are the most damaging choice we could make in our efforts to move away from using fossil fuels , " Jacobson said .
" We should be spending to promote energy technologies that cause significant reductions in carbon emissions and air - pollution mortality , not technologies that have either marginal benefits or no benefits at all " .
" Obviously , wind alone is n't the solution , " Jacobson said .
" It 's got to be a package deal , with energy also being produced by other sources such as solar , tidal , wave and geothermal power . "
During the recent presidential campaign , nuclear power and clean coal were often touted as energy solutions that should be pursued , but nuclear power and coal with carbon capture and sequestration were Jacobson 's lowest - ranked choices after biofuels .
" Coal with carbon sequestration emits 60 - to 110 - times more carbon and air pollution than wind energy , and nuclear emits about 25 - times more carbon and air pollution than wind energy , " Jacobson said .
Although carbon - capture equipment reduces 85 - 90 percent of the carbon exhaust from a coal - fired power plant , it has no impact on the carbon resulting from the mining or transport of the coal or on the exhaust of other air pollutants .
In fact , because carbon capture requires a roughly 25 - percent increase in energy from the coal plant , about 25 percent more coal is needed , increasing mountaintop removal and increasing non-carbon air pollution from power plants , he said .
Nuclear power poses other risks .
Jacobson said it is likely that if the United States were to move more heavily into nuclear power , then other nations would demand to be able to use that option .
" Once you have a nuclear energy facility , it 's straightforward to start refining uranium in that facility , which is what Iran is doing and Venezuela is planning to do , " Jacobson said .
" The potential for terrorists to obtain a nuclear weapon or for states to develop nuclear weapons that could be used in limited regional wars will certainly increase with an increase in the number of nuclear energy facilities worldwide . "
Jacobson calculated that if one small nuclear bomb exploded , the carbon emissions from the burning of a large city would be modest , but the death rate for one such event would be twice as large as the current vehicle air pollution death rate summed over 30 years .
Finally , both coal and nuclear energy plants take much longer to plan , permit and construct than do most of the other new energy sources that Jacobson 's study recommends .
The result would be even more emissions from existing nuclear and coal power sources as people continue to use comparatively " dirty " electricity while waiting for the new energy sources to come online , Jacobson said .
Jacobson received no funding from any interest group , company or government agency .
Energy and vehicle options , from best to worst , according to Jacobson 's calculations :
Best to worst electric power sources :
1. Wind power 2 . concentrated solar power ( CSP ) 3 . geothermal power 4 . tidal power 5 . solar photovoltaics ( PV ) 6 . wave power 7 . hydroelectric power 8 . a tie between nuclear power and coal with carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) .
Best to worst vehicle options :
1. Wind -BEVs ( battery electric vehicles ) 2 . wind - HFCVs ( hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ) 3.CSP - BEVs 4 . geothermal - BEVs 5 . tidal - BEVs 6 . solar PV - BEVs 7 . Wave - BEVs 8.hydroelectric-BEVs
9 . a tie between nuclear - BEVs and coal - CCS - BEVs 11 .
corn-E85 12.cellulosic-E85 .
Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were examined only when powered by wind energy , but they could be combined with other electric power sources .
Although HFCVs require about three times more energy than do BEVs ( BEVs are very efficient ) , HFCVs are still very clean and more efficient than pure gasoline , and wind - HFCVs still resulted in the second - highest overall ranking .
HFCVs have an advantage in that they can be refueled faster than can BEVs ( although BEV charging is getting faster ) .
Thus , HFCVs may be useful for long trips ( more than 250 miles ) while BEVs more useful for trips less than 250 miles .
An ideal combination may be a BEV - HFCV hybrid .
Research at the Delft University of Technology ( The Netherlands ) has led to better understanding of clouds , the unknown quantity in current climate models .
The Delft researcher Thijs Heus has tackled this issue with a combination of detailed computer simulations and airplane measurements .
He charted data including cloud speed , temperature and the ' life span ' of clouds to arrive at new observations .
Interaction
The behaviour of clouds is the great unknown quantity in current climate models .
To make reliable predictions on climate change , more knowledge about clouds is thus essential .
Heus explains , ' What we call fair - weather clouds have posed one of the biggest challenges in atmospheric science for decades .
For accurate representation of clouds in weather and climate models , it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the interaction between clouds and the environment .
Today , with the help of better observational methods and more powerful computers , we can get a much nicer picture of how it works . '
Downward
Heus continues , ' A cloud is normally described as an entity in which air rises .
All around the cloud , air sinks downward in compensation for the upward movement .
' We demonstrated that air far away from the cloud on average displaces very little .
The biggest amount of compensatory downward flow occurs immediately surrounding the cloud , in a ring of sinking air .
This ring results because cloud air mixes with the surroundings , causing the cloud water to evaporate , air to cool , and thereby sink .
The interaction between the cloud and its environment as such occurs indirectly , through the buffer zone of the ring .
This buffer zone has not yet been incorporated into climate models until now .
' The ring is principally created by horizontal mixing .
We showed that whatever happens on the cloud top has little influence on the underlying layers . '
Virtual Reality
A cloud 's behaviour is likewise affected over time by this same horizontal mixing ; the air in a cloud appears not to rise continuously , but rather in bubble - shaped form .
Using visualizations in a Virtual Reality - environment , Heus could reliably research this tendency for the first time .
The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ( KNMI ) , Heus ' current employer , and other scientific institutes have already expressed interest in the results of his study .

" What is wrong with this picture ? " is the theme of an article in Sunday ’s Washington Post Outlook section , written by Patrick Welsh , an English teacher at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria , Virginia .
Welsh , a frequent writer and observer of social trends among teens in his community and the school system in which he works , expresses his dismay and discomfort with the fact that the number of adolescents becoming parents continues to grow .
He writes :
Last I heard , teen pregnancy is still a major concern in this country
— teenage mothers are less likely to finish school and more likely to
live in poverty ; their children are more likely to have difficulties in
school and with the law ; and on and on .
[ Yet in ] our school of 2,211 students , we now have at least 70 girls who are soon - to - be or already mothers .
Welsh points out that the high school , local government and local non-profits all seem to be doing the " right thing . "
On the surface , Alexandria seems to be striving to stem teen pregnancy .
Every high school student is required to take a " family life " course
that teaches about birth control , sexually transmitted disease and teen
pregnancy .
The Adolescent Health Center , a clinic providing birth
control , was built a few blocks from the school .
The city - run Campaign
on Adolescent Pregnancy sponsors workshops for parents and teens .

Despite these efforts ,
Welsh and his colleagues see a growing number of girls , primarily lower - income students , becoming pregnant .
Once a girl gets pregnant , though , the school leaps in to do everything for her .
The idea is to keep the girls in school , let them get their diplomas and help them avoid the kind of fate described earlier .
He simultaneously lauds these efforts to help teens faced with profoundly life - changing circumstances and yet feels torn .
I ’ve been a teacher for more than 30 years , and I want the best for my
students and to help them succeed in every way possible .
I know that
these girls need support .
But I ca n’t help thinking we ’re going at this all wrong .
At T.C. Williams and in other schools and communities throughout the country , says Welsh , teen pregnancy no longer carries the shame it once did , but is celebrated and even planned by some adolescent girls and boys who see having a baby as a sign of " achievement . "
In one Massachusetts school last summer , a group of high school girls created a pact to get pregnant at the same time .
At T.C. Williams , there are reproductive and sexual health services , sex education and other relevant programs available , all of which implicitly acknowledge that teens will more likely than not become sexually active before they are married , and seek to ensure they can practice safer sex and avoid unintended pregnancy … but these efforts do not seem to make a difference among those whose intention is in fact to become pregnant .
Yet , as Welsh points out , whatever the perceived short - term gains for adolescents who do become pregnant , the end result for teen moms , even with community resources at hand , is a dimmer economic future for themselves and their children , as they are less likely to finish school , go to college , and land jobs that will provide a secure future .
And there is a broader economic and social cost incurred by helping support teen parents and their children : a study by National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy notes that teen childbearing nationwide cost taxpayers $ 9.1 billion in 2004 .
Welsh asks what many might seem to be the " politically incorrect " question :
Does the lack of shame and censure around teen pregnancy and the extensive support given these teens–additional resources for food and nutrition , an in - school day - care center , help getting to doctors ’ appointments–actually encourage teens to get pregnant " on purpose ? "
In short , are we enabling this ?
And should we be doing less ?
The answer to this , in my mind , is right there in Welsh ’s article .
It is not the services and and programs seeking to prevent adverse outcomes of unprotected sex ( unintended pregnancy , infection ) that lead teens to become pregnant , as many opponents of comprehensive education and services suggest .
Rather , it is the low level of self - esteem , low level of economic and social attainment within the communities from which these teens are coming , and the lack of " vision of a different future " that so clearly contributes to the desire for a baby to create an " identity " and to have someone – the school , the community –help support you in some way , as no other validation is available .
Teen motherhood at T.C. Williams is …
… mostly a class issue — and given Alexandria ’s
demographics , that means the teen mothers are virtually all
lower - income blacks and Hispanics with few financial or other
resources .
Moreover , the number of Hispanic girls with babies is double
the number of black girls , which also reflects a national trend .
According to Sarah Brown ,
director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned
Pregnancy , Hispanics now have the highest rate of teen pregnancy and
births of any racial or ethnic group in the country .
This story illustrates the realities evident throughout the reproductive and sexual health field , and with respect to public health strategies that ignore the social , economic , and cultural roots of sex and reproduction .
Services and programs are necessary but not sufficient aspects of any strategy to improve health and to promote a climate in which people have free choices , but can make those choices based not only on the immediate present , but an imagined–and different or better–future for themselves and their families .
The obstacles to such a future are evident even among those who strive to avoid becoming pregnant , as did Cynthia Quinteros , who was diligently using birth control but got pregnant when family circumstances forced her to miss a clinic appointment and who now spends 14 hours per day caring for her child , going to school , studying and working at night .
But these same teens also likely have at least some of the answers to Welsh ’s questions .
When asked about the situation of teen pregnancy in her community , Quinteros states :
In 1992 , by a 53 % - 47 % split , Coloradans passed an amendment to their state Constitution that repealed laws in Aspen , Boulder and Denver that prohibited discrimination against gays .
The amendment barred the state and its political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing any law “ whereby homosexual , lesbian or bisexual orientation , conduct , practices or relationships ” are the basis of a claim of discrimination .
Does this sound familiar ?
As the proponents of same - sex marriage rights determine the proper response to Proposition 8 , it is illuminating to compare Colorado ’s rejection of “ gay rights ” with California ’s repudiation of “ gay marriage . ”
The day after the Nov. 4 election , a coalition of civil rights groups asked the California Supreme Court to declare that Proposition 8 was unlawfully enacted .
The essence of their claim is that a constitutional change that rescinds individual rights must first be passed by a supermajority in the Legislature before being submitted to voters .
This process - based claim may well have merit , but there exists a more direct means of challenging Proposition 8 based on the U.S. Constitution .
Following the enactment of Colorado ’s Amendment 2 , its opponents filed suit claiming that it unlawfully singled out gays and lesbians as a class to deny them rights that other citizens not only possess but take for granted .
These rights include access to housing , government services , public accommodations and public and private employment opportunities without regard to an individual ’s race , sex , religion , age , ancestry , political belief or other characteristic that defines each of us as a unique human being .
Amendment 2 , the opponents argued , therefore denied gays and lesbians the equal protection of the laws , which is a guarantee of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
To the surprise of many , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed .
Writing for a 6 - 3 majority in Romer vs. Evans ( 1996 ) , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy explained that it “ is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort .
Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own Constitution ’s guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance . ”
Laws such as Amendment 2 “ raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected , ” Kennedy wrote , adding a reference to another 1973 ruling .
“ If the constitutional conception of ‘ equal protection of the laws ’ means anything , it must at the very least mean that a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest . ”
Proposition 8 suffers these same constitutional flaws .
It provides that gays and lesbians -- alone among consenting adult couples -- shall not have the opportunity to enjoy the rights , privileges and social approbation conferred by the status of lawful marriage .
And despite their insistence that the initiative was “ not an attack on the gay lifestyle , ” its proponents were remarkably candid about their disapproval of homosexual families .
The amendment , they argued in voter guides , “ protects our children from being taught in public schools that ‘ same - sex marriage ’ is the same as traditional marriage . ”
It protects marriage “ as an essential institution of society ” because “ the best situation for a child is to be raised by a married mother and father . ”
But as California ’s chief justice , Ronald M. George , explained in his opinion declaring the state ’s previous statutory ban on same - sex marriage unconstitutional , limiting marriage to opposite - sex couples does nothing to protect the interests of children .
“ An individual ’s capacity to establish a loving and long - term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend on the individual ’s sexual orientation . ”
Moreover , “ the exclusion of same - sex couples from the designation of marriage clearly is not necessary in order to afford full protection to all of the rights and benefits that currently are enjoyed by married opposite - sex couples . ”
In other words , the reasons for denying gay and lesbian couples the right to marry that served as the “ factual ” basis for Proposition 8 are but pretexts for discrimination .
This is not to say , of course , that the federal courts would hold Proposition 8 to be in violation of the U.S. Constitution .
There are differences between the marriage ban and Colorado ’s prohibition of all sexual orientation anti-discrimination laws .
As Kennedy noted in Romer vs. Evans , Amendment 2 “ has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group . ”
Proposition 8 , in contrast , was narrowly focused on one civil right -- marriage .
Moreover , any court -- especially our current U.S. Supreme Court -- may be reluctant to rule that Californians do not have the power to amend their own state Constitution as a remedy to a judicial interpretation of that very same document .
Yet the Colorado and California initiatives are alike in their essence .
Each is , to quote Kennedy , “ a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake , something the equal protection clause does not permit . ”
Proposition 8 was explicitly designed to relegate hundreds of thousands of Californians to an inferior legal and social status .
Many gay - rights activists are wary of the current Supreme Court , but five of the justices who formed the majority in Romer vs.
Evans remain on the bench .
As with so many cases , a ruling likely would hinge on the views of Kennedy , and there is no reason to believe that his judicial opinion has changed in any fundamental way .
Besides , any constitutional challenge will take years to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court .
By that time , the broader political change that swept over the nation Nov. 4 may have reached the Supreme Court as well .
But even if it has n’t , this 12 - year - old precedent from a conservative high court could be the key to reaffirming that fundamental civil rights must be available to all citizens , regardless of race , sexual orientation or other intrinsic human qualities .

With his heavy - handed crusade against online child pornography , New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo has already crushed more than a little free speech , all but destroying America 's connection to Usenet newsgroups .
And now he 's eying ISP - level porn - blocking hardware that would run roughshod over the country 's wiretapping laws .
As reported by msnbc , Cuomo 's office recently sent AOL an anti-porn business proposal from Bright Digital Networking , an Australian company once accused of distributing spyware .
According to the PowerPoint proposal ( PDF warning ) , Bright Digital offers deep packet inspection hardware - dubbed CopyRouter - that would identify and block known porn images by sniffing every single file passing over an ISP 's network .
Cuomo's office did not respond to a request for comment .
But the office told msnbc it was not promoting Bright Digital 's technology , saying it was merely sharing Bright Digital proposal with a committee of ISP representatives " brainstorming " new ways to combat child pornography on the net .
A coalition of seven big - name tech outfits - including AOL , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , Google , Earthlink , United Online , and Verizon - works closely with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) , a private organization that maintains a child porn black list on behalf of ISPs across the country .
AOL also received the Bright Digital proposal directly from NCMEC - whose efforts dovetailed with Cuomo 's grandstanding anti-porn crusade early this year .
NCMEC CEO and president Ernie Allen said he can't speak for Cuomo offices , but in a conversation with The Reg , he said he forwarded the CopyRouter proposal to AOL merely to get an opinion .
" What [ Bright Digital ] was doing came to our attention and the PowerPoint was sent to me , " he told us .
" I sent it to the guy who coordinates our technology coalition and is an associate general counsel AOL .
I said ' I just got this .
Do n't know anything about it .
Let me know what you think . '
" There is no plan or intent on our part to proceed with anything like [ Bright Digital 's technology ] at all .
We have not even met the people involved with the company .
We were just trying to evaluate a technology that appeared to have some potential interest . "
According to John Morris , general counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology , a well - known net watchdog , CopyRouter would run afoul US anti-wiretapping laws .
" It would be plainly illegal for an ISP to use this technology , " he said during a phone interview .
" The ISP would be violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act , which prevents private wiretapping of electronic communications .
" For an ISP to be scanning all this communication between private individuals that the ISP is not a party , that is unquestionably a wiretap . "
Even if an ISP were to obtain consent from its users , Morris says , the technology would violate various state laws .
" [ Some state laws ] require ' two - party consent ' - in other words , consent from both the sender and recipient of the communication . "
Over the summer , attorney general Cuomo pressured six of the country 's largest ISPs - AOL , AT&T , Comcast , Time Warner , Sprint , and Verizon - into signing his very own anti-child porn " code of conduct . "
In doing so , the ISPs agreed to rid their servers of images blacklisted by NCMEC and shutdown certain Usenet newsgroups housing such images .
Cuomo even went so far as to threaten Comcast with legal action if it did n't sign the pact .
And many of these ISPs felt compelled to nix access to all newsgroups .
" We 're very concerned about what Cuomo did in the newsgroup area with ISPs .
Were a government official to require an ISP to take down newsgroups , that would clearly be a violation of the First Amendment , " Morris told us , referring to the Constitutional amendment that protects free speech .
" The notion that what the ISPs did was voluntary was dubious .
He has made it clear that he is willing to directly threaten service providers . "
Because of Cuomo's actions over the summer , Morris questions whether the New York AG is pushing ISPs toward technologies like CopyRouter .
" Is it appropriate for a government official to be coercing companies into doing things that would violate the law ?
The answer , quite clearly , is that it is not . "
For what it 's worth , Bright Digital Networks owns Altnet , one of the companies that famously piggybacked ad software atop the free P2P file - sharer Kazaa early in the decade .
The adware - which nabbed unused bandwidth and processing power from user PCs in an effort to grab ad dollars - was often identified as spyware by anti-spyware tools . ®

Police have turned to satellite technology to hunt green - fingered crooks who grow marijuana in suburban backyards , on farms or on Crown land .
With most outdoor crops maturing over the next four months , police are increasingly relying on Google Earth to identify cannabis crops , which can be worth up to $ 2500 a plant .
A Victoria Police spokeswoman has confirmed that Google Earth is a tool in the battle against outdoor growers and has helped with several recent investigations .
A senior member of Victoria 's drug tasking unit told The Sunday Age the Big Brother technology would be used more when satellite images were updated more frequently .
" The detail is extremely good and allows us to pick up small plots of cannabis virtually anywhere , " the source said .
" The clarity is improving all the time , and I think it 's something we 'll probably use more down the track . "
Rumor has it that Strike Entertainment is talking about picking up the rights to John Carpenter 's They Live .
This fills me with mixed emotions , because They Live is full of great moments ( like a newsstand filled with black and white subliminal messages embedded into the magazines and papers ) .
But at the same time , how do you recreate such cheesetastic " I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum " lines and fight scenes ?
It 's impossible , unless you follow these simple rules .

Before everyone jumps out a window , I 'd just like to point out that Strike Entertainment is the production company that came out with Children of Men and helped with Slither , two movies that were tremendously enjoyable in their own very different ways .
So there 's still hope for a remake about a down - on - his - luck wrestler , no construction worker , who gets his mits on pair of magical sunglasses that reveal a secret alien race living among us and breeding the human race into slavery .
The Rules For Remaking They Live
1 : The role of Nada MUST be replaced by a wrestler ( I'm open to The Rock Dwayne Johnson , but would prefer someone else ) .
Advertisement
2 : Roddy Piper MUST appear in the movie somewhere , what he 's not busy .
If not as the lead , then as his dad or the creepy preacher .
3 : Keith David should come back as Frank , because he has n't aged a day .
4 : The Magical Sunglasses may NOT be adorable hipster Ray - Bans .
5 : The one liners have to be one upped in this .
I do n't know if someone can top , " I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass ... and I 'm all out of bubblegum , " but they should at least try , like Bond did with the martini , " do I give a damn " line .
Is this possible ?
I 'm not sure but they need to actually respect lines like this .
Sit down with a lot of alcohol and drugs and come up with something that can at least live up to the original .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
6 : The five minute fight scene — this is hard .
I say , should the producers or director stray from the amazing plot that is a subliminal alien take over and create new characters or make Nada a woman ( ugh it hurts to even think that , but we have to assume the worst ) this would be a great place to give a tip - of - the - hat to the original .
Recreate the five minute fight shot for shot , no matter how far the remake strays .
Sure it 's been done but that 's no reason for it to be neglected .
But until directors or a screenwriter is announced we 'll all just have to hope and pray that this movie remake or whatever they will do to it will be respected .

It All Out ( kind of ) :

DIGG THIS
In 1985 , the Board of Directors of Coca - Cola committed one of the biggest marketing gaffes in history .
After decades of establishing their product as " The Real Thing , " they accepted the findings of their research team that discovered a taste people preferred in blind tests , and proudly announced that they had improved the formula .
The New Coke was an absolute disaster .
The anger of the consuming public was so great that they had to eventually accept hundreds of millions in losses and figure out a way of reversing their course .
They announced the return of " Coke Classic , " to give people a choice , and then quietly shelved the New Coke once they had gotten rid of as much of the stuff as possible .
Now , far be it from me to describe the Libertarian Party of 1971 to 2000 as a best - seller like Coke .
Anyone who measures success by the election of LP members to office should have long ago given up and gone somewhere else ( the Republican or Democratic parties , if they have any common sense ) .
Still , it was a far more effective brand than people think it was : it served as a feeder organization for the entire movement , and many non-political libertarians of today can trace their first contact with libertarianism to the Libertarian Party .
It had and has an intellectual respectability within the field of academia and the blogosphere , and some within the field of journalism .
Well , we blew it .
In a year that screamed for an alternative , we were virtually ignored , and in a year that had thousands of young , idealistic people energized , we failed to convince them that we are the only logical home for the Ron Paul Revolution .
I think it is because we failed to defend our brand .
We do n't all want exactly the same thing , but we 're reasonably close .
What I want is a society with as little aggression as the real ( not a fantasy ) world can provide .
In my view , the most practical society will be based on private property anarchism , but if you put me in a room with Libertarian Party Founder David Nolan , who is explicitly a limited government libertarian , you 'll probably find that there is n't a dime 's worth of difference in our actual positions ( with the possible exception of immigration ) , and our differences are mainly in how we predict societies with libertarian sensibilities will address security , dispute resolution , and collective defense .
In my view , a society of people committed to mutual respect will find a way to resolve these issues peacefully , and one reason I 'm an anarchist is that I do n't believe we can come to a single agreement : limited government is the theory that free market capitalism is best protected by a socialist monopoly .
As an admirer of Friedrich Hayek , I do n't think any of us CAN know how a free society will solve all the serious problems facing a free society , and I do n't trust anyone who claims to know .
Even me .
What all members of the Libertarian Party want is an appealing and DISTINCT brand that will attract people to libertarianism .
Now , I happen to think that anyone who works within the LP has already made a decision to forego electoral success , but I would n't mind being proved wrong and , in any event , neither an educational nor an electoral strategy has a snowball 's chance in hell of succeeding unless libertarianism is an inspiring and unique brand , incapable of being confused with either Republican conservatism or Democratic progressivism .
I do n't think we 've ever tried hard enough to brand it properly .
Our radical past is a myth .
The LP before 2006 was NOT the product of decades of explicitly radical campaigns based on the Rothbardian platform of the LP .
To this day , there has never been a presidential campaign that promoted anarcho - capitalism , and LP candidates who internally identified as radicals have , with rare exceptions , pretty much been as loathe to campaign on their ideal society as non-radicals ( I blame the misinterpreted and now - dead Dallas Accord for some of this , but not all ) .
Similarly , the 2008 presidential campaign is NOT an example of the strategy recommended by the " reform " wing of the LP , as I understand it : they are every bit as eager as radical members to have libertarianism stand out , and not be viewed as merely a principled version of conservativism .
My view is that we must renew and strengthen our brand as the only consistent advocate of liberty , and that we must remain absolutely vigilant that we not appear to be a form of conservativism ( or progressivism ) .
To my fellow radicals , I think it is time we accepted the less comprehensive platform on a permanent basis , working only to improve it where it strays from plumb - line libertarianism ( as I believe it does implicitly in the tax plank and explicitly in the immigration plank ) .
To my friends in the reform wing , I think it is time you accepted the pledge and the Statement of Principles as keys to our brand , the Party of Principle .
Applied to issues , let me sketch out what I see the implications on a national level of a libertarian who wants a brand that is neither conservative nor progressive .
Foreign Policy —
An end to military intervention in other countries AND an absolute stand in favor of global free trade .
Health —
The abolition of restrictions on drugs and treatments AND the abolition of government subsidies for health care expenditures .
Economics —
An end to coercively financed poverty welfare AND an end to corporate welfare .
I do think reformers should acknowledge the Law of Unintended Consequences .
I have enough respect for many of you to know that you did n't want the absurd platform that came out of Portland in 2006 but , absent your strategy , it would n't have happened .
Many of you did n't want Barr to be our nominee but , absent your strategy , he would n't have been the nominee .
Acknowledge that .
Let me also caution my fellow radicals about People Who Live in Glass Houses .
You talk a good game about other people not being open about the full implications of libertarianism , and you were eager to fight for a comprehensive platform in Denver , but I spent a lot of time browsing candidate web sites and reading newspaper clippings , and with rare exceptions , I could n't tell you which candidates were the radicals if my life depended on it .
When it comes to radicalism , either put up or shut up ( for the record , you are all hereby invited to hold my feet to the fire on this issue as I expand my site , Anarchy Without Bombs , over the next several months : I 'm human , and sometimes I 'm weak , so if you catch me waffling at www.anarchywithoutbombs.com, I will be ever - so - grateful for your correction of my heresy ) .
I think the Ron Paul Youth are still up for grabs : their idealism will not be given a chance in the Republican Party , and they are largely pro-choice and pro-immigrant , inspired by Ron Paul primarily because of his courageous advocacy of a non-interventionist foreign policy .
They are not conservatives .
We still have the opportunity to inspire them to our side ( especially once the Obama Presidency gets going and starts disappointing ) .
We 'll only do it if we restore the libertarian brand .

The Best of Less Antman
We just bought a new HP OfficeJet J6480 multi-function - device .
It ’s a network ( wired or wireless ) connected printer , scanner , fax , copier , with a duplexer and page feeder .
This is the story of how we got it and how it worked in conjuction with Linux and OSX computers .
At the end of 2008 our HP OfficeJet 7310 multi-function printer / scanner / fax started having problems .
The scanner started to make the left side of all scanned images green .
This of course meant that the scanner , copier , and fax were basically useless , which left the printer .

Mukasey Tries To Steer Obama Away From Probing Torture , spying

Since he replaced disgraced Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last year , Michael Mukasey has stonewalled every attempt made by Congress to investigate the Bush administration ’s most controversial policies related to the so - called global war on terror .
Now Mukasey is taking his loyalty to President George W. Bush even further : by publicly declaring there is no legal basis to prosecute current and former administration officials for authorizing torture , domestic surveillance , and certainly no reason for President George W. Bush to issue blanket pardons when he leaves the White House in January to the individuals who implemented those policies .
“ There is absolutely no evidence that anybody who rendered a legal opinion , either with respect to surveillance or with respect to interrogation policies , did so for any reason other than to protect the security in the country and in the belief that he or she was doing something lawful , ”  Mukasey said during a roundtable discussion with reporters Wednesday .
“ In those circumstances , there is no occasion to consider prosecution and there is no occasion to consider pardon .
“ If the word goes out to the contrary , then people are going to get the message , which is that if you come up with an answer that is not considered desirable in the future you might face prosecution , and that creates an incentive not to give an honest answer but to give an answer that may be acceptable in the future .
It also creates some incentive in people not to ask in the first place . ” 
That statement appears to be a thinly veiled warning to the incoming Obama administration to steer clear of pursuing Bush administration or Justice Department officials who may have committed crimes related to the administration ’s decision to approve torture and domestic surveillance .
But Rep. John Conyers , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , immediately took issue with the “ breadth ”  of Mukasey ’s statement “ and the blanket conclusion that everyone involved in approving these policies believed they were acting within the law . ” 
Conyers sent Mukasey a three - page letter Thursday reminding Mukasey that reams of evidence in the public domain backed up by testimony from career military and law enforcement officials that show top White House officials may have in fact broken the law by authorizing torture and domestic surveillance .
“ The public record reflects ample warning to Administration officials that its legal approach was overreaching and invalid , such as repeated objections by military lawyers to Department legal opinions on interrogation issues and the stark warning by then - Deputy Attorney General [ James ]
Comey that the Department would be ashamed if the world learned of the legal advice it had given on torture issues , ”  says Conyers letter , which was also signed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler , the chairman of the subcommittee on The Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties .
War Crimes
Indeed , Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba , who led the wide - ranging abuse investigation at Abu Ghraib , said “ there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes , ”  he concluded .
“ The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account . ” 
Conyers added , “ Looked at another way , is it your view that the CIA attorney who reportedly told Guantanamo interrogators that Department legal guidance boiled down to “ If the detainee dies you ’re doing it wrong – or the Department lawyer who advised him – justifiably believed that approach comported with the law ? ” 
Conyers was referring to documents made public during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee this year where , Jonathan Fredman , chief counsel to the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center , discussed with U.S. military officials how interrogators could use the “ wet towel ”  technique , also known as waterboarding , against detainees to extract information .
“ It can feel like you ’re drowning .
The lymphatic system will react as if you ’re suffocating , but your body will not cease to function , ”  Fredman said on Oct. 2 , 2002 , during a meeting where specific techniques were reviewed and debated , according to the meeting minutes .
Fredman added that the “ wet towel ”  technique would only be defined as torture “ if the detainee dies . ” 
“ It is basically subject to perception , ”  Fredman said .
“ If the detainee dies you ’re doing it wrong . ” 
Fredman ’s comments prompted Lt. Col. Diane Beaver , then the chief military lawyer at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to respond : “ We will need documentation to protect us . ” 
Conyers ’s letter signals that there is a strong possibility his investigation into the Bush administration ’s interrogation practices will continue when the 111th Congress convenes in January .
Mukasey had stonewalled that probe , along with numerous other congressional inquiries into the Bush administration ’s counterterrorism policies , by refusing to release top - secret documents about the programs .
In fact , Mukasey rebuffed a request by Conyers in June to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether President George W. Bush and senior members of his cabinet committed war crimes by authorizing CIA and military interrogators to use harsh tactics against detainees at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq .
The extraordinary request came on the heels of an investigation conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross into the interrogation practices at Guantanamo Bay which “ documented several instances of acts of torture against detainees , including soaking a prisoner ’s hand in alcohol and lighting it on fire , subjecting a prisoner to sexual abuse and forcing a prisoner to eat a baseball . ” 
DOJ Watchdog Probing Torture Memo
Mukasey also seems to have forgotten that his own internal watchdog at the Justice Department has spent four years probing the infamous Aug.
1 , 2002 Torture Memo addressed to then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and written by former Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and signed by Yoo ’s boss Jay Bybee .
That probe , which DOJ spokesman Peter Carr said is “ ongoing ”  and will continue next year , is examining “ whether the legal advice contained in those memoranda was consistent with the professional standards that apply to Department of Justice attorneys , ”  according to H. Marshall Jarrett , the head of the agency ’s Office of Professional Responsibility , who is conducting the probe , launched in late 2004 after the Abu Ghraib prison abuses were documented .
The probe has centered on Yoo ’s use of an obscure health benefits statute from 2000 in defining torture .
That statue became the basis for authorizing enhanced interrogation methods .
Yoo and Bybee ’s legal opinion stated that unless the amount of pain administered to a detainee results in injury “ such as death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions ” than the interrogation technique could not be defined as torture .
Jack Goldsmith , the former head of the OLC , who withdrew the Torture Memo when he began his short stint at the agency in October 2003 , quickly determined that the Aug. 1 , 2002 opinion was “ sloppily written ”  and “ legally flawed ”  and withdrew the memo .
“ I reached this decision , and had begun to act on it , before I knew anything about interrogation abuses , ”  Goldsmith wrote in his book The Terror Presidency .
“ I did so because the opinions ’ errors of statutory interpretation combined with many other elements to make them unusually worrisome . ”
Bush Authorized Torture Talks
There is ongoing debate as to whether the brutal interrogation techniques first used against suspected terrorists predated the Aug. 1 , 2002 legal opinion .
In April , President George W. Bush told an ABC News reporter during an interview that he approved of meetings of a National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , whose advisers included Vice President Dick Cheney , former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , former CIA Director George Tenet and former Attorney General John Ashcroft , where these officials discussed specific interrogation techniques the CIA could use against detainees .
Rice admitted she led those high level discussions , some held in July , according to documents obtained by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Underscoring a point made in Conyers and Nadler ’s letter to Mukasey , DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine , issued a 437 - page report on the Bush administration ’s interrogation policies last spring , which found that White House officials ignored FBI concerns about the treatment of detainees .
The report singled out former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld who personally authorized the use of brutal interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay despite warnings from the FBI that the methods amounted to inhumane treatment , was possibly illegal , and would not produce reliable intelligence .
“ The FBI believed that these techniques were not getting actionable information , that they were unsophisticated and unproductive , ” Fine testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in June .
“ They raised their concerns with the Department of Defense , but the Department of Defense , from what we were told , dismissed those concerns and that no changes were made in the Department of Defense ’s strategy . ”
There are other ongoing investigations – some which may result in indictments when complete – being conducted by Mukasey ’s DOJ about the policies he claims were the result of a good faith effort by DOJ attorneys .
Spying , CIA Tape Destruction Investigation
In a semi-annual report sent to Congress this week , DOJ Inspector General Fine said he is continuing to probe the DOJ ’s involvement with the highly controversial terrorist surveillance program and the FBI ’s use and abuse of exigent letters where agents sought phone and e-mail records to determine whether any federal laws were broken .
Then there is the investigation headed by John Durham , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut , was appointed special counsel earlier this year to investigate the destruction of videotapes in 2002 that documented CIA interrogators waterboarding detainees .
Waterboarding is a technique that simulates drowning and has been regarded as torture since the days of the Spanish Inquisition .
The tapes were ordered destroyed , according to published reports , because the individuals overseeing the interrogations feared criminal prosecution if the tapes were leaked .
During his roundtable discussion Wednesday , Mukasey also refused to say whether he believed waterboarding was torture .
During his Senate confirmation hearing Mukasey refused to answer that question several times drawing criticism from lawmakers that nearly derailed his nomination to lead the Justice Department .
“ I have been asked that twice , ”  Mukasey said in response to a question about the drowning technique .
“ Once during my confirmation hearings when I was not read in on the CIA program as it then existed , and so – although I had heard of the process , did not know how and what safeguards and so on , so I could n’t comment .
“ Thereafter , I learned , as I testified , and as I believe General Hayden confirmed it , it was no longer part of the program .
Not only that , there have been since a number of other statutes including the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions
Act that overlay the standards of the anti-torture statute .
So the short answer is there is no occasion for me to comment on that .
It is not part of any program that is currently in existence . ” 
Before the taped interrogations were destroyed , however , CIA officials pressed the Justice Department ’s criminal division for assurances that they would not be prosecuted under anti-torture laws if they followed guidelines on aggressive interrogation techniques .
The officials appealed to the head of the DOJ ’s Criminal Division for guarantees .
That person was Michael Chertoff , who headed the division and is now Secretary of Homeland Security .
Three years ago , when Chertoff was facing confirmation hearings to be Homeland Security chief , the New York Times cited three senior - level government sources as describing Chertoff ’s Criminal Division as fielding questions from the CIA about whether its officers risked prosecution if they employed certain harsh techniques .
“ One technique the CIA officers could use under circumstances without fear of prosecution was strapping a subject down and making him experience a feeling of drowning , ”  the Times reported .
In other words , Chertoff appears to have green - lighted waterboarding ,
Chertoff reportedly did object to some other procedures , such as death threats against family members and mind - altering drugs that would change a detainee ’s personality , the Times reported .
During his Senate confirmation hearings in February 2005 , Chertoff denied providing the CIA with legal guidance on the use of specific interrogation methods , such as waterboarding .
Rather , he said he gave the agency broad guidance in response to questions about interrogation methods .
“ You are dealing in an area where there is potential criminality , ” Chertoff said in describing his advice to the CIA .
“ You better be very careful to make sure that whatever you decide to do falls well within what is required by law . ”
Nevertheless , the evidence continues to build that Chertoff ’s assurances gave CIA interrogators confidence they would avoid prosecution as long as they stayed within the permissive guidelines devised by Yoo and Bybee , whose radical legal interpretations on executive power after 9/11 have been roundly condemned .
Civil Rights Groups Want Obama to Investigate , Prosecute
That evidence has lead civil rights organizations to press President - elect Barack Obama to aggressively investigate the Bush administration ’s controversial policy decisions when he is sworn in next year .
Obama has not indicated whether Eric Holder , his choice for Attorney General , would pursue any investigation into the Bush administration ’s policies , particularly issues related to torture .
In response to numerous news reports about the possibility of Obama avoiding a criminal investigation or perhaps creating a Truth Commission to look into torture , Michael Ratner , the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , saidÂ “ one of Barack Obama ’s first acts as president should be to instruct his attorney general to appoint an independent prosecutor to initiate a criminal investigation of former Bush Administration officials who gave the green light to torture . ” 
Ratner ’s organization has led the legal battle for the human rights of detainees incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for the last six years .
In an article published in the magazine The Progressive , Ratner pointed to a statement Holder made a few months ago in which the Attorney General designee said the “ American people ”  are owed “ a reckoning . ” 
“ Our government authorized the use of torture , approved of secret electronic surveillance against American citizens , secretly detained American citizens without due process of law , denied the writ of habeas corpus to hundreds of accused enemy combatants and authorized the use of procedures that violate both international law and the United States Constitution , ”  Holder said .
“ We owe the American people a reckoning . ” 
Ratner said anything less than a full - scale criminal investigation would be unacceptable .
“ If Obama and Holder want to adhere to our Constitution and uphold our highest values , they must pursue those in the Bush Administration who violated that Constitution , broke our laws , and tarnished our values , ”  Ratner wrote .
“ To simply let those officials walk off the stage sends a message of impunity that will only encourage future law breaking .
The message that we need to send is that they will be held accountable .
“ This is not Latin America ; this is not South Africa .
We are not trying to end a civil war , heal a wounded country and reconcile warring factions ..
We are a democracy trying to hold accountable officials that led our country down the road to torture .
And in a democracy , it is the job of a prosecutor and not the pundits to determine whether crimes were committed . ” 
Conyers , meanwhile , demanded Mukasey explain , in writing , how he reached the conclusion that all Justice Department employees acted lawfully .
“ If relevant Department probes – or other secret inquiries such as the widely - reported but never published 2004 Special Review by the CIA Inspector General [ into harsh interrogations ] – have been completed and provide the basis for your statement , please state when they have been completed and describe their conclusions and any actions you have taken in response , ”  Conyers and Nadler wrote .
“ If , on further reflection , you believe that your statement was in any part premature and overly broad , please so indicate ”  by Dec. 12 .
Given that there is 46 days left before Obama is sworn in , and Mukasey ’s history on responding to such requests , it ’s unlikely Conyers will receive a response before Jan. 20 .

Bush may be able to block subpoenas even after leaving office John Byrne
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This President - Elect Obama seems tepid on investigating Bush President George W. Bush appears likely to claim executive privilege in blocking subpoenas after he leaves office , according to a report Wednesday .
Three Congressional investigations into the President and his administration remain open .
They include the role of Bush advisers Karl Rove and Harriet Miers in the firing of eight US attorneys , the prosecution of former Democratic Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and the torture of detainees held by US forces .
But if Congress filed fresh subpoenas , Bush could file a court petition seeking exemption under executive privilege .
President Harry Truman claimed privilege in 1953 , a year after he left the Oval Office , and Congress eventually backed down .
Moreover , President - Elect Barack Obama may actually stand in the way of Bush probes .
All presidents generally try to preserve the powers of the presidency , and allowing release of information about his predecessor could subject Obama to unwelcome scrutiny after his own departure .
Obama has been tepid about the prospect of investigating President Bush .
He told The Philadelphia Daily News that individuals needed to distinguish " between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity . "
" If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " Obama said , adding , " I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems we 've got to solve . "
Any attempt by an ex-President Bush to block release of his papers or testimony from his aides would likely go to the Supreme Court , a legal expert told the New York Times .
" The Bush administration overstepped in its exertion of executive privilege , and may very well try to continue to shield information from the American people after it leaves office , " Sen . Sheldon Whitehouse told the Times Wednesday .
House Democrat John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , is still holding out hope .
" I intend to ensure that our outstanding subpoenas and document requests relating to the U.S. attorneys matter are enforced , " Conyers told the paper .
" I am hopeful that progress can be made with the coming of the new administration . "
Two groups , the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First , have prepared detailed reports for Obama 's team calling for a probe into abuse of detainees , the paper said .
If Bush invokes executive privilege after leaving office , no one knows what will transpire : the Supreme Court has never ruled on how far a president can block the release of his papers and testimony after leaving office .
" There is no relevant precedent on the books , " an Ohio State law professor told the Times .
Aiming to ease farm labor shortages , the Bush administration issued sweeping changes to the nation ’s agricultural guest worker program Thursday , but California growers said the action would have only a minimal effect on their needs .
The controversial rules , many months in the making by U.S. labor and immigration officials , would streamline the guest worker application process , revise the way wages are calculated , and modify requirements for demonstrating that a labor shortage cannot be filled with U.S. workers , among other changes .
Congress ’ failure to pass a comprehensive immigration bill , along with crackdowns on illegal immigrants , stimulated efforts to alter the guest worker program .
Several farm labor advocates attacked the changes , saying they would drive down wages , displace U.S. workers and reduce federal oversight of potential abuses .
But Leon R. Sequeira , the Labor Department ’s assistant secretary of policy , defended the changes as necessary to boost use of the H2A visa program , which has long been criticized as too cumbersome .

“ Wrong , wrong , wrong , ” Sequeira said of the criticism .
“ We think the reforms will improve the operation of the program for both employers and workers . ”
The revisions are expected to have little effect in California , the nation ’s largest agricultural state , whose growers employ nearly 40 % of the 1.2 million farmworkers in the U.S.
Only about 1 % of the state ’s 450,000 farmworkers are recruited through the guest worker program .
On Thursday , California farm officials said the changes would probably not lead them to significantly increase their use of the program .
“ Some changes will help us on the margins , but it does n’t change our overall focus on seeking legislation ” to legalize existing farmworkers , said Jack King , spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation , a Sacramento - based farm advocacy organization representing 91,000 members .

King said the variety of California crops and their sometimes unpredictable harvest times made it difficult to use the H2A program .
Previously , growers had to apply for workers at least 45 days before they were needed .
The new rules require them to apply 60 days in advance .
“ There is a lot of uncertainty when help will be needed in California , but under H2A you almost need a crystal ball , ” he said .
King also said the new rules did not address two major issues for California farmers : revising the housing requirement and making dairy workers eligible for the program .
California farmers had sought vouchers to help workers pay for their own accommodations rather than have to provide it for them .
Some growers who have tried to build worker housing have been opposed by their local communities , King said , and others with short - season crops such as olives find it unreasonably expensive to build housing when they require workers for only a few weeks .
California also wanted to include dairy workers in the H2A program .
Dairy products are the state ’s top commodity , but the industry requires year - round workers , who are not eligible for a program designed for temporary workers .
Advertisement
King said California growers would continue to push for farm legislation known as AgJOBS , a bipartisan bill whose guest worker provisions would eventually allow laborers to gain legal status and become U.S. citizens .
An estimated 50 % to 70 % of the nation ’s farmworkers are undocumented .
Bruce Goldstein of Farmworker Justice , a Washington - based advocacy group , said changes in the way wages were calculated would lower the current $ 9.72 hourly H2A wage in California by 18 % .
He also said U.S. workers could be paid less than foreign workers .
But Sequeira countered that the new formula was more accurate , allowing the government to consider four skill levels and more than 500 geographic areas in setting wages .
The current system of one wage is based on 18 regions .
Goldstein and other advocates also argued that the new rules would lower requirements for growers to recruit U.S. workers before turning to foreigners .
Under the old rules , Goldstein said , growers had to expend as much effort recruiting U.S. workers as foreign ones and submit detailed recruitment plans , including copies of newspaper ads , to show they could not fill their labor needs with U.S. workers .
But the new rules do not require such evidence , Goldstein said .

“ It ’s ending any meaningful oversight of the program , ” he said .
Sequeira said , however , that new safeguards would ensure that growers were complying with the law , including random audits of applications and new authority to punish violators .

Here 's my own very simple model of liquidity .
It explains why a small initial shock to asset values could have a much larger effect on equilibrium asset values by making assets less liquid .
There 's a literature based on a model of informed traders , uninformed traders , and " noise " traders ( better called " liquidity traders " ) .
Robert Waldmann knows that literature better than I do , and has a post , similar to mine , in which he also offers an explanation of the fall in liquidity .
In a previous post , I argued that assets became less liquid in the last couple of months , and that the fall in liquidity might have been a major cause of the fall in asset values .
So , why did liquidity fall ?
There are 100 people living in a country , and 100 cars , and each person owns one car .
80 of the cars are good cars , worth $ 100 .
The other 20 cars are lemons , worth only $ 50 because of higher repair bills , so the average car is worth $ 90 .
You can't tell a good car from a lemon just by looking , but after owning a car for a year you know if it 's a lemon .
Each year a random 20 people are forced to emigrate , to be replaced by 20 immigrants .
Each year there is a market , where the emigrants sell their cars to the immigrants .
If the market could be restricted to emigrants , each car would sell for $ 90 .
Unfortunately , nobody can tell the emigrants apart from those staying at home .
Stay - at - homes who own lemons would want to sell their cars , worth $ 50 , for $ 90 .
And the immigrants know this .
In equilibrium , all lemons - owners come to the market to sell their lemon , hoping to replace it with a good car from an emigrant .
We have 16 good cars from the emigrants , 4 lemons from the emigrants , and 16 lemons from the stay - at - homes , all offered for sale .
So the average value of those 36 cars is $ 2600/36=$72.22 , and that 's the price they all sell at .
The emigrants are getting ripped off , since their cars are worth $ 90 on average , but they can only sell them for $ 72.22 .
Their cars are illiquid assets .
They would n't sell them at that price unless they had to .
The 100 cars in the country seems to be worth $ 7,222 at mark - to - market accounting values , even though we know the stock of cars is really worth $ 9,000 .
Now suppose we look at an alternative universe , where there are no lemons , and all 100 cars are worth $ 100 .
The stock of cars is worth $ 10,000 in that alternative universe , whether we use mark - to - market or " true value " accounting .
And emigrants could sell their cars for exactly what they are worth ; cars would be perfectly liquid .
Now imagine we used to live in the alternative universe , with no lemons , but suddenly switched to living in the universe where 20 % of the cars are lemons .
The true value of the stock of cars falls from $ 10,000 to $ 9,000 ( a 10 % decline ) , but the market value of the cars falls to $ 7,222 ( a 27.8 % decline ) .
I think that 's part of what happened in the financial crisis , but it 's not the whole story .
It 's not just that some cars became lemons .
And it 's not just an accounting illusion , based on market prices in an unrepresentative market .
The decline in liquidity caused a decrease in the true value of cars .
Let 's complicate the model a little .
Suppose each person has a choice between buying a car and catching the bus , and chooses whichever is cheaper .
The bus costs $ 10 per year , they have a rate of time preference of 10 % per year , so will be prepared to buy a known - good car at $ 100 , if they know they can sell it at the same $ 100 when they emigrate .
Now we switch to the universe where 20 % of the cars are lemons .
Lemons cost $ 5 per year in maintenance ( good cars cost nothing ) .
Someone who knew for certain he would never emigrate would be willing to pay $ 100 for a good car , $ 50 for a lemon , and $ 90 for the average car , rather than catch the bus .
But if he knows he has a 20 % chance of emigrating per year , and will suffer a capital loss of x % on the car if he emigrates and is forced to sell it , he will have a discount rate of 10 % + 0.2 x % .
The 10 % is the rate of time preference ; the 0.2x % is the liquidity premium .
The higher discount rate reduces the amount he would pay for a car .
If someone with a 20 % chance of emigrating were to pay $ 90 for an average new car , he would face a capital loss of $ 17.78 if he sold it at $ 72.22 .
He would rather catch the bus than buy a new car at $ 90 .
So $ 90 can not be the amount he would pay .
And then neither is $ 72.22 the equilibrium price on the market .
We have to solve for all prices simultaneously .
UPDATE 14/3/2009 : Kevin Quinn has spotted a math mistake in what follows .
I switched a + for a - in the appendix .
The appendix should read :
" Let G be the value of a known - good car
Let B be the value of a known - bad car
Let A be the value of an average car in the country
Let S be the market price of cars
A = 0.8G + 0.2B
S = ( 16G + 20B ) /36
10 %G + ( not minus ) 20 % ( G - S ) = $ 10 ( comparing cost of owning good car to annual cost of bus )
10 %B + ( S - B ) + $ 5 = $ 10 ( comparing cost of owning bad car , including $ 5 maintenance , to annual cost of bus ) "
Kevin 's solutions ( and they seemed correct when I checked them ) are :
If I have the arithmetic right ( do n't trust me ) , someone would be willing to pay $ 74.58 for a good car ( with a 20 % chance of having to sell it next year for $ 61.86 ) , $ 51.69 for a lemon ( which he will definitely sell next year for $ 61.86 ) , and so $ 70 for an average car ( with a 20 % chance of being a lemon ) , rather than catch the bus .
( And if it costs $ 90 to produce a new car , Tobin 's Q is now less than one , and there will be no investment in new cars . )
Let 's recap .
Originally all cars were good , and worth $ 100 , and perfectly liquid assets .
Then 20 % of the cars turned out to be bad .
With an unchanged discount rate , based on pure time preference , the fundamental value of the average car dropped to $ 90 , but the market value , based on a market in which mostly lemons were traded , appears to be $ 72.22 .
But the discount rate will not stay unchanged , because a liquidity premium is added to the time preference premium .
The fundamental value of the average car in the stock , the amount a person would rationally pay for one of the 100 cars chosen at random , rather than catch the bus , has fallen to $ 70 .
And the market value of a car , on a market where mostly lemons are traded , has fallen to $ 61.86 .
If people did n't care about liquidity , the average car would be worth 10 % less .
If people do care about liquidity , mark - to - market accounting shows a 38 % drop in value .
This overstates the drop in value , but the 30 % drop in true value when people care about liquidity is nevertheless real .
That 's my parable of the financial crisis , and why the loss in asset value was much bigger than the shock which caused it .
And it does n't really matter if the shock was merely that we realised that 20 % of the assets had been lemons all along .
The change in perceptions caused the real value to change .
Appendix ( for anyone who wants to check my arithmetic )
Let G be the value of a known - good car
Let B be the value of a known - bad car
Let A be the value of an average car in the country
Let S be the market price of cars
A = 0.8G + 0.2B
S = ( 16G + 20B ) /36
10 %G - 20 %( G - S ) = $ 10 ( comparing cost of owning good car to annual cost of bus )
10 %B + ( S - B ) + $ 5 = $ 10 ( comparing cost of owning bad car , including $ 5 maintenance , to annual cost of bus )
bddbddb
bddbddb stands for BDD - Based Deductive DataBase .
It is an implementation of Datalog , a declarative programming language similar to Prolog for talking about relations .
What makes bddbddb unique is that it represents the relations using binary decision diagrams ( BDDs ) .
BDDs are a data structure that can efficiently represent large relations and provide efficient set operations .
This allows bddbddb to efficient represent and operate on extremely large relations - relations that are too large to represent explicitly .
We use bddbddb primarily as a tool for easily and efficiently specifying program analyses .
We represent the entire program as database relations .
Developing a program analysis becomes as simple as writing the specification for the analysis in a declarative style and then feeding that specification to bddbddb , which automatically transforms your specification into efficient BDD operations .
Using bddbddb for program analysis has a number of advantages :
First , it closes the gap between the algorithm specification and its implementation .
In bddbddb , the algorithm specification is automatically translated into an implementation , so as long as your algorithm specification is correct you can be reasonably sure that your implementation will also be correct .
and its .
In bddbddb , the algorithm specification is automatically translated into an implementation , so as long as your algorithm specification is correct you can be reasonably sure that your implementation will also be correct .
Second , because BDDs can efficiently handle exponential relations , it allows us to solve heretofore unsolved problems in program analysis , such as context - sensitive pointer analysis for large programs .
Third , it makes program analysis accessible , and dare I say it , actually fun .
Trying out a new idea in program analysis used to be confined to the realm of experts and compiler writers , and would take weeks to months of tedious effort to implement and debug .
With bddbddb , writing a new analysis is simply a matter of writing a few straightforward inference rules .
The tool takes care of most of the tedious part and helps you develop powerful program analyses easily .
bddbddb was written by John Whaley , a Ph.D. student working in the Stanford SUIF Compiler group , as part of his research with Professor Monica Lam .
He releases this software as open source with the hope that it will take program analysis to a new level by accelerating the development of new advanced analyses , enabling non-specialists to easily develop their own program analyses , and facilitating collaboration between programming language researchers .

Until the night of an office Christmas party in 1957 , Wayne Ritchie was a Marine Corps veteran , a deputy U.S. marshal and a solid citizen .
Overcome by what he later described as depression and a delusion that everyone had turned against him , he tried to hold up a bar that night in San Francisco 's Fillmore District .
Spared a prison sentence , Ritchie quit his job in disgrace , spent years fighting off suicidal urges and for more than three decades lived with guilt and self - contempt -- until a 1999 newspaper article propelled him into federal court with a lawsuit against the U.S. government that could soon go to trial .
The article was an obituary of Sidney Gottlieb , director of a CIA mind - control project called MKULTRA , in which LSD and other drugs were given to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans during the Cold War .
Ritchie believes he may have been one of the guinea pigs , especially after the diary of a federal agent involved in MKULTRA showed he may have been at the same 1957 Christmas party attended by Ritchie .
Ritchie , now 75 and living in San Jose , " felt that a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders , " said psychiatrist James S. Ketchum in a report filed in federal court this April .
" He wept when he called his brother with the news . "
Ketchum 's report , based on six hours of interviews with Ritchie last year , a review of the case records and research on drugs and the CIA , concluded the federal marshal had been a victim of the " covert administration of LSD or an LSD - like substance . "
Government lawyers said their own psychiatric expert had determined Ritchie was probably drunk and certainly was n't on LSD .
They accused Ritchie of concocting the drugging theory to cash in on publicity about MKULTRA , the subject of congressional hearings in the 1970s and a 1997 movie , " Conspiracy Theory . "
But a new ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco may have removed the major obstacles to a trial of the former marshal 's $ 12 million damage suit .
The suit claims invasion of privacy , intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision of government employees .
MIND CONTROL
MKULTRA , the government 's search for chemicals or techniques to control human consciousness , was largely a response to reports of brainwashing of American prisoners during the Korean War .
According to congressional testimony and other records , the CIA and federal narcotics agents started giving mind - altering drugs to prison volunteers as well as unsuspecting government employees and private citizens in the early 1950s and continued to do so for at least a decade .
" We tested these drugs in bars , in restaurants , in so - called massage parlors , any place where there was a drink and people were eating and drinking , " said MKULTRA operative Ike Feldman in a 1999 documentary on the Arts and Entertainment cable network .
Because of the secrecy and destruction of records , many victims were never told what happened to them , said Ritchie 's lawyer , Sidney Bender .
One unwitting subject , Army chemist Frank Olson , jumped to his death from a hotel window in 1953 under the influence of LSD that had been slipped into a glass of Cointreau .
Congress approved a $ 750,000 payment to his widow in 1976 .
The U.S. government later paid a total of $ 750,000 to settle a suit by nine Canadians who learned they had been the subjects of MKULTRA experiments during psychiatric treatment in the mid-1950s .
SUIT FAILED AT TRIAL
At least one lawsuit has gone to trial .
It ended in a government victory in 1999 .
The suit was filed by Bender on behalf of the daughter of Stanley Glickman , an American art student who suffered hallucinations and long - lasting psychiatric damage after being given a drink by a fellow American in Paris in 1952 .
Before his death in 1992 , Glickman said the stranger who gave him the drink resembled the club - footed Gottlieb , but a New York federal jury that examined government travel records decided Gottlieb had not been in Paris at the time .
Ritchie 's case may depend on the whereabouts of a man named George White , who in 1957 was a federal Bureau of Narcotics agent and ran MKULTRA in the Bay Area .
White kept a diary that read , for the day in question , " home flu -- xmas party Fed bldg Press Room . "
White was never asked about the entry before his death in 1975 , and its meaning is disputed by the opposing sides .
Ritchie argues the entry shows
White either attended the party or was in touch with other agents who were there .
The government says it shows
White stayed home .
Ritchie , then 30 , had been a deputy marshal since 1954 after five years in the Marines and a little over a year as a prison guard at Alcatraz .
At the party , he downed four or five bourbon and sodas over several hours , then returned to the marshal 's office and started feeling strange .
" I became depressed and was overcome with a sense that all my friends and acquaintances had turned against me , " he said in a court declaration .
He went outside -- where , according to the psychiatrist 's report , he seemed to be walking in a tunnel without effort and with increasing feelings of paranoia -- and stopped at several bars , where he conceived the idea of getting money for his girlfriend to buy a plane ticket to New York , something she had once mentioned in jest .
HOLDING UP THE BAR
He retrieved his two service revolvers , drove to the Fillmore bar , demanded money , got distracted and was hit over the head and knocked unconscious .
When police arrived , he tearfully asked one officer if he could spare a bullet and save the state some money .
A Chronicle story two days later was headlined , " Good Guy Fails as Bad Guy . " Ritchie pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and was fined $ 500 and given a suspended sentence .
" He remained severely depressed for at least six years , and experienced disturbing flashbacks and nightmares , " said Ketchum 's psychiatric report .
" His self - esteem was destroyed , and his lifestyle changed from that of an outgoing , cheerful and ambitious marshal to that of a guilt - ridden , self - depriving , subdued house painter , with recurrent suicidal urges . "
Ritchie painted houses for 34 years before retiring in 1992 , and now lives with his wife on his union pension and Social Security .
He said his lawyer has told him not to discuss the case .
In her ruling rejecting the government 's attempt to dismiss the suit , Chief U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said the usual deadline for such personal - injury claims -- two years after the injury occurred -- might not apply to Ritchie 's suit more than 40 years after the Christmas party .
She said the evidence could show that , because of government concealment , Ritchie had no reason to know what had happened to him before reading the 1999 obituary .
" A reasonable person who had never used LSD would not think he had been exposed to it , " the judge said in her July 1 decision .
She noted that Ritchie denied previous knowledge of MKULTRA and that the government destroyed records of the program in the 1970s .
JOB DESCRIPTION
The government also sought dismissal on the grounds that the alleged injury occurred while Ritchie was on duty at the Christmas party and was covered , at most , by workers ' compensation benefits , which Ritchie never sought .
But Patel said the normal risks of a marshal 's job do not include involuntary drugging by the CIA .
Patel did not discuss whether the evidence presented so far supported Ritchie 's LSD claim .
In a case that concerns decades - old events with scanty records and few living witnesses , that question might not be resolved even by a trial -- which , under the federal law on damage suits against the government ,
would be conducted by Patel without a jury .
The Justice Department is making a final attempt to dismiss the suit without a trial by arguing that Ritchie has presented no evidence , beyond speculation , that federal agents caused his injuries .
The motion is pending before Patel .
The government denies that Ritchie was an MKULTRA subject and says the likely explanation is the one he himself believed for more than 40 years -- that he was drunk .
They cite his admission that he often had 12 to 25 drinks on weekend nights at the time and that he had been drinking before the robbery attempt .
Psychiatrist Henry D. Abraham , in a declaration filed by the government , said Ritchie 's actions that evening showed few of the known symptoms of LSD use and included " a complicated set of planned behaviors " that would be difficult after taking the drug .
But Ketchum countered that Ritchie had never reacted that way to alcohol before and showed clear signs of LSD intoxication -- a debate that may soon be replayed in court .
Ready To Find The Perfect Hot Tub ?

Can anyone say " mission creep " ?
The military always can , which is why a new initiative to give the Pentagon an ability to surge a combat - ready force for domestic security is so worrying .
The U.S. military expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops inside the United States by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe , according to Pentagon officials .
The long - planned shift in the Defense Department 's role in homeland security was recently backed with funding and troop commitments after years of prodding by Congress and outside experts , defense analysts said .
There are critics of the change , in the military and among civil liberties groups and libertarians who express concern that the new homeland emphasis threatens to strain the military and possibly undermine the Posse Comitatus Act , a 130 - year - old federal law restricting the military 's role in domestic law enforcement .
But the Bush administration and some in Congress have pushed for a heightened homeland military role since the middle of this decade , saying the greatest domestic threat is terrorists exploiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
They can say it all they want , but that does n't make it so .
And more to the point , the Bush administration knows it .
Their analysts have already given them a half dozen scenarios involving WMD level casualties without actually using WMDs , exploiting LNG tankers , blowing up a big enough bomb next to an existing reactor or using other everday aspects of the nation 's industry and commerce .
All are easier to pull off than smuggling a bomb , or radioactives , into the country or than gathering a sizeable store of such material from domestic sources without discovery .
And the point is that predicting and preventing such attacks should be the job of civilian agencies , not the military - and so should dealing with any aftermath .
Political scientist Dr. Steven Taylor writes :
There are two key problems here .
The first is that the function of the military is n’t domestic security and second , the military is already rather busy at the moment ( and for the foreseeable future ) .
First , the military is n’t designed or trained for domestic responses .
Training for a nuclear attack or an invasion is one thing , assigning an active - duty combat brigade to a specifically domestic task is yet another .
Indeed , one of the command centers the Bush administration has green - lighted , based on Hawaii , is specifically tasked with overseeing the military 's response to an outbreak of human - strain avian flu .
Another in South Carolina is tasked with earthquake response .
No terrorists in sight .
The American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute are troubled by what they consider an expansion of executive authority .
Domestic emergency deployment may be “ just the first example of a series of expansions in presidential and military authority , ” or even an increase in domestic surveillance , said Anna Christensen of the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
And Cato Vice President Gene Healy warned of “ a creeping militarization ” of homeland security .
“ There ’s a notion that whenever there ’s an important problem , that the thing to do is to call in the boys in green , ” Healy said , “ and that ’s at odds with our long - standing tradition of being wary of the use of standing armies to keep the peace . ”
The military already gets the lion 's share of the intelligence budget - over 80 % .
Back in 2005 , even Saxby Chambliss was writing for the neocon Heritage Foundation that that was a bad idea .
Now it seems determined , in line with Bush administration policy , to grab the domestic security portfolio too .
The Dept. of Homeland Security will go right along with it too , arguing that Bush 's power as the Unitary Executive Deciderer In Chief outweighs Posse Commitatus .
The dynamic has been clear since the earliest days of the Bush presidency , according to an essay for the Naval postgraduate school 's Strategic Insights magazine back in 2003 .
America 's post -9/11 obsession with securing the " homeland " shifted the domestic political landscape , including American civil - military relations .
The American model of civil - military relations has been characterized by a contract according to which the military defends the nation 's borders while domestic police keep order at home .
" On September 11 , " in the words of DoD Transformation " czar " Arthur K. Cebrowski , " America 's contract with the Department of Defense was torn up and a new contract is being written . "
Over at Hullabaloo , DDay writes :
This goes to the other side of how this nation is changing radically - with a series of programs conceived largely by executive fiat that weakens civil liberties protections and subverts the plain letter of the law .
This includes illegal wiretapping of American citizens , indefinite detention of prisoners without charges , and the dehumanizing practice of torture , which is ineffective and deeply dangerous to the lives of our troops .
And " b " at Moon of Alabama notes America 's single - minded reliance on the military as the hammer for all nails and wonders , as do many of us , whether Obama and his centrist hawk national security team will really try to rollback such egregious abuses of power , or simply embrace them .

MONTERREY , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexican gunmen have kidnapped a U.S. security consultant who negotiated the release of dozens of kidnap victims in Latin America .
Gunmen abducted Felix Batista outside a restaurant last Wednesday in the relatively safe northern industrial city of Saltillo in Coahuila state , Mexican authorities and his employer , security consultancy ASI Global , said on Monday .
Batista , a Miami - based Cuban American credited with negotiating the release of victims abducted by Colombian rebels , was snatched after he stepped outside the restaurant , answering a call on his cellular phone , Mexican media said .
The U.S. embassy in Mexico City said it was investigating and declined to comment further .
“ He may have been targeted by organized crime in an attempt to show their power .
Saltillo is not a kidnapping hot spot , ” said a source at Coahuila state attorney general ’s office .
Batista ’s employer , Houston - based ASI Global , denied Mexican media reports that he was a former FBI agent and said he was on a private trip in Coahuila state near Texas , giving seminars on security .
“ We have requested help from the FBI and the Mexican authorities , ” said ASI Global ’s President Charlie LeBlanc .
Hundreds of people are kidnapped in Mexico every year and the number of victims has increased sharply as drug gangs , under pressure from President Felipe Calderon ’s army - backed crackdown , seek new revenues to fund their operations .
Coahuila lawmakers last week sent a bill to Mexico ’s Congress to change the constitution to allow the death penalty for kidnappers who kill their captives .
More than 5,300 people have been killed in drug violence across Mexico this year as cartels fight each other over smuggling routes to the United States and clash with Mexican security forces seeking to restore security .

29 A 5th generation Mormon and young woman - -

35 A Mormon who picks what he wants to believe in - -
He writes , " My " recovery " is different from most of your contributors , but I do n't condemn any Mormon who has to leave in order to " recover " .
It is not easy being part of a cover - up church . "
36 Why it is so difficult to leave - -
He writes , " I recently needed to know I was n't alone when my wife and I woke up ....
I wo n't give you another life travel log , but thought I 'd instead demonstrate why I think it is so difficult to leave the Mormon faith . "
37 Has it been easy ?
- No - -
" We did n't leave the church because of sin in our lives ; we left because we could no longer believe , support , or condone the doctrine , the policies , and the practices of the Mormon Church .
Our lives have been full and rewarding contrary to what the Church teaches about all the bad things that will happen if a member leaves the Church . "
38 A former missionary to France - - " I asked God every possible question .
Perhaps we will laugh about it now , but back in 1982 I asked God about dinosaurs , about evolution ....
I asked God many questions about more ordinary aspects of LDS doctrine as well . "
39 He looks forward to learning - - " Although our stories are different , the one thing that we all hold in common is a devotion to truth , even if it means significantly altering our lives , disrupting relationships and taking a plunge into the great , wide unknown . "

One talks about being a pagan and why .

43 A graduate of MIT and now a young wife - - " I am still learning not to be afraid of life ...
I grew up thinking that God would n't hear your prayers if you did n't pray the Mormon way .
It 's only recently that I see that is n't true . "
44 A stereotypical Mormon and now a successful business leader - -

An excellent summary .

This is an excellent and sad account of a Mormon temple experience .
46 A Mormon for 31 years - -
" I loved reading everything on Joseph Smith and gave firesides to the youth , giving spiritual and funny events of his life .
I even named my first born son after the prophet Joseph . "
47 The church wants to be viewed as mainstream - - " The LDS church is packaged nicely , very nicely .
... very homogeneous ....
Most of the chapels have a similar look and feel .
Even the lettering used within the church must conform to standards ...
It works hard on its image . "
48 The wife of story # 46 tells about her experiences - -
She , along with her 4 children , left Mormonism .
She writes , ' We had a stake president tell us , " There is n't a damn thing true about the church , but it 's the best place to raise a family " ...'

Lots of documentation .

Good reading if you come from a long line of Mormons .
52 He left Mormonism when he was a missionary - - " The more I read from the church history , the worse I felt .
The more I studied , thought and prayed , the more problems I found with the church and what it claimed to be .
It became harder and harder for me to go out and teach . "
53 She lost 2 of her adult daughters when she left - -

56 Mormon women and depression - -
She writes , " I have realized that I have so much potential , and that I will not be spending eternity with my husband 's other wives , being eternally pregnant ...
I 'm certain than depression among women in the LDS church is rampant , and I feel that being free of the burden of constant pain and guilt will be one of the greatest accomplishments of my life . "
57 A Student at BYU - Winter 1997 - - " I realized that testimonies , no matter how strong or seemingly undeniable , are not unique to one system of beliefs .
People disagree about what they actually do represent , but I think that " the spirit " is absolutely and completely created and controlled by the individual .. "
58 A young married man and returned missionary - - " So I guess my question is , why should a Mormon even bother to pray ?
A Mormon already has all the answers ...
And if you should choose to pray about an issue , and find that your answer is not in line with what the church teaches , you can rest assured that it is you who is wrong . "
59 A non-LDS mother writes about her son's experience - -
This mother writes about her son who was a convert to Mormonism .
She says , " Imagine raising a child for 26 years and being banned from the marriage ceremony !!
There were no plans to make , no communication with the bride or her family , no participation , no joy . "
60 A Finn now living in the US relates his life 's experience - - He is former missionary .
" It 's difficult to convey how different I feel today compared to earlier in life .
I feel much more comfortable and content with my life .
I do not feel in the least like there is something missing , as , in some ways , I did back then .
I enjoy life . "
61 Sexual abuse by local Mormon leaders - - Sadly this is very common in Mormonism .
The LDS church is adept at hiding incidents like those told in this story to maintain its public image .
Few Mormons realize how common this is .
There are now resources available for women who have suffered abuse from LDS religious leaders .
62 A former missionary to Japan - -
He is still a Mormon .
" Mormon life ( meetings , programs , scouts , tithing , administration , superiority ) personally , has left me unfulfilled .
Service , teaching , friendship , raising a good family , etc. , have been fulfilling .
I no longer believe that Mormonism has a patent on these things . "
63 A molecular biologist at BYU - -
He writes about his Mormon life and also his work at BYU .
" I worked in a laboratory at BYU ( which was funded in part by FARMS ) where I isolated and sequenced human DNA segments .
Molecular biology , without exception , confirms the anthropological findings that the American Indians are an Asian population -- absolutely not Semitic [ Jewish ] ! "
64 A professional writer and a scholar - -
He writes about LDS public relations , Chinese leaders and the Mormon hierarchy and other subjects .
He states , " I was astonished at the lengths to which LDS officials would go , and the depths to which they would descend , in order to deal with a minor public relations problem .
This is the ' one true church ' ? "
65 A young man who looks at his upbringing - - Fear of eternal failure and separation from one 's family are the most common tools used by the church to keep people in line .
It play 's on a child 's sense of dependency on his or her parents and community , causing a sense of separation anxiety at the thought of going against the system .
In fact , it 's almost unimaginable to think of leaving .
66 He left Mormonism in 1958 - - " There were no black people in the church ( at least none were visible ) .
Garments were in a single piece .
The temple endowment ceremony still had the death penalties , the minister , the five points of fellowship .
The Book of Abraham papyrus scrolls were still missing ...
Why , after all these years , would I still be concerned about Mormonism ? "
67 A family divided due to Mormonism - - " There is no open , free exchange of ideas in this [ Mormon ] family ...
You do n't share your personal beliefs , fears , doubts , dreams , concepts , theories , discoveries , attitudes , opinions , and views because it will just upset mom and dad .
You keep your personal , family , and marital problems locked tightly away from prying eyes ... "
69 Leaving after 19 years - - I have n't the words to make you understand the sadness , frustration and sense of betrayal ...
I said , " Heavenly Father , this church is causing me pain .
These men are not hearing me .
These men have hurt me and others .
I feel these men are lying to me -- that they have lied countless times in the past . "
70 Things I wished I had known - - A wonderful essay .
He says , " God will not condemn an honest and sincere thought or question .
Truth does not begin with an answer on behalf of which all questions must constantly rearrange themselves .
If I want the truth I must begin with questions , fearlessly , and let the answers arrive accordingly . . "

75 See her web site on Women and Mormonism - -
She is an active participant in our online group .
She writes , " In the ex-Mormon community , I found the healing that I had been seeking .
I learned of the historical contradictions , twisted doctrinal thinking , and most important , I found people who felt like I did . "
76 Spousal Abuse - -
" What happens when you have raised your children in this belief system ... how do you put the brakes on and say , ' Hey kids , I was wrong ? '
What happens to you emotionally , mentally , spiritually , and physically when you discover that your life has been based on a lie ? "

If that headache plaguing you this morning led you first to a Web search and then to the conclusion that you must have a brain tumor , you may instead be suffering from cyberchondria .
On Monday , Microsoft researchers published the results of a study of health - related Web searches on popular search engines as well as a survey of the company ’s employees .
The study suggests that self - diagnosis by search engine frequently leads
Web searchers to conclude the worst about what ails them .
The researchers said they had undertaken the study as part of an effort to add features to Microsoft ’s search service that could make it more of an adviser and less of a blind information retrieval tool .
Yes , used tea leaves makes outstanding compost .
Finely broken tea can be mixed in directly to soil , and coarser , large tea leaves can either be used as a coarse leaf mulch , or added to a compost pile or heap where they will quickly break down into nutrient - rich soil .
Be cautious , however , when using tea bags .
Many tea bags are not biodegradable .
Some are made of nylon , and others may be made of paper but have plastic sealant used to seal the bags , and may not break down completely .
It is safest to either use loose - leaf tea ( the more sustainable option ) , or to break open the tea bags before composting the contents of them .
The G20 says there must be a global solution to current problems
World finance chiefs are looking to increase the role of emerging nations , as part of reforms to tackle the current crisis .
Finance ministers and central bank presidents from the world 's 20 major economies have been meeting at a G20 summit in Sao Paulo in Brazil .
World Bank President Robert Zoellick said countries see the need for better coordination towards economic issues .
" All of us know it 's a meeting at a time of historic challenge , " he said .
" The food and fuel crises of the recent years have now been supplemented by the blow of a financial crisis .
Virtually no country has escaped ... all countries are moving into a danger zone . "
' Developing country voices '
Emerging nations want to see the G20 grouping - which includes the G7 and the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China ) plus others - enhanced and also elevated to a heads - of - state and heads - of - government level , above the present finance ministerial status .
In October Mr Zoellick said the G20 system was " too unwieldy " .
In Brazil , he has now said that a new grouping of nations must emerge .
" We need to modernise the multilateral system to bring in the important developing country voices such as Brazil ...
I think over the next two years we are going to see some real changes to the global system , " he said .
Brazil and other emerging - market nations do not feel that under the current set - up they have sufficient representation within bodies like the IMF and the World Bank .
France is suggesting bringing emerging economies on board as members of the G8 club of industrialized nations .
' Real change ' Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said there was acceptance the G7 group of elite nations was no longer capable of working alone .
" It is time for a pact between governments to build a new financial architecture for the world , " he said .
" This is a global crisis and it demands global solutions . "
He said nations must " avoid temptations to take unilateral measures , " and stressed that " new universal mechanisms are needed " that have to be worked out in concert .
" The crisis gives an opportunity for real changes , " he said , adding : " We cannot , we must not and do n't have the right to fail . "
On Friday the Bric nations had called for reform of institutions like the IMF to give more influence to developing economies .
China and the Gulf states have trillions of dollars in reserves that could help the IMF help smaller countries withstand the present turmoil .

Looks like the economic crunch has come to Adobe , too .
In releasing its preliminary fourth quarter earnings , the software company said it plans to lay off 600 full - time positions , or about 8 percent of its workforce .
The cuts are driven by poor sales for Creative Suite 4 , which includes core Adobe products like Acrobat and Photoshop , which was released in October .
This should n’t be a huge shock — with the economy in the tank , and copies of CS4 selling for more than $ 1,000 ( or hundreds of dollars for an upgrade ) I ’m betting a lot of folks decided their old copies of Creative Suite 3 would continue to serve them just fine .
Adobe says its Q4 revenue will probably be between $ 912 and $ 915 million , or between 45 and 46 cents per share , below targeted revenue of $ 922 and $ 955 million .
It also lowered its guidance for the new quarter to between $ 800 million and $ 850 million .
With less money coming in , Adobe says it is restructuring the company to reduce operating costs and “ fine - tune the focus of our resources on key strategic priorities . ”
Before the Guinness Book of World records took on the format of a coffee table book , I used to read it cover to cover every year .
Back then the categories seemed to be pretty straight forward .
Tallest , shortest , heaviest , fastest etc .
Now it seems many categories are a little contrived just to keep the book fresh and different .
However I do have to admit some are quite interesting to watch .
So here is a list of 10 world records that are different and entertaining .
10 Lying With Live Cockroaches
I ’m putting this at the number 10 spot just to get it out of the way .
This guy lays down in a glass coffin while people pour a record amount of cockroaches on him .
It is simply astonishing what people will do to get mentioned in a book .
9 French Kissing
I know this is a terrible transition – going from cockroaches to French kissing – but I could n’t rate this any better than 9 because it really did n’t take a lot of talent to accomplish , just good organization skills as well as being fearless to the possibility of getting mono or worse .
Talk about swapping spit .
8 Head Spins
This guy does 124 head spins with no hands break dance style .
Tylenol anyone ?
7 Slam dunk off a trampoline
These guys take their slam dunks off of a trampoline distance records very seriously .
6 Motorcycle Jump to a Moving Truck
I think this might be a case of taking a neat stunt and trying to turn it into a world record of some kind .
Nevertheless it ’s fun to watch plus it is replayed from every angle known to man .
5 Consecutive Three Pointers
Ok , I admit this is not the most exciting clip in the world to watch but I think it is the most incredible feat on the list .
This guy ’s name is Fred Newman , he is 60 years old , and in this clip he sinks 209 three pointers in a row !
Apparently he ’s also made 1,000 free throws in a row and he ’s made 88 in a row blindfolded .
VIEWING TIP :
The first basket looks pretty much like the other 208 .
So I would suggest after watching the first few baskets fast forward it to the end of the clip so you can see him miss on the 210th shot .
He seems dumbfounded .
4 House Speed Building
I thought this was pretty incredible especially when you consider the fact that it takes me two days just to repair some shingles on my roof .
In this world record , Habitat for Humanity builds a house including landscaping in just over 3 hours .
3 Highest Vocal Note by a Male
In this clip we see Adam Lopez – an Australian .
He sings a note higher than D7 ( the highest note on a piano ) .
The host of the show actually asks this guy if he still has his testicles .
2 Freeflying
I was going to avoid your typical skydiving world records on this list where a bunch of people jump out of a plane and fly in some kind of formation .
This however is quite different .
This is called “ Freeflying . ”
Instead of falling belly to earth as an average skydiver would do these people fall vertically .
It really has an eerie look to it .
In some of the camera angles it looks like you are walking in on a ghostly party gathering .
When falling this way it increases the freefall speed so since most parachutes are not designed to be opened at these speeds freeflyers must transition back to the belly to earth position and slow down their descent for several seconds before deploying their parachute .
This was a world record for largest Vertical Formation and was set on August 3 , 2007 over Chicago .
1 Rolling an Orange with your Nose
Terminal 4 at JFK International Airport was the unlikely location for 21 - time Guinness record holder Ashrita Furman ’s latest attempt to make history .
Furman was attempting to break the Guinness record of 29 minutes for rolling an orange with his nose for one mile .
Although rolling an orange with ones nose may look amusing , getting in record - setting form is serious business , said Furman .
“ It ’s down to 29 minutes for the mile and it ’s actually very fast , it ’s a very intense record and so it ’s a challenge to me even though it ’s silly so hopefully it ’ll work out . ”
After 24 minutes and 34 seconds , the orange and then Furman entered the record books , squashing the old record by over 3 minutes .
It was the first for the orange , but Furman ’s 87th time in the Guinness book .

Anti-gay , yet quite pro-recycling

Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell is getting attention for a widely disseminated column in which denounces both affirmative action and marriage equality .
We , however , have one primary reaction to the piece .
We want to know :
Why did n't the numerous outlets that printed Sowell 's words just invest in a Xerox machine instead ?
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 11/2008 :
The argument that current marriage laws " discriminate " against homosexuals confuses discrimination against people with making distinctions among different kinds of behavior .
All laws distinguish among different kinds of behavior .
What other purpose does law have ?
While people may be treated the same , all their behaviors are not .
Laws that forbid bicycles from being ridden on freeways obviously have a different effect on people who have bicycles but no cars .
But this is not discrimination against a person .
The cyclist who gets into a car is just as free to drive on the freeway as anybody else .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 8/2006 :
The " equal protection of the laws " provided by the Constitution applies to people , not actions .
Laws exist precisely in order to discriminate among different kinds of actions .
When the law permits automobiles to drive on highways but forbids bicycles from doing the same , that is not discrimination against people .
A cyclist who gets off his bicycle and gets into a car can drive on the highway just like anyone else .

Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 3/2000 :
Homosexuals were on their strongest ground when they argued that what happens between consenting adults is nobody else 's business .
Now they want to make it everybody 's business by requiring others to acquiesce in their unions and treat them as they would other unions , both in law and in social practice .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 3/2004 :
Homosexuals were on their strongest ground when they said that what happens between " consenting adults " in private is none of the government 's business .
But now gay activists are taking the opposite view , that it is government 's business — and that government has an obligation to give its approval .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 8/2006 :
Homosexuals were on their strongest ground when they said that the law had no business interfering with relations between consenting adults .
Now they want the law to put a seal of approval on their behavior .
But no one is entitled to anyone else 's approval .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 11/2008 :
Gays were on their strongest ground when they said that what they did was nobody else 's business .
Now they are asserting a right to other people 's approval , which is wholly different .
None of us has a right to other people 's approval .

Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 1/2005 :
Oliver Wendell Holmes said that the life of the law is not logic but experience .
Marriage laws have evolved through centuries of experience with couples of opposite sexes — and the children that result from such unions .
Society asserts its stake in the decisions made by restricting the couples ' options .
Society has no such stake in the outcome of a union between two people of the same sex .
Transferring all those laws to same - sex couples would make no more sense than transferring the rules of baseball to football .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 8/2006 :
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said that the life of the law has not been logic but experience .
Vast numbers of laws have accumulated and evolved over the centuries , based on experience with male - female unions .
There is no reason why all those laws should be transferred willy - nilly to a different union , one with no inherent tendency to produce children or the inherent asymmetries of relationships between people of different sexes .
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 11/2008 :
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said that law has not been based on logic but on experience .
To apply a mountain of laws based specifically on experience with relations between a man and a woman to a different relationship where sex differences are not involved would be like applying the rules of baseball to football .
****
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 1/2005 :
The rhetoric of " equal rights " has become the road to special privilege for all sorts of groups , so perhaps it was inevitable that gay activists would take that road as well .
It has worked
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 11/2008 :
The politically clever way to get special privileges is to call them " rights " — especially " equal rights . "
Some local election campaigns in various states are using that tactic this year , trying to get special privileges through affirmative action quotas or through demands that the definition of marriage be changed to suit homosexuals .
****
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 3/2004 :
The last refuge of the gay marriage advocates is that this is an issue of equal rights .
But marriage is not an individual right .
Otherwise , why limit marriage to unions of two people instead of three or four or five ?
Why limit it to adult humans , if some want to be united with others of various ages , sexes and species ?
Conservative columnist Thomas Sowell , 11/2008 :
The real issue is whether marriage should be redefined — and , if for gays , why not for polygamists ?
Why not for pedophiles ?
****
Broken , both the record and the logic !
Your thoughts
Typical right wing straw man argument of trying to tell us what we want .

" The real issue is whether marriage should be redefined — and , if for gays , why not for polygamists ?
Why not for pedophiles ? "
Oh fuck you 're stupid .
Have you ever looked into the highly lucrative career calling ' killing yourself ' ?
I 'm sure you'd be a wonderful candidate .
And for the record , some polygamous / polyamorous would like to have bigamy laws repealed .
But do n't fucking compare gay / polyamorous couples to CHILD RAPE you fucking asshole !
We 're trying to live in a progressive society here , could you please at least help out by committing suicide if nothing else ?

Once again they show their complete lack of originality .
It is why they will inevitably lose .

Chemists at the University of Liverpool have developed a way of converting methane gas into a powder form in order to make it more transportable .
Scientists have developed a material made out of a mixture of silica and water which can soak up large quantities of methane molecules .
The material looks and acts like a fine white powder which , if developed for industrial use , might be easily transported or used as a vehicle fuel .
Methane is the principal component of natural gas and can be burnt in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water .
The abundance of the gas and its relatively clean burning process makes it a good source of fuel , but due to its gaseous state at room temperature , methane is difficult to transport from its source .
Professor Andy Cooper , Director of the Centre for Materials Discovery at the University ’s Department of Chemistry , explains : “ Many natural gas reserves are geographically remote and can only be extracted via pipelines , so there is a need to look for other ways to transport the gas .
It has been suggested that methane gas hydrate could be used as a way of containing methane gas for transportation .
The disadvantage of methane gas hydrate for industry use is that it is formed at a very slow rate when methane reacts with water under pressure .
“ To counteract these difficulties we used a method to break water up into tiny droplets to increase the surface area in contact with the gas .
We did this by mixing water with a special form of silica – a similar material to sand – which stops the water droplets from coalescing .
This ‘ dry water ’ powder soaks up large quantities of methane quite rapidly at around water ’s normal freezing point . ”
The team also found that ‘ dry water ’ could be more economical than other potential products because it is made from cheap raw materials .
The material may also have industrial applications if methane could be stored more conveniently and used to power clean vehicles .
Chemists at Liverpool are now investigating ways to store larger quantities of methane gas at higher temperatures and lower pressures as part of a project funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) .

Endangered US animal and plant species are in danger of losing vital legal protection designed to prevent them from extinction .
The outgoing Bush administration is proposing to rush through legislation that will remove the right of government experts to ensure that dams , highways and other big infrastructure projects do n’t pose an unacceptable threat to fragile plants and animals under the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) .
Crucially , the regulations must be approved by Friday if they are to come into effect before President - elect Obama ’s swearing - in ceremony on January 20th .
Under the plan , the existing role of federal wildlife scientists in approving key projects likely to affect endangered species cases will be removed .
Instead , the federal agency in charge of building , authorising or funding a project will be given sole responsibility for deciding the likely harm it might cause .
The move is the latest in a string of ‘ midnight regulations ‘ that the incumbent administration is seeking to push through in the final days of the Bush administration .
In a further sign of the administration ’s stubborn refusal to deviate from from its entrenched views , a November 12 version of the final rules has changed little from the original proposal , despite the more than 250,000 comments received since it was first proposed in August .

I grew a beard as a rebellion against those consultants who told me I had to comb my hair , shave , lose weight .
I said ,
You know , I 'm gonna do what I want now .
That was a good feeling .
I named my horse after Toby Keith because I really like the guy .
Genuine — that 's Toby Keith .
One of the great things about him is that during dinner he 'll start singing a song .
Right there .
Not to perform , but to tell you what he was feeling the particular day that he wrote it .
As I 'm chatting with Obama , the moderator says , " Governor Richardson , what do you think of that ? "
And I look at him like a deer in the headlights .
I was about to say that I had n't heard , when Obama puts his hand over his mouth and says , " Katrina . "
So I gave my four - point plan on Katrina .
When I was done and the debate moved on , I looked over and said , " Thanks , you 're okay . "
He said , " Nothing to it , brother . "
My mother used to insist that I go to confession almost every day when I was a kid .
I 'd say , " This is absurd !
Let 's do it every three days .
Give me time to sin ! "
New Mexicans have better imaginations than anybody .
My point on UFOs is , I do n't know if they 're fact or fiction .
But it 's fun .
It 's Americana .
Why shut down dreams ?
And Dennis Kucinich said he 'd actually seen one .
Artists have said that New Mexico 's biggest asset is the color of the mornings and evenings .
It spurs creativity .
One time when I was a congressman , in the House gym , I was talking to one of the towel attendants .
I said , " Kenny , how you doin ' ? "
He said , " You know , I feel really good today . "
I asked why , and he showed me a note that President Bush had sent him .
The note really connected with Kenny , and it showed a certain class by George Bush the first .
Every elegant man should have a nice fountain pen and a nice watch .
The moment that Barack takes the oath of office will be a signal to the world that America is back and ready to lead again .
Saddam had these small , black eyes .
I started giving him my spiel , which was , " I want you to release these Americans as a humanitarian gesture , Mr. President . "
I was very respectful .
Then I made a terrible mistake : I was so tired , I crossed my legs and showed him the sole of my shoe .
Saddam got up and left .
I thought I was toast .
" Is he coming back ? " I asked .
" He 'll be back , but you must apologize for insulting an Arab with the supreme insult . "
I decided not to apologize — maybe he was playing a psychological game with me .
He came back and I just continued making my point .
His eyes got bigger and then his mouth started moving into a smile .
I had gotten three Red Cross leaders freed ten years earlier .
So I had a plus in my good relations with Bashir , the Sudanese leader , when I went back to ask for the release of Paul Salopek , the Chicago Tribune correspondent .
Bashir remembered that I had treated him with respect .
He released Salopek .
Then I said , " But you 've gotta give me the two Africans you 've got . "
He said , " No , the Africans are from Chad .
That 's an enemy country . "
I said , " I ca n't go back with one white guy and not any black guys . "
Bashir laughed , really laughed , and that 's how we got them out .

Everybody knows the classic winter holiday movies , from older ones like It 's a Wonderful Life to newer ones like A Christmas Story , to ones that get remade over and over again like A Christmas Carol .
Whether or not you like such movies , you must admit that it does get a bit repetitive watching the same stories over and over again every year , with the possible exception of the cartoon version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas .
Here , then , are ten holiday movies ( in no particular order ) that are n't on most people 's list to watch with the family , some of them for very good reasons .
1. Die Hard -
You can't get much less traditional than a movie with people being shot , blown up , dropped out of high windows , and killed in various other ways .
But , even if you do n't want to watch it with your little kids , considering the violence and the language , it is a Christmas movie , and it does show how the forces of good can triumph over the forces of evil even when all of the good guys but two are completely incompetent .
Right ?
2. The Hebrew Hammer
- Not only is this one of the few Hanukkah - related movies in existence , but it 's also hysterically funny .
Unless you watch the version that
Comedy Central shows , it 's not appropriate for young kids , but every
Jew ( of which I 'm one ) with a sense of humor will love this movie , and gentiles with any knowledge of Judaism will get a huge kick out of it , too .
Honestly , I think it 's worth watching if only to see Andy Dick get the tar beaten out of him .
__3 . Desk Set __-
This is a classic movie , with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn , that takes place during the holiday season , but for some reason is n't known as a classic holiday film .
It 's got Hepburn & Tracy , romance , humor , and a main character who 's a geek !
And it's as family - friendly as just about anything you 're likely to find on the Disney Channel , only several orders of magnitude better .
What more could you ask for ?
4. The Nightmare Before Christmas -
This is a classic holiday movie , but the holiday is Halloween , so I 'm including it .
What could be better at evoking the true spirit of Christmas than the song
" Kidnap the Sandy Claws ? "
The only part of the movie I do n't quite understand is why all the kids who get the shrunken heads for Christmas scream ; surely some of them should 've thought it was cool , no ?
5 . The Lion in Winter ( 1968 version ) - I will never understand how Oliver !
beat this movie out for the Best Picture Oscar , but Katharine Hepburn won for her role as Eleanor of Aquitaine .
The movie stars Hepburn , along with Peter O'Toole as King Henry II of England , at a fictional Christmas Court in 1183 .
A very young Anthony Hopkins ( making his film debut ) plays one of their sons , the future King Richard .
It is truly a brilliant film , one of the few showing castle life in the Middle Ages as it really was : cold , filthy , and dark .
It 's definitely not your usual family film , unless you watch it so you can make your family look functional and loving by comparison , since the members of the royal family are all conspiring against each other .
6 . The Thin Man -
This is one of the best detective movies of all time , and one of the funniest .
The Christmas part of the movie is pretty much incidental to the plot , but it has what is probably the best Christmas morning scene ever filmed , in which Nick Charles ( played brilliantly by William Powell ) , trying out the air gun he 's received as a gift , shoots ornaments off the tree .
There 's a reason this film inspired five sequels : Powell and Myrna Loy 's Nick and Nora Charles are among the best film characters ever .
7. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians - I 'll be honest : I 've never actually seen the whole movie , just the Mystery Science Theater 3000
version of it .
But every sci - fi geek should see this film in one form or another , because it 's so terrible it 's hysterically funny .
I was n't going to list it , seeing as how the original film is n't out on DVD , and neither is the MST3K episode , but Joel Hodgson and his new Cinematic Titanic effort have come to the rescue — I have n't seen it yet , but based on the trailer I 'm sure it 's great .
__ 8 . Gremlins__
- This is a classic light horror film from the ' 80s that probably takes place at Christmas only to give the main character 's father a reason why he buys the first Mogwai , Gizmo , for him .
It 's not a great film , but it has some surprisingly good special effects for a 1984 film , and has a lot of really good scenes .
I do n't advise showing it to little kids if they 're at all prone to nightmares , but older kids should be fine with it .
9. Batman Returns - The Batman films made by
Tim Burton were n't as good as the two most recent films , to be sure , for a variety of reasons .
But they were very well made nonetheless , and still have a great deal to recommend them .
This , the second one , happens to take place at Christmastime , providing for a good scene in which the Penguin disrupts the lighting of Gotham City 's Christmas tree .
I honestly could 've done without Danny DeVito as the Penguin , and
Christopher Walken is n't quite as good as usual , but Michelle Pfieffer more than makes up for them both , and not just because of the way she looks as Catwoman .__
__
__10 . Blackadder 's Christmas Carol __-
I know I 'm cheating a bit here , since this is a TV show and not a movie .
But I love it so much I really can't leave it off , and besides , it has
Rowan Atkinson , Stephen Fry , Hugh Laurie , Robbie Coltrane , Jim
Broadbent , and Miranda Richardson in it ( among others ) .
With a cast like that , it can stand up to most movies .
It takes the classic Dickens tale and flips it 180 degrees , so that the main character , Ebenezer
Blackadder , starts out a man who is kind and generous to a fault and ends up a cruel and bitter miser .
Any others you can think of ?

Whitesnake founder objects to McCain use of ' Here I Go Again ' at campaign event Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008

The founding member of Whitesnake is objecting to John McCain 's use of the hair - metal band 's classic " Here I Go Again " during a campaign rally in Colorado on Tuesady .
" I must respectfully object to having my music misappropriated for a political campaign that I do not personally support , " David Coverdale said in an e-mail statement to RAW STORY , after hearing the song at a McCain rally broadcast on CNN .
" I am delighted to add that this election is my first voting experience as a brand new citizen of the United States of America ...
I voted for , & fully support , the Democratic representative , Senator Barak Obama , & believe in my heart & soul that he will best represent these United States in the most profound & fulfilling way . "
Coverdale , a UK native , became an American citizen in March of 2007 after living in the US for 20 years .
The Whitesnake founder and lead singer joins a growing list of songwriters and entertainers dismayed at McCain 's misappropriation of their material .
Others who have objected include Van Halen , the Foo Fighters , Jackson Browne , Frankie Valli , Jon Bon Jovi and John Mellencamp .
After the Republican National Convention , Heart asked the campaign to stop using its song , " Barracuda " to introduce VP nominee Sarah Palin .
John Hall , the founding member of Orleans , asked McCain to stop using his song " Still the One " ; Hall is now a Democratic congressman from New York .
Earlier this year , McCain said he would not play " Take a Chance on Me " by Swedish pop group Abba , one of the GOP nominee 's favorites , because of concerns over expensive copyright fees .

Hollywood thinking today is to release sequels to practically any blockbuster … which is why in 2007 we saw a rash of threequels : Spider - Man 3 , Shrek the Third , Pirates of the Caribbean : At World ’s End , Ocean ’s Thirteen , The Bourne Ultimatum , and Rush Hour 3 .
All of those films made oodles of cash , showing if at first you do succeed , try , try again until you ’ve milked it dry .
Surprisingly , even some classic and well - renowned films have been given sequels , but needless to say , they have not become classics .
Most of the films on the following list were not intended as “ official ” sequels , but nevertheless continued the stories and characters of earlier classics .
Unofficial sequels can work well … a few such films are very popular , like The Lion in Winter ( a “ sequel ” to Becket since Peter O’Toole plays King Henry II in both films ) and The Silence of the Lambs ( technically a sequel to Manhunter , even though Frankie Faison is the only actor in both films ) .
However , most of the following failed miserably , as audiences preferred the unspoilt originals .
10 The Sting II 1983
Universal tried to repeat the success they had with the 1973 classic starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford .
They failed .
By replacing the original ’s two huge stars — the reason The Sting was so great — with Jackie Gleason and Mac Davis , the filmmakers basically acknowledged they were making a second - rate sequel .
The film failed , and The Sting II was banished to the forgotten film vault in the sky .
9 Return to Oz 1985
The Wiz it ai n’t .
Disney ’s sequel to the classic
The Wizard of Oz came 46 years after the 1939 original – earning this sequel a place in the record books .
Unfortunately , that is about all this is known for , as it was a commercial and critical failure .
Director Walter Murch reportedly wanted only scant references to the original film , with the intention of remaining faithful to the L. Frank Baum novels ; for instance , the Tin Man , Scarecrow , and Cowardly Lion are only briefly in the film .
But why do that when the whole point of this sequel was to capitalize on the success of the original ?
8 The Last Days of Patton 1986
George C. Scott reprised his role as the no-nonsense General George S. Patton in this CBS TV Movie .
Like the original , it ’s based on a book by Ladislas Farago ; the setting this time is after World War II , when General Patton is dying after a car accident .
With his wife ( Eva Marie Saint ) at his bedside , the General reminiscences about his good ol ’ pre-WWII days .
Ron Berglas plays young Patton .
Why such a classic war film like 1970 ’s Patton would get a simple TV - movie sequel is beyond me , especially if they were able to convince George C. Scott to reprise his role .
The movie ranked ninth in the ratings for the night , but one wonders if audiences were n’t keen on seeing such a bombastic man go out with a whimper instead of a bang .
7 Return from the River Kwai 1989
Nick Tate , Timothy Bottoms , Edward Fox , and George Takei (! ) all star in this war epic follow - up to the 1957 classic The Bridge on the River Kwai .
It ’s based on a 1979 book by Joan and Clay Blair , which in turn is based on a true story .
The plot concerns the workers of the previous bridge who , after it is blown up , are shipped to Japan .
Along the way , there is much war - related action .
6 A Dangerous Man : Lawrence After Arabia 1990
One year after the original was re-released to theatres , an unofficial TV sequel was produced with Ralph Fiennes in the titular role .
Shown on PBS ’ “ Great Performances ” in 1992 , the movie dealt with Lawrence at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference following World War I .
The New York Times called Fiennes ’ peformance more authentic than Peter O’Toole ’s , as in this movie it portrayed him as a complicated , ambivalent , and dark man , rather than a flamboyant , swashbuckling hero .
Steven Spielberg reportedly saw Fiennes ’ performance in this and asked him to sign up as a Nazi in Schindler ’s List .
5 Happily Ever After 1993
Filmation , an animation studio known for Star Trek : The Animated Series and Fat Albert , came up with the brilliant idea in the 1980s to produce sequels to classic Disney films .
Their first one was Happily Ever After , a “ sequel ” to the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs picking up where the first left off .
Snow White meets the Seven Dwarfelles , cousins of the Dwarves , and they team up to destroy the evil Lord Malice .
Despite a big - name cast ( Ed Asner , Carol Channing , Zsa Zsa Gabor , and Malcolm McDowell ) , the film was received poorly by just about everyone .
Filmation did produce one other Disney “ sequel , ” Pinocchio and the Emperor of The Night , which had a great title but nothing else going for it .
4 It Runs in the Family 1994
A Christmas Story is a beloved Christmas classic .
Its sequel more than a decade later is not .
Kieran Culkin takes over as Ralphie , whose quest deals not with obtaining a Red Ryder BB Gun , but some kind of top ( a dice ) to pit against some bully ’s top .
WTF ?
Tedde Moore returns as Ralphie ’s teacher , and Jean Shepherd narrates , but the rest of the original cast is kaput .
MGM later retitled this My Summer Story ; you probably do n’t want this on your Christmas list .
3 Scarlett 1994
Alexandra Ripley ’s 1991 novel of the same name , a sequel to Gone With the Wind , was turned into a TV miniseries in 1994 .
Joanna Whalley played Scarlett O’Hara and Timothy Dalton took over as the dashing and suave Rhett Butler .
Not taking “ I do n’t give a damn ” for an answer , Scarlett attempts to win back Rhett ’s heart , traveling to Ireland in the process .
This eight - hour miniseries , aired on CBS during the November sweeps , garnered substantial ratings , but ones less than hoped for by the network .
The era of the epic miniseries was over .
Still , it ’s probably worth enough to take a look , if you can find it on video– after all , Sean Bean is in it , playing the evil Lord Fenton .
2 Sahara 2005
One of those “ technically a sequel ” films .
The 1980 film Raise the Titanic featured Richard Jordan as Dirk Pitt , a role sent to Matthew McConaughey in Sahara .
Both are based on Clive Cussler ’s novels of the treasure - hunting Dirk Pitt , and both had tremendous budgets ( and consequently were tremendous failures ) .
Raise the Titanic ’s producer lamented that it would ’ve been cheaper to “ lower the Atlantic . ”
Some reference to the first film can be found during the opening credits , when a clipping in Dirk Pitt ’s office references a “ raising the Titanic . ”
1 The Queen 2006
OK , you ’ve heard of The Queen , but did you know that it is essentially a sequel to the 2003 TV Movie The Deal ?
Both movies feature Michael Sheen as Tony Blair , and both were written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears .
The Deal is based on a supposed meeting between Tony Blair and current PM Gordon Brown , with Blair telling Brown to step aside and allow him to run as Labour Party leader while allowing Brown sway over domestic policy .
Fraudster is accused by judge of ' deliberately ' getting pregnant to avoid prison - then is allowed to walk free from court
Imogen Glyne is seen leaving court on Friday .
She was given a suspended prison sentence for taking part in a swindle after she became pregnant
A woman fraudster was accused by a judge of ' deliberately ' getting pregnant to avoid prison - and then allowed to walk free from court .
Imogen Glyne took part in a £ 70,000 swindle targeting advertising giant M&C Saatchi while working in the accounts department at Transport for London .
The 26 - year - old is five months pregnant and conceived after she was arrested .
She would have given birth in prison if given the 12 - month term the judge , Recorder Jonathan Laidlaw , said she deserved .
But he said he did not want a child to start its life in jail and instead handed down a suspended sentence .
The judge told her : ' You became pregnant in June of this year , after your arrest .
' I do harbour the gravest of suspicions that that was done deliberately with these proceedings in mind .
' However much you deserve to go to prison , I am not prepared to have a child start his or her life in a prison in London . '
Miss Glyne was recruited as an ' insider ' by accomplice Nicholas Simpson , 23 , who was beside her in the dock at Southwark Crown Court and jailed for a year .
The accounts administrator , whose daughter is due in March , had worked as for Transport for London for just six months when she committed the fraud .
At his behest she forged two letters requesting a change of bank details for two contractors , M&C Saatchi and another firm Frankham Consultancy Group , due for payment by TfL .
They bungled an initial bid involving Frankham when the wrong sort code was entered but took £ 65,000 on their next attempt with M&C Saatchi .
The judge said : ' It was a clever scam which took advantage of inside knowledge that you had achieved as a result of your agency employment at TfL .
' You used forged changes of bank account instructions to change the account details of suppliers due to be paid by TfL .
' The result was that money was diverted to bank accounts opened and operated by Mr Simpson . '
However , Simpson only managed to get away with just over £ 8,800 .
When he tried to transfer the rest into three other accounts , bank staff suspected something was wrong , made inquiries and discovered the fraud .
Miss Glyne admitted one fraud offence but denied two counts of obtaining money transfers by deception in late 2006 and was convicted following a trial while Simpson admitted two fraud charges .
Judge Laidlaw said : ' Frauds of this sort and of this scale which involve in addition , in the case of Miss Glyne , a gross breach of trust upon your employer , must be met by custodial terms . '
But he said he felt compelled to suspend Miss Glyne 's prison term , to avoid her baby being born in HMP Holloway .
He added : ' It will add to the burdens on the prison service .
' Of course they would cope , but it will make things difficult - the resources for caring for expectant mothers are not perhaps as extensive as they might be .'
He also gave her two years ' supervision , and 150 hours ' unpaid work .
Bespectacled and wearing a black cowl - neck jumper and black leggings , Glyne , of Thamesmead , South East London , wept as she walked free , while Simpson , of Canning Town , East London , buried his head in his hands .
The man reportedly ran Mike Huckabee ’s presidential campaign and is one of the six guys in the running for RNC chair , head of the entire Republican .
The song is called “ Barack the Magic Negro . ”
Yes , “ negro . ”
Does n’t it figure that one of the top guys in the race for the head of the party is basically making n- gger jokes for Christmas .
Ca n’t wait for Huckabee to run for president again , and have to explain this one .
Oh , and big surprise – the guy is from Tennessee and used to run the state party , which is known for its own racist exploits .
Seriously , could these people set the GOP , and the southern Republicans , back any further ?
It sounded more like a choice between side dishes at a diner .
In one of the Democrats ’ victories in the state Senate , incumbent Bob Bacon has easily defeated Matt Fries .
The Bacon versus Fries race is running 62 percent to 37 percent in favor of Bacon of Fort Collins .
Speaking exclusively to BloodyElbow.com , world champion grappler Lloyd Irvin said his home in Accokeek , Maryland was invaded by two armed gunman on Saturday morning at approximately 4:30 am .
According to Irvin , the two gunman held Irvin , his son , wife and UFC light heavyweight contender Brandon Vera at gun point while demanding to be directed towards valuables like cash or jewelry .
While one gunman held Irvin 's family hostage , another gunman directed Irvin to the the master bedroom .
According to Irvin , he led the gunman toward his bedroom .
Once in the bedroom , Irvin said he noticed the other gunman was far enough away down the hall to make a move to disarm the attacker in his bedroom .
Irvin , an expert in Sambo defensive gun and knife techniques , was able to get ahold of the gun in the attacker 's hands , first separating the clip from the gun and then removing the gun from the attacker 's hands .
At that point , the attacker in Irvin 's room ran yelling to his accomplice that Irvin had his gun and both gunman fled the house .
It 's not clear what , if anything , they were able to take with them .
Police were called to the scene and have launched an investigation .
According to Irvin , no one in his family was physically hurt , although the psychological trauma at this point is considerable .
While Vera is physically unharmed , leaving for England this Tuesday and will continue training , it is not clear to what extent the psychological trauma from this event will have as he heads into his fight with Keith Jardine at UFC 89 on October 18th .
Irvin indicated that to the extent possible , training would continue as normal .
On behalf of everyone at BloodyElbow.com , we are glad to hear no one was harmed in the attack and wish both the Irvin family and Vera the best during this very difficult time .
PERSONAL NOTE : For anyone who has ever doubted Irvin 's weapons techniques that he learned in Sambo , they literally saved his life and the life of his family / Vera .
There can be no more doubting them .
A Walk Down A Perfect Street
I am going to have a little fun and pretend that I was walking down the perfect street .
By my definition , a perfect street is one that meets all the criteria for being a quality public place where people want to spend time .
As I walk down this perfect street , what would I see ?
What would I smell ?
What would I hear ?
How would I feel ?
What would be going on around me ?
The first thing I would notice about this perfect street is that there are lots of people walking around , mingling with one another , talking to friends , sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with friends , window shopping , and people watching .
Some people will be walking slowly while eating an ice cream cone , and others will be walking quickly with their briefcase on a way to a meeting .
Some people will be standing around talking with friends , while others will be sitting on benches or short walls in small groups conversing about their lives .
There will be people entering and exiting buildings , and some sitting in sidewalk cafes enjoying the view .
As my previous posts concerning sidewalk contact and safety explain , the abundance of people of all ages and backgrounds is what makes the street interesting and vibrant .
The next thing I would notice is that the architecture of the buildings is diverse .
There will be a mixture of building types with varying styles of architecture .
The buildings will be narrow and no taller than six or seven stories , and there will be no separation between them .
Very importantly , the buildings will meet the sidewalk and there will be a connection between the people inside the buildings and outside the buildings because of the large windows on the storefronts .
There wo n’t be a vast asphalt wilderness called a parking lot between the street and the building .
Parking will be offered on the street or behind the buildings .
I will notice that the sidewalk accessories , such as benches , planters , and lamp posts are plentiful .
The lamp posts will be smaller , human scale and not towering over the people .
The benches will be frequent and arranged so that they are conducive for conversation .
Straight benches will be in groups facing one another .
There will be planters that are raised so that people can stop and have a seat or prop their feet up on them while they relax .
I would notice that the sidewalks are wide — wide enough for several people to walk abreast .
There will be bulb - outs at the intersections and at strategically placed crosswalks between intersections to give pedestrians added safety when crossing the street .
Signal timing will be pedestrian oriented , giving pedestrians a leading walk signal so they can cross in safety .
There might even be innovative crosswalk designs where the pedestrians can actually cross the intersections diagonally with dedicated signals , which would save them from having to cross an intersection twice .
Bicyclists will have lanes , ideally physically separated from the automobile lanes , where they can travel safely .
There will be bicycle racks places along the street so that those bicyclists have a place to lock up their bikes when they enter the stores and shops .
As important as what I will see is what I will hear and smell .
I will hear people laughing , talking , and maybe even crying .
I will hear children singing and laughing .
I will smell freshly brewed coffee wafting out from the coffeehouses .
I will smell freshly baked bread and pastries emanating from the bakeries .
I will smell the flowers and trees
My walk down the perfect street will leave me feeling energized .
I will know that I have experienced a great place .
It will make me want to return over and over , as it will all the other people there as well .
This will cause the street to become even better as more people discover it and make it their favorite place to be .
In the winter for many people there ’s a room that really does n’t need to be heated as badly .
Actually you might be happier if it received none at all most of the time , especially since most people are trying to spend less money right now .
However , if you keep the vent closed all the time , it ’s entirely possible to just forget to open it again .
Although you do n’t really want much heat getting into the room , I ’m sure you do n’t want an in home iceberg .
Well this vent makes your life easier , it could help you save money , while still keeping the room at a reasonable temperature .
The vent is meant to be easily installed in place of the old vent .
Then , once installed it can be programmed to open on certain days , and then close again .
It would be especially convenient for a guest room that you do n’t often need .
You could set it up to open the day the guest arrives , or the day before .
Granted I ’m sure you could physically walk over and either open or close the vent .
However , this does simplify things a little .
They can be purchased on Amazon in different sizes and colors to accommodate your home .
The Vent - Misers range in price from $ 22.49 on up to $ 27 .

1. Workers win : Bank to give credit to Chicago plant
Bank of America says it will extend credit to a Chicago window and door maker whose workers have occupied the factory for five days .
The bank said Tuesday that it 's willing to give the Republic Windows and Doors factory " a limited amount of additional loans . "
That 's so it can resolve claims of employees who have staged a sit - in since Friday .
The factory closed Friday after Bank of America canceled its financing .
Workers were given three days ' notice .
But they refused to leave and vowed to stay there until receiving assurances they would receive severance and accrued vacation pay .
The bank has been criticized for cutting off the plant 's credit after taking federal bailout money .
2. December 10th 2008 , Unions in Greece are calling for a general strike today , while demonstrators are set to take to the streets for a fifth day to protest the fatal police shooting of a 15 - year - old .
The strike , called to protest government economic policies , will shut schools and government offices and disrupt public transport .
Air - traffic controllers will walk off the job , halting flights by carriers Aegean Airways SA and Olympic Airways SA .
Labor groups representing 2.5 million workers plan to rally early today in Athens .
The country 's biggest labor groups -- GSEE , which represents about 2 million workers , and civil - service union ADEDY , with 500,000 members -- rebuffed a call by the prime minister to cancel rallies in Athens to prevent more clashes .
The unions comprise about half the Greek workforce .
3 . On Dec 8 2008 , North Carolina log haulers and container drivers - many who are misclassified as " independent contractors " - held a work stoppage .
They are demanding paper giant Weyerhaeuser and its subcontractors recognize their newlyformed union , the United Truckers Cooperative .
On Monday Dec 8 , the drivers of the United Truckers Cooperative held a work stoppage and picket outside of Weyerhaeuser Mills in Plymouth and Vanceboro , North Carolina .
The workers are demanding Weyerhaeuser arrange a meeting between mill management , subcontractors , and representatives of the truckers to address the drivers ' legitimate grievances and negotiate a formal agreement on wages and working conditions .
4 . Protesters unseat Prime Minister 150 riot police fled their checkpoint near Suvarnabhumi after they were attacked by PAD militants armed with iron rods , slingshots and hurling firecrackers .
The PAD , which seized the airport , then stationed guards on the expressway exit to keep police at bay .
The closures of Suvarnabhumi and the city 's old airport Don Muang , a big domestic hub , have crippled the tourism industry during the peak end - of - year season .
Somchai , who has refused to quit , imposed emergency rule at the airports but police made no moves to evict the thousands of protesters .
The PAD , a coalition of royalist businessmen , activists and academics who accuse Somchai of being a puppet of his brother - in - law , ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , seized the airports in a " final battle " to unseat the government .
Anti-government demonstrators in Thailand declared victory and said they will end their occupation of the country 's two main airports after a court decision forced the country 's prime minister from office .
Courts side with protesters , oust government .
The country 's Constitutional Court found Somchai's People 's Power Party , the Machima Thipatai party and the Chart Thai party guilty of committing fraud in the December 2007 elections that brought the coalition to power .
" Dishonest political parties undermine Thailand 's democratic system , " said Constitutional Court President Chat Chalavorn .
Power purge
The ruling sent Somchai , Thaksin 's brother - in - law , and 59 executives of the three parties into political exile and barred them from politics for five years .
Of the 59 , 24 are lawmakers who will have to abandon their parliamentary seats .
When and how are the spirits of just man made perfect ?
" The spirits of just men made perfect " refers to men made perfect by having their sins washed away by the blood of Christ .
We have had our sins washed away and have come to have fellowship with others who have been made perfect by having their sins washed away .
Adam Clarke in his Commentary on Hebrews 12:23 , " In several parts of this epistle teleiov , the just man , signifies one who has a full knowledge of the Christian system , who is justified and saved by Christ Jesus ; and the teteleiwnemoi are the adult Christians , who are opposed to the nhpioi or babes in knowledge and grace ...
The spirits of the just men made perfect , or the righteous perfect , are the full grown Christians ; those who are justified by the blood and sanctified by the Spirit of Christ .
Being come to such , implies that spiritual union which the disciples of Christ have with each other , and which they possess how far so ever separate ; for they are all joined in one spirit , # Eph 2:18 ; they are in the unity of the spirit , # Eph 4:3 , 4 ; and of one soul , # Ac 4:32 .
This is a unity which was never possessed even by the Jews themselves in their best state ; it is peculiar to real Christianity : ( See Heb 12:29 ) . "
There is no way we could have come to the " spirits " of those in Heaven ?
If they were in Heaven , they would be beyond our reach unto we are in Heaven with them .
We would not have come to them .
" And to the spirits of the righteous made perfect " [ New Revised Standard Version ] .
If disembodied spirits were in Heaven and in any way had fellowship or communication with us it would prove Spiritualism , which is forbidden by God .
Most all who uses this to prove the soul is now immortal do not believe we have any communication with the dead if they are in Heaven , Hell , the grave , or any other place , therefore , we have not come unto them .
WHEN THIS IS USED TO PROVE THE SPIRIT IS ALIVE AND THEREFORE , IMMORTAL AFTER DEATH FOR THE " SOUL " OF THOSE WHO ARE DEAD ARE NOW MADE PERFECT , IT MAKES THE JUDGMENT AND RESURRECTION BE 100 % TOTALLY USELESS .
Hamilton says spirit ( pneuma ) refers to God 288 times , to evil spirit 30 times , and 40 times pneuma refers to the human spirit ( Truth Commentaries , 1 Peter , Page 370 ) .
W. E. Vine lists a number of ways pneuma refers to man , to " the human spirit , " they must therefore be part of the 40 times .
( f ) The sentient element in man , that by which he perceives , reflects , feels , desire ... ( g ) purpose aim ... ( i ) character ...( j ) moral qualities and activities : bad ... stupor ... timidity ... good ... liberty ... meekness ... faith ... quietness . "
As these all refer to the human spirit , they must be a part of the 40 times , but not a one in his list refers to a part of a person that lives after the death of the person .
Hamilton says on page 364 that the Soul may mean life , persons , the heart , the mind , or the spirit .
From what both W. E. Vine and Hamilton say , some of the 40 times means the mind .
etc .
Therefore , the times pneuma can refer to an internal immortal part of a person would be less than 40 times .
But , he did not say how many or list them , which is the very thing he needed to prove his point .
Just saying that a part of less than 40 times means a person has an immortal spirit does not get the job done .
How often , one , five or more ?
Where are they ?
Hence , the GREAT CONFUSION : Soul or spirit or both ?
Try the Mormon handshake , for Christ 's sake .

There is no better way to celebrate a win than getting grabbed and punched in the balls by a bunch of offensive lineman on the bus .
Lesson learned though , if you go back and try to mess with one of them then the rest are gonna gang up on ya .
To their defense , I guess I kind of had it coming .
Last Thursday in practice we were working on our run game and one of our guys fell down as the play ended .
I had just finished off my block and turned back to see him wallowing around on his hands and knees trying to get back to his feet .
I do n't really know why , but I thought it would be funny as hell to air hump him in while he was down , maybe catch it on the end of the film clip to have something to laugh about in meetings later that afternoon .
I was even nice enough to make sure he was n't really hurt before I moved in behind him .
As I finished off and made my way back to the huddle I heard about half the team erupt in laughter , really I did n't expect any reaction , but apparently it was noticed by everyone .
So , back to the bus , when the game ends I usually load up on bus # 2 and move towards the back with the offensive line , Yoder , and the kickers .
Kind of our little after the game club .
After games we usually have to sit on the bus and wait for a half hour or so before all the interviews are done and the gear gets loaded up to take to the airport and then it 's usually another half an hour before we get to the plane .
So we get some quality time to spend together , especially after a win .
After Sunday nights game I was getting all kinds of hell about what was going to happen to me when I fell asleep on the plane due to the whole air humping thing .
You know , asses on your face , dicks drawn on you forehead , or the very popular picture of you sleeping with someone 's balls touching you then getting the photo texted to your phone in the morning prank .
So I went back to entertain a little pre-plane wrestling match and take care of business .
Before I knew it I was held down on the floor being manhandled and punched in the crotch , oh yea , I got air humped in retaliation while I was down too .
Yea , we are a bunch of 14 year olds , at least until we get back home to our families and then we mature to at least 17 .
After all the shenanigans we had a good laugh and then I proceeded to remain awake the entire flight home .
It 's hilarious to think about how someone may explain the antics on the bus to a human resources director at a normal workplace .
Can you imagine a some dude at an accounting firm complaining about all his fellow workers pinning him down in a cubicle and punching his nuts ?
That 's assault brother !
And we just laugh about it like a bunch of idiots .
Well enough of the bullshit .
I think everyone knew that this week 's game was a must win to keep any kind of pace with the rest of the NFC .
Let 's not even talk about winning our division , I mean , it will probably take 11 wins just to get into a wild card spot .
Right now everyone is winning games and we could n't afford to drop another one .
Seattle was a tough team and a crazy ass place to play , I think that 's all I have to say .
It was a huge win !
New York City Police Department Officer Charged with Acting As an Illegal Agent of the People ’s Republic of China
By Kevin Connolly
BBC News , Washington
It is getting harder and harder to remember the last time anything happened in Campaign 2008 that John McCain 's camp would regard as clear , unambiguous good news .
Colin Powell was himself once tipped as a presidential candidate Perhaps it was the heady moment just after he made Governor Sarah Palin his running mate and just before her " gosh - darn " stump speech began to grate on the American ear .
Since then Mr McCain has struggled to find the right tone and the right message amid a sinking economy , and Mrs Palin has come dangerously close to running aground in a series of excruciating interviews on network television .
Opinion polls have also provided depressing evidence that Barack Obama is winning the arguments and - for the moment at least - winning the election .
Now Mr McCain is losing the battle for high profile endorsements too .
Colin Powell , the latest big figure to back Mr Obama , might have had a few kind words for his old friend and party colleague - but he 's still voting for the Democrat .
It is a decision which will come as a particular blow to John McCain .
Mr Powell is , after all , a Republican , a lion of the party and a retired general with impeccable national security credentials .
He served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the first Gulf War in 1991 and was then Secretary of State during George W Bush 's first term in office .
He is a big player in Washington and a contemporary of Mr McCain .
His view that America needs the generational change which Mr Obama is in a position to offer will undermine his old friend 's credibility .
Valuable endorsement ?
Given that the US is due to vote on 4 November and that we have already reached the point in the year when stores are beginning to erect their Christmas displays , Mr Powell can hardly be accused of rushing his decision .
Even the way the endorsement came suggests that the general was rather torn .
The man who has served as America 's most senior soldier and as its most senior diplomat thinks Obama is ready to lead the nation
Profile : Colin Powell
It was offered during a thoughtful TV interview rather than on stage at an Obama rally .
It is particularly damaging for the Republicans that Mr Powell suggested Sarah Palin 's inclusion on the ticket and the negative tone of the campaign were major factors in his decision .
The implication is clear - that his own party could have won his support , but failed to do so .
You might argue in fact that in making up his mind so late in the campaign Mr Powell is demonstrating a political version of the so - called " Powell doctrine " he practiced as a military man .
That essentially involves only making your move when you are certain that overwhelming force is on your side .
Or , in this case , that you are on the side of overwhelming force .
So , given that this is not an act of reckless political courage , does a Powell endorsement have real value at this stage of the race ?
I think it does , although it certainly wo n't be decisive .
The first way in which it matters is simply that it means another day of positive headlines for the Obama campaign , and by extension another day in which the news cycle spins out of the control of the McCain camp .
There will be big headlines too , in the American media .
Colin Powell has been a high profile Republican since leaving the army Mr Powell is a hugely respected and high - profile figure - if he says he is disappointed with the tone of the Republican campaign or that Sarah Palin simply is n't ready to be president , then that will be widely reported .
It is also true that Mr Powell 's views probably carry quite a bit of weight with the type of military veterans who are natural McCain voters and who distrust Obama - in part at least - because of his lack of international experience .
If the man who has served as America 's most senior soldier and as its most senior diplomat thinks Obama is ready to lead the nation , then that might be enough to convince a few waverers .
Obama 's momentum
There is a rather touching generational resonance in all this too - it once seemed possible that Colin Powell himself would become the first African - American President of the United States .
He was born in an America where it would n't have been possible for a black man - however brilliant and inspiring - to reach the position in which Barack Obama now finds himself .
Now he is in a position to lend his authority to an African - American politician who may be about to complete an astonishing journey on which he himself took some of the first steps .
Mr Obama is , in Colin Powell 's words , a transformational figure .
It is worth noting though that the Obama camp will want to be sure that no - one sees Mr Powell 's decision as some kind of act of racial solidarity .
Powell criticised the choice of Sarah Palin as McCain 's running mate
They want everyone to be clear that this is all about a senior figure in American politics endorsing the judgment and readiness to lead of a man who he has met and engaged in serious discussion .
Colin Powell of course , remains a Republican - and he wo n't be campaigning for Obama .
But it is hard not to wonder about his decision to go against the interests of his own party in this very public way .
Could it be rooted in the bitter experience he suffered as secretary of state when he became the front man for the Bush administration , charged with selling the dossier on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction to a dubious world ?
Still , the endorsements of the big players in American politics do matter , and Mr Obama has simply been getting more of them - not just from major political figures but from big newspapers too .
It 's no great surprise that the Washington Post threw its weight behind Barack Obama .
But the Los Angeles Times is also endorsing the Democrat , the first time the west coast newspaper has backed any candidate since it went for Richard Nixon back in 1972 .
Given how that particular recommendation turned out you can see why the Times stayed out of the endorsement business for 36 years , although it is important to bear in mind that in 1972 the Vietnam war was still raging , that no - one had yet heard of Watergate and that Mr Nixon was from California .
You can bet the LA Times came to regret that endorsement of Nixon .
And you might remember that Colin Powell himself once backed Dick Cheney 's run for high office with the view that he would make a " superb " vice - president .
I wonder if that 's the word he would now use to describe Mr Cheney 's time in office .

The Feel Your Boobies Foundation is a breast cancer non-profit organization that utilizes technology and other unconventional methods to remind young women to “ feel their boobies ” .
A friendly reminder when you least expect it .
When Derek Johnson was interviewing candidates for a marketing job at his tech company , one applicant arrived in a business suit .
" It put us on edge , " says Mr. Johnson , founder and CEO of Tatango.com .
Mr. Johnson believed the job candidate was presenting a false image of himself .
The suit , he felt , was tantamount to a lie .
Mr. Johnson is 22 -- an entrepreneur who dropped out of college when it got in the way of running Tatango , which enables groups to blast text and voice messages to their members .
Like many of his generation , he sees traditional business attire as a form of cover - up .
In his workplace , he says , " we 're not trying to hide anything with our clothes . "
Established companies have long hired employees whose clothing suggested they would toe the corporate line .
Today , many young managers believe office attire should do pretty much the opposite : express a person 's inner soul .
To older people , young people 's style can be difficult to understand .
Going far beyond business casual , the clothes seem either highly informal or provocatively young -- jeans , athletic shoes , tight T - shirts and miniskirts , for instance .
But young workers are replacing traditional business dress with their own complex sets of rules and subliminal messages .
Their choices among brand - name items are meant to communicate substance .
Rather than Gucci versus Allen Edmonds , for instance , the choice may involve Nike Air Force versus Chuck Taylors .

ZEVS , THE RUSSIAN 82 Hz ELF TRANSMITTER
A Extrem Low Frequency transmission - system , using the real longwaves
By Trond Jacobsen at ALFLAB , Halden in Norway
WHY THE USE OF SUCH EXTREM LOW FREQUENCIES
FOR COMMUNICATION WITH SUBMARINES ?
The main reason for this is the extrem low frequency signals ability to penetrate deep down below the surface of the ocean .
Not only will the ELF frequencies penetrate water , but also thick sea-ice , making it possible for submarines to receive orders while they are travelling under Polar Icecaps .
Down there in the oceans at depths often below 300 meter , is a fleet of nuclear armed submarines , from both east and west , playing hide and seek with each other and the respective enemy  nations sophisticated surveillance equipment .
Nuclear powered submarines can stay at these depths for weeks , without the need to break the surface for fresh air or other supplies .
The main problem is to get information of what is going on at the surface , down to the sub .
In waters where the submarines patrol on a regular basis , there are most likely several near bottom fixed stations for hydro- acoustic communication .
This system links the submarine with coastal points relaying radiosignals .
Underwater sound communication is quite effective for joint tactical actions of submarines with other sub and / or surface ships .
As these underwater acoustic communication systems is intended for comparatively short distances , up to 10 - 30 km , problems arise when the submarine operate outside the normal areas , far from the save waters covered by national defence and communication systems .
Out in the no-mans land of the international waters are the only means of communication with the submarines , to use radio in the VLF or ELF range .
The radio signals ability to penetrate water depends of the frequency and the salinity of the water .
In the middle of the Atlantic ocean , with a salinity of 3.2 % , a VLF signal will penetrate down to a depth of 10 - 20 meter , barely periscope - depth for a modern large scale submarine .
In areas with less salinity , like the Mediterranean Sea or in the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea , the same signal will be possible to receive at a depth in excess of 40 meter .
For submarines operating deeper then this , is the only solution for a one - way communication link with the surface to use radiowaves in the ELF , extrem low frequency range , below 3 kHz .
As of today both the Russian Navy and the US Navy operates ELF transmitters capable of communication with their respective submarines at their operational speed and depth .
THE LOCATION OF ZEVS
The Russian ELF transmitter Zevs , is located north / west of Murmansk - 69 °N 33°E , at the Kola Peninsula in north - western Russia .
In the Murmansk area on Kola are the homeport of the Russian Northern Fleet and a multitude of other military installations , like the Russian Arctic Fleet Air - force operating from the Olegonorsk airfield .
One must assume that the Tu - 142 MR ( Bear J ) " radio retranslator " aircrafts stationed at this airfield , together with ZEVS and the RDL 18.1 / 21.10 kHz VLF transmitters are the backbone of the ELF / VLF communication link between the Kremlin Op - Center and the Russian nuclear - armedsubmarines .
To build and operate an ELF - transmitter is neither an easy nor cheap economically and technically task .
The antenna system needs a lot of space and the transmitter requires a small power plant of its own , but also the geological conditions at the antenna site must be taken under consideration before the building starts .
The number one rule , for a successful ELF transmitter site like Zevs and the US counterpart operating at 76 Hz from the dual - antenna WMT ( Wisconsin Transmitter Facility ) and MTF ( Michigan Transmitter Facility ) sites , are very low electrical ground conductivity .
This is a necessary feature , exclusive to ground based ELF - transmitters , as opposed to all other kinds of radio transmitters , who need good earth ground - plane connection for the antenna .
A suitable location for an ELF transmitter would there for be in areas with not more then a rather thin layer , only a couple of meters of sand or moréne gravel ,
covering the baserock like igneous granite and metamorphic gneiss .
Areas to look for , are where the remnants of the very old Precambrian mountain belts , are to be found close to the surface of the earth .
In Canada and northern USA is the Canadian , also named the Laurentian shield , covering an area of 4790000 km² , portions of the shields southern edge are exposed in northern Michigan and Wisconsin .
Another suitable location in the US is the Adirondacks in New York .
In Europa are similar suitable locations for ELF transmitters , to be found in areas covered by the Baltic and the Caledonian shields .
Like the Scandinavian countries , were exposed portions of this European continental core is easily found and in the western part of Russia , like on the Kola Peninsula .
Other suitable locations for ground based ELF
transmitting antennas are countries with geological remnants of long gone , eroded mountain ranges , like in Scotland .
GlenGarry Forrest in Scotland was intended as a location for a Royal Navy ELF transmitter operating on 72 Hz , for communication with the Trident submarines .
This project was tested but the expenses contra efficiency was to high and after a political debate was the Glen Garry ELF communication station turned into history .
THE EXTREM LOW TRANSMISSION FREQUENCY
With a transmitted signal as low as 82 Hz or 0.000082 MHz ( equals a wavelength of 3658536.5 meter or 3658.5 km ) , we are talking real longwaves .
At the Zevs military operating frequency , is the wavelength more then ¼ of the earths diameter .
If you think your backyard is too small for a half wavelength dipol - antenna at the 80 meter radio - amateur band , try to imagine a half wavelength dipol - antenna at a frequency as low as 82 Hz .
At this extrem low frequency , the half wavelength dipol antenna , would need to be 1829.25 km long , this is longer then the distance Moscow - Berlin or London - Napoli in Europa .
And the 82 Hz dipol would need to be longer then the distance between Miami - St. Louis or New York - New Orleans in North America .
Even the distance between Renatos QTH in Cumiana - Italy and mine here in Halden - Norway , at close to 1660 km , is shorter then a 82 Hz half - wave dipol .
But luckily for the designers of the ELF station Zevs , is there no need to design and construct gigantic antennas like these very large theoretical dipol antennas , to get a useful signal from the transmitter - site high above the arctic - circle near Murmansk , to the Russian submarines deep beneath the waves of the oceans .
The solution to this gigantic ELF antenna - problem , is in fact right under your feet .
THE KOLA PENINSULA TRANSMITTER FACILITY
The Russian ELF transmitter Zevs , was during the early 1990s detected around the globe , by several radio noise measurment systems operated by Stanford University .
The 82 Hz signal was even received at the base at Arrival Height in Antarctic ( 78 °S 167 °W ) .
At that time was there no information available about other ELF transmitters , then the US 76 Hz system .
And the contrast could not have been bigger , there was an extensive literature covering the development and deployment of the US WTF / MTF dual antenna transmitting system .
The Stanford University scientists , quickly assumed that the source for the 82 Hz signal was in Russia .
This logical deduction was based upon the comparatively large signal strength of the 82 Hz transmission at the Søndrestrømfjord 
Greenland , scientific station , and by references to a Russian ELF transmitter in a novel ( !!! ) by Tom Clancy , who has a reputation for accuracy in regard to defence matters .
They also predicted the construction and orientation of the transmitter antenna as a long horizontal electric dipole , oriented in an approximate east / west ( EW ) direction .
This has since been confirmed by Russian sources ; the transmitter consists of two swept - frequency generators of sinusoidal voltage and two parallel horizontal grounded antennas , each about 60 km long .
The generators provide 200-300 A currents in the antennas , in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 250 Hz
But there is one correction to be made ; the two parallel 60 km long antennas is not the antenna at all , but the feedline .
The actual antenna is the earth itself .
By building the antenna at a location with a poor effective conductivity of the ground , and by grounding the ends of the feedline / antenna , the signal is forced deep down into the earth , making the earth itself the effective radiating element .
The actual look of the visible part , the feedline , of this giant antenna , is much like the old telegraph wires hung up on telegraph poles .
Down from the last pole at the end of each antenna leg , there is a thick copper wire down to the ground and installed deep in a borehole , making up for the earth connection .
( See the open Lab article  Reception of submarine communication systems  by IK1QFK and OH2LX for an principal sketch of an ELF antenna system ) .
Calculations performed on data collected back in 1990 , also show us that the 82 Hz Zevs ELF transmitter is 10 dB more powerful then the US Navy 76 Hz ELF transmissions from the dual WMT / MTF sites .
We shall not delve nor exclude someone , with complicated mathematical explanations , but here is some facts :
The magnetic moment M ( Am² ) of a horizontal magnetic dipole ( HMD ) is expressed like this :
M=ILW
L is the antenna length ( m )
I is the antenna current ( A )
W is the effective vertical extent , or depth , of the antenna ( m )
W is found using a formula based on propagation constants and corresponding skin depth of the individual conductive layers of the ground beneath the ELF antenna .
For simplicity we declare that W=h1 where h1 is the depth of the first conductive layer .
If we compare with the US 76 Hz ELF transmitter :
The average effective conductivity of the earth beneath the WTF / MTF antennas is approximately 2.4 x 10 - 4S / m , which gives an effective depth of W ~ 2.6 km at a frequency of 76 Hz .
For the very low conductive Kola Peninsula area , there is a first layer with a conductivity of approximately 10 - 5 S/m down to a depth ( h1 ) of close to 10 km , beneath which is a second layer with a conductivity of approximately 10 - 3 S/m .
For the combined WTF / MTF antennas , operating at 76 Hz we have :
M ~ 2x300 ( A ) x 22.5 ( km ) x 2.6 ( km ) = 3.51 x 104 ( A km² )
Since the magnetic moment for the Zevs transmitter back in 1990 was assumed approximately 10 dB greater then that of the WTF / MTF combination , it must equal 1.1 x 105 ( A km² )
For an antenna length of 55 km , the required current I is 200 A .
That is , at 82 Hz :
M ~ 200 ( A ) x 55 ( km ) x 10 ( km ) = 1.1 x 105 ( A km² )
Because of the very low efficiency , the effective radiated power is only a couple of Watts ( !!) but that is enough to secure near global coverage at these frequencies , when the earth itself is the actual antenna .
TRANSMISSION MODE
The Zevs 82
Hz transmission is technically speaking , making use of a minimum shifted carrier , MSK .
This type of transmission mode , is in use by nearly all modern submarine - communication VLF band , 3  30 kHz , transmitter facilities .
What makes the transmission mode of the ZEVS and similar ELF transmitters so unique , is the very narrow frequencyshift of the transmitter carrier , during the message phase of the transmission .
The widest frequency shift observed , is in the narrow range 81 Hz to 83.3
Hz , at the start of a transmitted message !
The carrier shift of only 2.3 Hz. makes up the difference in a mark and a space of the MSK signal .
That obviously calls for some rather sophisticated decoding software used by the onboard communication computer - system of the submarine .
The ELF carrier frequency is shifted from the normal carrier frequency of 82 Hz , down to 81.6 Hz and up to 82.7
Hz , prior to this message .
This is most likely the message waiting  call function of the Russian ZEVS transmitter .
A Zevs transmission recorded in Italia by Renato Romero on the 8th of December 2000 , at 08:40 UTC .
The message waiting  signal , 81.6
Hz low for 8 minutes , 82.7
Hz high for 4 minutes is easily detected in thespectrogram .
After the 16 minutes long message sequence of the transmission is again the carrier at 82 Hz .
Because of the long exposure are the Schumann resonance bands easily visible at the bottom of the spectrogram .
ZEVS SIGNAL CODING AND DECODING
Even after reduction in the number of both Russian and American nuclear weapons , are there still enough atomic warheads , onboard submarines around the world , to wipe us off this planet once and for all .
When you are in control of the worlds fate , you dont want by accident - to start a nuclear ragnarock , leading to the third and last world war on the homeplanet .
There for are the on -ship communication computer set up to look for priority messages .
The clue is to construct codes that dont make to much harme , if the message is misunderstood .
Very little is known about the actual code used by the Russian ELF transmitter at the Kola peninsula .
If I had known the actual code , I would not have given the info anyway , so restless decoder addicts must cool down .
What is much more interesting then the actual code , is how these very slow transmission systems deliver the message to the receiver .
The Zevs transmitters nearly worldwide coverage , makes it possible to send one - way messages to submersed Russian submarines , in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
With the aid of ELF transmitters like the Russian Zevs , nuclear powered submarines can stay under water at operational depth with operational speed for weeks and months , out of sight for the enemy  .
The crudest way to contact a deep submerged submarine , is to use the carrier of the ELF transmitter as a bell ringer .
Much like in the classical gangster movies , dont call us we call you 
The captains orders for the mission , received at the homeport , ordering him to take the submarine to a specified location and stay there for a specific time , if not an ELF signal with the right frequency is detected by the computer on board the submarine .
If such a signal is detected , several actions are taken .
A possible scenario is to bring the sub from the secure deep waters to more shallow water , in order to receive new orders on standard communications frequencies , ranging from VLF and upwards .
INSIDE A RUSSIAN SUBMAR .
TYPE 227 , THE SUB IS AT PERISCOPE DEPTH
This can be done by launching the ELF / VLF communication buoy , which makes it possible to receive radio messages , target designation data and satelitte navigation signals while remaining at a reasonable safe depth .
Russian submarines like the type 667 DELTA  has two of these floating communication buoys .
Or with increased risk of being detected , the captain might take the submarine up to periscope depth and make use of satellite or other high data rate communication .
To make use of the Zevs full potensial as a one - way , but worldwide , communication tool , requiresome slightly more sophisticated message coding .
ELF transmissions make use of a very slow data rate , this combined with high natural noise - levels at the frequencies used , put special demand on the coding used for the message .
Messages making use of direct orders like :  fire ballistic missile 2,4,6,8 with preprogrammed address and ballistic missiles 1,3,5,7 redirected to 59°8  12  N 11°2355 E ( my QTH ! ) is not very likely , as a thiscertainly will cause an irreversible effect (! ) if this NOT was the intended message , but something incorrectly decoded , by the communication computer onboard the submarine .
With a transmission format using only a single three letter code and repeating this single code for the 15 minute message segment of an ELF transmission , it would still be possible to signal some 35937 different codes ( 33x33x33=35937 ) when the 33 letter Russian alphabet is used .
The coded message sent is a repeated , error correcting code .
The bit rate is a few bits per minute repeated until enough data is accumulated to let the receiver decide if a letter has been received successfully .
At the end of the message segment it is expected that three correct characters in the codeword have completed the journey  from the ZEVS transmitter to the submarine .
In the early 1990s the Zevs transmitter was at several times observed using telegraphy and morse code .
If the Russians still use this mode and code , the same rules apply for this type of communication .
The length of each dash or dot is of course very long , compared to normal speed morse - as heard on the radioamateur bands .
Instead of keying the carrier on and off , it would be beneficial for the quality of the transmission to use frequency shift in the transmitted carrier instead .
For an example on how this works tune to MKL , an LF transmitter , operating at 82.75 kHz from Kinloss in Scotland , MKL use this mode and code for the TAFS ( weather forecast / report ) transmission on the hour , every hour .
Some sources list other kinds of operational modes for the ELF transmitters like Zevs , some of them obviously monitored during test transmissions .
But the simplest mode of them all and the most frightening one , - is the continous transmission mode .
A specific code ,  the situation is normal is continuously sent , more then foreseen and programmed breaks in this chain of OKs , signal that an extreme situation has been established .
This break in , and loss of all data from the surface , is an order to start a new sequence of actions based on this new situation on land .
Obvious a communication mode for a nation , already in full nuclear attack alert .
Let it never happen .
NON - MILITARY USE OF THE ZEVS TRANSMITTER
In contrary to the US dual WTF / MTF facility , is the CIS ELF transmitter Zevs at the Kola peninsula , not exclusively used for military communication purposes .
The ELF electromagnetic waves do not only penetrate water but also the ground to great depths .
This propertyare used for geophysical research .
Electromagnetic sounding and monitoring of the earths crust was in 1994 performed by Earth Crust institute of St. Petersburg and the Geological institute of the Kola Science Center .
Frequencies used was in the range 31 - 166
Hz and high resolutions of signals could be measured up to several thousand of kilometres from the source .
From 1995 and onwards the Zevs transmitter has been used in various research projects connected with seismic activity monitoring .
Precursors like variations in rock conductance and ionosphere disturbance are important early warning signals for earthquake preparation .
The use of the 82 Hz Zevs carrier provides a higher accuracy of measurements , making it possible to extract data from very deep soundings not earlier possible by using standard sources of pulsed electromagnetic field .
In Northern Caucasus , at 2700 km from the Kola Peninsula , is the 82 Hz field strong enough to make confident measurements using standard wideband ACF - 2 instruments for audiomagnetotellurics ( AMT ) soundings .
Closer to Kola , at distances of only  950 km on the Karelia isthmus is the 82 Hz ELF signal used for collecting correlation data for the vertical tide deformation of the earth surface .
This deformation also causes changes in the earths conductivity , in the same way as before an earthquake .
This normal deformation correction data , of up to 20 cm at the Karelia test - site ( but up to 60 cm tidal deformation is normal at the equator ) , is necessary to effectively analyse early warning signals before a possible earth quake .
In China is this promising method for earthquake detection , used in the experimental studies and cooperation between Institute of Geology , China Seismological Bureau in Beijing and St. Petersburg State University in Russia , at several test - sites in the vicinity of Beijing , Baodi and Jixian in northern China .
ELF , AN OFTEN USED AND MISUSED PHRASE
Search for ELF on the web and you get quite a number of hits , directing you from small fairies and elfs , via a French oil company , to the wildest histories about death rays , mind control and electronic warfare .
Electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the ELF range , might of course like all electromagnetic radiation , seriously damage your health .
If the field is strong enough , if you has been exposed to an electromagnetic field too long .
If ...
I do not say that the ELF doomsday profets and activists are wrong .
The human body is full of electrical signals of several different frequencies , all non-natural fields , like TV , cellular phones , military transmissions , the mains and electrical fields etc. from all the other electrical
gadgets we humans all like to use and vorship , will of course interact with those natural occurring signals .
A well known authority in the field is once quoted like this :
 The human body is an electrically conducting fluid  just a big sack of salty water .
Any fluctuating magnetic field in a conductive fluid sets up electric currents .
 This is supposed to have an effect on the natural electrobiological signals in the human body .
How this will affect the human race in the long term , we do not know .
What is certain is the fact that lot of non-technical writers , do like to call ; HAARP , The absent Russian wood - pecker , and standard VLF transmitters for ELF .
A for all things evil suitable mysterious phrase .
Transmitters using HF transmission frequencies , but with modulation signals in the ELF range , like some HF Over The Horizon Radars , OTHRs , are not at all ELF transmitters .
2.2
Hz unidentified submarine communication received by Renato Romero in Italia
The same apply to ionospheric heaters like Eiscat and HAARP , the ELF signal is the secondary product of the HF transmission .
With transmitters like HAARP , who modulate the polar electrojet with ELF frequencies , is also the gigantic antenna problem a thing of the past .
Now , not only the earth , but the atmosphere to , act as the radiating element .
The HAARP transmitter facility at Gakona in Alaska is using this effect for ( test ) transmissions at 2.2 Hz to US submarines .
A future focus of interest and well worth the effort , to investigate into , is the very interesting information regarding other kind of manmade Extrem Low Frequency transmissions , like various tethered ELF antenna tests , both within and without the earths atmosphere .
There are also some rumours , that among other is the Indian Navy very much interested in an ELF transmitter facility to communicate with their Russian built Kilo class submarines .

Max Gross , author of From Schlub to Stud : How to Embrace Your Inner Mensch and Conquer the Big City , will be blogging all week as one of Jewcy ‘s Lit Klatsch bloggers .
Gross is a real estate reporter for the New York Post , and also one of Jewcy editor Michael Weiss ’s closest friends .
Weiss can attest to Max ’s being both a schlub and a mensch .
Since she first went on the campaign trail , Sarah Palin has been called many things , but I think Judith Warner might have come up with a new one in her op - ed in Sunday ’s Times …
She essentially calls Palin a schlemile .
( Sort of .
Warner quotes the great Bella Abzug saying , " Our struggle today is not to have a female Einstein get appointed as an assistant professor .
It is for a woman schlemile to get as quickly promoted as a male schlemile . "
And then she applies that to Palin . )
It ’s a mostly fair characterization .
In fact , it ’s worth one ’s time to look at the classic definition of a schlemile , going by Leo Rosten in The Joys of Yiddish ) which goes something like this :
1 ) A foolish person ; a simpleton .
" He has the brains of a shlemile . "
[ MPG : Rosten very rarely uses the " c " in his " sch " Yiddish words . ]
2 ) A consistently unlucky or unfortunate person ; a " fall guy " ; a hard - luck type ; a born loser ; a submissive and uncomplaining victim .
" That poor shlemile always gets the short end of the stick . "
A Yiddish proverb goes : " A shlemile falls on his back and breaks his nose . "
3 ) A clumsy , butterfingered , all - thumbs , gauche type .
" Why does a shlemile like that ever try to fix anything ? "
4 ) A social misfit , congenitally maladjusted .
" Do n’t invite that shlemile to the party . "
5 ) A pipsqueak , a Caspar Milquetoast .
" He throws as much weight as a shlemile . "
" No one pays attention to that shlemile . "
6 ) A naive , trusting , gullible customer .
The usage is common among furniture dealers , especially those who sell the gaudy , gimcrack stuff called " borax . "
7 ) Anyone who makes a foolish bargain , or wagers a foolish bet .
This usage is wide in Europe ; it probably comes from Chamisso ’s tale Peter Schlemihl ’s Wunderbare Geschichte , a fable in which the protagonist sold his shadow and , like Faust , sold his soul to Satan .
Obviously , not all of these things fit precisely with Sarah Palin .
I would be hard pressed to think that someone who has come so far on so little is in any way " unlucky " or " unfortunate . "
Quite the opposite .
Nor is Palin a social misfit — if anything , her social status is her greatest strength .
( Her only strength , when you get right down to it . )
But she certainly fits in with the first definition .
( You really could n’t ask for better words than " Foolish " and " Simpleton " to describe her . )
The third definition I could go either way on .
Who knows if Sarah Palin is handy around the house ( I ’m sure she is ) but she definitely strikes me as more than a little gauche .
And I think definitions five , six and seven are all very fair .
( Certainly if you watch Tina Fey ’s portrayal . )
Which leads me to believe : Warner is right .
Sarah Palin is , for the most part , a genuine schlemile .
Which , I hate to say , does inspire some pity and sympathy for her — even in a yellow dog Democrat like myself .
For a long time now Sarah Palin has clearly been in way over her head — and this has made me wonder if she woke up every morning praying that this non-ending parade of ridicule and media scrutiny were just some dreadful nightmare .
Moreover , the worst you could say about her ( until she started playing viciously ) was that she did n’t quite appreciate how unqualified she was .
It ’s not easy being self - aware ( most people are n’t ) and Palin clearly was not .
That ’s not her fault , exactly .
It ’s a reason to vote against her — not to hate her .
But sympathy only goes so far …
Rosten adds something important to his entry on schlemiles : " It is important to observe that shlemile , like nebech [ nebbish ] , carries a distinctive note of pity .
In fact , a shlemile is often a nebech ’s twin brother .
The classic definition goes : ‘ A shlemile is always knocking things off a table ; the nebech always picks them up . ’ "
After eight years of picking up after George W. Bush , personally , I ’ve had enough schlemiles in the executive branch .
Demorcrats were always the much more nebbishy party .
Vote nebbish in ’08 !

Published : Aug 15 , 2007
Mexico has had many revolutions , but the 10 - year Revolution of 1910 had the most impact on that country .
Under the rule of Gen. Porfirio Diaz , a small minority controlled the country 's wealth and the majority of Mexicans worked and lived in poverty .
The country was divided into factions , and rebels roamed freely , killing citizens and government officials who were not aligned with their cause .
During the Revolution of 1910 , tens of thousands of Mexicans fled into the United States to avoid the violence and to find a better life .
The lives of Americans living along the border towns of Nogales , Naco and Douglas were endangered by the constant violence that spilled over the border .
In January 1916 , Pancho Villa 's army killed 16 American engineers at Santa Ysabel , Mexico .
In March of that year , Villa led an attack on Columbus , N.M. , that left 17 Americans dead .
President Wilson sent Gen. John Pershing to the border to stop the violence and capture Villa , dead or alive .
Joining the military team dispatched to secure the Arizona border was the 1st Arizona Infantry Regiment of the Arizona National Guard .
Almost 100 years later , not much has changed .
Instead of Pancho Villa and Emilio Zapata , the players are the Mexican cartels : Sinaloa , Los Zetas , Gulf , Juarez and Tijuana .
All the cartels are drug - trafficking organizations whose members are engaged in a war against the Mexican government for control of land .
This time , it is not for the people of Mexico but for control of smuggling routes for drugs , guns and human - trafficking dollars .
Police officers , soldiers , judges , prosecutors and innocent bystanders are dying by the thousands in this new revolution .
Mexican citizens are once again fleeing across the border for a better life in the United States .
Now , as in 1916 , law enforcement and the National Guard have been sent to the border to stem the tide .
This drug war between the drug cartels and government forces began on Dec. 11 , 2006 , when President Felipe Calder�n mobilized federal troops to put an end to the gang violence that had been in full swing since the late 1980s .
During this period , Colombian cocaine traffickers formed alliances with Mexican marijuana and heroin traffickers for alternative U.S. distribution routes because of the intense law - enforcement pressure in Florida .
When the Colombian cartels fell apart after the arrest of the cartel leaders by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , Mexico became the primary distributor of cocaine into the U.S. and the Mexican drug lords started to fight for control of the lucrative drug routes .
President Calder�n 's crackdown on the cartels and government corruption triggered the carnage we see and read about in Mexico .
This year , more than 4,000 people have been killed as a direct result of the cartel war with the Mexican government .
Just last week , funeral wreaths were placed at the homes of several state police officers in Nogales , Sonora .
Attached to the wreaths were handwritten messages that said , " This is a message for the State Police .
If you get in our way we are going to kill you with your family and all your descendants .
( signed ) Gulf Cartel . "
These are not threats but promises .
The Mexican drug cartels are committed to bringing the Mexican government to its knees by dismantling the fragile criminal - justice and military components .
Arizona has always experienced border violence , but now , the spillover from the drug wars is festering and is threatening us .
In the past , drug smugglers and other border traffickers were reluctant to engage with U.S. law enforcement .
Not anymore .
As the cartels continue to grow more powerful in Mexico , they are becoming ever more violent .
It is just a matter of time before the violence reaches across the border .
Maricopa County has the distinction of being the kidnapping capital of the country because of the number cases involving illegal aliens who are held for ransom by human - smuggling groups .
Much of the money obtained from these crimes goes to the cartels to finance drug purchases .
The drophouse - ransom cases , assaults on American peace officers working along the border and the increase in border bandits are barometers of things to come .
The solution to this and the related immigration problem is both complex and simple .
I think almost everybody agrees that we must secure our borders and that every migrant who enters the United States must do so legally .
The more than 300,000 illegal aliens entering the U.S. annually from our southern border is virtually impossible to stop .
We can not arrest our way out of this .
There are not enough jail beds , prosecutors , public defenders , judges and deputy U.S. marshals now to handle the small percentage that are arrested and prosecuted .
The long - term solution is not in state capitols or Washington , D.C. , but in Mexico City .
Until the Mexican people can prosper at home , nothing will change .
A high - ranking Mexican police official told me recently that the thirst for drugs in America and the availability of guns play a major part in the thousands of deaths in Mexico .
A little oversimplified , but he had a good point .
We need to reduce the consumption of drugs in the U.S.
When the majority of marijuana , cocaine , heroin and meth is sold in the U.S. and comes here via Mexico , you can understand why the cartels will stop at nothing to get their drugs here .
Federal , state , and local police agencies need to do a better job of coordinating and sharing information and intelligence to take out the cartels and other organized - crime leaders .
We also need to stem the tide of guns , purchased primarily through straw buyers , that is flooding into Mexico from border states .
Our efforts in this area are dismal .
As Albert Einstein said , " We can not solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . "
Author risks fury of millions of women with a claim that THEY are to blame when husbands stray
It is a philosophy sure to enrage every cheated wife .
A counsellor turned author claims that women are to blame for their husbands ' indiscretions .
Psychotherapist Gary Neuman has written a guide to changes that women should make in order to stop their partners from straying .
Gary Neuman has advised women on how to prevent their partners from cheating ( picture posed by model )
It is the second book in a week that recommends women take a subservient role in marriage .
Mr Neuman 's advice includes always forgiving him , providing sex on demand and taking an interest in his hobbies .
In his book , Advice in The Truth About Cheating : Why Men Stray and What You Can Do to Prevent
It , he says a woman should praise her man for providing for the family , even if she earns more than him .
The author , who has been featured on Oprah Winfrey 's TV show and in Time magazine , claims his book is ' dedicated to helping wives ' .
But not all women appreciated the recommendations .
' This is an appalling book , ' said Susan Quilliam , a relationship psychologist and author .
' It 's more like dog - training than being in an honest , successful , adult relationship . '
Dorothy Ramsay , chairman of the Association for Family Therapy , questioned whether the book was written as a joke .
She said : ' It depends whether you see marriage as so worthwhile that it 's worth sacrificing one human being to sustain it . '
Mr Neuman said he was just trying to give women some useful advice .
He questioned 25,500 faithful and unfaithful men and found almost 90 per cent linked cheating to some ' significant dissatisfaction ' in their marriage .
He added : ' Men will eventually find their way into the arms of another if they are not getting enough sex at home . '
The Re-education Of The Female , which tells women to follow their man 's orders if they want to keep him , has been a recent success in the U.S .
It says that women should wear sexy clothes while doing the cooking and cleaning .
And despite first - time author Dante Moore 's chauvinist opinions , copies have been flying off the shelves in America .
One piece of advice reads : ' Here 's a little secret , ladies .
Men never really ask for anything .
They command .
And believe me , what you wo n't do , ten broads around the corner will . '
" The Atlantis Aquarists believe the shark was startled by an unusual circumstance that we have no way of defining completely .

You have read and heard over and over one way to conserve energy is to turn off and unplug your computers right ?
Well , now World Community Grid , Harvard University and a few other sponsors are asking you to leave your computers on for their new project .
The project with and eco-friendly mission is called The Clean Energy Project .
" The mission of The Clean Energy project is to discover organic materials to create a more efficient and lower cost solar cell . "
If you are wondering how The Clean Energy Project will help find solar cell materials , you are not alone , but it involves a lot of volunteers , the volunteers ' computers , a program download onto volunteer s' computers , the data collected from the computers and a lot of research by the researchers in Harvard University 's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology .
The Clean Energy Project FAQ section at the World Community Grid website explains the project like this :
Understanding the properties of new materials that are the basis of alternative sources of renewable energy represents one of today 's major scientific challenges .
Many of these materials are composed of large organic molecules that contain hundreds of atoms .
These atoms can be rearranged in multiple ways to fine - tune the properties of the desired material .
With the aid of World Community Grid , researchers will evaluate the conductive properties of at least 100,000 molecular structures ( created by combinatorial methods ) that are suitable for organic solar cells applications .
The results of such an enormous number of computations will be used to create a database of molecular properties for data mining , which will be publicly available .
As a volunteer , other than helping make a difference , you can also receive project badges and participate in the project 's forums .
For each level achieved in the project a badge appears as images on a member 's page .
There are 3 badge levels : Bronze , Silver , and Gold .
For a Gold badge a member would need to participate for 90 days .
For a bronze badge 14 days of participation is the minimum required .
What about hackers ?

We 've been pretty quiet lately , but thankfully , that 's about to end .
In the next few days we 'll have an update out that has a couple of new features for the Engineer and Spy , and a variety of other smaller fixes .
Teleporters will be upgradeable to level 3 .
As the teleporter is upgraded , the cooldown will decrease .
Dispensers will be upgradeable to level 3 .
They will heal faster and generate metal faster as they are upgraded .
Spies will be able to recharge their cloaking ability by picking up ammo off of the ground .
We 've made a bunch of minor changes by adding particle systems and upgrading the HUD to show things like deaths by critical hits , players that are overhealed , and giving more information to medics when people are calling for them .
These are just to work on some class balance and depth issues that we 've seen in the wild with these two classes , but are n't meant to replace their entire class packs .
They will be getting more attention further down the road .
While that 's in testing , we 're off working on several things that folks have been emailing us about , so we thought it'd be good to provide some detail :
Analyst : Obama fears punishing Lieberman would make him a GOP hero David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 11 , 2008
Print This Email This
In the wake of the presidential election , one of the most vexing problems for Senate Democrats is how to deal with Senator Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , who not only supported the candidacy of John McCain but broke earlier promises by engaging in negative campaigning against Barack Obama .
Obama himself reportedly has told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid he would like to see Lieberman remain within the Democratic caucus .
Political analyst Howard Fineman explained to MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Monday why he believes Obama 's position makes sense .
" It 's clear to me that Barack Obama 's going to operate as the good cop , surrounded by a whole squad car of bad cops , " Fineman began .
" He 's going to be the one saying -- no-drama Obama -- ' Let 's save our fight and our fire for the tough battles .
After all , Joe Lieberman votes with the Democrats on domestic policy 90 % of the time .
And let 's not make a hero of him by trying to kick him out of the party . ' "
Reid had already begun negotiations last week to keep Lieberman within the Democratic caucus while removing him as chairman of the powerful Homeland Security Committee , but Lieberman had threatened that the loss of his chairmanship could be a deal - breaker .
A vote by secret ballot on the matter will come at a Democratic caucus next week , and according to Fineman , the senators are deeply divided .
Some favor making concessions , while Dick Durbin , a long - time Obama supporter , " is really loaded for bear about Lieberman .
He wants to kick Lieberman off that chairmanship . "
" I think it 's going to be dramatic , " Fineman commented .
However , he added , " I think Obama 's made it plain that he wants to be the uniter .
...
He does n't want to pick unnecessary fights .
...
He 's going to have enough tough fights ahead . "
Fineman suggested that it is particularly important for Obama to set a bipartisan tone because John McCain and Lindsay Graham have been signaling they are prepared to do business with an Obama administration .
" I would n't be surprised to see Obama hand the immigration brief , in a sense , to John McCain , say , ' Here , buddy , you take it , ' " commented Fineman .
" It would be very shrewd . "

The Orphan Works
Act of 2008 was passed by the Senate last week , but the House failed to take action before taking off for a couple of days , and the bill may be dead until after the fall election .
The bill would have loosened restrictions on using copyright - protected works that have been abandoned by their creators .
It has faced strong opposition from copyright holders who fear it could create loopholes that would insulate perpetrators of commercial copyright infringement .
The Senate passed the bill after making changes intended to clarify the language and provide a higher level of specificity .
The House version of the bill states that individuals are entitled to make use of a work after conducting a " diligent search " for the copyright holder .
That aspect of the bill generated controversy and was regarded by some in the content industry as excessively vague .
Critics were concerned that the copyright office , which would ultimately have the task of interpreting the legislation and defining the standards for diligence , would be unable to devise consistent requirements .
The final version of the bill included an expanded definition of " diligent search " that instructs users to seek expert assistance and look in Internet databases and Copyright Office records to try to ascertain the rights - holder before using a work without permission .
Specifically , users must first search the relevant Copyright Office records , search for the owner in " reasonably available " sources of information , use technology and printed publications , and search various databases , including those available online .
In fact , the bill specifies that these guidelines are merely minimums , and as pointed out by Public Knowledge , it also asks the Copyright Office to take into account comments from the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy in order to determine best practices .
This was added , no doubt , in order to quell critics ' fears that the Copyright Office was not well - equipped to handle the job entirely on its own .
Unfortunately , after the Senate passed its version of the bill , it was sent to the House just as all hell broke loose over the current economic situation in the US , leaving it lost in the fallout from the failed attempt to pass the $ 700 billion bailout bill .
As a result , lobbyists have apparently told Wired that the House is n't likely to take up the Orphan Works Act until after the November election .

Traders remain deeply concerned about the state of the US economy
Wall Street shares plummeted on Wednesday , the day after the US presidential election .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 496.3 points , or 5.2 % , to end the day at 9,129 .
The falls wiped out the gains from the election day surge on Tuesday , when the Dow Jones closed up 3.3 % .
Shares fell as weak economic data highlighted the challenges that will face the new administration when it takes over in January .
Economic worries
Among the figures was a report showing that the US services sector had contracted sharply in October .
The Institute for Supply Management 's service sector index fell to 44.4 in October from 50.2 in September , which is its worst reading since 1982 .
There was also a report from ADP Employer Services showing that private employers made their biggest job cuts for six years last month , which made traders nervous ahead of Friday 's monthly unemployment figures .
With all the worries about the economy , there is also some nervousness about whom President - elect Barack Obama will choose as his treasury secretary .
The fallers were led by financial institutions , with Citigroup and AIG both down 14 % and Bank of America falling 10 % .
The recent volatility has been partly blamed on the light volumes of trading , which have exaggerated the movements in share prices .
During my last weeks in office , I recommended to President Bush that he consider Gen.
David Petraeus as commander of coalition forces in Iraq , as General Casey ’s tour was coming to an end .
General Petraeus and his deputy , Gen. Ray Odierno , had the experience and skill to recognize and exploit the seismic shifts that were taking place in Iraq ’s political landscape .
And United States troops had the courage to win the alliance of Iraq ’s people against a common enemy  and the benevolence to win their friendship .

At the critical moment  a moment when the Iraqis were able and willing to be part of the surge with the American forces  the United States surged into Iraq with the right commanders , additional forces and a fresh operational approach rooted in years of on - the - ground experience .
Americans can be proud of what has been accomplished in Iraq over the last five - plus years .
They should also be impressed by the results of the surge , which , thus far , has outstripped expectations , including mine .
President Bush ’s decision to increase combat troop levels in Iraq in January 2007 sent a clear message that he was determined not to abandon a people to death squads and terrorists .
We will need the same commitment to helping the people of Afghanistan succeed , but that does not mean we will achieve it with the same tactics or strategies .
The way forward in Afghanistan will need to reflect the current circumstances there  not the circumstances in Iraq two years ago .
Additional troops in Afghanistan may be necessary , but they will not , by themselves , be sufficient to lead to the results we saw in Iraq .
A similar confluence of events that contributed to success in Iraq does not appear to exist in Afghanistan .
What ’s needed in Afghanistan is an Afghan solution , just as Iraqi solutions have contributed so fundamentally to progress in Iraq .
And a surge , if it is to be successful , will need to be an Afghan surge .
Left unanswered in the current debate is the critical question of how thousands of additional American troops might actually bring long - term stability to Afghanistan  a country 80,000 square miles larger than Iraq yet with security forces just one - fourth the size of Iraq ’s .
Afghanistan also lacks Iraq ’s oil and other economic advantages .
It is plagued by the narcotics trade .
Its borders are threatened by terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan .
Fractured groups of Pashtun tribesmen on both sides of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border do not yet appear willing to unite and take on the insurgents in their midst , as Arab tribes did in Iraq .
Further , Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign armies that sought strength in numbers .
The Soviet Union tried to occupy Afghanistan with hundreds of thousands of troops  and withdrew , defeated and broken .
More United States troops could raise tensions , particularly in Afghanistan ’s Pashtun south , where the insurgency is strongest .
Spotting obvious visual changes can sometimes be difficult
Most of us know what it is like to look at something but fail to see the obvious , such as a traffic light turning green .
UK researchers at University College London , along with US colleagues from Princeton University , have located the brain 's parietal cortex as key .
Switching this area off causes change blindness , Cerebral Cortex reports .
There has been increasing evidence from brain scan studies to suggest that awareness of what we see is not only down to the part of the brain that processes visual information - the visual cortex - but also other brain regions .
Professor Nilli Lavie and colleagues at UCL focused on an area called the parietal cortex , which is involved with concentration .
Even dramatic changes can go unnoticed
Professor Nilli Lavie , study author
Using a process called transcranial magnetic stimulation , which delivers currents to the brain , they were able to temporarily switch off the parietal cortex in nine healthy volunteers .
Visual trickery
When they did this , the volunteers failed to notice big changes in visual scenes , such as when one of four faces on a video screen was replaced by another face .
The exact critical spot in the parietal cortex lies just a few centimetres above and behind the right ear - the area many people scratch when concentration .
Magicians often exploit change blindness for their tricks
The researchers believe their findings explain change blindness , a phenomenon often exploited by magicians .
Professor Lavie said : " The finding that this region of the brain has both these functions , concentration and visual awareness , explains why we can be so easily deceived by , say , a magicians ' trick .
" When we 're concentrating so hard on something that our processing capacity is at its limits , the parietal cortex is not available to pay attention to new things and even dramatic changes can go unnoticed .
" If you 're concentrating on what the magician 's left hand is doing , you wo n't notice what the right hand is doing . "
Medical Research Council scientist Dr John Duncan said : " Doubtless , many other parts of the brain are involved . "
He said findings such as these might help shed light on medical conditions that can affect a person 's perception and attention .
For example , brain damage due to stroke can sometimes mean the individual will completely ignore one side of their body .
