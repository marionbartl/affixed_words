The Chinese military ’s destruction of one of China ’s own satellites last month was an unexpected , disruptive , and potentially very alarming event .
Was the People ’s Liberation Army beating its chest and showing its potential ?
Was there confusion within the Chinese government — as suggested by the several - day delay before the Foreign Ministry began answering questions about what had happened ?
Was this some ill - advised reverse - backflip attempt to force the United States to reenter negotiations for a treaty banning space warfare ?
Was this the most ominous step the Chinese government has taken in a long time ?
Or the most foolish ?
Both ?
No one outside the Chinese government knows at this point , and perhaps very few people inside it .
What is clear is that the worst - positioned person to scold China about its behavior is the one who just did : Vice President Dick Cheney .
In his speech yesterday in Australia , the Vice President helpfully observed that the satellite test , plus the buildup of China ’s military ( with a budget still a tiny fraction of America ’s ) was “ not consistent with China ’s stated goal of a peaceful rise . ”
Let ’s assume , for argument , that China intends to convert its growing economic power into military strength .
Let ’s assume that its strategic and territorial ambitions are at odds with America’s .
Let ’s assume that it intends to upset the international order in countless ways .
Let ’s assume a lot of other things that I do n’t think are true .

Even if all those things were true , there could be no less effective spokesman for American concern or for the interests of international order than Cheney .
This is the man who has refused to answer to his own public for — well , for anything .
For his insistence that everything has gone just as planned in Iraq .
For his claim before the war that “ There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction . ”
For his claim after the war that the Iraqi insurgency was in its “ last throes . ”
For his role , as described in prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald ’s closing statement , as the central , unindicted malefactor in the Scooter Libby case .
Even for shooting his friend in the face .
Say what you will about Al Gore ’s wooden “ no controlling legal authority ” rationalization when he was asked to explain campaign donations he received .

A number of years ago I was working on the scenery system for the open source FlightGear flight simulator .
Due to the nature of geodata and the scenery building system , I ended up with tens of thousands of tiny files on my hard drive , many only a few bytes long , and I was constantly running out of disk space .
Then I read about an alternative filesystem for Linux called ReiserFS , part of a new generation of journaling filesystems .
Unlike the others , however , ReiserFS had a special innovation : it allowed multiple very small files to share the same block , so that a 5 - byte file would not automatically take up 512 bytes ( or whatever your block size was ) .
I switched over , and bingo !
There was suddenly a huge amount of free space on my previously - full hard drive , and I noticed no performance problems ( aside from the occasional tiny zombie file that I could n’t delete ) .
I ’ve been running Reiser ever since , but the filesystem has fallen on hard times .
On 14 September 2006 ( via Tony Coates ) , Jeff Mahoney announced that the SuSE Linux distribution would no longer use ReiserFS as its default .
Mahoney is also one of the principal ReiserFS developers , and he wrote that ReiserFS3 does not scale , that it has a small and shrinking developer community inadequate to maintain it , and that ReiserFS4 is “ an interesting research file system , but that ’s about as far as it goes . ”
Then , on 10 October 2006 Hans Reiser , the principal maintainer , was arrested and charged with the murder of his estranged wife Nina .
SuSE was the only Linux distribution that used Reiser as its default filesystem .
This c|net story links the SuSE decision with the murder charges , but it ’s worth noting that Mahoney ’s message predates the charges by almost a month .
Whatever the cause , however , Novell ( SuSE ’s owner ) had contributed significant resources towards the maintenance of ReiserFS .
It no longer looks like ReiserFS has any future at all , and in its current state , it has performance and scalability problems that prevent its use in high - demand environments .
ReiserFS was a big help to me when I needed it a few years back , but the next time I install Ubuntu , I ’ll use the default ext3 filesystem instead .
Hard disks — even for notebook computers — are a lot bigger and cheaper now , anyway .

As a follow - up to our wildly successful impeachment Town Hall meeting with Minneapolis City Council Members Cam Gordon and Elizabeth Glidden and Council Member Remington coming out for impeachment , we ’re calling on citizens to do three things :
* Call your Council Member
* Attend the City Council Meetings
* Flyer neighborhoods to spread the word ( on car windows , doors , etc ) .
Here ’s the flyer ( If you hand out the flyer in your neighborhood , circle the councilmember who represents your neighborhood so folks know who represents them . )
Attend the Minneapolis City Council Meetings with impeachment signs and shirts to show support .
According to sources on the Minneapolis City Council .
The idea is to be a visual advertisement of the call on them to impeach !

A copy of the impeachment resolution we ’re suggesting is here :
http://impeachforpeace.org/impeach_bush_blog/?p=2195
Is Bush / Cheney Impeachment a City Council ’s Job ?
– City Council members take an oath of office promising to “ protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic .
They do n’t take an oath to fix potholes .
If the Constitution is in danger then their primary duty is to defend it .
– Cities and towns routinely send petitions to Congress for all kinds of requests .
This is allowed under Clause 3 , Rule XII , Section 819 , of the Rules of the House of Representatives .
This clause is routinely used to accept petitions from cities , and memorials from states , all across America .
Is Impeachment a Local Issue ?
– If a federal action has a significant negative impact on this city , then it is appropriate for this city to defend itself .
– Citizens from this city may be sent , or have been sent , to Iraq to fight in an illegal war .
– Tax funds from this city that could have been spent locally have been spent in Iraq for war .
Tax money from this city has been wasted in no -bid contracts with companies like Halliburton .
Yet this city can barely afford the emergency services , libraries , and schools that we need .
– The State National Guard should be available to protect this city from floods or other disasters .
But instead , this administration has sent them to Iraq .

Aerotrain Concept
Second Generation Prototype
-- by JD
The Aerotrain is an interesting transportation idea currently being prototyped by Yasuaki Kohama and his group at Tohoku University in Japan .
The basic idea of the Aerotrain is to create a " levitating " train by using the aerodynamic principle of ground lift -- a phenomenon which boosts the lift of a wing when flying close to the ground .
This makes it possible to achieve many of the advantages of a maglev train , without the expensive coils .
A practical system could fly at speeds of 500 km /h , while consuming about 1/2 to 1/3 the energy of the bullet train .
The current goal of Professor Kohama 's group is to complete a 350 passenger craft with a speed of 500 km / h by 2020 .
There is also a Quicktime video of the prototype here
The USA is the world 's foremost economic and military power , with global interests and an unmatched global reach .
America 's gross domestic product accounts for close to a quarter of the world total , and its military budget is reckoned to be almost as much as the rest of the world 's defence spending put together .
The country is also a major source of entertainment : American TV , Hollywood films , jazz , blues , rock and rap music are primary ingredients in global popular culture .

The US contains a highly diverse population , the product of numerous and sustained waves of immigration .
Ethnic and racial diversity - the " melting pot " - is celebrated as a core element of the American ideology .
The 1964 Civil Rights
Act outlawed racial and other discrimination , but race continues to be a live issue .
The election of Barack Obama as the country 's first African - American president in November 2008 marked a defining moment in the country 's chequered history of race relations .

' Melting pot ' America
The original people of north America , who made up several distinct groups of native Americans , went into decline with the arrival of settlers and now constitute a minority of the population .
The early settlers came predominantly from the British Isles .
Large numbers of black Africans were taken as slaves to work the plantations of the Americas , while millions of Europeans in search of political freedom and economic opportunity constituted a third stage of immigration .
Today , Asians from the Pacific rim and Hispanics from the southern Americas are among those seeking what their predecessors wanted - the promise of prosperity and freedom which remains one of the defining hallmarks of " the American dream " .
Despite relative prosperity in recent years , the gap between rich and poor remains a major challenge .
More than 30 million Americans live below the official poverty line , with a disproportionate percentage of these being African - Americans and Hispanics .
Furthermore , the global financial crisis of 2008 has left the US facing its most challenging set of economic circumstances since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
9/11 aftermath
The terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 had a momentous impact as the country continued to re-define its role as the world 's only superpower .

In October 2001 the US led a military campaign in Afghanistan which unseated the Taleban regime .
However , the man thought to have inspired the 9/11 attacks , Al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden escaped the operation and eluded the US until 2011 , when killed in a US special forces operation in Pakistan .
In March 2003 Washington initiated military action in Iraq which led to the toppling of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
US foreign policy has often mixed the idealism of its " mission " to spread democracy with the pursuit of national self - interest .
Given America 's leading role on the international stage , its foreign policy aims and actions are likely to remain the subject of heated debate and criticism , as well as praise .

President : Barack Obama
President Obama faces formidable challenges
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was elected the first black president of the United States in an historic election win in November 2008 .
His emphatic victory over his opponent John McCain , who struggled in vain to distance himself from the unpopular presidency of George W. Bush , ended eight years of Republican rule in the White House .
Mr Obama clinched the Democratic Party 's nomination in June 2008 , following a long and bruising primary race with former first lady and fellow Democratic senator , Hillary Clinton .
He ran for president on a ticket promising change , and came to office riding a wave of high expectations from his supporters , both at home and abroad .
President Obama inherited a formidable in - tray of problems from Mr Bush .
The US was facing its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , and his administration the task of determining the next steps in the lingering conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He made reform of the healthcare system to extend coverage and reduce ballooning costs one of his top domestic priorities .
Congress , government 's law - making branch , consists of : The Senate - 100 members , two from each state , serving six - year terms House of Representatives - 435 members , serving two - year terms
Glossary : US politics
Despite a tortuous drafting process and vociferous Republican opposition , Mr Obama and Democrats in Congress finally succeeded in passing a health care bill in March 2010 .
However , the health reform , along with the $ 787bn stimulus package passed in February 2010 to shore up an ailing economy , galvanised opposition among some Americans to Mr Obama 's agenda .
The American Right in particular worries about what it sees as moves to extend the role of the state in the economy , and the threat of excessive public debt .
The rise of the conservative Tea Party movement in 2009 re-energised the Republicans and helped them to capitalise on popular discontent at the slow pace of America 's economic recovery .
The Republicans made sweeping gains in mid-term elections in November 2010 , regaining control of the House of Representatives .
The mid-term election result represented a serious setback for Mr Obama , as with his opponents controlling the House the president is likely to find it much harder to turn his plans into laws .
In the autumn of 2011 anti-capitalist protestors took to the streets of major cities , marching under the slogan " Occupy Wall Street " , against " corporate greed " and increasing government debt .
The protests inspired marches in other cities worldwide in October 2011 .
In May 2011 , he was widely applauded domestically - including by the Right - for his decision to order the operation that killed Al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden .
Barack Obama is widely acknowledged as a charismatic figure and is noted for his stirring oratory .
He was born in 1961 in Hawaii , the son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother .
After attending an elite Hawaii academy and Columbia University in New York , he went on to Harvard Law School , where he graduated in 1991 .
After graduating , Mr Obama practiced law and did community work in Chicago , where he also became active in the Democratic Party .
He won a seat in the Illinois state senate in 1996 , and followed this up by winning a US Senate seat in 2004 .

It is ironic that one consequence of global warming is that Europe might plunge into a deep freeze .
This possibility stimulated an unusual research project at the University of Alberta .
Dr. Peter Flynn , the Poole Chair in Management for Engineers in the U of A Department of Mechanical Engineering , has studied whether down - welling ocean currents can carry more dissolved carbon into the deep ocean .
He learned they can't , but in the course of this research he found some evidence that the ocean currents that bring warm water to the oceans off northern Europe may be weakening .
The results of the research have been published recently in the journal Climatic Change .
" The current is like an ocean conveyor belt , " Flynn explained .
" It starts in the north Atlantic , where down - welling , cold , arctic water flows south at the bottom of the ocean , and then warm , tropical water flows north to fill in the vacuum created by the cold water , and this warm water helps ensure a mild climate in northern Europe , "
The melting of fresh water ice due to global warming can reduce the flow of the down - welling current , and a study published recently in the journal Nature by researchers at the University of Southhampton in England reported evidence of weakening down - welling currents .
Flynn and a graduate student evaluated seven different methods to enhance down - welling currents .
They found one way was far more cost effective than the others : making thicker sea ice by pumping salty ocean water on top of ice sheets .
They envisioned more than 8,000 barges moving into the northern ocean in the fall , speeding the initial formation of sea ice by pumping a spray of water into the air , and then , once the ice is formed , pumping ocean water on top of it , trapping the salt in the ice and reaching a thickness of seven meters .
In the spring , water would continue to be pumped over the ice to melt it , forming a vast amount of cold , salty water that sinks and adds to the down - welling current to re-strengthen it .
The estimated cost is about $ 50 billion .
" When we first did this study we thought this idea was way too expensive -- we were shocked by the numbers , " Flynn said .
" But let 's say conservatively that there are 100 million people in Europe affected by this current .
Fifty billion dollars would come to 500 dollars per person , and we do n't think that is an unreasonable price if the glaciers are at your backdoor and your way of life is disappearing . "
Flynn emphasizes that his group does not propose this scheme as the first or best choice , since all geo- engineering projects have a risk of unforeseen circumstances .
" The best way to deal with global warming is to deal with the causes , fossil carbon in the atmosphere , not the symptoms , " he said .
" However , if our efforts to control CO2 levels in the atmosphere fail and we reach a crisis , we can contemplate emergency action . "

10 Newspaper Myths Deconstructed
The San Francisco Chronicle is in financial trouble .
InfoWorld stops printing .
Time Magazine redesigns its print edition and fires 50 people .
Quo vadis , newspapers ?
You might ask whether newspapers have a future at all ?
—“ Change or die ” is the media ’s new watchword .
Here are the 10 major misconceptions that hold newspapers back :
Myth :
We pay for printed content
Fact :
News content was always free
The price we pay for newspapers merely covers the paper and printing costs .
The management , writing , editing and delivery of newspapers is fully covered by advertising .
Economically , it ’s only fair that we do n’t pay for online content .
Do n’t tell me you ’ve never heard that …
Myth :
There is not enough money in online ads
Fact : Newspapers do n’t care about online ads
Why are print ads expensive and online ads so cheap ?
Print ads are neither measured nor measurable , they are perceived as prestigious no matter how much impact they have .
Things are changing though :
The latest numbers from the Newspaper Association of America show print newspaper advertising revenue continuing to drop : down 1.7 percent in 2006 to $ 46.6 billion .
No news there — the usual doom and gloom .
But there ’s another interesting number in the NAA report :
Advertising revenue for online newspaper sites jumped 31.5 percent in 2006 , to $ 2.7 billion . ”
Source : Recovering Journalist
Put more effort and care into your website , hire your own salesmen , sell online ads together with print ones , and understand and explain to your customers that the goal of an online ad is not to be clicked , but to be seen .
Just like the paper ad .
Reduce ad space to one banner per page , make it big and nice and sell it appropriately .
We do n’t mind good adverts .
We do n’t click them , but we did n’t click on paper ads either .
Do n’t allow online what you would never do in print .
And once and for all : no popups .
Everybody hates popups and companies that use them to advertise their stuff make us angry .
Myth : Newspapers need on - and offline identities
Fact : Newspapers need one identity
The brand consultant that came up with the idiotic idea of creating separate brands for the print and the online edition should be beaten with a stick .
Beaten really hard .
The “ special ” online identity communicates : “ This is not the real thing .
It ’s a sloppy version of the paper . ”
Get rid of that silly “ online ” or “ .com ” or “ . co.uk ” or whatnot attribute after your precious brand .
The New York Times got it right .
Myth : Newspapers need closed archives
Fact : Closed archives destroy access
How much money did you make with your precious archives , and how much traffic did you lose ?
Newspapers need to open their archives , cross link their articles and get Google to index as much of their stuff as possible .
Put ads on your old content , for heaven ’s sake .
As for TimesSelect — which runs so contrary to the first law of internet thermodynamics , according to which , unless you are offering financial news or porn , online content should always be free — it hides no more than three percent of the paper ’s content behind its subscription wall .
And this so - called “ premium content ” generates just under $ 10 million a year , a tiny slice of the company ’s $ 350 million digital revenue pie .
— The Huffington Post
Myth : Newspaper pages need to burst with stuff
Fact : Readers want nicely presented information
Print and online are somewhat different in terms of what can and should be done , but for serious companies the quality standards should be the same .
Newspapers allow the biggest information design horrors online , things they ’d never allow in a printed edition .
Treat your online design as you treat your printed edition , in terms of branding , information design and advertisements .
Always ask yourself : would I allow that in print ?
Myth : People are stupid , journalists are smart
Fact :
The collective is smarter than you
I wonder who came up with that idea ?
A journalist ?
People are often much smarter than you think , and collectively they can outsmart any journalist a thousand times .
Using the intelligence of your readership makes far more sense than insulting it .
Myth : Journalists = professional , bloggers = smearers
Fact : Bloggers are journalists
Yeah , right …
And ice from the iceman is colder and tastes better than ice from the fridge …
Bloggers are journalists .
Some suck , some rock .
Social media forces newspapers to become more independent , so this does n’t happen any more .
Myth :
The web is just a trend .
No need to panic .
Fact : Change or die
Yeah , and the telegraph will come back and end this silly email trend .
Let me assure you : what comes after the Internet will be even more fatal to your business if you do n’t adapt soon .
Your website is your publishing tool .
The paper is one exciting product of that interactive publishing process .
You need to work on your paper as well : increase its readability , scan-ability and usability .
Myth : Without paper , journalism and democracy die
Fact : Social news is democratic news
You may say I ’m a dreamer , but … — we have never had as many journalists as we do at the moment .
And democratization of markets and politics is on the rise .
Old media dies , because it is authoritarian and can be abused as an instrument of propaganda and suppression :
AsiaMedia : “ Malaysia ’s traditional media has been ordered not to mention , quote or pursue stories exposed by bloggers and online news sites , which are emerging as a powerful new media force .
A security ministry circular dated March 13 told top editors of a dozen mainstream newspapers and five television stations that they must not “ give any consideration whatsoever ” to anti-government material posted online . ”
Journalists are not going to die out .
The more information we have , the more we need intelligent filters ; newspapers should integrate :
Myth : Newspapers need to become social networks
Fact : Newspapers need to become Wikis
Newspaper readers are not friends .
Good readers are supposed to be critical about each other and not pat each other ’s backs .
There is a much more obvious technological model for newspapers .
I believe that newspapers need to make the development of a story transparent , they need to cross link and cross reference articles , they need to allow users to write articles and collectively correct each other ’s mistakes and they need to become at least as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica .
Got it ?
Yes , newspapers should use Wiki technology .
There is a lot to improve on the front end , but the content generation and optimization model is an almost perfect fit .
UPDATE : This is what it looks like ( The Washington Post as a Wiki ) .

Over in the comments to this post at Cafe Hayek , a debate is brewing over whether compensation for bad CEO ’s is the fault of the shareholders or not .
In this debate , you constantly see people of the libertarian mindset blaming the shareholders for not exercising enough control over the CEO compensation process .
This , I think , is hypocritical .
In any big organization , there is a facade of democratic decision - making .
In the United States , we pick our President through primaries and a general election process .
But since the process is completely driven by money and influence , we have a very limited number of choices to take into account , largely limited to who the RNC and the DNC put their money and weight behind .
Yet when we complain and people say “ well you elected them ! ” , we get angry .
What ’s different with the shareholders ?
Often the selection of CEO is limited to a small number of candidates selected by the Board of Directors , who are also often selected by a very limited number of candidates .
When I look at the idiocy in the United States government , I can at least say that because the system of electing those idiots is completely screwed up , that I have very little meaningful control over who ends up in power and what they do with that power .
I ’m doing everything I can to change that system ( including posting to this blog ) , but I still have almost zero influence over what they ’re doing .
Would n’t it be consistent to apply the same argument to shareholders ?
The only advantage that shareholders have over citizens of the US is that the cost of exit from owning a company has a much lower transaction cost than leaving the United States .
But the argument still holds .
Do shareholders really exert meaningful control over the inner workings of a Board of Directors and CEO ?
Do they exert much more control than voters exert over our government ?
I say no .
In both cases , the system is broken .
Blaming the peons in a system does n’t accomplish anything if those peons can only change who runs the broken system , not the system itself .
A Nazi-era law requiring all children to attend public school , to avoid " the emergence of parallel societies based on separate philosophical convictions " that could be taught by parents at home , apparently is triggering a Nazi - like response from police .
The word comes from Netzwerk Bildungsfreiheit , or Network for Freedom in Education , which confirmed that children in a family in Bissingen , in the state of Baden - Wuerttemberg , have been forcibly hauled to a public school .
" On Friday 20 October 2006 at around 7:30 a.m. the children of a home educating family ... were brought under duress to school by police , " the organization , which describes itself as politically and religiously neutral , confirmed .
A separate weblog in the United States noted the same tragedy .
Homeschoolblogger.com noted that the " three children were picked up by the police and escorted to school in Baden - Wurttemberg , with the ' promise ' that it would happen again this week . "
The Network for Freedom in Education , through spokesman Joerg Grosseluemern , said the Remeike family has been " home educating their children since the start of the school year , something which is legal in practically the whole of the ( European Union ) . "
" However , on this morning , they were confronted by police officials , who , in an incredibly inconsiderate manner , forced their crying children into a police car and drove them to the school .
The police stated that they had been instructed to continue this measure in the coming week , " the network statement said .
The network noted that the previous Minister of Education , Annette Schavan , had said such actions were not needed , because " ... the children are generally not lacking in any other respects . "
Officials at that time , in 2002 , confirmed that " forcible methods " generally are " not in the long - term interests of either the children or the police . "
However , the network noted the priorities of current officials obviously are different .
" The family involved emphasizes that their children are neither truant nor school deniers , which are the cases for which such measures were intended , " said the network 's statement , a translation from the original German .
" The Remeike family is fulfilling their children 's right to an education by educating them at home , with the support of teachers from a distance learning academy , which also supplies the necessary material . "
School arguments that homeschooling endangers the welfare of the children " lacks any factual foundation , " the network statement said .
" Tearing the children from the bosom of their family by forcing certainly does not contribute to their welfare .
The result is more likely to be traumatisation and the development of an aversion to instruments of state authority , " the statement said .
No comment could be obtained immediately from school or police officials .
" The Netzwerk Bildungsfreiheit strongly empathises with the Romeike family , whom many of us know personally to be an intact and conscience - driven family .
We condemn the degrading act carried out by the police as a blatant breach of the personal rights of individual family members and call for the Mayor of Bissingen , as well as the Office for Education of the District Authorities of Esslingen , to end these sanctions … "
The American blog noted that several other homeschooling parents recently have been fined or imprisoned for brief jail terms for teaching their children at home .
The blog reported that one mother spending a few days in jail for providing homeschooling for her child " ended up leading a Bible study for women who have begged her to come back . "
It reported another family was fined $ 2,250 and members were being attacked emotionally so that the father handed a nervous breakdown that landed him in a hospital .
The family put their two children in a public school " but it was so awful , they pulled them out again … and put them in a public Catholic school . "
It also contained reports that Waldemar Block , the father of nine , was arrested at his work earlier this month and jailed for 13 days , while Olga Block , his sister - in - law , was jailed for 10 days for not paying fines after she sent her children to a Christian school in Heidelberg .
The Home School Legal Defense Association , the largest homeschooling group in the U.S. with more than 80,000 families , also has been working to raise attention in the international community to the plight of German homeschoolers , including several families in the Baden - Wurttemberg region .
The group suggested contacting the German embassy , which had an answering machine attached to the telephone line when WND left a request for comment yesterday .
The HSLDA said that contact is : Wolfgang Ischinger Ambassador German Embassy 4645 Reservoir Road NW Washington , DC , 20007-1998 ( 202 ) 298-4000 or it can be e-mailed from its its website .
The U.S. organization also noted that homeschooling has been illegal in Germany probably since 1938 when Hitler banned it .
It recently announced a campaign to address the persecution Christians in Germany are facing from education authorities .
Ian Slatter , a spokesman for the HSLDA , said it was launched after a mother was arrested and jailed on criminal homeschooling counts .
In that case , according to a report in the Brussels Journal , Katharina Plett was arrested and ordered to jail while her husband fled to Austria with the family 's 12 children .
The latest police - state actions follow by only weeks a recent ruling from the European Human Rights Court that affirmed the German nation 's ban on homeschooling .
The Strasburg - based court addressed the issue on appeal from a Christian family whose members alleged their human rights to educate their own children according to their own religious beliefs are being violated by the ban .
The specific case addressed in the opinion involved Fritz and Marianna Konrad , who filed the complaint in 2003 and argued that Germany 's compulsory school attendance endangered their children 's religious upbringing and promotes teaching inconsistent with the family 's Christian faith .
The court said the Konrads belong to a " Christian community which is strongly attached to the Bible " and rejected public schooling because of the explicit sexual indoctrination programs that the courses there include .
The German court already had ruled that the parental " wish " to have their children grow up in a home without such influences " could not take priority over compulsory school attendance . "
The decision also said the parents do not have an " exclusive " right to lead their children 's education .
The family had appealed under the European Convention on Human Rights statement that : " No person shall be denied the right to education .
In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching , the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions . "
But the court 's ruling said , instead , that schools represent society , and " it was in the children 's interest to become part of that society .
" The parents ' right to education did not go as far as to deprive their children of that experience , " the ruling said .
A new study from the University of Michigan found that traffic metering systems that incorporate new algorithms for merging could reduce the seriousness of traffic slowdowns that originate near freeway on - ramps .
Craig Davis , a retired Ford Motor Co. research scientist and current adjunct professor at U - M , studied highway merging to see how current on - ramp traffic meter systems could be made more effective .
Currently , meter systems try to improve traffic flow by letting a certain number of cars enter the highway each minute based on how many cars are already there .
Traffic metering has been around for a long time and many large U.S. cities have metering systems , Davis says .
Davis says there are two basic types of traffic congestion : gridlock - type jams where cars stop ; and the synchronous flow - type congestion , where two or more lanes of traffic all slow down to the same speed .
Synchronous flow happens often near on - ramps , when cars do n’t give one another enough room to merge , or when too many cars are on the road .
Metering systems use computer algorithms to try to predict when a jam may occur , typically based on occupancy .
Davis , however , based his algorithm on the throughput and the rate at which vehicles are merging , not on highway occupancy .
He found that traffic jams happen when throughput exceeds about 1,900 cars per hour per lane , and after that capacity drops by 10 percent or more .
Davis says in the absence of metering systems , simple politeness would go a long way toward thinning the sludgy traffic near on - ramps .
But , letting people merge is helpful only if you do n’t slow down too much to do so .
“ If you can do it without slowing down very much , that allows the driver who ’s entering to enter at a higher speed , ” Davis said .
“ If they have to crawl along waiting for an opening , they slow down the other vehicles on the freeway . ”
If you can safely move over a lane and allow a vehicle merge , that is even better , he adds .
Davis has received much attention for his research on automatic cruise control , a separate but related area of traffic congestion research .
With ACC , onboard computers keep the correct distance between cars .
Such systems have been shown in computer simulations to reduce traffic jams in throughput lanes , but do n’t do much to lessen the problem that is caused by merging near on - ramps , he says .

Prince to launch album as free newspaper giveaway http://business.guardian.co.uk
Prince is launching his new Planet Earth album as a free giveaway with a national Sunday newspaper in a move that has drawn widespread condemnation from music retailers .
The 10 - track CD will be available free with an " imminent " edition of the newspaper .
Planet Earth will then go on sale on July 24 .
" It 's all about giving music for the masses and he believes in spreading the music he produces to as many people as possible , " said Mail on Sunday managing director Stephen Miron .
" This is the biggest innovation in newspaper promotions in recent times . "
The paper will be ramping up its print run in anticipation of a huge spike in circulation but would not reveal how much the deal with Prince would cost .
One music store executive described the plan as " madness " while others said it was a huge insult to an industry battling fierce competition from supermarkets and online stores .
Prince 's label broke off ties in the UK with the album in a bid to appease music stores .
The Entertainment Retailers Association ( ERA ) said the giveaway " beggars belief " .
" It would be an insult to all those record stores who have supported Prince throughout his career , " ERA co-chairman Paul Quirk told a music conference .
" It would be yet another example of the damaging covermount culture which is destroying any perception of value around recorded music .
" The Artist Formerly Known as Prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the Artist Formerly Available in Record Stores .
" And I say that to all the other artists who may be tempted to dally with the Mail on Sunday . "
High street music giant HMV was similarly scathing about the plans .
Speaking before rumours of a giveaway were confirmed , HMV chief executive Simon Fox said : " I think it would be absolutely nuts . "
" I can't believe the music industry would do it to itself .
I simply can't believe it would happen , it would be absolute madness . "
Prince , whose Purple Rain sold more than 11 m copies , also plans to give away a free copy of his latest album with each ticket sold for his upcoming string of concerts in London .
The singer had signed a global deal as well for the promotion and distribution of Planet Earth in partnership with Columbia Records , a division of music company Sony BMG .
A spokesman for the group said tonight that the UK arm of Sony BMG had withdrawn from Prince 's global deal and would not be distributing the album to UK stores .
" We think it is the right thing to do in the difficult retail market , " he said .
" We are delighted Prince has come back to a major label but this makes sense for the UK . "
The Mail on Sunday , owned by Associated Newspapers , has built up a reputation for music giveaways and this is not the first time it has drawn harsh criticism .
It most recently clashed with musician Mike Oldfield over the giveaway of his album Tubular Bells .
Still , the paper maintains that its covermount CDs of artists such as Simply Red , Madness and Dolly Parton stimulate interest in music and it has asked retailers to look at partnerships .
" The Mail on Sunday is the biggest distributor of albums in this country , " said Mr Miron .
" We are saying to retailers we would be happy to engage in dialogue . "

A Quick FAVICON HOWTO
Now that you generated your nice favicon you may want to know how to add it in your site following the right standards and rules in order to be sure most users will see it .
The following is a quick guide extracted from the Favicon Wikipedia Page .
What is a favicon A favicon ( short for " Favorites icon " ) , also known as a page icon , is an icon associated with a particular website or webpage .
A web designer can create such an icon , and many graphical web browserssuch as recent versions of Internet Explorer , Firefox , Mozilla , Opera , Safari , and Konquerorcan then make use of them .
Browsers that support favicons may display them in the browser 's URL bar , next to the site 's name in lists of bookmarks , and next to the page 's title in a tabbed document interface .
How to use a favicon in your site
The original means of defining a favicon was by placing a file called favicon.ico in the root directory of a webserver .
This would then automatically be used in Internet Explorer 's favorites ( bookmarks ) display .
Later , however , a more flexible system was created , using HTML to indicate the location of an icon for any given page .
This is achieved using the link element like : < link rel= " shortcut icon " href= " /favicon.ico " /> in the < head > section of the document .
In this way , any appropriately sized ( 16×16 pixels or larger ) image can be used , and although many still use the .ico format , other browsers now also support the GIF and PNG image formats .
For optimal browser support , the following rules should be obeyed :
Include both element types :
< link rel= " shortcut icon " href = " http://example.com/favicon.ico " />
< link rel= " icon " href = " http://example.com/favicon.ico " />
< link rel= " shortcut icon " href = " http://example.com/favicon.ico " /> < link rel= " icon " href = " http://example.com/favicon.ico " />
The link elements must be inside the head element ( between < head > and < /head > ) in the HTML .
For XHTML , the link element must be empty ( terminated by /> )
The href can , but need not , point to the location / favicon.ico .
It could equally well point anywhere else on your site that is convenient .
The image can be an ICO , PNG or GIF .
The .ico file format will be read correctly by most browsers .
Note : A file called favicon.ico and located in the document root directory will also be found by some browsers which do not process the link elements , even if it is not linked from anywhere on your site .

An angry and bitter Paul Wolfowitz poured abuse and threatened retaliations on senior World Bank staff if his orders for pay rises and promotions for his partner were revealed , according to new details published last night .
Under fire for the lavish package given to Shaha Riza , a World Bank employee and Mr Wolfowitz 's girlfriend when he became president , an official investigation into the controversy has found that Mr Wolfowitz broke bank rules and violated his own contract – setting off a struggle between US and European governments over Mr Wolfowitz 's future .
Sounding more like a cast member of the Sopranos than an international leader , in testimony by one key witness Mr Wolfowitz declares : " If they fuck with me or Shaha , I have enough on them to fuck them too . "
The remarks were published in a report detailing the controversy that erupted last month after the size of Ms Riza 's pay rises was revealed .
The report slates Mr Wolfowitz for his " questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self - interest " , saying : " Mr Wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply . "
The report brushed off Mr Wolfowitz 's defence that he thought he had been asked to arrange Ms Riza 's pay package , observing that " the interpretation given by Mr Wolfowitz ... simply turns logic on its head " .
The investigators have sent their completed report to the bank 's governing board , containing a string of withering criticisms of Mr Wolfowitz 's behaviour and casting doubt on his ability to continue running the bank , a multibillion - pound international agency with 12,000 staff based in Washington .
According to the report , Mr Wolfowitz 's actions " had a dramatic negative effect on the reputation and credibility " of the bank .
It concluded that " the damage done to the reputation of the World Bank group " should lead the bank 's board to " consider whether Mr Wolfowitz will be able to provide the leadership needed to ensure that the bank continues to operate to the fullest extent possible " .
It also said : " Mr Wolfowitz 's contract requiring that he adhere to the code of conduct for board officials and that he avoid any conflict of interest , real or apparent , [ was ] violated . "
Despite the weeks of turmoil within the bank , Mr Wolfowitz may still keep his job if the US government is prepared to stick by him .
Mr Wolfowitz still enjoys support from the Bush administration , where he served as deputy defence secretary at the Pentagon during the invasion of Iraq .
Yesterday vice president Dick Cheney defended Mr Wolfowitz , saying : " Paul is one of the most able public servants I 've ever known ....
I think he 's a very good president of the World Bank , and I hope he will be able to continue . "
The US treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , was yesterday said to also be drumming up support for Mr Wolfowitz , while European governments increasingly despair of US intransigence in allowing Mr Wolfowitz to hang on .
The angry comments attributed to Mr Wolfowitz came from damning testimony by Xavier Coll , head of human resources at the bank , who provided investigators with his notes of a meeting with Mr Wolfowitz last year .
The notes directly contradict Mr Wolfowitz 's assertions that the details of Ms Riza 's treatment were properly shared with senior bank officials .
In March last year , when a mention of Ms Riza 's secondment outside the bank to avoid rules about partners was first published in the magazine US News & World Report , an angry Mr Wolfowitz accused Mr Coll of leaking the information .
According to Mr Coll 's notes : " At the end of the conversation Mr Wolfowitz became increasingly agitated and said that he was ' tired of people ... attacking him ' and ' you should get your friends to stop it ' .
Mr Wolfowitz said , ' If they fuck me or Shaha , I have enough on them to fuck them too ' , " naming several senior bank staff he felt were vulnerable .
Mr Wolfowitz appears before the bank 's executive board today to make a final defence of his actions , with the board meeting tomorrow to consider the report and make a statement later in the week .
With Mr Wolfowitz so far refusing to step down , the board may need to take radical action to break the stalemate .
Members have discussed a range of options , including sacking Mr Wolfowitz , issuing a vote of no confidence or reprimanding him .
Some board members argue that a vote of no confidence would make it impossible for him to stay in the job .
Back in 1992 , when " yahoo " was something cowboys yelled and " ebay " was just pig Latin , the University of Minnesota developed a new way of looking at data on the Internet .
Their protocol , called " gopher " after the UMN mascot , allowed archivists to present the mishmash of information in a standard format , and enabled readers to navigate documents on a world of servers using a simple visual interface .
For a while , it seemed as if gopher might open the Internet up to the nontechnical masses and usher in a new era of online communication .
It very well might have , if the Web had n't come along and done it instead .
Mention gopher to a newcomer to the Web and you might get a blank stare .
Mention it to an old - timer and you 're likely to see a nostalgic smile .
But to a community of developers and enthusiasts , gopher is alive and kicking .
And if they have their way , it will have a healthy future .
According to a list on Floodgap.com , over 250 active gopher servers are currently online , serving documents ranging from lawyer jokes to the text of the Shays - Meehan campaign finance reform bill .
Almost half these servers are affiliated with American colleges and universities , but servers are also located on every continent but Africa and Antarctica .
One such repository is Quux.org and is maintained by John Goerzen , a 24 - year - old Kansas systems administrator and programmer .
In addition to managing what is to his knowledge the largest actively maintained gopher server in existence , Goerzen is the developer of a gopher server called PyGopherd , and the maintainer of the original gopher code from the University of Minnesota .
Goerzen 's work on gopher is strictly volunteer , and his main motivation is his own enjoyment .
" Put most simply , gopher is fun , " he explains .
" Any programmer with experience with network programming can write a pretty much full - featured gopher server or client in a couple of hours . "
Another of his motivations is preserving the history of the Internet .
" A lot of gopher sites are disappearing – running on servers that have been forgotten by now – and I wanted to be able to prevent the content on them from disappearing forever , " he said .
" I started Quux.org , my gopher site , with that in mind . "
Goerzen is not just an archivist , though .
He sees a future for gopher in applications such as data exchange .
" I 'm interested in using gopher as a protocol for dynamic information exchange in a way similar to XML - RPC and SOAP , " he says .
He also sees gopher as an excellent alternative to PDA and smartphone Web browsers .
" Consider this example : Port - a - Goph , a gopher client in development for Palm OS .
Cameron Kaiser wrote this in his spare time and got it working quickly on his own Palm , " he said .
" Contrast that with the state of Web browsing on handheld devices : Despite many years to improve them , I still regularly run across websites that simply do not render at all , or render so poorly that they are unusable . "
Whatever its future , development for gopher continues .
Late last month saw the release of a gopher module for Apache , allowing the popular open - source Web server to serve up gopher pages as well as Web pages .
Despite its relative obscurity , gopherspace is accessible to many more Web users than people realize .
Gopher support is built into Mozilla - based browsers including Firefox , most versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer up to version 5 , although the degree of support varies .
People who want to stick with the familiarity of http can use the public gopher proxy at Floodgap.com , which translates gopher pages into HTML .
Visitors to gopherspace will find a piece of the Internet 's history , some of which , Goerzen says , is n't available anywhere else .
They will also find The Gopher Manifesto , a document praising gopher 's simplicity and elegance .
The Gopher Manifesto describes gopher as " a hypertext Eden " that existed before the clutter and commercialization of the Web .
" Is it time for a new Renaissance on the Internet , to bring back the promise of the early years ? " it asks .
Goerzen 's take on that question is subdued , but optimistic .
" I do n't expect gopher to ever overtake the Web , " he says .
" I do expect it to continue to exist . "
Ex -Gonzales aide immunized from prosecution
Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
A federal judge immunized the former White House liaison to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales Friday morning , protecting her from prosecution on a limited basis for testimony she may give to Congress on the firing of US Attorneys .
Rep. John Conyers , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , who sought the order , said in a statement sent to RAW STORY that hearing from Monica Goodling was " critical . "
" Monica Goodling is a critical witness to this ongoing investigation .
We look forward to hearing her testimony as promptly as possible , " he said .
Thomas Hogan , the federal district judge who issued the order , said Goodling could no longer claim testifying would result in self - incrimination .
" Monica Goodling may not refuse to testify , and may not refuse to provide other information , when compelled to do so , " Hogan wrote in his order , according to the Bloomberg News .
When Goodling was first identified as a target of Congress 's investigation , she told the House and Senate Judiciary Committees through her attorney that she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination if called to testify .
When the House Judiciary Committee questioned the basis for her assertion of her rights , her lawyer accused them of carrying out a " McCarthyist " probe .
However , as Bloomberg pointed out , she has agreed to testify now that the immunity order has been granted .
On Monday , the Justice Department investigators who are looking into Goodling 's activities consented to the immunity deal , finding that it would not interfere with their investigation .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Can you tell whether someone 's gay just by the way he or she walks ?
Psychologists and geneticists are trying to answer the question of whether sexual orientation is a choice .
David Sylva wants to know .
He straps bright red lights to people 's bodies and videotapes them walking in the dark .
He then shows the videotape to observers ( who wo n't be biased by clothing or hairstyles since the walker is in the dark ) and asks them to guess the walker 's sexual orientation .
Sylva 's observations focus on the physical characteristics of the individual 's stride , such as the closeness of the knees .
Why does Sylva , a graduate student at Northwestern University , care so much about how gay people walk ?
Because he's one of a growing number of researchers who think sexual orientation may be as basic as how you walk , something inborn that you do n't choose .
His premise reflects a growing belief among Americans , according to a new CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll .
For the first time a majority of respondents -- about 56 percent -- said they do n't believe a person can change his or her sexual orientation .
In a similar poll in 2001 , 45 percent said orientation could n't change .
In 1998 , 36 percent held that belief .
The sampling error for Wednesday 's results is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Watch more on research into the nature of sexual orientation »
A growing number of psychologists and geneticists are working on the " nature versus nurture " question -- a question that 's set off a highly charged political debate about whether people choose their sexuality , or whether gayness is determined by their DNA .
Take Richard Lippa , a professor of psychology at California State University at Fullerton .
His studies show that gay people are twice as likely to be left - handed .
He also collects photos of hair whorls -- those circular swirls you see atop a man 's head .
He says about 10 percent of the general population have whorls that rotate counter - clockwise , but about 20 percent of gay men have counter - clockwise whorls .
Lippa acknowledges that studying hair patterns sounds strange .
" It sounds a little like the ' Twilight Zone ' or voodoo science , " he says .
But to Lippa , a link between sexual orientation and something that 's clearly inborn ( like handedness or the way hair grows ) speaks volumes .
His theory :
You can't choose your whorl , and you can't choose your sexuality , either .
" You 're born with either a clockwise or a counter - clockwise hair whorl .
It 's fixed , it 's biologically determined .
No one 's going to argue that your hair whorl is influenced by learning or culture , " he says .
Lippa says his next step is see whether there are specific genes that control sexual orientation .
Douglas Abbott thinks Lippa wo n't find a thing .
" There is no evidence of a ' gay gene , ' " says Abbott , professor of child and family studies at the University of Nebraska .
Abbott points to studies that look at the sexual orientation of the offspring of gay people .
" If homosexuality was caused by genetic mechanisms , their children would be more likely to choose same - sex interaction , " he says .
" But they are n't more likely , so therefore it can't be genetic . "
For Abbott , the answer to the nature - vs. - nurture question is very clear .
" I think the primary causes of same - sex behavior are environmental and personal choice and free agency , " he says .
" Can someone change their orientation ?
The definitive answer to that is , " yes . ' "
That makes Gerulf Rieger laugh .
" Ask a bunch of straight guys [ if they could switch to being gay ] and they would tell you , ' Are you kidding me ? ' " says Rieger , a lecturer in psychology at Northwestern University .
" So the other way around does n't work either . "
In his research , Rieger shows videotapes of men and women talking about the weather .
Observers have been able to predict with great accuracy whether the person talking is gay or straight .
" Even within seconds , people are pretty good at figuring out who 's gay and who 's not , " he says .
Like Sylva with his illuminated walkers , Rieger thinks his research points to genetics , and not choice , as the source of sexual orientation .
" It does n't seem to be the social environment , it does n't seem to be the parents or peers that make you gay , " he says .
" It seems to be something that comes from within . "

The recent July issue of Nintendo Power is the best issue I ’ve read since first resubscribing a year ago .
The thing is packed to the gills with promising Wii games and pretty much kills the conventional wisdom that Wii is only good for party - games .
Granted , announcements and previews do not a great final game make , but I ’m giddy at the prospects of all the games profiled .
Says Managing Editor Scott Pelland before unleashing a slew of titles , “ Nintendo ’s vision of active player interaction goes far beyond realistic bowling and wacky cow games . ”
And he ’s right , assuming developers can deliver on all the encouraging games mentioned in the mag .
Let ’s run down the ones that piqued my interests , shall we ?

Hitting Wii in August , Madden on Wii will feature ALL online content as its more powerful comrade consoles .
That ’s right , NP says EA is dumping everything in this version with still more attention on the motion - controls .
Having loved last year ’s Madden on Wii , I think I ’m starting to become a fan again , and it ’s looking like this version could be the one to have for all Madden fans ; motion controls , online , the works .
Good stuff .

The Bigs ( Wii ) .
Ever since first playing Wii Sports Baseball , I ’ve been itching for a full on game .
This could be it .
Like Madden above , it sounds like 2 K is putting in a lot of effort to give the Wii version its rightful cachet .
You ’ll run the bases by shaking the Wii remote and nunchuk alternately in a drumming motion , then flick them both down at the same time to slide all while using the analog stick for direction ( same for fielding too ) .
Sounds like a really fun and smart implementation of motion - controls .

Fifa Soccer 08 ( Wii ) .
If there was one genre I thought would n’t benefit from motion - controls , it was simulation soccer .
What could developers really do ; ask you to tape nunchuks and Wiimotes to your feet ?
But again EA seems like they could prove me wrong using nunchuk and wiimote jukes for tackling , getting past defenders , lobbing the ball , passing it , etc .
Sounds fun and is also coming this fall .

Yeah–Wii should be just fine when it comes to meeting the demands of core gamers .
Honorable mentions include : Pheonix Wright : Trials and Tribulations ( DS ) coming this fall ; Jam Sessions ( DS ) this fall ( download track here ) ; and Mortal Kombat : Armageddon which NP says works well and feels fresh .
They gave the game a 8/10 .
Oh and Transformers on Wii looks amazing …

Banksy at the West Bank barrier
Keeping his identity a closely guarded secret , the graffiti artist Banksy has made a name for himself with provocative images stencilled around the streets of London .
Here we show a selection of images from his recent trip to the Palestinian territories , where he has created nine of his images on Israel 's highly controversial West Bank barrier .
Read the news story of his visit here .

Art attack
On Banksy 's website , readers are reminded that Israel 's 425 - mile - long West Bank barrier , separating Israel from the Palestinian territories , is considered illegal by the United Nations .
Stable conditions
Banksy 's feelings about the barrier are made explicit in a statement which says the wall " essentially turns Palestine into the world 's largest open prison . "
Window on the West Bank
Indicating why he undertook the trip from London , where he made his name as a ' guerilla ' artist , Banksy 's website says the West Bank barrier is " the ultimate activity holiday destination for graffiti writers " .
Balloon debate
During his visit to the West Bank , Banksy created nine images along the barrier , most of them provocative without being directly polemical .
Cut it out
During the visit to Ramallah and surrounding areas , Banksy reports some tense moments .
His spokeswoman Jo Brooks said : " The Israeli security forces did shoot in the air threateningly and there were quite a few guns pointed at him . "
Escapism
( Conversation reported on www.banksy.co.uk)
Soldier : What the f*** are you doing ?
Banksy :
You 'll have to wait until it 's finished .
Soldier ( to colleagues ) : Safety 's off
Unwelcome intervention
Banksy also records on his website how an old Palestinian man said his painting made the wall look beautiful .
Banksy thanked him , only to be told : ' We do n't want it to be beautiful , we hate this wall .

LONDON , May 30 ( Reuters ) - Eating less meat and dairy could help tackle climate change by reducing the amount of methane gas emitted by cows and sheep , a British government agency says .
Cows feed on grass as they roam the hills near Pleasanton , California March 23 , 2007 .
Eating less meat and dairy could help tackle climate change by reducing the amount of methane gas emitted by cows and sheep , a British government agency says .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
In an email leaked to vegetarian campaign group Viva , an official of Britain ’s Environment Agency expressed sympathy for the green benefits of a vegan diet , which bans all animal product foods .
The official said the government may in future recommend eating less meat as one of the “ key environmental behavior changes ” needed to combat climate change brought on by the production of greenhouse gases .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) has already announced it is looking into the benefits of low environmental impact diets , including reducing the amount of animal protein eaten .
The email was written by an agency official to a member of the public who had written to support a vegan diet .
“ Whilst potential benefit of a vegan diet in terms of climate impact could be very significant , encouraging the public to take a lifestyle decision as substantial as becoming vegan would be a request few are likely to take up , ” it said .
“ You will be interested to hear that Defra is working on a set of key environmental behavior changes to mitigate climate change .
Consumption of animal protein has been highlighted within that work .
“ As a result , the issue may start to figure in climate change communications in the future .
It will be a case of introducing this gently as there is a risk of alienating the public majority . ”
Cattle and sheep release millions of metric tons of methane gas a year into the environment through flatulence .
In New Zealand , for example the 55 million farm animals produce some 90 percent of the country ’s methane emissions .
Several European nations , including Germany and the Netherlands , have promoted policies that make methane capture a money - spinner for farmers .
In the UK , the National Farmers ’ Union , said it was working on similar projects , and rejected government moves to encourage less meat intake .
In a statement it said : “ To suggest that people eating less meat and diary products will have a significant impact on the fight against global warming seems rather dubious . ”
Defra denied that it was telling people to give up meat .
“ It is n’t the role of government to enforce a dietary or lifestyle change on any individual , ” it said .
The Environment Agency said it believed a vegan diet was a matter of personal choice .
Washington
Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt has done it again .
He continues to publish editorials that directly contradict articles in his own paper .
Well , let me be more clear - he continues to publish editorials that are patently false as shown by articles in his own paper .
He did it again yesterday in his attack on Nancy Pelosi .
You see , Hiatt is a big Bush - lover .
He loves the war .
Ca n't get enough of it .
And no one had better dare stand in Bush 's , or Hiatt 's way .
So he publishes editorial after editorial outright lying about what 's going on in foreign policy in an effort to trick the American people into supporting George Bush .
It 's yellow journalism at its finest .
Do n't rely on my word for it .
Just read the rest of the Washington Post .
This is n't the first time Hiatt has been contradicted by his own newspaper on the SAME DAY he 's published one of his erroneous , partisan editorials .
It 's not even the second time .
This is what this guy does .
He just makes stuff up .

It seems that Chomskyâ€™s Syntactic Structures was published fifty years ago this month .
Unquestionably a historic event as far as linguistics and cognitive science is concerned .
Just the other day I had a conversation with a ( non CS ) colleague about Chomsky .
My friend argued that Chomsky is regarded as very important for CS .
Not going into a full historical analysis I argued that most CS people are unaware of Chomsky , or at least do n't see him as all that crucial to the discipline of CS .
A CS undergrad probably encounters Chomsky when learning about the Chomsky Hierarchy in a formal languages course - which deals mostly with regular and context free languages , the lower rungs of the hierarchy .
A more cautious historical analysis will show how Chomsky influenced CS , as well as much else , but I think my assessment of the way most computer scientists view Chomsky 's impact on the field is fairly accurate .
Still , many of us are interested in languages in general , as well as programming languages , and in the interaction between PLT and linguistics .
So I think LtU is a good place to mention the fiftieth anniversary of Syntactic Structures , surely a landmark affair in 20th century science .
EVERY hour , students at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania commit sexual misconduct .
How ?
No , the student body is n’t made up of sexual predators .
It ’s because Gettysburg ’s sexual - misconduct policy makes even the most innocent student interactions a violation .
Gettysburg requires its students to gain consent before sexual interaction .
No surprises there :
That ’s not only the law , it ’s common sense .
But what is n’t common sense is how Gettysburg defines “ sexual interaction ” and “ consent . ”
The school ’s policy considers “ brushing , touching , grabbing , pinching , patting , hugging and kissing ” to be sexual interactions .
Making matters worse is the fact that Gettysburg requires “ verbal , ” “ continuing ” and “ active ” consent to engage in these “ interactions . ”
Under the policy , hugging your friend without permission is as serious an offense as rape .
In practice , complying with Gettysburg ’s policy seems to mean that each and every physical contact between students is doomed to be embarrassingly awkward .
( Can I hold your hand ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Can I continue to hold your hand ? ” “ Yes . ” )
But of course Gettysburg students do n’t comply with these ridiculous prohibitions ; they ’re students , not robots .
Every Gettysburg student has likely violated the policy at some point .
So why does it exist ?
Since it clearly has no relation to reality , the policy should be scrapped .
Gettysburg ’s administration insists that while the policy is enforced , it has never been used to crackdown on hugging or hand - holding , but the fact that the policy still exists means that administrators have explicitly reserved the right to punish students for this behavior when they deem it necessary .
Trusting administrators with the power to punish on the promise that they wo n’t abuse that power is a losing proposition .
The university promised to change its policy at the start of the school year – but an academic year later , the old rules are still in effect .
Students should be extremely suspicious – and they should demand change .

Justin.tv , which is making Internet history by broadcasting every moment and movement of founder Justin Kan 's life , is giving new meaning to the term live feed .
The unusual San Francisco startup is dishing up the kind of gourmet grub usually reserved for Internet giants like Google .
Call it the North Beach diet , produced by Michael Seibel , the 24 - year - old chief operating officer of the company , cast member and resident chef of the online reality show headquartered in an apartment high - rise overlooking San Francisco 's northeast shoreline .
With its expansive views of the San Francisco Bay and sky - high electricity usage included in the rent , that high - rise is now dubbed the " Yscaper " because it has become home to six startups funded by Y Combinator , the startup investing firm that provided the initial funding for all of them .
The ragtag set offers a quintessential slice of startup life .
A central feature of that life : " You have more servers in your apartment than edible items in your fridge , " said Matt Brezina , founder of Xobni , which aspires to help people get more out of their e-mail .
One founder of a Y Combinator startup even contracted scurvy , a disease that used to afflict sailors who were out at sea too long without fruits and vegetables .
Seibel , like the pioneering former Google chef Charlie Ayers before him , is determined to change the way malnourished entrepreneurs eat .
He commandeers ovens throughout the building to prepare tasty meals from scratch , single - handedly getting his fellow startup junkies to consume more than two basic food groups in one sitting .
He even persuades them to wolf down what few guys their age will : leafy greens .
How did Seibel find himself playing chef on Justin.tv ?
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" I am the only one who knows how to cook , " said the Yale political science grad who started cooking in high school and worked as a fundraiser on Kweisi Mfume 's failed U.S. Senate campaign in Maryland before joining the startup last fall .
And cook Seibel can , from homemade gnocchi to sushi .
In the Silicon Valley spirit of experimentation , he usually makes a dish only once and then , after inspecting what food his guests leave on their plates , tries something new .
On Monday night , Seibel even hosted a Passover seder while juggling calls from television producers and bookers , potential advertisers and business partners .
Seibel 's culinary inclinations boost Justin.tv 's energy , productivity and efficiency , said Kan , the reality show 's star who has strapped a camera to his head to stream his life on the Internet 24 hours a day .
" You are far more alert when you eating well instead of having Burger King every day , " Kan said .
Until the show launched , creating a media maelstrom , Seibel used to whip up a meal most nights for his Justin.tv co-founders and dinner crashers like Steve Huffman , who lives two flights up .
Huffman , who hit it big last fall when Wired Digital bought his startup Reddit , is " our millionaire freeloader , " Seibel said .
The other entrepreneurs in residence describe themselves as Internet thousandaires .
" It 's like a family dinner , " 23 - year - old Justin.tv co-founder Emmett Shear said .
" A horribly dysfunctional , all - young - twentysomething male family , but a family nonetheless .
...
It becomes the social event of the day .
I fear getting stuck in one room for the whole day working and working only to buy food from the convenience store . "
Since November , one night a week , the Justin.tv crew has thrown open its doors for a free - for - all , usually on Thursday nights .
The two - bedroom apartment fills up with 20 to 30 neighboring entrepreneurs known by their startup names -- for example , the Xobnis or the Weeblies .
The weekly dinners were inspired by Paul Graham , founder of Y Combinator .
Seibel organizes weekly bulk - buying expeditions to stretch the startup 's shopping dollars for entertainment , hauling home huge bags of rice and bottles of olive oil .
Then he takes over the kitchen ( and sometimes the Xobni and Weebly kitchens , too ) for several hours each Thursday afternoon to give his fellow startups a taste of finer dining .
Lubricants of choice are Budweiser and Charles Shaw's " Two Buck Chuck . "
Sometimes Seibel 's colleagues pitch in .
On a recent Thursday night , Shear , who in his college days experimented with lemon , lime and orange bars , baked a chocolate cake served alongside a vat of vanilla ice cream to 18 people from seven startups .
With Kan filming the animated bursts of conversation and consumption , the evenings have the feel of a smartly scripted but completely unpredictable television sitcom , laugh track and all .
In addition to good food , these entrepreneurs say they pick up good ideas .
" It 's a place to show off what you have done , get help with technical problems , find out what 's going on in the venture capital world , get advice , " Seibel said .
" Everyone appreciates good food . "
Justin.tv is holding off on handing Seibel his own camera and cooking show .
He borrowed the camera once while preparing a meal and managed to burn his hand , drop food on the floor and curse up a storm .
Still , Seibel 's spreads get star reviews from this startup crowd .
And that 's not surprising .
The startup food pyramid would alarm the surgeon general .
These entrepreneurs want their food fast , cheap and loaded with calories .
After all , food is for thought , the deep kind that fuels all - nighters .
Keeping such erratic hours makes it hard to figure out what time of day it is , let alone what to eat .
" Eating 's inconvenient , " says Adam Smith , the 21 - year - old founder of Xobni .
" It can really break your concentration . "
The typical startup kitchen comes equipped with the two essential tools to sustain a steady diet of frozen pizza and canned soup : microwaves and can openers .
Snacks range from potato chips to Pop - Tarts .
And do n't count out the nutritional value of condiments .
Consider Justin.tv's " poorest " startup pals , the Weeblies , who are working on a way for even the most technologically challenged to build their own Web sites .
The scrawny Penn State dropouts -- Chris Fanini , 22 , David Rusenko , 21 , and Dan Veltri , 22 -- look forward to Thursday nights all week .
" This is the only day of the week we get a full , regular meal , " Veltri said at a recent Justin.tv get - together .
Veltri occasionally remembers to pop a multivitamin to make up for certain nutritional deficiencies in his eating habits .
For the first two weeks of startup life , the Weeblies subsisted on nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches .
Now their diet ranges from cereal for breakfast to sandwiches for lunch and hot dogs or hamburgers for dinner .
No Ramen noodles ( " We 're not that low " ) , but macaroni and cheese is OK .
They sometimes splurge on frozen pizza .
But vegetables rarely make an appearance at the dinner table .
The only time they have eaten asparagus , for example , was at chez Seibel .
" We once bought some canned corn , " Fanini recalled .
" That 's our favorite vegetable .
I guess I have never seen anything green in this apartment . "
The Weeblies do go through gallons of ice cream , a common startup staple for late - night technobinges .
" We went to buy shampoo the other day and we ended up in the ice cream aisle , " confessed Brezina , the more health - conscious of the two Xobni founders .
So just how much of a junk food nut is Smith ?
One of his proudest achievements is his technique for warming chewy chocolate - chip Chips Ahoy cookies : Microwave them for exactly 10 seconds .
He averages between six and eight cookies a day .
If he stays up late , make that 10 .
" It 's an art , " he said .
Good news for worried parents out there : Ayers , the former Google chef who is opening a chain of restaurants and is consulting with startups , senses a growing awareness in Silicon Valley of the importance of eating right .
" Half of the young twentysomething entrepreneurs that I encounter are eating more healthful , artisan , new age , wellness - driven menus , " he said .
" Then you have the other 50 percent which still go directly for the pizzas , burritos , burgers and fries , all chased down with a carbonated beverage the size of the Pacific Ocean . "

For hundreds of years , Tibetan monks and other religious people have used meditation to calm the mind and improve concentration .
This week , a new study shows exactly how one common type of meditation affects the brain .
Using a scanner that reveals which parts of the brain are active at any given moment , the researchers found that meditation increased activity in the brain regions used for paying attention and making decisions .
" Most people , if they heard a baby screaming , would have some emotional response , " Davidson says , but not the highly experienced meditators .
" They do hear the sound , we can detect that in the auditory cortex , but they do n’t have the emotional reaction . "
The changes were associated with the practice of concentration meditation , says study leader Richard Davidson , professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and the Waisman Center .
Practitioners were instructed to focus attention intently on a stimulus , and when the attention wandered off , to simply bring the attention back to the object , explains Davidson .
" In one sense , concentration mediation is ridiculously simple , but in another , it ’s extraordinarily difficult , " adds Davidson .
" If you try it for two minutes , you will see that it ’s not so easy .
Minds have a propensity to wander . "
In collaboration with colleagues Julie Brefczynski -Lewis and Antoine Lutz of the UW–Madison W.M. Keck Laboratory for Functional Brain Imaging and Behavior , Davidson compared newly trained meditators to people with up to 54,000 hours of meditation experience .
The study is being published this week in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
After the novices were taught to meditate , all subjects underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain while they were meditating .
Among all experienced meditators , the MRI scan found greater activity in brain circuits involved in paying attention .
" We found that regions of the brain that are intimately involved in the control and regulation of attention , such as the prefrontal cortex , were more activated in the long - term practitioners , " Davidson says .
A different picture emerged , however , from looking only at the most experienced meditators with at least 40,000 hours of experience .
" There was a brief increase in activity as they start meditating , and then it came down to baseline , as if they were able to concentrate in an effortless way , " says Davidson .
Effortless concentration is described in classic meditation texts , adds Davidson .
" And we think this may be a neural reflection of that .
These results illustrate one mechanism by which meditation may act in the brain . "
While the subjects meditated inside the MRI , the researchers periodically blasted them with disturbing noises .
Among the experienced meditators , the noise had less effect on the brain areas involved in emotion and decision - making than among novice meditators .
Among meditators with more than 40,000 hours of lifetime practice , these areas were hardly affected at all .
" Most people , if they heard a baby screaming , would have some emotional response , " Davidson says , but not the highly experienced meditators .
" They do hear the sound , we can detect that in the auditory cortex , but they do n’t have the emotional reaction . "
As Davidson notes , any comparison of average middle - aged Americans to people who have meditated daily for decades must try to associate the differences with meditation , and not lifestyle factors such as isolation or religious faith .
" This was a highly unusual group of people .
Two - thirds of the experienced meditators were Tibetan monks , recruited with the help of the Dalai Lama , and they all had an extremely long history of formal practice . "
For 15 years , Davidson has had a scientific relationship with the Dalai Lama , spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists , to investigate the effects of meditation .
Still , the correlation between more meditation experience and greater brain changes does suggest that the changes were caused by meditation .
" If it were simply lifestyle , we would not expect a very strong correlation with hours of practice , " Davidson says .
Other evidence for the neurological benefits of meditation came from a study Davidson reported in May , which showed that three months of meditation training improved the ability to detect a brief visual signal that most people cannot detect .
" That was a more definitive kind of evidence , because we were able to track the same people over time , " he says .
Psychologists have long considered an adult ’s capacity to pay attention as relatively fixed , but Davidson says : " Attention can be trained , and in a way that is not fundamentally different than how physical exercise changes the body . "
The attention circuits affected by meditation are also involved in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , which Davidson describes as the most prevalent psychiatric diagnosis among children in our country .
" Our findings suggest that it may - I stress may - be possible to train attention in children with methods derived from these practices , " he says .
Davidson says scientific studies of meditation are proving traditional beliefs about the mental benefits of meditation .
Yet although meditation is often associated with monks living a life of simplicity , poverty , and prayer , " There is nothing fundamentally mysterious about these practices ; they can be understood in hard - nosed western scientific terms . "
And , he adds , a growing body of " hard - nosed neuroscience research " is attracting attention to the profound effects of meditation .
" This deserves serious scientific attention , " he says .
" It also explains why people spend time sitting on the meditation cushion , because of the effects on day - to - day life . "
Davidson compares mental practice to physical exercise .
" We all know that if an individual works out on a regular basis , that can change cardiovascular health , " he says .
" In the same way , these data suggest that certain basic mechanisms of the mind , like attention , can also be trained and improved through systematic practice . "
Everyone now knows that the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) that Bush ordered prepared in the summer of 2002 to “ justify ” the preemptive invasion and occupation of Iraq was  to put it politely  a crock [ pdf ] .
It relied heavily on disinformation  some of it provided by the neocrazies , themselves  and virtually ignored a decade of authoritative “ null ” reports on Iraqi nuclear programs by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Back in 1998 IAEA Director - General ElBaradei had told the Security Council [ .pdf ] that
“ There were no indications to suggest that Iraq had produced more than a few grams of weapons - grade nuclear material through its indigenous processes .
“ There were no indications that Iraq otherwise clandestinely acquired weapons - usable material .
“ There were no indications that there remains in Iraq any physical capability for the production of amounts of weapons - usable nuclear material of any practical significance . ”
Furthermore , ElBaradei had reported to the Security Council as recently as January of 2002 , that IAEA inspectors had entered Iraq and had verified that there had been no attempts at reconstruction .
But not everyone knew , until Sy Hersh revealed it in a January 2003 New Yorker article , that a few months before producing the fatally flawed Iraq NIE , the intelligence community had also hurriedly produced for Bush a NIE on North Korea ’s nuclear programs .
Why ?
In 1992 , a dispute had arisen between the Koreans and the IAEA , which was attempting to verify that the DPRK had accurately declared and made subject to a just negotiated Safeguards Agreement ( required of DPRK by the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ) all NPT proscribed materials .
The IAEA threatened to involve the UN Security Council in the dispute , whereupon the DPRK gave notice it was withdrawing from the NPT .
Eventually , after many carrot - stick negotiations , the DPRK agreed  under the so - called Agreed Framework [ .pdf ]  to remain a NPT signatory and to freeze all its nuclear programs , subject to IAEA verification .
In return , an international consortium  led by South Korea  would construct in the DPRK two free conventional nuclear power plants .
So , as Bush entered office , according to the IAEA , there were no nuclear programs  peaceful or otherwise  underway in Iraq or North Korea .
Well , that would never do .
Bush intended to invade Iraq and disarm Saddam Hussein .
The IAEA had to be discredited .
Hence , the Bush NIE of 2002 for Iraq .
And for North Korea .
According to Hersh , North Koreas NIE “ made the case ” that they had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by obtaining  unbeknownst to the IAEA  prototypes of high - speed gas centrifuges from Pakistan and that by 2001 , DPRK engineers were producing  unbeknownst to the IAEA  enriched uranium in significant quantities .
To this day , DPRK officials have vigorously denied the enriched - uranium charge , even after withdrawing from the NPT on the eve of Bushs war of aggression against Iraq , after expelling the IAEA monitors of the Agreed Framework , after restarting their plutonium - producing reactor and after recovering enough weapons - grade plutonium to make a dozen or so nuclear weapons .
And no one has provided any evidence to the contrary .
In 2004 , Siegfried Hecker  former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory  was invited to come check out their “ nuclear deterrent . ”
They proudly showed Sig all their plutonium stuff .
But when Sig asked to see the alleged highly enriched - uranium program , Vice Minister Kim Gye Gwan immediately responded that the DPRK had no HEU program ; nor any facilities , equipment or scientists dedicated to it .
So , why did Bushs DPRK - NIE of 2002 make the HEU charge ?
To further discredit the IAEA so Bush could preemptively attack Iraq  which the IAEA had given a “ clean bill of health ”  in 2003 ?
So Bush could preemptively attack Iran  which the IAEA has given a “ clean bill of health ”  in 2006 ?
But , wait a minute .
The Bush DPRK - NIE also alleged Pakistan helped North Korea conduct a series of “ cold tests ”  explosive tests , using non-fissile materials , necessary for determining whether an implosion device design functions properly .
Now , all of the devices that Pakistan claimed to have successfully tested in 1998 were implosion nukes , some reportedly utilizing almost - pure Plutonium - 239 .
There is no evidence that the DPRK ever had  or sought  weapons - grade enriched uranium .
But at the time of the Bush DPRK - NIE , the DPRK was known to have enough weapons - grade plutonium to make several implosion - type nukes .
All of it contained in spent fuel elements  “ frozen ”  under IAEA lock and seal .
Bottom line ?
When Bush became President , Iran , Iraq and North Korea were all certified by the IAEA to be nuke free .
Iran and Iraq still are .
But , thanks to Bush , the North Koreans are threatening to actually test one of the nukes everyone  including the IAEA  agrees they probably now have .

The Harry Potter Theory of Programming Language Design
by Guido van van Rossum
August 14 , 2005
Summary
A lighthearted comparison of how successful fiction authors and language designers can accidentally paint themselves into a corner in their first work .
Advertisement
I love reading the Harry Potter books , and recently came up with an interesting analogy between writing a series of fiction books and designing a programming language .
I 'm sure that when J.K. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book ( planning it as the first of a series of seven ) she had developed a fairly good idea of what kind of things might eventually happen in the series , but she did n't have the complete plot lines for the remaining books worked out , nor did she have every detail decided of how magic works in her world .
I 'm also assuming that as she wrote successive volumes , she occasionally went back to earlier books , picked out a detail that at the time was given just to add color ( or should I say colour :-) to the story , and gave it new significance .
For example , I doubt that when she invented the name Voldemort she had already decided that " I am Lord Voldemort " would be an anagram of " Tom Marvolo Riddle " --
Tom Riddle just is n't a very convincing name for a character to develop into the most evil person in the world , but apparently she could n't come up with a good anagram of Voldemort by itself .
( And the idea itself of an anagram is a bit lame , just as are the allitterating names of Hogwarts ' founders and some of the other students . )
I also do n't think that she had thought of Scabbers , Ron 's pathetic pet rat , as an animagus in disguise ( AFAICT the fact that he 's missing a toe does n't come up in the first two books at all ) .
Maybe she regrets the emphasis on Quidditch ( I know do :-) .
And so on -- you get the idea .
In a similar vein , I had never thought of iterators or generators when I came up with Python 's for - loop , or using % as a string formatting operator , and as a matter of fact , using ' def ' for defining both methods and functions was not part of the initial plan either ( although I like it ! ) .
Just like the successive Harry Potter books are required to have " continuity " ( we can't have Dumbledore 's taste in sweets change drastically in book 3 ) , successive versions of Python are constrained by pretty serious backwards compatibility requirements .
Sometimes it 's easy to go back and generalize a feature ; for example , the transformation of built - in conversion functions like int ( ) , str ( ) and list ( ) into built - in classes feels like a stroke of genius ( if I may say so myself :-) .
On the other hand , the recent discussion on python - dev of the exception hierarchy , summarized in PEP 348 , shows that early choices sometimes are less than ideal , even if they 're not fatally flawed .
The mismatch of naming conventions and API quality in the standard library is another example .

An artist 's impression of merging neutron stars , one of the theoretical progenitors of gamma-ray bursts .
Scientists have taken another step closer toexplaining mysterious gamma ray bursts , some of the most energetic and brightexplosions in the sky .
Gamma ray bursts ( GRBs ) - the harbingers of death for some massive stars - are intense blasts of energyand radiation that eject from massive dying stars .
Now , scientists at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica ( INAF ) in Italy have used NASA 's Swiftsatellite - specially designed to automatically detect GRBs - to determine that GRBs are a two - step explosion .
" The first burst of energy , lasting lessthan a few minutes , is produced by shockwaves within the collapsing star , " study author Sergio Campana told SPACE.com in an email .
" Whereas the longer , less energeticafterglow is produced by collisions between ejected matter and the materialaround the star , witnessing the X - ray light curves in the transition period fromprompt emission to afterglow . "
This research isdetailed in the Aug. 18 issue of the journal Nature .
The soft X - rayafterglow following the initial GRB can last for periods ranging from hours toweeks .
This afterglow was initially thought to be the slow fading of theinitial burst .
But after closelyobserving five GRBs and measuring the patterns ofX - ray emission , the INAF scientists determined that the afterglow was insteadcaused by violent shock interactions caused by the initial high - intensity blast .
" The duration of GRBs , together with their spectral properties , suggest aclassification into short and long bursts , " Clemson University physicist DieterHartmann wrote in an accompanying ' News and Views ' piece to the Nature article .
Short GRBs are believed to be caused by the merging of compactbinary stars , such as two neutron stars .
However , scientists are not yetpositive this explanation is definite and plan to continue to use the Swiftsatellite to investigate the nature of these bursts .
When explaininglong GRBs , scientists favor the " collapsar " model .
In this model , a rapidly rotating massive star has undergone extremegravitational collapse and created a black hole .
A disk of material from thecollapsed star forms around the outer rim of the black hole .
Through complexprocesses , a jet of high - energy radiation shoots from this disk , burstingthrough the surface of the star at almost the speed of light .
Intense bursts ofhigh - frequency gamma ray and X - ray radiation from exploding stars werediscovered nearly four decades ago .
Since NASA launched the Swift satellite inNov. 2004 , its detectors have picked up a burst every couple of days .
The Swift satelliteis the most autonomous spacecraft NASA has designed , using its three telescopesto detect and observe GRBs all on its own , automatically detecting the first stage of the explosion and targeting itselfon the event in about one minute .
Atrios is engaged in a debate over the role of religion in politics .
He 's chaffing at the notion that the religious left can be the conscience and soul of the Democratic Party , and he 's right .
Here 's the deal -- Republicans have claimed god as their own and perverted religious texts to justify some of the most divisive and hateful policies and discourse in our politics today .
And while Corporate Cons , Neocons , and Paleocons have tolerated the Theocons in order to tap into their activist network ( none of those other conservative factions have significant boots to help them win elections ) , fact is it 's created an ugly party that is unelectable in entire regions of the country .
No one likes to have their morality dictated by others .
And that does n't just mean the Religious Right , but those on our side as well .
Morality and ethics do n't have to come from religion .
Yes , there 's a whole cottage industry of consultants , media pundits , and establishment figures who think that 's the case .
Witness last year 's Senate battle .
The DC punditry and party establishment were in love with Harold Ford .
His campaign proudly sent me an advance look at Ford 's ad filmed inside a church .
I guess I was supposed to get excited at Ford 's cheap manipulation of religion for political ends .
But the DC set was in love .
Ford made the cover of Time Magazine .
He was on every cable show as an example of a new breed of Democrat willing to wrap himself up in a cross for electoral gain .
It does n't matter that it 's ugly when Republicans do it , here was one of our own willing to debase religion just the same !
The Ford love was so crazy , that James Carville attempted a coup post -November at the DNC , demanding Ford replace Howard Dean .
When that got nowhere fast , Ford landed as head of the DLC .
And this was a guy who did n't just lose his race , but did so in an open seat -- always the best pickup opportunities for challengers .
But you know what was interesting ?
Two Democrats defeated entrenched Republican incumbents in states just as Red , if not more so -- Jim Webb in Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana .
Bush got 57 percent in Tennessee , while he got 59 percent in Montana ( and 54 percent in Virginia ) .
And , they did so without cheap pandering to the religious set .
They did n't shoot commercials in churches , embrace hatred of gays , or demand school prayer ( all of which Harold Ford did ) .
They did n't prattle on about " god " at every campaign stop .
Yet somehow they were able to win .
But did the DC establishment celebrate those victories as a new model of Democrat able to win in tough Red states ?
Nope .
Because they did n't follow the established narrative .
Ford did , and was hailed for it even though he lost .
Did I mention Ford lost , while Tester and Webb won ?
So what lessons should we have learned ?
Democrats and liberals have been too willing in the past to make their electoral appeals based on the intellect -- offering a laundry list of 10 - point plans and programs they will create and / or support .
We 're trying to appeal to the brain , while Republicans have learned to appeal to the heart .
So we bore and confuse voters , giving them little sense in what makes our candidates tick .
They are busy .
They have two jobs , kids to shuffle between soccer practice and camp , myriad problems to deal with .
Political blog readers may be obsessed with politics , but it 's mostly a hobby .
Most people have other hobbies .
Politics is background noise .
They do n't want to deal with the details or learn about the issues .
That 's why we have a representative democracy -- so we can elect people to worry about the details .
What voters want is a sense of what makes a candidate tick .
When confronted with a decision , what values will the official draw upon to inform his or her decision .
And while many people -- thanks to the good branding work of the Religious Right -- think that " values " equals " religion " , fact is that values can come from any number of places .
For Jon Tester , his values were drawn from being part of a long line of Montana farmers .
All a Montana voter had to hear about Tester is that he was a third generation farmer and rancher to get a sense for what made him tick -- rugged individuality meshed with small - town sensibilities and community , someone who has had to work hard for a living , tilling his land , fixing his machines , scraping by year after year .
For Jim Webb , his values were drawn from a deep commitment to national service , coming from a long line of military professionals .
Voters could immediately get a sense for what makes Webb tick -- a deep sense of commitment to his country , honor , and duty .
Voters want to know what makes a candidate tick .
What are the values that inform his decision making process ?
Fairness ?
Opportunity ?
Paul Hackett was able to diffuse the gay marriage issue in his OH - 02 2005 special election by turning into a discussion about values , in this case , fairness :
Gay marriage — who the hell cares ?
If you 're gay you 're gay — more power to you .
What you want is to be treated fairly by the law and any American who does n't think that should be the case is , frankly , un-American .
And where do those values come from ?
If a candidate sincerely gets his or her values from religion , then that 's fine .
The Bible is a wonderfully liberal text .
And when it 's sincere it does n't come across so grating , so imposing .
Compare Obama 's talking about religion to Bush 's " favorite philosopher " b.s .
But religious values are no more superior than the values I learned from my abuelita ( and most Latinos will get a good sense of what my value system looks like just by referencing the word " abuelita " ) .
They are no more superior than the values Tester learned on the farm from his farmer father and grandfather .
Or the values that Webb learned while proudly wearing his uniform .
Or the values someone might learn by contemplating the great philosophers .
Or whatever .
Values are important , and Democrats must be comfortable talking about them .
Voters will respond to those better than any laundry list of issues .
But that does n't equal " talking about religion " .
We have Democrats who proved their ability to win in tough districts based on values - heavy campaigns .
So stop looking at Ford 's losing campaign as a model for the future .

Experts have added climate change as a great threat
Stephen Hawking
As a result , the group has moved the minute hand on its famous " Doomsday Clock " two minutes closer to midnight .
The concept timepiece , devised by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , now stands at five minutes to the hour .
The clock was first featured by the magazine 60 years ago , shortly after the US dropped its A - bombs on Japan .
Not since the darkest days of the Cold War has the Bulletin , which covers global security issues , felt the need to place the minute hand so close to midnight .
' Perilous choices '
The decision to move it came after BAS directors and affiliated scientists held discussions to reassess the idea of doomsday and what posed the most grievous threats to civilisation .
Growing global nuclear instability has led humanity to the brink of a " Second Nuclear Age , " the group concluded , and the threat posed by climate change is second only to that posed by nuclear weapons .
CHICAGO CLOCK OF DOOM Symbolic Doomsday Clock first established in 1947 Chicago BAS offices keep a representation of the timepiece First positioned at 7 mins to the hour ; 18 changes since then Originally reflected concern about nuclear annihilation Bulletin now considers other threats to global security also
The announcement was made at simultaneous events held by the magazine in London and in Washington DC that included remarks from the English Astronomer Royal , Sir Martin Rees , and physicist Stephen Hawking .
" Humankind 's collective impacts on the biosphere , climate and oceans are unprecedented , " said Sir Martin .
" These environmentally driven threats - ' threats without enemies ' - should loom as large in the political perspective as did the East / West political divide during the Cold War era . "
A number of alarming nuclear trends led to a statement by the Bulletin that " the world has not faced such perilous choices " since the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The worries include Iran 's nuclear ambitions , North Korea 's detonation of an atomic bomb , the presence of 26,000 launch - ready weapons by America and Russia , and the inability to secure and halt the international trafficking of nuclear materials such as highly enriched uranium and plutonium .
Ice evidence
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , founded by former Manhattan Project physicists , has campaigned for nuclear disarmament since 1947 .
Its board periodically reviews issues of global security and challenges to humanity , not solely those posed by nuclear technology , although most have had a technological component .
Nuclear war would itself bring about climate changes
Climate impact of A - bombs
A less immediate threat , but included in the assessment , is the one posed by emerging life science technologies , such as synthetic biology and genetic modification .
While the harm done to the planet by carbon - emitting manufacturing technologies and automobiles was more gradual than a nuclear explosion , nonetheless , it could also be catastrophic to life as we know it and " irremediable " , the board said .
It cited in support the conclusions of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Its broad assessment is that the warming over the last few decades is attributable to human activities , and that its consequences are observable in such events as the melting of Arctic ice .
In the years ahead , rising sea levels , heat waves , desertification , along with new disease outbreaks and wars over arable land and water , would mean climate change could bring widespread destruction , the board said .
It also warned against the use of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels .
' Optimistic ' view
While the technology had the potential to alleviate the climate warming effects of burning coal , its development raised the spectre that nuclear materials would be available for nefarious ends as well , the board argued .
Some scientists - even climate scientists - may not support the comparison of global warming to the catastrophe that would follow a nuclear engagement .
" Whether it 's a threat of the same magnitude or slightly less or greater is beside the point , " said Michael Oppenheimer , a geoscientist from Princeton University , US .
" The important point is that this organisation , which for 60 years has been monitoring and warning us about the nuclear threat , now recognises climate change as a threat that deserves the same level of attention , " he said .
Both the nuclear menace and a runaway greenhouse effect were the result of technology whose control had slipped from humans ' grasp , the BAS directors said .
But it was also within our power to pull them back under control , they added .
" We have n't figured out how to do that yet , but the potential is within our institutions and our imaginations , " said Dr Benedict .
Dr Oppenheimer agrees that people should not despair .
After all , he said , for a long time the world took the nuclear threat seriously and reduced the numbers of weapons .
" I 'm optimistic that we can address climate change , " he said .
" We 've dealt with such problems before , and we can do it again . "
Over the past 60 years , the Doomsday clock has now moved backwards and forwards 18 times .
It advanced to two minutes before midnight - its closest proximity to doom - in 1953 after the United States and the Soviet Union detonated hydrogen bombs .
Its keepers last moved the clock 's hand in 2002 after the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and amid alarm about the acquisition of nuclear weapons and materials by terrorists .

[ From the March 1997 issue of The Free Market , Volume 15 , Number 3 ]
My idea of a great president is one who acts in accordance with his oath of office to " preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . "
Not since the presidency of Grover Cleveland has any president achieved greatness by this standard .
Worse , the most admired have been those who failed most miserably .
Evidently my standard differs from that employed by others who judge presidential greatness .
In the New York Times Magazine for December 15 , 1996 , Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. , presented the results of a poll of historians asked to rank the presidents ( excepting only William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor , who held office very briefly ) .
Thirty historians plus politicos Mario M. Cuomo and Paul Simon were asked to rank the nations chief executives as Great , Near Great , Average , Below Average , or Failure .
The ranking applies to performance in the White House , not to lifetime accomplishments , and the historians used their own judgment as to what constitutes greatness or failure .
The results of the poll correspond well with the results of a number of earlier polls , especially in the set of presidents regarded as Great or Near Great .
The three Great ones are Washington , Lincoln , and Franklin D. Roosevelt .
The Near Great comprise Jefferson , Jackson , Polk , Theodore Roosevelt , Wilson , and Truman .
The Failures are Pierce , Buchanan , Andrew Johnson , Grant , Harding , Hoover , and Nixon , the last ranking at the very bottom of the heap .
What are we to make of this ranking ?
Well , it helps to know that the historians ( and two politicians ) doing the ranking are nearly all left - liberals .
In this regard they faithfully represent the historical profession in the United States today .
In making their judgments , such historians bring to bear left - liberal beliefs and values .
Thus , one respondent , James MacGregor Burns , asks : " How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic President [ as Nixon ] , so brilliant and so morally lacking ? " -- as if Nixon were , in this crowd , uniquely immoral .
One need not ponder the rankings long , however , to discover a remarkable correlation : all but one of the presidents ranked as Great or Near Great had an intimate association with war , either in office or by reputation before taking office .
Of the top - ranking " nine immortals , " five ( Lincoln , FDR , Polk , Wilson , and Truman ) were commander in chief when the nation went to war , and three ( Washington , Jackson , and Teddy Roosevelt ) were best known prior to becoming president for their martial exploits .
The one exception , Jefferson , confined his presidential bellicosity to authorizing , with Congressional consent , the naval engagements against the Barbary pirates .
( Of course , he had been a revolutionary official during the War of Independence . )
In contrast , of the eleven presidents ranked as Below Average or Failure , all but one ( Nixon ) managed to keep the nation at peace during their terms in office , and even Nixon ultimately extracted the United States from the quagmire of the war in Vietnam , though not until many more lives had been squandered .
The lesson seems obvious .
Any president who craves a high place in the annals of history should hasten to thrust the American people into an orgy of death and destruction .
It does not matter how ill - conceived the war may be .
Lincoln achieved his presidential immortality by quite unnecessarily plunging America into its greatest bloodbath - - ostensibly to maintain the boundaries of an existing federal union , as if those boundaries possessed some sacred status .
Wilson , on his own initiative and against the preference of a clear majority of the American people , propelled the country into a grotesquely senseless , shockingly barbarous clash of European dynasties in which the United States had no substantial national interest .
On such savage and foolish foundations is presidential greatness constructed .
I hold no brief for John Quincy Adams , Martin Van Buren , or Chester Arthur .
But give them their due ; at least they did not spill the blood of their fellow citizens .
Grant and Harding , who always rank near the bottom , do not deserve such contempt .
Schlesinger observes that " their sin was excessive loyalty to crooked friends " - - a sin that , in truth , many presidents have committed .
And even Schlesinger admits : " Scandal and corruption are indefensible , but they may injure the general welfare less than misconceived policies . "
Indeed , scandal and corruption , which not surprisingly have tainted most administrations to some degree , pale by comparison to the damage presidential policy decisions have wreaked .
What weight does Grant 's Credit Mobilier scandal have in comparison to Lincoln 's 620,000 dead in the Civil War ?
Harding 's Teapot Dome affair is but a drop in the ocean compared to the global horrors set in train by Wilson 's decision to take the United States into World War I : Allied victory , a harsh Versailles treaty , German resentment , the rise of Nazism , and World War II , not to speak of the rise of Communism , which also followed in World War I 's wake .
Why do the historians , and following them the public , place on pedestals the leaders responsible for such utter catastrophes ?
I have a theory : left - liberal historians worship political power , and idolize those who wield it most lavishly in the service of left - liberal causes .
How else can one account for the beatification of Lincoln , Wilson , and Franklin Roosevelt ?
Truman , now so elevated in the estimation of the historians , left office in unpopularity bordering on disgrace because of his Korean War disaster , but the historians forgive him , admiring his use of nuclear weapons and attempts to preserve and extend the New Deal .
Theodore Roosevelt , a bloodthirsty proto - fascist , evokes admiration because of his public flogging of big business , a perennial left - liberal whipping boy .
Were I to rank the presidents , I would not quite turn the historian 's ranking on its head , but I would move in that direction .
Certainly Lincoln , Wilson , FDR , Truman , and Lyndon Johnson belong at the bottom , for their statist economic policies as well as their supremely catastrophic war policies .
Finding presidents to put at the top of the list poses more difficulty , especially in choosing among those who have held office during the past century .
Grover Cleveland , though far from perfect , may have been the best .
He kept the country at peace .
He respected the Constitution , acknowledging that the national government has only a limited mission to perform and shaping his policies accordingly .
He fought to lower tariffs ; preserved the gold standard in its time of crisis ; and restored order forcibly when hoodlums disturbed the peace on a wide front during the great railroad strike of 1894 .
Washington , I think , actually does deserve a high rating -- not even the historians can be wrong all the time .
He established the precedent of stepping down after two terms , which lasted until it clashed with FDR 's insatiable ambition , and he prescribed the sensible foreign policy , later slandered as " isolationism , " that served the nation well for more than a century .
Other early presidents who were not entirely reprehensible in office include Jefferson and Jackson , though each committed grave derelictions .
Of the presidents since Cleveland , I rank Coolidge the highest .
He sponsored sharp tax cuts and greatly reduced the national debt .
As H.L. Mencken wrote , " There were no thrills while he reigned , but neither were there any headaches .
He had no ideas , and he was not a nuisance " -- high praise in view of the execrable performance of other twentieth - century presidents .
Taft and Eisenhower were a cut above the rest , but that 's not saying much .
Unfortunately , under FDR the Constitution suffered damage that none of his successors has repaired and most have made worse .
Certainly since 1932 -- and , one might well argue , since 1896 - - no president has been true to his oath of office .
Realizing the ambitions harbored by Teddy Roosevelt and Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt created the " imperial presidency , " and we have been the worse for it ever since .
The people who ratified the original Constitution never intended the presidency to be a powerful office spawning " great men . "
Article II , Sections 2 - 4 , which enumerate the powers of the president , comprise but four paragraphs , most of which deal with appointments and minor duties .
The president is to act as commander in chief of the army and navy , but Congress alone can commit the nation to war , that is , " declare war . "
The president is to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " but only Congress can enact laws , and then only within the scope of its limited , enumerated powers .
The presidency was intended to be a largely ceremonial position whose occupant would confine himself to enforcing federal laws .
But over time , abruptly during Lincoln 's presidency and progressively during the twentieth century , presidents seized more and more power .
American liberty will never be reestablished so long as elites and masses alike look to the president to perform supernatural feats and therefore tolerate his virtually unlimited exercise of power .
Until we can restore limited , constitutional government in this country , God save us from great presidents .
The Inmates Are Running the Asylum , Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity by Alan Cooper is a seminal book on user - centered software design .
The central theme of this book is how the IT industry resembles an asylum taken over by inmates – with software products completely missing the goals of their customers due to a combination of programmer psychology and sales - driven feature explosion .
Alan Cooper argues that programmers drive the development process using their own image as a guideline , and overloading the software with features which require expert knowledge .
On the other hand , sales and marketing push for features that can be used by beginners in order to expand the customer base .
Most of the software users are , according to Cooper , ‘ perpetual intermediaries ’ , so their needs are not addressed at all .
Cooper advocates fighting back against this unnecessary complexity and refusing to give in to the mass craziness .
His proposed solution is interaction design , a relatively new design practice focused on improving the way users access software .
I found the first part of this book especially interesting , as Cooper prepares the arguments for interaction design by taking a look at programmer psychology , and trying to explain the root causes of miscommunication between programmers and clients ( and managers in between ) .
Illustrated with anecdotes on the edge of irony and humour , Cooper describes several “ programmer ’s personal traits like considering failures a success if they learned anything in the process , sacrificing everything for knowledge , insisting on hard reality and over - emphasising edge cases .
Based on that , he then argues that programmers are consistently running the development show , regardless of the organisation structure or methodology , as they can , in Cooper ’s eyes , always push features dull , unimportant or uninteresting features to the bottom of the list just by estimating the development time too high .
Cooper also attacks programmers for developing the software with the primary aim to maintain it easily , not to meet the goals of customers , and for requiring users to gain internal knowledge of the systems they build .
In the first part , Cooper also attacks overloading products with features , and the world ’s acceptance of ugly interfaces and buggy software just because it enables solving complex problems .
He compares those imperfect products to a dancing bear – it looks really ugly when a bear dances , but it ’s fascinating enough so that people do n’t mind that it ’s not really a dance .
Cooper proposes design as a key factor to product success and customer loyalty , especially interaction design .
Without going into too much detail , he attributes the fall of Novel and Borland to the lack of interaction design in their products , and argues that good design is responsible for customer loyalty which kept Apple from completely vanishing , and helped them resurrect a few years ago .
His approach is completely opposite to the current trends in the software industry , as he argues for much more up - front design and against being directly customer driven .
Cooper calls doing layout design after development ‘ painting the corpse ’ , and proposes a phase of interaction design before software design .
His goal - driven design technique starts by identifying core user groups and representing them by a single , imaginary person , then focusing on those person ’s goals .
The idea of interaction design is making that one customer ecstatic about the product , and the book contains several detailed case studies which show how to do that , but still not push away other customer groups .
Once those target customers and their goals are identified , Cooper argues that having ‘ named persons ’ to represent users significantly improves communication , and makes it easy to remove the features which are not needed and would just introduce unnecessary complexity .
Last thirty or so pages , where the author tries to sell his process , were not very convincing to me .
Out of respect for his experience in the industry I will not say that he is plainly wrong , but in my humble opinion he misses to consider some very important realities of software development .
For example , Cooper compares software development with film making , arguing that the two are essentially the same in terms of having a pre-production , production and post - production phases , and that changes such as deciding to blow up a train instead of an air plane cannot be made easily in production , but can be quite easily made in pre-production .
Software business and films may seem close on a silver screen , or to a consultant that just jumps from one project to another , but software is developed , maintained and supported for years after the release , which cannot map to anything in the movie world .
I imagine that studio executives would just laugh at an offer to sell a popular blockbuster movie to a large retailer only if Julia Roberts was replaced by Pamela Anderson , but 15 cm taller , and if the story takes place in a futuristic instead of a medieval environment .
But I see changes like that in enterprise software every day – and being able to accommodate such silly requests is one of the key market advantages of good enterprise software .
Again , I might just be one of the followers of the ‘ dancing bear ’ , and trying to find an excuse for the imperfections rather than solving them – but I ’ll leave that to you to decide .
I still recommend this book very much to any open - minded developer ( and especially development managers ) .
It is full of good case studies and , although I do not agree with a lot of ideas described in the book , it was very refreshing to read .
Not very often did I come across such a detailed analysis of the software world from outside , by someone who has been an insider and with a viewpoint that will certainly make you think about ways to improve .
I do not believe that interaction design is a silver bullet that can solve all the issues in software development , but I believe that Cooper identified real problems which should be addressed .
I agree very much with him that we should put more effort into removing the complexity , and attacking unfounded common beliefs .
And even if you do n’t agree with the arguments which conflict with modern software development trends , there are a lot of ideas from this book that can be applied to improve software development and communication .
For example , although Cooper ’s approach completely at odds with Agile methodologies , his persona - focus is very similar to what Mike Cohn proposes in User Stories Applied , one of the agile bibles .
Similar , focusing on customer ’s goals is an excellent guideline for software development ( I wrote earlier about my experiences with goal - driven development in The Magic of Goals : Focused Projects and Better Requirements and How to develop software like commanding a tank ) .
Very definitely not green
A new mineral matching its unique chemistry - as described in the film Superman Returns - has been identified in a mine in Serbia .
According to movie and comic - book storylines , kryptonite is supposed to sap Superman 's powers whenever he is exposed to its large green crystals .
The real mineral is white and harmless , says Dr Chris Stanley , a mineralogist at London 's Natural History Museum .
" I 'm afraid it 's not green and it does n't glow either - although it will react to ultraviolet light by fluorescing a pinkish - orange , " he told BBC News .
Rock heist
Researchers from mining group Rio Tinto discovered the unusual mineral and enlisted the help of Dr Stanley when they could not match it with anything known previously to science .
Once the London expert had unravelled the mineral 's chemical make - up , he was shocked to discover this formula was already referenced in the literature - albeit literary fiction .
" Towards the end of my research I searched the web using the mineral 's chemical formula - sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide - and was amazed to discover that same scientific name , written on a case of rock containing kryptonite stolen by Lex Luthor from a museum in the film Superman Returns .
" The new mineral does not contain fluorine ( which it does in the film ) and is white rather than green but , in all other respects , the chemistry matches that for the rock containing kryptonite . "
The mineral is relatively hard but is very small grained .
Each individual crystal is less than five microns ( millionths of a metre ) across .
Elementary clash
Identifying its atomic structure required sophisticated analytical facilities at Canada 's National Research Council and the assistance and expertise of its researchers , Dr Pamela Whitfield and Dr Yvon Le Page .
" ' Knowing a material 's crystal structure means scientists can calculate other physical properties of the material , such as its elasticity or thermochemical properties , " explained Dr Le Page .
" Being able to analyse all the properties of a mineral , both chemical and physical , brings us closer to confirming that it is indeed unique . "
Finding out that the chemical composition of a material was an exact match to an invented formula for the fictitious kryptonite " was the coincidence of a lifetime , " he added .
The mineral cannot be called kryptonite under international nomenclature rules because it has nothing to do with krypton - a real element in the Periodic Table that takes the form of a gas .
Power possibilities
Instead , it will be formally named jadarite when it is described in the European Journal of Mineralogy later this year .
Jadar is the name of the place where the Serbian mine is located .
Dr Stanley said that if deposits occurred in sufficient quantity it could have some commercial value .
It contains boron and lithium - two valuable elements with many applications , he explained .
" Borosilicate glasses are used to encapsulate processed radioactive waste , and lithium is used in batteries and in the pharmaceutical industry . "
Last week , there were snakes on a plane — almost .
The man was stopped at customs .
This week , another man stepped boldly into a movie - imitating mission , and succeeded .
Alain Robert , a 44 - year - old Frenchman , has scaled the three tallest buildings in the world , and also the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building .
Shanghai ’s 88 - story Jinmao
Tower was his next target , and he climbed it today in 90 minutes while wearing a Spider - Man outfit .
( It does n’t look like he ’s getting any of the estimated $ 120 million in marketing cash for the latest sequel ) .
“ His feet had barely touched the ground when he was arrested by police , ” Reuters reported .
He expects to serve 15 days in jail .
If there is such a thing as a more serious , premeditated charge having to do with building climbing , Mr. Robert will certainly be guilty .
In 2001 , Chinese authorities rejected his requests to climb the Shanghai building .
The first person to scale the tower — a 31 - year - old Chinese man named Han Qizhi — claimed he was “ struck by a rash impulse . ”
That yielded about a two - week sentence , Reuters said .
Mr. Roberts does it for the thrill , but Mr. Han evidently was trying to promote his shoe business .
That ’s right , Al Bundy beat that comic book “ super hero ” to the top .

Study shows vaporizer delivers marijuana ' safely and effectively ' .
The active ingredient in cannabis leaves is in oils on the surface of leaf ' hairs ' .
Overgrow.com/norcan.org
Vaporizing cannabis leaves instead of burning them can release the drug 's active ingredient just as effectively — while avoiding the harmful toxins inhaled through smoking the drug , according to a pilot study .
The result could be good news for those who choose to use marijuana medicinally .
The potential benefits of marijuana include pain relief for multiple - sclerosis sufferers , a treatment for glaucoma , as an appetite stimulant for AIDS patients and an anti-nausea agent for people on chemotherapy .
But smoking is n't a good method of drug delivery because the harmful effects — such as lung cancer and heart disease — outweigh the likely merits of marijuana for all but terminal cases .
Rather than smoking , some use the leaves to make tea or cakes for consumption .
But this means that the active agents are metabolized by the liver rather than entering the bloodstream unaltered .
Others have focused on extracting active ingredients such as tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) and delivering them alone in a pill or oral spray .
However , many think that the isolated ingredients are not as effective as the whole plant , and it is more difficult to customize the dose for each individual with a pill .
Hot stuff
Donald Abrams of the University of California , San Francisco , and his team decided to investigate the benefits of the ' Volcano ' , a commercially available vaporizer .
The device heats marijuana leaves to a temperature between 180 and 200 °C so that THC is released from oils on the surface of the leaf but no actual combustion takes place .
Previous studies have shown that harmful toxins released through smoking cannabis such as carbon monoxide , benzene and a host of compounds known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( many of which are known carcinogens ) are not produced by such devices .
Abrams ' study is the first to compare the effects of smoking and vaporizing cannabis on human subjects .
" We were able to deliver more - or - less equivalent amounts of THC into the bloodstream , " he says .
The main difference between the two delivery methods was that THC seemed to be absorbed into the bloodstream faster when using the vaporizer1 .
" The pharmacological and physiological effects were comparable , " he says , although a larger study would be needed to prove that they are biologically equivalent .
Slow burn
The first studies to highlight the advantages of using vaporizers for cannabis were published more than five years ago , but the pace of research has been slow , partly because there is only one source of research - approved marijuana in the United States — the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) — which critics accuse of dictating research along a political agenda .
A legal ruling this February recommended that the US Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) end NIDA 's monopoly on the production of marijuana for research approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and by the DEA .

Laura Bell of the Multiple Sclerosis Society in the UK says that her society supports cannabinoid research for people with multiple sclerosis .
" Smoking cannabis results in exposure to many toxic chemicals , " she says .
" We welcome research into better and safer delivery methods . "
Cannabis leaf is not the only substrate suited to a vaporizer .
Other herbal preparations , such as eucalyptus and chamomile can also be used , or any plant with medicinal properties in the volatile compounds of its leaves .

För några månader sedan kunde jag ta ut lite extra semesterdagar och funderade över om jag kunde hitta ett billigt resmål för att njuta av min oväntade semester istället för att bara sitta hemma och dra .
Jag ville först ha lite sol och bad , kanske på Kanarieöarna , men sen kände jag att om jag åker själv så kommer det nog vara tråkigt att bara ligga och bada och dricka drinkar i min ensamhet .
Då är det roligare att upptäcka saker , promenera runt och så vidare .
Till slut bestämde jag mig för Lettland .
Det fanns både billigt flyg och boende så det fick bli ett flyg till Riga .
Jag var en aning orolig för att resa själv med risk för att bara ha det tråkigt men eftersom det bara handlade om fyra dagar så gick tiden till slut väldigt snabbt .
Jag hade kollat upp en del sevärdheter på förhand som jag betade av en efter en .
Jag besökte bland annat slottet Rundale som tydligen är skapat av en italiensk arkitekt som hette Rastrelli .
Det var verkligen mäktigt och vackert att se .
Av ren nyfikenhet gick jag även och kollade på en gammal port som heter “ Den svenska porten ” .
Det var kanske inget märkvärdigt men man blir ju nyfiken .
Tydligen utgjorde Lettland en del av ett svenskt kungarike under framförallt 1600 - talet .
Jag besökte även ett frihetsmonument som jag inte minns nu vad det hette .
Men det var en hög obeliskformad pelare med en kvinna i toppen som höll upp något i händerna i triumf .
I stort sett spatserade jag mest runt i Riga och kollade på gammal arkitektur och åt gott på restauranger och drack kaffe på kafé .
Jag hade dessutom tur med vandrarhemmet där jag träffade tre tyskar som också var på semester så jag spenderade en dag med dem och besökte bland annat ett konstmuseum .
On Wednesday night 's " Countdown , " Air America Radio talk show host Rachel Maddow discuss the recent TB scare .
Maddow points out that the CDC literally had no plan in place for this kind of dangerous situation and the abysmal way they dealt with it .
Hmm , a Bush appointee with no plan to deal with a potential crisis ... I think I 'm starting to see a pattern here .

Stewart : " So , in your opinion , what could or should the government have done differently without running afoul of civil right 's concerns ? "
Maddow : " The first thing the goverment should have done is have a plan .
The single scariest thing about this entire response and everything we 've learned in the last two days was the statement by the head of the CDC , Julie Gerberding , when she actually said , we just kind of had to make up the plan as we went along . "
I did a little research on the head of the CDC , Julie Gerberding , and it turns out that she got the job in large part for her extensive work on the 2001 anthrax attacks .
Because we know that investigation was a huge success ...
Good translators are hard to find , especially if you are the US military and you need people who speak Arabic .
But if new software from IBM proves successful in field trials , it will soon be easier for English - speaking personnel in Iraq to communicate with Iraqis without the need for a human translator .
The United States Joint Forces Command ( USJFCOM ) has ordered 35 ruggedized laptops equipped with IBM 's MASTOR software to test the utility of speech - to - speech machine translation .
The software , which has been under development since 2001 , provides real - time , two - way translation between English and Arabic without requiring speakers to use preprogrammed phrases .
" Our goal is to enable units operating in areas where human interpreters are scarce to communicate effectively with speakers of different languages in real - world tactical situations , " said Wayne Richards of USJFCOM .
" The feedback gained in the field is crucial to enhance the translation system requirements and performance expectations . "
Here 's how it works : soldiers will carry around the new Panasonic ToughBooks .
When they want to speak to someone , they open the laptop , load the software , and speak into the microphone .
The computer uses ViaVoice technology to recognize words , which it displays on - screen in English .
It then translates the phrase into Arabic , displays this as text , and simultaneously uses a text - to - speech engine to say the phrase aloud .
The system has a vocabulary of 50,000 English words and 100,000 Arabic words , though creating an Arabic language model posed a challenge to IBM scientists .
They trained the system using 50 hours of recorded speech which contained 200,000 short Arabic phrases .
Though researchers acknowledge that the machine translations will not be idiomatic , they are confident that they will prove " good enough " for communicating basic information when a translator is not available .
The MASTOR system is currently available for Iraqi Arabic , Standard Arabic , and Mandarin Chinese .
Though the military is currently the main customer , IBM hopes to further commercialize the technology for business use , and they have developed a smaller version that runs on PDAs .
A few weeks ago I was walking down 31st Street near 8th Avenue and noticed a four - foot tall ledge protruding from a seemingly abandoned building .
The next logical step was to stage an Improv Everywhere Mission with a suicide jumper on the absurdly small ledge .
At around 3:30 in the afternoon , a somber man crawled up the far side of the ledge at the edge of the building and began carefully inching his way towards the center .
Agent Nicholson brought his fisheye lense
The view from across the street
Many cars slowed down as passengers gawked at the jumper
A crowd looks on at the taxi- line across the street
Someone must have called the police , because Officer Randy McNabb soon arrived to talk the jumper down .
“ It ’s ok .
Everybody gets a little depressed around the holidays ”
Officer McNabb soon ascertained that the jumper ’s name was “ Will ” and that he was devastated after not receiving a Christmas bonus .
He could n’t even afford to buy his kids presents this year , and suicide seemed like the only way out .
Suddenly a cab pulled up to the scene and Will ’s wife , Eliza frantically dashed out .
“ We got your wife here .
She says she loves you very much . ”
As the scene gets more dramatic , more people join the crowd to figure out what ’s going on .
Out of nowhere a shout is suddenly heard at the far edge of the ledge .
“ Will !
What the hell do you think you ’re doing ? ”
Will ’s coworker , Nate , had braved the dangerous ledge in attempt to save the day .
“ Sir , do n’t try to be a hero . ”
As the plot thickens , the crowd grows larger .
Much to everyone ’s relief a fireman appeared on the scene .
He sprinted down the street with a trampoline , ready to save the day .
Man watches the fireman do his duty
The fireman moved the trampoline back and forth as Will paced on the edge .
“ You got a lotta people who care about you , Will . ”
Officer McNabb encouraged the crowd to cross the street and come closer to show their support for Will .
Will looked deep into the eyes of Eliza and realized he was about to make a huge mistake .
“ I ’ll come down .
I ’ll come down , ” he shouted as the crowd gasped with relief .
It was determined that jumping down to the trampoline would be safer than walking back along the narrow ledge .
The fireman instructed Will to aim for the “ x ” in the center of the trampoline and the crowd cheered him on by chanting “ Hit the x ! ” Just before
Will was about to jump a huge gust of wind caused him to lose his balance .
Unable to regain his balance , Will bravely pushed off the ledge .
He hit the “ x ” right in the center and collapsed on the street .
The fireman quickly covers
Will with a warm blanket as Eliza rushes in to hug him .
Officer McNabb announced on the megaphone , “ We got him !
He ’s ok ! ”
It was a true Christmas Miracle .
Nate jumps to safety .
“ Use your head next time . ”
Agent McNabb broke the crowd up .
“ Show ’s over everybody .
Let ’s give these folks some space . ”
The crowd dispersed as Will and Eliza slowly walked off together .
Agent Whines ( “ Will ” – the jumper )
When Agent Todd contacted me to play the suicidal businessman , I was surprised to find myself completely flattered .
I ’d always believed that I could project sadness ; I just had n’t realized I was proud of believing that until I got this assignment .
Executing the mission felt extremely simple .
About fifteen minutes before we started , the principal agents and I sketched out a very simple back - story : ( the names of my children , name of the fictional company , the fact that I had not received a Christmas bonus ) .
Then Agent Todd and I walked over to the site .
I spent five minutes or so preparing myself , and then hopped up on the ledge .
After that , I simply had to react to other agents as they entered the scene .
I ’ve been impressed with the acting commitment of IE Agents in previous missions , and wanted to live up to that standard .
Agent Todd instructed me — and all other agents agreed — that we would play the suicide near - attempt as realistically as possible , except for the four - foot ledge .
The only time I felt close to breaking character and laughing was 1 ) when I first saw Agent Shelktone nervously stepping towards me , since watching him once again revealed how absurdly close to the ground we were and 2 ) when Agent Ace $ Thugg told me I should not kill myself because “ you gotta good - lookin ’ wife . ”
The ledge was narrow enough that shifting along it was difficult .
That helped generate actual nervousness and panic — since if I really did fall off the ledge too soon , I would drop harmlessly three feet down , ending the mission .
The moment I first stood up on the ledge , a passerby laughed and said “ Do n’t jump . ”
This encouraged me that our scenario was visually very recognizable .
At first I avoided eye contact with people walking by underneath me , since I was trying to pretend that I was hundreds of stories in the air , and unable to see pedestrians .
But after a few minutes , I decided that a big part of the mission was interaction with non-agents , so I let myself make eye contact if it happened naturally .
Most people hurriedly looked away as if they did n’t want to interrupt me , or did n’t want me to talk to them .
A second guy said “ Do n’t jump ” and laughed .
I was really excited for the “ accidental ” fall which happens after my character decides that he ’s going to get down safely .
I was hoping for three or four really big buckles forward and backward before jumping onto Agent Ace $ Thugg ’s trampoline .
I think I got three before actually losing balance and having to jump off .
Agent Rodgers ( Officer Randy McNabb )
1445h : I met up with the other agents and changed out of my civilian clothes , into my police uniform .
1530h : Agent Ace $ Thugg and I lean on a truck near the ledge , and watch as
the crowd grows .
I saw several police officers eyeballing me .
I figured when I start talking on the megaphone they ’re gonna give me a hard time , and it might cut things short .
So at the last minute I decided to take off the badges on my arm , the only thing that said NY PD .
This did not affect the mission at all , and I doubt if anyone but myself noticed , but it was a personal defeat , I felt it almost immediately , and it made me a little depressed .
In the end no police officer gave a shit , they watched as confused as anyone else , it was too cold for them to care enough .
I made my move away from the truck and took my first glance at Agent Whines on the ledge .
As I brought the megaphone to my mouth , two girls grabbed my arm and asked , “ What is the fastest way to 45th St. and 3rd Ave . ? ”
I told them a cab is the fastest route , but I also told them how to get there by subway .
I noticed one of them realizing the unnatural quality of my mustache , while the other girl pressed on with more questions .
I pointed behind me and asked , “ I ’m sorry girls , how long has this guy been out here ?
I think we might have a situation on our hands . ”
They said they did n’t know , thanked me for the directions , and walked away .
I asked the crowd how long he had been up there , a horrified Agent Simmons came forth and said , “ like fifteen minutes ! ”
People were confused .
A woman pushing a stroller and fighting with her husband said something along the line of , “ I want to watch this crazy bootleg shit ! ”
Most people walking by did n’t realize anything was going on until they got between Agent Whines and myself .
I would try to tell them , “ Do n’t worry we ’ll get him down . ”
A few in the crowd started chanting “ Jump ! Jump ! ”
This deeply hurt me , I turned around and shouted , “ This is a mans life your joking with ! ”
They stopped the chanting .
Agent Ace
$ Thugg ’s firefighter had an interesting take on things .
He was pretty bitter , asking the jumper , “ What do you just need some attention ? ” and saying “ Come on , you got a real good lookin ’ wife down here , r- e - a-l good lookin’ . ”
After the trampoline was put down , I think Agent Lathan started a ‘ hit the X ’ chant , which the entire crowd and myself joined in on .
1615 : The jumper was down , Will hugged me and I realized my hands were just about frozen .
So if you ever pretend to be a cop talking down a suicide jumper , wear gloves !
Also remember most people get depressed this time of year , never kill yourself !
Agent Skinner ( “ Eliza ” – the wife )
Agent Whines and I were an easy package deal .
He ’s my real - life boyfriend , so we have the emotional connectedness required to convince a cabstand full of strangers that we were a married couple on the brink .
Before we started , we worked out a back story including two fictional children , Tristan ( 9 years old , our little scientist ) and Elliot ( 6 years old , just started violin lessons ! )
We were waiting behind a parked truck for our entrances , and Agent Rodgers – “ the cop ” – was the first to go out .
As soon as he walked away from the rest of us , he got stopped by two girls who needed help with directions .
I wonder how far into their question they realized that he was wearing a fake mustache .
After Agent Whines assumed his position on the ledge and Agent Rodgers made contact with him , I was supposed to join Agent Rodgers in trying to talk him down .
At the last minute I decided it would be more dramatic to ride up in a cab , so I borrowed $ 3 from Agent Ace $ Thugg and ran through Penn Station to get to the cabstand on the other side .
When the cab pulled up , some cops were there but Agent Rodgers was still on the bullhorn , so I figured I should go down with him .
I jumped out of the cab yelling , and generally freaking out , as I assumed I would in such a situation .
From then on out I just stood by Agent Rodgers worrying and saying , “ Do n’t do this !
We love you ! ” and that sort of hoo -haa .
We frequently pleaded on poor little Elliot ’s behalf , but apparently dropped Tristan from the family entirely .
When Agent Whines finally jumped onto the trampoline , I covered him with a blanket and we hugged heartwarmingly for a while .
When we had all collected ourselves Agent Whines and I bid the crowd goodbye to go start putting our family back together ( perhaps to find our poor forgotten Tristan ) .
At this point Agent Shelktone stopped us , locked eyes with Agent Whines , and said very intensely “ HEY … I ’ll see you . ”
Which was hilarious .
Agent Shelktone ( “ Nate ” – the coworker )
I had never seen the building that Agent Todd had referred to in our mission briefing so I was curious to finally get a look at it .
It is quite an oddball building .
In fact , it looks like how I imagine the book depository in Dallas to be .
Which makes it all the more humorous that this is the place that Agent Whines and myself supposedly work at .
Agents Rodgers , Skinner , Ace $ Thugg , and myself huddled behind a parked 18 - wheeler truck .
We were remarking how it felt like some sort of wings for the stage .
Nobody seemed to notice that each new character in the ‘ jumper ’ drama emerged from behind the truck .
A crowd started to gather , part plants of agents , and part genuine onlookers .
The choice of location was clever as it was in front of a cabstand .
So there was a built - in crowd .
The moment that Agent Rodgers emerged as the cop , two women asked him immediately for directions .
Agent Rodgers had been worried that he might be mistaken for impersonating a policeman but I assured him that the giant fake moustache he was wearing could never be taken as real .
Apparently these two women felt that fake moustache or not , he probably had a good idea of directions .
Agent Skinner came up with a great idea to arrive on the scene from a cab .
There was a nice New York moment when she came up and got out and started yelling , and the person next in line for cabs pretty much just gave a nonchalant look and got in the cab .
Finally it was my turn to enter the scene and I crawled up on the side of the building and began edging my way towards Agent Whines .
It proved to be more difficult than I imagined because every four feet the wall jutted out a little more and then went back to normal and then thinner again .
I was wearing a heavy jacket too so this compounded things .
I felt was I was going to fall a couple of times .
I wondered what I would do if I fell but it never came to that .
When I got to the last thin section near Agent Whines , I noticed that it was covered with bird crap .
So I decided to flip myself around and inch that way so I did n’t have to touch the bird dung .
I almost broke when Agent Whines scolded me for being out on the ledge what with my heart condition and trick knee .
I got to hop down on the rescue trampoline and hugged my co-worker and his wife .
I waved them goodbye and then decided to get a cup of coffee with the Officer McNabb .
Agent Ace $ Thugg ( Fireman )
I was waiting at the end of the street before I came around the corner as the fireman .
Every passenger in every car that drove by had their head turned back trying to get a glimpse of the suicide as they drove by .
Then they saw me with my trampoline and fireman hat , pretending to be one of NYC ’s bravest and the passengers all seemed to make the connection right then and laugh , even without witnessing the whole event .
Agent Lathan ( bystander )
The first thing I saw when I got there was a guy laughing hysterically who had just walked past Agent Whines .
He was talking on his cell phone and was like , “ Check this out , some dude is threatening to jump to his death … off a three foot ledge ! ”
Some highlights included :
- Eliza racing out of her cab pleading with Will not to jump .
- Officer McNabb making the name connection to Will : “ Your name ’s Will ?
Well I have a son named Bill .
That ’s pretty close right ? ”
- Nate ’s concerned and scared look on his face as he shimmied his way across the ledge .
- The fireman ’s instruction to jump on the X .
( Which led to the chant : “ Jump on the X ! ”
- Will ’s commitment and believability to a depressed man about to jump off a three - foot ledge .
Plus his jump on the trampoline was highly dramatic .
I actually was n’t sure if we would really land on the trampoline .
But he did !
I remember at one point a drunken old man came over and demanded to know what was going on .
I gravely informed him that someone was about to jump .
This made the drunken old man very angry .
“ Awww who cares ?
What ’s gonna happen if he jumps ?!
It ’s not even that high ! ! ”
To which I sincerely replied , “ I ’m not sure .
He could twist an ankle . ”
Agent Simmons ( bystander )
A very intense vagrant stopped and stared at the scene in disbelief .
He said “ What ’s this idiot think he ’s gonna do from that height ? ” I replied “ We ’ve had some ice lately and he could slip on that marble ” .
He shot back “ It ’s made of granite–like his head .
Good BYE ! ” And he stormed off .
Agent Moore ( bystander )
I had a friend in town on Saturday , and I was showing him around the city .
Agent Todd had briefed me about when and where the prank was to be ( 3:30 at 31st Street and 8th Ave ) , and I tried to casually end up at the location with my friend .
Unfortunately it was pretty cold out , so I had to tell him that yes , there was a reason I wanted to stand nonchalantly on a street corner eating a pretzel .
I did n’t tell him the reason , but he knew something was up .
I recognized a few agents standing around us also being nonchalant , which reassured me that things would eventually start and that I had n’t somehow missed it .
After a while , though , I started shivering , which is decidedly un-nonchalant , so we ran to get a cup of coffee .
When we came back , I found that all the agents were moving away from the street corner on which we ’d been loitering .
We followed a familiar back that was disappearing down 31st street .
I saw a couple of cameras flash ahead of us , and knew things had begun .
We joined the small crowd of what looked to be mainly agents and people queuing for cabs .
Across the street , there was a policeman with a bullhorn talking down a well - dressed but obviously agitated businessman threatening to jump from a four - foot ledge .
“ My God , ” I exclaimed .
“ My God , I think he ’s going to do it ! ”
My friend laughed momentarily , but immediately played along , putting on a very serious face and trying to shield me from what would obviously be a sad , gory ending for the poor man .
A middle - aged couple walked by , and the woman asked her companion what was going on .
He glanced briefly across the street , and replied , “ It ’s theatre . ”
They kept walking .
Some people stayed to watch , though , and a small crowd was growing .
Several people asked me what was going on , “ He ’s threatening to jump , ” I would respond worriedly .
“ I think he ’s going to do it . ”
My favorite reaction came from a girl who approached me and asked , “ Is this …funny ? ”
We cheered when the fireman approached with his tiny trampoline , and moved across the street when asked .
I encouraged several passersby to come with us .
There was another big cheer when the poor man finally agreed to come down safely .
I got a little teary .
My friend – an excellent sport — did n’t laugh until we moved far away from the site .
“ I always trust you to show me the best things in the city , ” he told me .
Agent Montague ( bystander )
I think this mission was best suited for cars passing by .
I saw a couple of camera phones stick out of cab windows to take pictures .
A couple of cars halted in the middle of the road .
Without any time to really take everything in , these people might have gone home truly believing the stunt .
People standing on the sidewalk were drawn in , and it was n’t because they were concerned for the jumper or wanted to watch a film shoot , but they just wanted to figure out what exactly was going on .
I heard a lot of people saying , “ Is this a movie ? ” and “ What is this ? ”
We were near the crowded taxi line at Penn Station .
I actually saw one guy put his family in a cab and tell them , “ I ’ll meet up with you later .
I ’m sticking around to see what happens . ”
As a planted audience member , I knew few details about the mission .
The real highlight for me was watching everything unfold , not knowing what would happen next .
Originally , I assumed the cast of characters consisted of nothing more than one guy on a tiny ledge , which would ’ve been sufficient .
To my delight , a whole cast of characters slowly entered the picture .
For me , it was like watching a play unfold on a random sidewalk , which was a unique experience .
Agent Pally ( bystander )
I think the funniest thing that I heard or saw by far were the nurses in the dentist office on the ground floor .
I was hanging back faking calls on my cell phone to try and make the people in the cab line believe it was something real as opposed to a movie , and I heard a banging on the glass and when I turned around I saw three nurses looking through their ground floor window miming to me “ what ’s going on ” .
This was particularly funny because I would imagine that if this were going on in a building that was on a high floor , you would have people from the building across from it looking on and wondering what was going on .
Only in this case , we were all standing on the ground looking at someone four feet up .
Agent Pally and the nurses
Mission Accomplished .
EPILOGUE :
In September of 2006 , Officer McNabb and Will gave us an update at the IE 5th Anniversary Show :

WASHINGTON DC ( March 19 , 2007 ) – A platoon of Iraq Veterans Against the War took to the streets of downtown Washington DC today reenacting their experiences in Iraq as participants in an unjust war .
A dozen others people filled the roles of Iraq civilians under foreign occupation .
Troops reenacted mass roundups and detentions , prisoner searches and interrogations , and patrol operations on the Capitol Building lawns , the gates of the White House , the Washington Monument , the Treasury Building , and a military recruiting station .
Troops barked orders , “ To shut the hell up or I ’ll blow their freaking head off ! ”  to suspected insurgents and / or Iraqi civilians .
Leaflets were distributed to people walking by to explain that “ this is what is happening every day in Iraq . ” 
Although the IVAW platoon was detained briefly near the Capitol Building , and shadowed by a multi-agency SWAT team , no casualties were taken .
Midway throw the day the platoon joined a press conference with Military Families Speak Out , Veterans for Peace , and the Appeal for Redress to call on congress to “ Support the troops by de-funding the war . ” 

This just in .
CodePlex is planning to roll out TortoiseSVN support !
A little while ago I wrote a comparison of TFS vs Subversion for Open Source projects .
I ’ll spare you the suspense by telling you that Subversion wins hands down , primarily because it itself is open source and is designed with open source in mind .
It turned out that there was already a work item for SVN support and it was the highest vote getter .
On Friday , Jim Newkirk commented within the work item that they are adding support for TortoiseSVN .
You can see in the work Item Details ( click to enlarge ) that it is set to release on June 5 , 2007 .
Jim ’s comment mentions TortoiseSVN support specifically , but I assumed he meant Subversion support .
Unless they are building some sort of Subversion bridge to TFS .
As I wrote in a recent post , there appears to be two camps at Microsoft in regards to Open Source - the old guard who are threatened by it , and the new guard who are embracing it as the opportunity it really is for Microsoft .
CodePlex is emblematic of the new guard .
They are listening to their users and building something that really will benefit the .NET OSS community .
My heartfelt kudos to the CodePlex team !
Now it ’s time for me to approach the rest of the Subtext devs to talk about a potential move after June 5 .
Of course , being pragmatic .
I ’ll want to test it out first .
Kick the tires before making any commitments .
UPDATE : It looks like the CodePlex team has created a Subversion bridge to TFS .
In other words , from the outside , it looks just like Subversion so you can connect using TortoiseSVN and SVN.exe , but under the hood , it is TFS .
Technologically speaking , that sounds pretty cool .
It could n’t have been trivial .
However , I ’m a bit skeptical it will have ( and maintain ) feature parity , but I ’m looking forward to trying it out .
Not exactly what I hoped for , but I wo n’t sit around and bitch about it if it works .
On the Today Show , Nancy Pelosi sat down with Campbell Brown to discuss her trip to Syria , as well as the stand - off between the White House and Congress over the war funding .

NP : The president is not king , the president is the president of the United States .
America is a democracy .
We have to make decisions based on our judgment .
Thus far , the president 's judgment has n't been good , in terms of say for example the war on Iraq .
So with all due respect to the president and the role he has , we want respect for the role we have .
And members of Congress have gone on fact finding trips since our country began .
We 're not going to stop because the president wants to avoid the facts and does n't want to engage in dialogue .
We had a bipartisan trip , interesting that the administration chose to ignore the trips of the Republicans who had been there in the week that we were there .
Full transcript below the fold .
NP : Everyone has a right to be critical of it [ Syria trip ] .
The point is that we had a very high level visit , which was very well received .
The president wants a blank check on all of his foreign policy , including the war .
We 're simply not going to give that to him .
CB : But traditionally that has been the power of the presidency .
There are some who would argue that legally it is the president 's responsibility to conduct foreign policy and it was n't just the Washington Post , the New York Times ' editorial page said that your job is to spur the administration to pursue active diplomatic policy , not to attempt to conduct the diplomacy yourself .
NP : We were n't conducting diplomacy .
This may be a mission for the administration that has very little to offer to the American people .
As far as we were concerned , I am Speaker of the House , we oversee the budget of the United States , much of that budget is that of our national defense .
Fight that war on terror is a very big priority for us .
We had a bipartisan delegation , we had the support of the Iraq Study Group , which said that we should engage in dialogue , that 's what we were doing .
CB : But the president rejected the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group .
We 're not going to engage Syria .
So you do n't think you 're conducting an alternative foreign policy if you 're following those recommendations , even though the president said we 're not going to do that .
NP : The president is not king , the president is the president of the United States .
America is a democracy .
We have to make decisions based on our judgment .
Thus far , the president 's judgment has n't been good , in terms of say for example the war on Iraq .
So with all due respect to the president and the role he has , we want respect for the role we have .
And members of Congress have gone on fact finding trips since our country began .
We 're not going to stop because the president wants to avoid the facts and does n't want to engage in dialogue .
We had a bipartisan trip , interesting that the administration chose to ignore the trips of the Republicans who had been there in the week that we were there .
CB : But the Republicans do n't have your megaphone .
They 're not speaker of the House .
You speak , the world listens .
NP : That 's right , and that 's because I have power , and that 's why I have -- in other words -- the president wants to have it both ways .
She should n't go because what difference does it make ?
She should n't go because she makes a big difference .
They have to make a decision .
But the fact is that we will never stop finding the facts to honor our responsibility to provide for the common defense to fight terrorism and to deliver the president 's message .
CB : Let 's talk about Iraq .
You are locked in a standoff with President Bush right now over funding for the war .
You say any bill has to have a timetable for withdrawal , with troops out in 2008 .
The president , he 's adamant , that he will veto any bill that includes a timetable .
Do you see any hope for resolution ?
NP : I hope so .
I think that we owe it to the American people to sit down with each other .
CB : He 's invited you to the White House to talk next week .
NP : No , he has n't .
He said he'd invite us to the White House if we agreed to give him a blank check , but there are no more blank checks .
This is about a Congress that is accountable to the American people and we will hold the president 's policy accountable as well .
CB : He says that you , that Democrats , are using this bill to make a political statement at the expense of …
NP : Well I 'm sad that he 's saying that , because our members , as he would say , are all patriotic on both sides of the aisle .
We all care about our troops , we all are committed to our national security .
So he can say what he will say , but it simply is n't true just because the president says it .
It does n't make it a fact .
CB : But right now you do n't have the votes to override a veto .
NP : Well we would hope that the president will make a reflection of the majority view in our country .
And I would hope that the president would understand that that 's where the Congress is coming from on this .
Via The Independent :
The ' IoS ' today reveals a draft for a new law that would give Western oil companies a massive share in the third largest reserves in the world .
To the victors , the oil ?
That is how some experts view this unprecedented arrangement with a major Middle East oil producer that guarantees investors huge profits for the next 30 years
So was this what the Iraq war was fought for , after all ?
As the number of US soldiers killed since the invasion rises past the 3,000 mark , and President George Bush gambles on sending in up to 30,000 more troops , The Independent on Sunday has learnt that the Iraqi government is about to push through a law giving Western oil companies the right to exploit the country 's massive oil reserves .
Now , unnoticed by most amid the furore over civil war in Iraq and the hanging of Saddam Hussein , the new oil law has quietly been going through several drafts , and is now on the point of being presented to the cabinet and then the parliament in Baghdad .
Its provisions are a radical departure from the norm for developing countries : under a system known as " production - sharing agreements " , or PSAs , oil majors such as BP and Shell in Britain , and Exxon and Chevron in the US , would be able to sign deals of up to 30 years to extract Iraq 's oil .

When Abraham Lincoln took actions based on military considerations , he gave himself the proper title , “ commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States . ”
That title is rarely — more like never — heard today .
It is just “ commander in chief , ” or even “ commander in chief of the United States . ”
This reflects the increasing militarization of our politics .
The citizenry at large is now thought of as under military discipline .
In wartime , it is true , people submit to the national leadership more than in peacetime .
The executive branch takes actions in secret , unaccountable to the electorate , to hide its moves from the enemy and protect national secrets .
Constitutional shortcuts are taken “ for the duration . ”
But those impositions are removed when normal life returns .
But we have not seen normal life in 66 years .
The wartime discipline imposed in 1941 has never been lifted , and “ the duration ” has become the norm .
World War II melded into the cold war , with greater secrecy than ever — more classified information , tougher security clearances .
And now the cold war has modulated into the war on terrorism .
There has never been an executive branch more fetishistic about secrecy than the Bush - Cheney one .
The secrecy has been used to throw a veil over detentions , “ renditions , ” suspension of the Geneva Conventions and of habeas corpus , torture and warrantless wiretaps .
We hear again the refrain so common in the other wars —
If you knew what we know , you would see how justified all our actions are .
But we can never know what they know .
We do not have sufficient clearance .
When Adm. William Crowe , the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , criticized the gulf war under the first President Bush , Secretary of State James Baker said that the admiral was not qualified to speak on the matter since he no longer had the clearance to read classified reports .
If he is not qualified , then no ordinary citizen is .
We must simply trust our lords and obey the commander in chief .
The glorification of the president as a war leader is registered in numerous and substantial executive aggrandizements ; but it is symbolized in other ways that , while small in themselves , dispose the citizenry to accept those aggrandizements .
We are reminded , for instance , of the expanded commander in chief status every time a modern president gets off the White House helicopter and returns the salute of marines .
DJ admits false tale about missing teen Aruba prosecutor says judge told son :
No body , no case RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Aruba Missing Persons or or Create Your Own PALM BEACH , Aruba ( CNN ) --
A disc jockey who spent 10 days in jail after being arrested and questioned about a missing American teenager admits he lied to Aruban police to protect one of the suspects in custody .
" I heard this guy talking on the phone at the Internet cafe , " Steve Croes said .
" So my story was like almost exactly as his . "
Croes was referring to Deepak Kalpoe , 21 , who originally said he and his brother Satish , 18 , and their friend Joran Van Der Sloot , 17 , drove Natalee Holloway back to the Holiday Inn the night of May 30 .
Croes told police he saw the young men drop Holloway off at the hotel .
" So that 's why they thought that maybe I was in it , " Croes told CNN Wednesday .
" But everything that I knew , I just hear it from his voice , when he was talking on the phone . "
Croes works on a party boat that docks about 1,000 feet from the Holiday Inn where Holloway was staying when she disappeared .
The Kalpoes later said they dropped Joran and Natalee off at a beach down the road .
When she disappeared , the 18 year old was celebrating her high school graduation in Aruba with about 100 classmates and several parent chaperones from Mountain Brook , Alabama , a suburb of Birmingham .
She was last seen leaving a nightclub with the Kalpoe brothers and Van Der Sloot .
They were arrested on June 9 and have been detained since .
No charges have been filed against the three , and their attorneys have said the men are innocent .
Police released Croes Monday after a judge ruled there was not enough evidence to hold him .
The DJ was arrested June 17 after at least one of the three still being held named him during questioning by authorities , officials said .
A hearing is scheduled early next week to determine whether the Kalpoe brothers and Van Der Sloot can be held for 60 more days .
Prosecutor : Van Der Sloots interfered Judge Paul Van Der Sloot , Joran 's father , was arrested a week ago , but was released a few days later .
Aruba 's chief prosecutor Karin Janssen told CNN Wednesday the elder Van Der Sloot told his son that without a body police would have no case .
Janssen said the judge made the comment " some days after " Holloway disappeared in a conversation with his son and the Kalpoes .
Investigators learned about his conversation with the three during questioning of one of the Kalpoe brothers , Janssen said , and when asked about the comment , the judge replied that he had been speaking about such a situation " generally . "
In addition , he and his wife , Anita , interfered in the case by asking a friend of their son what he had told police during questioning , Janssen said .
" That was not positive to the investigation , " she said .
CNN has tried unsuccessfully to contact the couple and attorneys representing the father and son .
The release of the elder Van Der Sloot was met with chagrin by Holloway 's family .
" He definitely , definitely has information that he needs to step forward and be the man that he is and disclose that information , " Holloway 's mother , Beth Twitty , told CNN .
Janssen said criticism of the way Aruban authorities have handled the case " is not justified . "
" We have a civilized society .
We have a decent law system .
We can't book people when we want ... [ like ] a bunch of cowboys , " she said .
" We have made some progress , and we are doing it in our way .
It is maybe not fast enough for a lot of people , but it is no grounds to have such criticism . "
The legal system in Aruba , an autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , is based partly on Dutch civil law .
Janssen said she thinks island police " are doing a hell of a job . "
The prosecutor said the investigation is being conducted around the three suspects in custody , " so we get a clear picture of where they were , and what has happened , and what happened to Natalee . "
She described the process as " millimeter work " going on " around the clock . "
" It 's a real puzzle , but we are getting the picture of the puzzle , I think , " she said .
Janssen said authorities in Aruba are working Holloway 's disappearance as a missing person 's case with the possibility of murder , although they have not definitively concluded that the teen is dead .
Mother : Time wasted Twitty , however , wonders how much time investigators lost checking out Croes ' story .
" I think that 's sad for him if that 's how it truly happened , " she said .
" I just do n't want to waste any more ... energy or focus on the wrong individuals . "
Croes said he lied to police because he thought he was helping Deepak stay out of trouble .
" If you were sitting in the cafe and heard the guy , you 'd think he was telling the truth , too , " Croes said .
Aruba on Thursday was awaiting the deployment of another contingent of Dutch Marines to assist with the search for Holloway .
The Netherlands agreed Wednesday to assign the Marines to the search , joining several hundred others stationed on the island who have been looking .
Also scouring the island is a team of search specialists that arrived last weekend .
The volunteer group , Texas EquuSearch , has sent some searchers home , as well as several cadaver dogs , but expects to have new volunteers arrive to continue the search .

Right after the debate , he said it on FOX News , talking about his angry response to Ron Paul blaming America for 9/11 .
From Hotline :
It reminded me of the Saudi prince that gave me the $ 10 million .
He did the same thing : “ This is America at fault , the way America has outreach to the world . ” …
I usually hear this on the Democratic side .
Do n’t usually hear it on the Republican side .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cGZgxkuuJU]
Really , Rudy ?
You usually hear Democrats saying 9/11 was our fault ?
Well , sure , I mean it was Bush ’s fault – you know , that old memo entitled “ Bin Laden Determined to Strike In US ” – but that ’s not what you meant .
You meant on a more visceral basic level that Ron Paul was saying that America deserved what it got on September 11 .
And you think you “ usually ” hear this from Democrats .
What Democrats have you heard saying that we deserved September 11 ?
That we ’re to blame for September 11 ?
The only person I know who said that is your Republican buddy Jerry Falwell , and oh yeah , religious right extremist Fred Phelps ( the guy who pickets American soldiers ’ funerals ) .
So tell us , Rudy , which Democrats “ usually ” blame America for September 11 ?
Or is this yet another lie that you ’ll flip - flop on by the next debate ?

Why do you sometimes shiver when you wee ?
Asked by John Rae of Clapham , United Kingdom
Shiver wee ?
This is not to be confused with chivalry ( the valorous qualities of a knight or gentleman ) or a shivaree ( a noisy mock serenade by friends of a newly wed couple ) .
This is a surprisingly commonly - asked Odd Body Question ( OBQ ) , and no research has been done on this topic .
Low room temperature as covered parts of the body are exposed could be an obvious cause .
More seriously , the shivering is an example of the human body 's autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) at work .
We are not conscious of the ANS .
It runs on automatic , hence its name , " autonomic " , which literally means " self controlling , working independently " .
The urination reflex is relayed through the ANS .
The reflex is directly related in strength to the amount of stretch of the bladder .
Thus , the degree of shivering is generally related to how full the bladder is at the time of urination .
The ANS has two divisions .
One is the parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) and the other is the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) .
The SNS tends to keep the bladder relaxed and the urethral sphincter contracted .
This is why one does not have an " accident " while one is concentrating on something else .
It is true to say that the more " desperate " one becomes in response to a bulging bladder , the more the SNS acts to keep you dry .
The SNS response includes the release by the brain of chemicals doadrenal medulla catacholamines epinephrine , norepinephrine , and dopamine to bring about the necessary body reactions .
When the opportunity arises to allow the parasympathetic side of the ANS to take over , the change in catacholamine production probably causes of the shivering .
Laboratory experiments which have not been undertaken would prove this beyond doubt .
In any case , at the moment of urination , there is a slight blood pressure rise and a momentary flushing or euphoria shortly after relaxing the urethral sphincter .
Some find this feeling pleasurable .
At such moments , some people say " ah " .
This same response in its most extreme forms causes fainting .
All of this is the ANS doing its job .

Who 's cruel idea was it for the word " lisp " to have a " s " in it ?
Sometime back in elementary school , I first asked teachers , " What happens when you divide infinity by 2 ? "
Some teachers could n't answer , and others told me , " It 's still infinity ! "
More recently , a couple of friends were discussing a similar question at lunch : " What happens when you add 1 to infinity ? "
Of course I said , " It 's still infinity ! " , but I could n't explain it much better than my school teachers ( at least not without using the word denumerable , which is a good way to ruin a lunch conversation ) .
And then tonight , while reading a paper about Haskell , I was hit by an evil idea :
When in doubt , ask the Haskell interpreter !
Step 1 : Counting
First , we need to teach Haskell about the natural numbers .
( Why not use Haskell 's built - in integers ?
Just humor the crazy programmer for a moment , OK ? )
A number is either zero , or the successor of another number .
We can write that in Haskell as :
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat deriving ( Show , Eq , Ord )
Math geeks in the audience will recognize this as the Peano arithmetic .
The " deriving " keyword tells Haskell to define show and the comparison operators for us .
Using this definition of Nat , we can now define some numbers :
one = Succ Zero two =
Succ one three =
Succ two four =
Succ three
These work the way you 'd expect :
* Main > three Succ ( Succ ( Succ Zero ) ) * Main > two < three True
OK , I threw in that last example just for fun .
Step 2 : Arithmetic
Adding 1 to a number is easy :
add1 n = Succ n
And sure enough , it works :
* Main > add1 two Succ ( Succ ( Succ Zero ) )
Doubling a number is a bit trickier .
We need to replace each Succ with Succ ( Succ ... ) , which we can do with a recursive function :
double Zero = Zero double ( Succ n ) = Succ ( Succ ( double n ) )
This gives us regular multiplication :
* Main > double two Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ Zero ) ) )
Dividing is trickier still , because we 're working with natural numbers , which means we 'll need to round down .
But other than that , it 's pretty much the opposite of multiplying :
divBy2 Zero = Zero divBy2 ( Succ Zero ) = Zero -- round !
divBy2 ( Succ ( Succ n ) ) = Succ ( divBy2 n )
Sure enough , this seems to work :
* Main > divBy2 four Succ ( Succ Zero )
Step 3 : Infinity
How should we define infinity ?
There 's several ways we could do it , but one way is particularly natural in this framework .
Infinity is basically Succ followed by an infinite number of other Succ values .
So let 's do something evil to Haskell * :
infinity = Succ infinity
If we type this into the listener , something entertaining happens :
* Main > infinity Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ
Haskell will happily keep printing this until we hit Control - C .
Step 4 : Arithmetic with infinity
What happens if we add 1 to infinity ?
add1 infinity {-
By the definition of add1 -} = Succ infinity {-
By the definition of infinity -} = infinity
And sure enough , add1 infinity is just another infinite list of Succ :
* Main > add1 infinity Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ
We need to hit Control - C again .
Now , to answer our original question , what do we get when we divide infinity by 2 ?
* Main > divBy2 infinity Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ ( Succ
Well , that looks like infinity to me !
Now , infinity is a subtle concept , and if had we used different definitions , we might have gotten a different result .
You 'd have to ask somebody who knows more math than I do ( or check Wikipedia ) .
And finally , some questions for mathematically sophisticated readers :
Is it reasonable to define infinity this way , assuming we 're in category CPO ?
Is it possible to represent any other ( more interesting and / or more correct ) definitions of infinity in Haskell ?
What 's the best way to think about the infinite ordinals ?

Update
The Court of Appeals has refused Vonage 's request for a new trial but has ruled that the VoIP provider can bring up the recent KSR v. Teleflex ruling as part of its appeal of the jury 's finding of patent infringement .
" Although we 're disappointed that the appeals court denied our request for a retrial , this ruling has no impact on our appeal , which continues to move forward , " said a Vonage spokesperson .
Original story
Following Monday 's Supreme Court ruling in KSR v. Teleflex , VoIP provider Vonage has asked the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to vacate a lower court judgment that it infringed on three Verizon patents .
Vonage is asking for a retrial of the case that will take into account the Supreme Court 's latest guidance on patent obviousness .
Ars recently looked at the three Verizon patents and we were n't terribly impressed .
From Tim Lee 's article :
In short , the " invention " described in these patents is combination of an excruciatingly obvious point — that it would be helpful for an Internet telephony application to have a mechanism for translating between phone numbers and IP addresses — and a series of " enhancements " to DNS servers that many network engineers would regard as a step backwards .
The key here is " excruciatingly obvious . "
That 's exactly what the Supreme Court faulted the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in KSR v. Telefex .
Writing for a unanimous court , Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled that " The results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws .
Were it otherwise , patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts . "
Vonage is hopeful that the Supreme Court 's ruling will help its case .
" We are very encouraged by the Supreme Court 's decision and the giant step it represents towards achieving much - needed patent reform in this country , " said Vonage interim CEO Jeffrey Citron .
" The Supreme Court 's decision should have positive implications for Vonage and our pending patent litigation with Verizon .
We are also hopeful that this case will protect legitimate innovators and the value of their inventions , unlock the innovation process , and provide that companies are better able to conduct business without the encumbrance of meritless patent claims . "
Verizon disagrees with Vonage 's take on the ruling .
A Verizon spokesperson said that the company believes that there is " no merit " to Vonage 's latest filing , saying that the particulars of the KSR v. Teleflex case were " entirely different " than Verizon v. Vonage .
The telecom has already filed a reply opposing Vonage 's motion .
Vonage 's very survival is riding on its ability to convince the Court of Appeals that the lower court erred in its $ 58 million award .
The trial judge also issued an injunction barring Vonage from signing up new customers , but the Court of Appeals has issued a permanent stay of that order pending the outcome of the appeal .
According to two indectments served Monday , millions of shekels have been transferred from a Saudi organization to Hamas operatives in Jerusalem .
The money was received as charity although , in reality , it was earmarked for terrorist activities .
Following a request from the Jerusalem prosecutor 's office , details of the affair were released for publication Monday after the Shin Bet and Police investigation was concluded .
Two indictments were served on members of the organizations involved for breaking the law that prohibits funding terrorism .
The millions of shekels were received from the Charity Coalition – an umbrella organization that encompasses Hamas charitable societies in Saudi Arabia .
The money was transferred to non-profit organizations in the A - Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem to conceal its final destination – the Hamas movement in the city .
Indictments were served
The first indictment accuses four officials in the A - Ram Charity Committee of receiving the monies from the Charity Coalition despite the fact that the organization had been outlawed .
They will stand trial for channeling money to the Hamas .
Three of the defendants are East - Jerusalem residents while the fourth is a Jenin resident .
According to the second indictment , three other East Jerusalem residents are accused of being members of Hamas and involved in terrorist activities , as part of the Izz - al - Din al - Qassam Brigades infrastructure , and in civilian activities through the charities .
The indictment also said that schools and religious institutes under the influence of these organizations teach incitement against Israel and encourage terrorism against the State and citizens of Israel .
The organizations also support families of known terrorists and those in prison or detention .
According to the indictment , NIS 1 million was transferred in the past year .

PLT Scheme provides a graphical toolkit for implementing GUIs called MrEd .
At least on Windows , the result looks like a native application and was used to implement the IDE , DrScheme .
As usual , the documentation is excellent .
When an application is running , it can be useful for it to output diagnostics that report on what it is currently doing , e.g. which database it connected to , or the id of a transaction that may have failed .
This is normally output to a file , but it can also copy the output to a logging window , e.g. the Transcripter in Squeak , or the Java Web Start Console .
How easy is it to implement a simple transcripter in PLT Scheme ?
As usual , it is a good idea to decide on your API first as encapsulating everything behind an API means that we can easily change the implementation later on .
I will simply provide a function ( log s ) where s is a string but you would probably want to have various logging levels which can be enabled or disabled at runtime .
( require ( lib " 42.ss " " srfi " ) ) ;;
First of all , create a text area inside a window ( frame ) ( define * frame * ( instantiate frame % ( " Transcript " ) ) ) ( define * text * ( instantiate text - field % ( ) ( label " " ) ( style '( multiple ) ) ( parent * frame * ) ) ) ;;
We need the editor belonging to the text area in order to append text to it ( define * editor * ( send * text * get- editor ) ) ;;
The ' API ' for accessing the Transcripter ;;
This is a somewhat unrealistic implementation , but good enough for a quick example ( define ( log s ) ( send * editor * insert s ) ) ;;
A test method , displaying 200 numbers on the transcripter ;; - this is the same as we did in Squeak ( define ( 200 - nums ) ( time ( do-ec ( : range i 1 201 ) ( log ( string - append ( number - > string i ) " n " ) ) ) ) ) ( instantiate button % ( ) ( label " Execute " ) ( parent * frame * ) ( callback ( lambda ( button event ) ( 200 - nums ) ) ) ) ( send * frame * show # t )
A couple of things .
First of all , performance :
When I ran this initially , the display numbers test took ~ 60 ms .
However , when I expanded the Transcripter window to a reasonable size , it took ~ 2000 ms ( 2 seconds ! )
When I retried the same in Squeak it took around 5700ms although I ’m certain it had earlier taken more than 10 seconds .
This is a different computer and a different image but maybe the Squeak Transcripter is n’t so bad after all .
Secondly , it was fairly straight - forward to construct the GUI .
Of course , such a simple example does n’t really give any idea how hard it is to use MrEd to create moderately complex GUIs , but the existence of DrScheme indicates that it is at least possible .
Railway safety is often criticised
Rather than face the prospect of scores of frustrated passengers launching a chorus of complaints , the driver instead asked them to get out and push .
Many chose to get out of their seats and do just that , officials say .
It took them more than half an hour to move the electric train 12ft ( 4 m ) so that it touched live overhead wires and was able to resume its journey .
Momentum
" In so many years of service in the railways , I have never come across such a bizarre incident , " Deepak Kumar Jha , a spokesman for Indian Railways , told the Reuters news agency .
Trains carry a huge number of people in India
Officials say the extraordinary display of passenger power occurred on Tuesday in the eastern state of Bihar after a passenger pulled the train 's emergency chain , bringing it to a halt in a " neutral zone " .
This is a short length of track where there is no power in the overhead wires .
Correspondents say that a train 's momentum usually allows it to continue moving through neutral zones .
You 've reached something that 's archived .

Nothing , it seems , can stop the mud .
For more than three months , the hot , noxious goop has spewed up through a crack in the earth at a natural - gas exploration site , swamping everything in its path .
The expanding , surreal gray lake with the stench of rotten eggs has enveloped more than 10 square miles of land in eastern Java , Indonesia ’s most densely populated island .
The flow has forced 8,000 to 10,000 people from their homes , engulfed about a dozen factories , contaminated fish farms and intermittently closed a major highway .
Confusion has reigned over how to stop it .
An effort to drill a series of relief wells was slow to begin and has thus far failed .
With the mud continuing to gush , emergency crews have scrambled to put up earthen barriers to contain and redirect the flow away from villages .
Some of the dams already have been breached , and officials are running out of space .

In a country reeling from a string of natural disasters , this man-made fiasco has thrown a fresh , harsh light on an overwhelmed government struggling to counter accusations of corruption and ineptitude .
Nerves have frayed over the slow and uneven response to the crisis by government agencies and Lapindo Brantas , the politically connected company with a controlling stake in the exploration project .
Frustration spilled over last week when displaced villagers set fire to a camp of tents used by Lapindo workers .
Suyati , who , like many Indonesians , uses one name , watched anxiously for weeks as one of the barriers held the mud at bay -- temporarily .
“ It flew very fast , like a tsunami , ” said Suyati , 57 , recalling the day last month when the pent - up mud surged though the barrier .

“ I was scared and I ran with my sick husband .
My son and I had to carry him , because my husband is paralyzed .
The mud was behind us ....
It was hot and smelled very bad .
We ran to the mosque , but the mud was very fast .
All of a sudden it was up to my waist . ”
It is unclear what went wrong during the drilling of a 2 - mile - deep exploration well .
Several environmental and community groups have accused the company of shoddy work and lax oversight , saying a protective lining that could have prevented the disaster was not properly in place .
Company officials initially suggested the mudflow had resulted from an earthquake days before , but quickly abandoned the idea .
The company has since taken responsibility for the damage but wo n’t say what caused it , citing a police investigation .
Advertisement
The disaster , and the government ’s inability to cope with it , have angered residents .
Their frustration has deepened with reports that Aburizal Bakrie , the government minister responsible for coordinating responses to natural and man-made disasters , owns a stake in the gas exploration project .
Adang Setiana , a deputy to Bakrie , said the government ’s response had not been influenced by the minister ’s connections .
Bakrie is one of the country ’s wealthiest men .
At the shore of the mud lake , white smoke billows ominously .
Large bubbles burp at the center , marking the roughly 50 - foot - wide crack , where temperatures reach about 140 degrees .
Only rooftops and the tips of denuded trees poke above the surface of the mud , which is 20 feet deep in places .
Tests have found elevated levels of phenol , which can irritate human skin and cause breathing discomfort , according to a report by WALHI , a leading environmental group .
There have been no reports of hospitalizations , although two people have died in accidents related to the mudflow : an emergency crew member reportedly caught in an explosion of a pent - up gas deposit and another run over by a bulldozer .

Most of the people whose houses have been inundated have taken refuge in the dreary storefronts of a recently built market , uncertain whether they will be able to return home .
On a recent sweltering afternoon , a neighbor of Suyati’s , Rois Haryanto , was trying to clear knee - high mud from his front yard while four young men he had hired worked inside .
On the white wall of his home , Haryanto , 47 , had scrawled , “ Beware of Lapindo ’s henchmen . ”
“ I saw them on TV promising that they will reimburse everything , every little thing , ” he said angrily .
“ They promised that .
That is why I still live here , with the mud .
I do n’t want to go to the [ market ] .
This is my house , and I want them to see that . ”
Rawindra , a regional manager for Lapindo , said the company had been paying displaced residents about $ 35 a month for living expenses , while also offering about $ 550 to families to cover two years ’ rent and to purchase their homes from them .
Many villagers , however , are reluctant to abandon the idea of going home .
Advertisement
“ It would be easier if everybody agrees , but people have different ideas , ” Rawindra said .
“ Some are still convinced that they can stay at their homes , so we cannot ask them to sell their houses -- even if it ’s under the mud . ”
The offer to buy homes has stoked the suspicions of some .
They accuse Lapindo of trying to acquire the land cheaply to exploit it for the large natural gas field that is thought to lie beneath .
Energy exploration is a major industry in Indonesia .
Amid declining output from many of the country ’s older oil fields , the world ’s energy giants are investing heavily here to find new oil and natural gas deposits .
A steady stream of elected officials , including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , has visited in an effort to ease tensions and show the government ’s commitment to stopping the mud .
Advertisement
The public relations bid , however , has failed , with Cabinet ministers clashing publicly over a contentious plan to build water treatment plants and several miles of pipelines to drain the lake into the ocean .
The whispers about possible corruption have been an added setback for Yudhoyono , who has made combating graft a focus of his first term .
Despite his efforts , surveys by the World Bank and Transparency International , a German - based corruption - monitoring group , have ranked Indonesia near the bottom .
Meanwhile , the mudflow continues .
The chief of one flooded village recently offered a free house to anyone who could use magic to stop the flow .
More than 60 people from around the country have tried , the chief said , but no one has succeeded .

In the not - too - distant future , police may request a warrant to search your brain .
This was said only partly in jest by one of the panelists at a Feb. 2 symposium , " Is There Science Underlying Truth Detection ? " sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
The symposium explored whether functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which images brain regions at work , can detect lying .
" There are some bold claims regarding the potential to use functional MRI to detect deception , so it 's important to learn what is known about the science , " said Emilio Bizzi , president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , an investigator at MIT 's McGovern Institute for Brain Research and one of the organizers of the event .
The criminal justice system , counter - terrorists and even parents of adolescents would potentially benefit from accurate lie detection , but the risks and costs could be enormous , said panelist Henry Greely , professor of law and genetics at Stanford University .
" Lie detection is being sold today and may well be being used today by our government here and overseas , " he said .
" There is little to no regulation of this technology . "
At least two start - up companies claim to be able to use fMRI to detect deception .
The companies plan to market their services to law enforcement and immigration agencies , the military , counterintelligence groups , foreign governments and corporations that want to screen applicants .
Not so fast , said panelist Nancy Kanwisher , the Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and an investigator at the McGovern Institute .
While her own research shows that you can accurately predict from fMRI data whether a person is thinking about a place or a face , Kanwisher thinks that neither the technology nor our understanding of the brain is sufficiently advanced to tell when a person is lying .
advertisement
In 2005 , two separate teams of researchers announced that their algorithms had been able to reliably identify " neural signatures " that indicated when a subject was lying .
But the research , conducted on only a handful of subjects , was flawed , Kanwisher said .
Subjects were asked to lie about whether they were holding a certain card or whether they had " stolen " certain items .
These are not actually lies , she pointed out , because subjects were asked to make such statements .
" What does this have to do with real - world lie detection ?
Making a false response when instructed is n't a lie .
" In the real world , the stakes are higher .
If a subject believes the fMRI could be used against him or send him to prison , this would cause extreme anxiety whether the individual is guilty or not guilty , " potentially influencing their patterns of brain activity , she said .
In addition , the subject may not want to cooperate .
" FMRI results are garbage if the subject is moving even a little bit .
A subject can completely mess up the data by moving his tongue in his mouth or performing mental arithmetic , " she said .
Testing also poses problems .
To ensure accurate results , fMRIs would have to be tested on a wide variety of people , some guilty and some innocent , and they would need to believe that the data would have real consequences on their lives .
The work would need to published in peer - reviewed journals and replicated without conflicts of interest .
In short , Kaniwsher said , " There 's no compelling evidence fMRIs will work for lie detection in the real world . "
On one of the two panels , Marcus E. Raichle , a professor at Washington University School of Medicine , said that fMRI has been put forward as a more accurate version of the polygraph test .
But Raichle , who contributed to a 2003 National Academy of Sciences report on the polygraph , said he hopes proponents of fMRI deception testing wo n't " make the same mistakes and fall in the same traps that the polygraph has fallen in , " he said .
advertisement
The polygraph , which measures lie- associated stress through accelerated heart rate , rapid breathing , rising blood pressure and increased sweating , is considered unreliable in scientific circles .
Sociopaths who do n't feel guilt and people who learn to inhibit their reactions to stress can outwit a polygraph , and negative results can often be attributed to coercion by the administrator .
Nevertheless , polygraphs are given to more than 40,000 people a year by the federal government and employers .
The polygraph has been evaluated in " poorly controlled studies with little testing of its validity .
It is unacceptable for this kind of screening , " Raichle said .
" We do need better ways to screen for deception and truth telling . "
Panelist Elizabeth Phelps , professor of psychology and neural science at New York University , said fMRI is not likely to provide a more accurate screen .
Regions of the brain dedicated to forming and retrieving memories can't tell imagined memories from real occurrences .
" We may not be able to differentiate those things that are imagined or rehearsed from what actually happened , " she said .
The United States should ban any use of a lie detection method until it is deemed safe and effective to the satisfaction of a watchdog government agency such as the Food and Drug Administration , Greely said .
" We need a consciously well thought - out federal statute saying no lie detection technique may be used unless proven safe and effective in a variety of ways -- with trials of thousands of people , not 35 to 65 people .
This includes tests on mentally ill people , nondepressives , people who have had a drink , people who have not had a drink .
We need broad tests on broad numbers of people and broad sorts of lies .
We need to act today to begin to ban " anything short of such a product , Greely said .
Panelist Jed Rakoff , a United States district judge in New York , said that eventually , neuroscience may have a significant impact on the legal system , but in the immediate future , it 's " much more likely to cause mischief than be of real help . "
While as many as 90 percent of witnesses lie , the current method of cross examination as a lie-detection tool is considered effective .
And fMRI could do little to ferret out what Rakoff said is the " biggest form of lying - - omission .
The practiced liar does n't tell falsehoods , just omits key facts that would give a different spin . "
MY WIFE AND I just had an abortion .
Two , actually .
We walked into a doctor ’s office in downtown Los Angeles with four thriving fetuses — two girls and two boys — and walked out an hour later with just the girls , whom we will name , if we ’re lucky enough to keep them , Rosalind and Vivian .
Rosalind is my mother ’s name .
We did n’t want to .
We did n’t mean to .
We did n’t do anything wrong , which is to say , we did everything right .
Four years ago , when Tina and I set out on this journey to have children , such a circumstance was unimaginable .
And yet there I was , holding her hand , watching the ultrasound as a needle with potassium chloride found its mark , stopping the heart of one male fetus , then the other , hidden in my wife ’s suffering belly .
We do n’t feel guilty .
We do n’t feel ashamed .
We ’re not even really sad , because terminating these fetuses — at 15 weeks ’ gestation — was a medical imperative .
This has been a white - knuckle pregnancy from Day 1 , and had it gone on as it was going , Tina ’s health would have been in jeopardy , according to her doctor .
The fact is , multiple pregnancies are high risk , and they can go bad very suddenly .
I was n’t going to allow that , though the fires of hell might beckon .
In the midst of this experience , practically on the eve of our procedure , the U.S. Supreme Court announced its ruling in Gonzales vs. Carhart , upholding the federal ban on a rare obstetrical procedure called intact dilation and extraction , or intact D&E , also known as “ partial - birth ” abortion .
The decision is a watershed in abortion law , the first ban on a particular abortion procedure since 1973 ’s Roe vs.
Wade , and the first restriction on abortion to be approved by the court that does not include an exception for the health of the mother .
Antiabortion activists were jubilant and immediately began talking about plans for state - by - state campaigns to restrict , and eventually rescind , access to abortion generally .
For the first time in a long time , such talk did n’t seem like wishful thinking .
I was stunned .
Events in Washington that I had once followed with purely newsy and academic interest — the recent appointment of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. , and the fate of Roe — suddenly struck home in the most personal way possible .
I mean , my wife and I have always been pro-choice , but we never expected to actually confront the Choice .
After all , we ’ve been trying like crazy to have children .
We had already undergone two in - vitro fertilization procedures before this last time , when we put back five embryos , despairing that any would take .
Beforehand , the fertility specialist asked us if we were OK with “ reduction ” — also known as selective abortion — in the event that too many took hold .
We said yes , not really appreciating what that meant .
To our delight , four set up residence .
Our initial joy , however , was tempered by the realization that we would have to lose two to keep two .
For the last couple of months , Tina and I have discussed our options with our doctors , gradually wrapping our heads around this personal and private decision — only to have the government invite itself to the conference at the eleventh hour .
To be clear , the procedure banned by the court last month — intact D&E — was not an option in our case .
But it does n’t take much foresight to see how the court ’s decision could have huge consequences for fertility and reproductive medicine .
For instance , the case upheld a ban on a midterm abortion procedure — that is , one that takes place between 12 and 28 weeks .
If the government begins to foreclose obstetrical options in the midterm , it will tie the hands of family health doctors in unexpected and dramatic ways .
Take our case .
As soon as we found out at about four weeks that we had too many fetuses , we wanted to undergo the reduction procedure .
But our doctor told us to wait to see if the number would reduce on its own , as often happens .
Then , at about 12 weeks , we underwent a type of genetic testing ( chorionic villus sampling , similar to amniocentesis ) , reasoning that if we had to abort two , it would be better to abort any fetuses with genetic abnormalities .
The results took two weeks to get back , and by that time Tina was experiencing complications so severe that we had to put her in the hospital .
The whole time , an awful clock was ticking .
Amniocentesis testing — which involves extracting fluid from the placenta — is usually performed between 15 and 20 weeks .
That ’s solidly in the second trimester as well .
If midterm abortions are banned , what will the state tell parents confronting the agony of a fetus with severe abnormalities ?
Would it oblige them to carry through with the pregnancy against their will ?
Would it — as proposed by South Carolina ’s pending “ ultrasound ” legislation — require women to look at pictures of their fetuses in an attempt to impress on them the humanity of the fetus they are aborting ?
Believe me , they know .
We got a sense of this kind of heavy - handed paternalism in Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s majority opinion in Gonzales vs. Carhart , in which he asserted that the ban would ultimately be good for women , who would be spared the mental and moral trauma of the procedure .
If only women and their doctors were as smart as Congress .
The court ’s ruling upholds the Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 , which declares the intact D&E — in which the fetus is partially extracted from the uterus before being dispatched with an aspirating needle , scissors or forceps — to be “ gruesome and inhumane . ”
But the truth is , there is no such thing as a pretty abortion .
The alternatives to intact D&E are no less grim .
Is grasping and dismembering the fetus in utero with forceps ( as opposed to after a partial extraction ) or injecting it with heart - stopping chemicals and then delivering the stillbirth any less repellent ?
Gruesomeness is no standard at all .
Removing the organs from a brain - dead teenager is gruesome , yet we do it to preserve the life of an organ recipient .
The point is , sometimes it ’s necessary .
Americans need to be careful what they wish for .
I think antiabortion advocates imagine a world in which women — promiscuous , lazy or selfish singletons — roll into the doctor ’s office for midterm abortions and stick their feet in the stirrups while still chatting on the cellphone .
Recreational abortions , you might say .
But in the real world , that ’s not how it happens .
Virtually no one takes the matter lightly .
I would also point out that even the most fervent abortion opponents may one day find themselves suffering from infertility and may rue supporting the court ’s from - the - bench obstetrics .
Some wanted to know how we decided to keep the girls .
Partly , it was a matter of how the fetuses were arranged .
Partly , it had to do with other factors .
Some studies show offspring of older fathers ( I ’m 47 ) run a higher risk of autism , and males are four times as likely to be autistic .
Still , I had reservations about bringing girls into the world now , when forces seemed to be aligning to disenfranchise them ( nine of 10 GOP presidential candidates favor reversing Roe vs. Wade ) .
I hate to think my girls will have to fight the battles their mothers and grandmothers fought .
I feel sorriest for our doctors .
The three we have seen are all extraordinary people , deeply compassionate , superbly trained .
All are parents .
All regard abortion with the greatest gravity .
And yet they are obliged to be circumspect , if not downright fearful .
And who can blame them ?
The physician who performed our reduction asked that her name not be used , for fear that she might be terrorized by some gun-toting antiabortion extremist .
For our part , we are grateful that she was out there .
Without her , we would n’t have been able to have a family .
When Roz and Viv grow up , I hope one day I can introduce them to her .
I think she ’d be proud .

Alabama site classifies environmental activists , gay rights supporters as possible terrorists RAW STORY
Published : Sunday May 27 , 2007 Print This Email This The Alabama Department of Homeland Security has taken down a webpage that listed environmental , anti-war , and gay rights groups as possible terrorists , according to a report from the Associated Press .
" The director of the department , Jim Walker , said his agency received a number of calls and e-mails from people who said they felt the site unfairly targeted certain people just because of their beliefs , " the AP reported .
" He said he plans to put the Web site back on the Internet , but will no longer identify specific types of groups . "
The site described the various groups as " single - issue terrorists " who include " people who feel they are trying to create a better world . "
Excerpts : # Howard Bayliss , chairman of the gay and lesbian advocacy group Equality Alabama , said he does n't understand why gay rights advocates would be on the list .
" Our group has only had peaceful demonstrations .
I 'm deeply concerned we 've been profiled in this discriminatory matter , " Bayliss said .
The site included the groups under a description of what it called " single - issue " terrorists .
That group includes people who feel they are trying to create a better world , the Web site said .
It said that in some communities , law enforcement officers consider certain single issue groups to be a threat .
" Single - issue extremists often focus on issues that are important to all of us .
However , they have no problem crossing the line between legal protest and ... illegal acts , to include even murder , to succeed in their goals , " it read .
Walker said the site had been up since spring 2004 , and had gotten a relatively small number of hits until it recently became the subject of blogs , he said .

A seventh - grade geography teacher who refused to remove Chinese , Mexican and United Nations flags from his classroom was placed on paid administrative leave Wednesday by Jefferson County officials who were concerned that the display violates the law .
District officials said state law forbids the display of foreign flags unless they are temporary and related to the curriculum .
Carmody Middle School principal John Schalk looked at the curriculum for Eric Hamlin ’s world geography class “ and there was nothing … related to any of these countries , ” said Lynn Setzer , district spokeswoman .
She said Schalk asked the teacher three times to remove the flags and warned there would be consequences , but Hamlin refused .
Hamlin , in his first year at Carmody , said he regularly displays flags from different countries , rotating them out based on countries being studied .
He said that the first six weeks of school are devoted to discussing the “ fundamentals of geography ” and that the flags were randomly selected .
District officials are citing Colorado Revised Statute 18 - 11 - 205 .
It says : “ Any person who displays any flag other than the flag of the United States of America or the state of Colorado or any of its subdivisions , agencies or institutions upon any state , county , municipal or other public building or adjacent grounds within this state commits a class 1 petty offense . ”
It says an exception to that law is “ the display of any flag … that is part of a temporary display of any instructional or historical materials not permanently affixed or attached to any part of the buildings … . ”
Mark Silverstein , an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union , said he did n’t see how the statute applied to this situation .
District Superintendent Cindy Stevenson said the district has contacted Hamlin and is trying to resolve the issue .
“ We have not heard back , ” she said .
She said Hamlin could have complied with the principal ’s request and then followed policies that allow him to appeal .
Schalk did not return a phone call seeking comment , but Stevenson said the current topic for the class was “ latitude and longitude , not the culture of China , not the culture of Mexico . ”
The punishment for insubordination could range from a reprimand to dismissal , Setzer said .
Hamlin said he was in his classroom Monday when an assistant principal came in , saw the flags and told him they needed to be removed .
Hamlin said there is an American flag stationed permanently in the classroom .
He said he believes school officials are being extra cautious because of a controversy at Denver ’s North High School when a Mexican flag was hung by a social studies teacher and people complained .

I have always been curious about Sonia Greene , the woman who married H.P. Lovecraft .
She supported Lovecraft financially for several years , and famously described him as " an adequately excellent lover " who never told her that he loved her .
A few years earlier , she had dated Alistair Crowley so she must have had a taste for morose men obsessed with the supernatural .
Even more surprising for the Lovecraft fan is that Greene was a Jewish immigrant , a category of person whom Lovecraft often blamed for the downfall of his beloved " chalk - white " civilization .
According to Lovecraft 's obsessive biographer S.T. Joshi , Greene was herself a writer ( she published a story called " The Invisible Monster " and was president of the United Amateur Press Association for a while ) .
She had a daughter from her first husband , Florence Carol , who became a successful journalist after having a falling - out with Greene .
The two women never spoke again after H.P. Lovecraft came to New York to live with his new bride .
Unlike many women of her era , Greene was independently middle - class .
She worked as a milliner – a hat - designer – at a posh department store and frequently traveled for her job .
Her salary allowed her to rent a nice house for herself and her daughter in the then - fancy area of Brooklyn known as Flatbush .
It also allowed her to donate money to several amateur press publications , as well as to travel to amateur press conventions ( basically proto - science fiction conventions ) .
She met Lovecraft at one such convention , and got to know him better by traveling up to his beloved Providence to see him .
She also helped him visit her in New York by paying his way .
More on Greene after the jump . . .
The couple had married in 1924 , after a strange two - year courtship in which Lovecraft confessed to Greene that she was the only woman who had ever kissed him in his adult life .
Apparently his mother and aunts , with whom he was very close , did n't believe in displays of affection .
When Greene and their other amateur press pals walked around New York with Lovecraft , he constantly became enraged by the immigrants he saw ( see " The Horror at Red Hook " for a taste of Lovecraftian racism ) .
Sometimes , he would insist that they walk down the center of a street so that he would n't have to share a sidewalk with " mongerels . "
Greene told a biographer later that she kept reminding Lovecraft about her own background , but it did n't seem to dissuade him from his fear of Jews and other immigrants .
What the hell did Greene see in this guy ?
We 'll never truly know because she burned all his letters after divorcing him and moving away from New York in 1926 .
We do know that she fell in love with him because she enjoyed his mind , and their daily correspondence via post .
Some of his letters to her , she said later , were as many as twenty pages long .
It sounds a lot like a steampunk version of an online romance .
The first few months after they married , they were apparently happy .
They spent a lot of time talking philosophy and hanging out with their amateur press geek friends .
But then Greene decided to open her own millinery business and it failed .
This meant she had to take a job that required a lot of traveling , much like her last job .
Also , I suspect , Lovecraft 's incessant whininess , anti-Semitism , and general uselessness started driving her nuts .
In the last year or so of their marriage , Greene lived on the road , traveling for her job .
She sent Lovecraft a weekly allowance that helped him pay for a tiny flat in the then - working class Brooklyn Heights .
Greene slept there one or two days out of the month .
During this time , Lovecraft claimed in letters that he was so poor that he lived for three days on one loaf of bread , one can of cold beans , and a hunk of cheese .
But he never managed to get a job .
He was essentially a house husband who occasionally sold a short story to Weird Tales .
Little is known about Greene 's life after she left Lovecraft .
Apparently this fascinating woman , a pioneer in both business and the writing world , was deemed so unimportant that the Wikipedians deleted her entry on Wikipedia – now " Sonia Greene " redirects to " H.P. Lovecraft . "
Talk about a slap in the face .
As if she had n't taken enough crap from Lovecraft in life , now she 's doomed to spend eternity as a footnote in the life of a man who took her money and disparaged her heritage .
It almost sounds like a Lovecraft story .
Except it 's real .
For more information about Sonia Greene , you can pore over S.T. Joshi's Lovecraft : A Life .
Or you can revive the Wikipedia entry about her and help this cool woman reclaim her place in the history of amateur fiction .

Chris Moukarbel , a New York artist who was sued by Paramount Pictures over a 12 - minute video based on a bootleg Oliver Stone film script about 9/11 , has another video in a New York gallery exhibition that seeks to marry politics and art .
This one was created from film shot in the process of making the video that led to the lawsuit .
Paramount filed suit in United States District Court in Washington last month saying that Mr. Moukarbel 's original video , " World Trade Center 2006 , " infringed on the copyright of the screenplay for Mr. Stone 's $ 60 million film " World Trade Center , " scheduled for release in August .
" I 'm interested in memorial and the way Hollywood represents historical events , " Mr. Moukarbel said in an interview yesterday , the day after his new video was shown as part of the group exhibition " Data Mining " at Wallspace , a Manhattan gallery .
" Through their access and budget they 're able to affect a lot of people 's ideas about an event and also affect policy .
I was deliberately using their script and pre-empting their release to make a statement about power . "
" My film was offered free on the Internet , " he said of " World Trade Center 2006 . "
" It cost $ 1,000 to produce .
We 're at a place now where technology allows the democratization of storytelling . "
Suddenly , the man on the left seems more attractive ( Image : Ben Jones et al )
It is a classic image : a group of young women sighing over the latest heartthrob .
But do they all really share identical taste for , say , Brad Pitt , or that cute guy in physics class ?
A new study suggests that , in fact , women will look more favourably on the men that other women find attractive .
Female guppies , quail and finches tend to mate with males that look like the males they have seen other females paired with .
Such “ mate choice copying ” can pay off .
If it is difficult to choose the best mating material , or takes a lot of time and energy , it makes sense to go with what works for the other girls .
Yet although human mate selection suffers just such difficulties , there has been little evidence that women do this , until now .

Ben Jones at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland , and colleagues , showed 28 men and 28 women pairs of male faces and asked them to rate their attractiveness .
The photos had been already been rated by 40 women as of about equal attractiveness .
Striking difference
The researchers then showed the same faces alongside a third photo of a female face in profile , positioned so she was looking at one of them , and smiling – or not .
The viewers were asked to grade the faces again .
Women found the men who were being smiled at suddenly more attractive , while men who apparently elicited no such smiling approval were pronounced less attractive .
Men , meanwhile , behaved in a strikingly different manner .
They rated men who had been smiled at as less attractive .
“ Within - sex competition promotes negative attitudes towards men who are the target of positive social interest from women , ” the researchers conclude .
Or to put it another way , the next time you hear a man say “ I do n’t know what she sees in him ” , remember the fact she ’s sees anything at all may be off - putting enough

Officials at the CIA and scientists around the world have pondered the " cocktail party problem " for decades .
How could they separate one sound - perhaps a voice - from a group of other recorded sounds , perhaps a multitude of voices at a cocktail party ?
Now , two researchers at the University of Missouri - Columbia have found a mathematical solution to this problem .
" Theoretically , our solution says you should be able to pick up voices on a squeaky old microphone and then separate them all out so that you can hear what each person is saying in his or her own voice , " said Peter Casazza , professor of mathematics in MU 's College of Arts and Science .
" This is a very old problem , and we have the first mathematical solution to it . "
Casazza and Dan Edidin , also a professor of mathematics at MU , worked with Radu Balan of Siemens Corporate Research to solve the problem .
Their solution shows that it is possible to separate voices and still retain vocal characteristics .
Researchers had previously found a solution for separating and reconstructing voices , but they were only able to reconstruct the words spoken , not the characteristics of the voice itself .
" Our solution is called ' signal reconstruction without noisy phase , ' " Edidin said .
" In speech recognition technology , a ' signal ' could be a recording of 25 people in a room talking at the same time .
Our solution shows that we can pull out each voice individually , not just with the words , but with the voice characteristics of each individual .
We showed that this ' cocktail party problem ' is mathematically solvable . "
Although Casazza , Edidin and Balan do not have a computer program that can do this automatically , they hope to find a way to develop one .
Currently , their solution runs on a computer , but the process cannot be easily replicated or distributed .
" The computer we use is doing the work without an algorithmic program .
It uses a system called a neural net , which is designed for the computer to teach itself .
Basically , it works on trial and error , " Casazza said .
" This is n't consistent and can not be duplicated easily .
We need to find a way to design an implementable algorithm that could do this consistently and quickly . "
Casazza said that there are already programs that can separate and reconstruct voices , but they are not completely reliable .
For example , such programs have difficulty separating voices with similar pitch characteristics .
A program using the researchers ' solution would be more exact .

I think that it can almost be stated as a fact that concurrency in languages that were n't designed with concurrency in mind tends to be poor .
The languages I have in mind here are Python , C , C++ and similar .
I have come across a few people who disagree with this statement however after questioning I have found that they have A )
Not done much of anything complex with threads B ) Never used a concurrently oriented language .
Needless to say , I do n't take their opinion very seriously .
Now , obviously , you can take the time to write an application that uses threads and works well .
But , with enough time , you can do just about anything , and in the time it takes to make that application one can deffinatly develope an equivalent program faster in concurrent orientated ( CO ) language .
Because writting decent threaded applications in other languages is so difficult there are a number of frameworks available that try to make it easier to write applications in a single thread .
One of the reasons I think these frameworks will fail in comparison to a language such as Erlang for most developers is the amount of work it takes to integrate other libraries into it .
For anyone that has used a framework such as Twisted , they have probably run into a situation where they have a third party library they want to use however the problem is , it blocks .
For an asynchornous framework this is murder .
So one has two choices .
Either to run the third party library in its own thread .
Obviously this is generally not what we want to do since the whole point of using the framework is to avoid threads .
The other solution is to rewrite the library to integrate it into the frameworks event loop .
Depending on the situation , this might be acceptable but it sure is a pain to have to do extra work to use this library .
Now , a language which supports concurrency does not have this problem so much .
The first solution , of running the library in a thread , works perfectly fine .
You probably have 300 or 400 threads going already so it is no big deal .
This makes it easy to distribute libraries for the particular language .
For a simple example .
Imagine you make a really great http client in python .
You can't really make a general http client because you need to take into account the various networking frameworks they might be using .
If they are using twisted then it needs to integrate into the twisted event loop to be really useful .
If they are using asyncore it needs to integrate into the asyncore event loop , and so on and so forth .
Now take the same situation in erlang .
Just throw the client in a process and you are all set .
You do n't have to rewrite anything .
The obvious benefit of this is increased development speed .
I think it seems pretty clear that our processors and applications are moving towards more concurrent environments .
Languages that can take advantage of this environment are most likely going to be the ones that make it .
However I 'm no fortune teller , so there is a good chance I could be wrong .
I think I tried to put too much into this one post so it might not make sense .
Hopefully I got my ideas across .
Berkeley --
A common additive found in food and cosmetics has been found to inhibit the activity of sirtuins , enzymes associated with lifespan control in yeast and other organisms , according to a new study led by researchers at the University of California , Berkeley .
The study , to be published Friday , Dec. 16 , in the online journal Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) Genetics , found that in lab tests , dihydrocoumarin ( DHC ) , a compound found naturally in sweet clover and synthetically manufactured for use in foods and cosmetics , inhibited the activity of Sir2p and SIRT1 , forms of sirtuin found in yeast and humans , respectively .
Increased sirtuin activity is known to increase longevity in yeast , roundworms and fruit flies .
The opposite effect in yeast has also been shown when the sirtuin enzyme is either deleted or reduced - the lifespan decreases by as much as 30 percent .
" Although studies on sirtuins and longevity have not been done in humans , there is reason to suspect that sirtuins play a role in the aging process of human cells , so identifying sirtuin inhibitors becomes important , " said Martyn Smith , professor of toxicology at UC Berkeley 's School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study , which was funded by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences .
DHC is added as a flavoring agent to a wide variety of foods , including soft drinks , yogurt and muffins , and is used as a common fragrance in cosmetics , lotions and soaps .
It can be found in concentrations as high as 100 parts per million in such foods as gelatins , puddings and frozen dairy products .
" It 's still a long jump from test tube to person , but our findings may imply that humans are exposed to chemicals in the diet and environment that block an important enzyme involved in longevity , " said Smith .
Notably , there are five forms of sirtuins found in yeast , and seven forms of sirtuin in humans .
" There is good reason to think that DHC would inhibit at least some of the functions of some of the other forms of sirtuins , " said Jasper Rine , professor of genetics at UC Berkeley 's Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and co-author of the paper .
The UC Berkeley researchers collaborated with Dr. Eric Verdin , associate director and senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology , which is affiliated with UC San Francisco .
Verdin , who is also a professor of medicine at UCSF , is an expert on mammalian sirtuin enzymes .
" It 's important to note that the role of sirtuins in aging is conserved in distantly related organisms such as yeast , drosophila and the small roundworm , C. elegans , " said Verdin .
" So , it is not too much of a stretch to expect that sirtuins also control the aging process in mammals , including humans .
In addition , sirtuins control many important cellular functions besides aging , and an agent that modulates sirtuins , such as DHC , could not only affect aging but also other critical functions , such as metabolism , neurodegeneration and cancer . "
Sirtuin enzymes are histone deacetylases , which modify the structure of chromatins , complex substances made up of DNA and protein .
Histone deacetylases keep chromatins packed and tightly coiled in such a way that enzymes cannot activate the DNA , keeping the gene from being expressed .
This type of gene " silencing " is considered epigenetic , which means that it effectively controls the expression of a gene without altering the actual DNA molecules .
" Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for nearly all aspects of development and have been implicated in a variety of human diseases , " said Rine .
" Hence , agents which disrupt epigenetic processes can have profound consequences . "
Andrew Olaharski , UC Berkeley post - doctoral researcher in environmental health sciences and lead author of the paper , noted that toxicology testing routinely focuses on an agent 's ability to cause DNA mutations , chromosome alterations , or cell death , but does not currently test for chemical - induced epigenetic changes .
While epigenetic changes do not alter the DNA structure , they can impact gene expression that may lead to disease .
" Identical twins with the exact same DNA may grow up to have different diseases because of epigenetic changes , " said Olaharski .
" The identification that a common additive to foods and cosmetics may interfere with these epigenetic processes is simply one more piece of evidence supporting the important role environmental agents may play in human health . "
To screen for possible sirtuin inhibitors , the researchers used haploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast .
The haploid yeast strains , like gametes or sex cells , contained only one set of chromosomes , and would not normally grow on the medium prepared in the lab .
However , if the haploid yeast strains were exposed to an agent that disrupted sirtuin activity , epigenetic silencing would be reversed , the strains would mate to become diploid cells , and the yeast would grow on the medium .
Of the compounds tested thus far , DHC was the first environmental agent to have shown the ability to inhibit sirtuin enzymes .
The researchers further tested the role of DHC in apoptosis , a process that causes a cell to die .
They exposed DHC to human white blood cells and found that increasing concentrations of the compound led to increases in cell toxicity , apoptosis , and the stability of p53 , a tumor - suppressing protein associated with apoptosis .
" Our study raises some concern about the potential effects of DHC on humans , " said Olaharski .
" However , I would not be alarmed at this point , since we currently do not have any evidence that exposure to DHC in the diet accelerates the human aging process . "
Olaharski said the findings highlight an emerging hypothesis regarding the delicate balance a cell must strike between tumor growth and aging .
" Cancers and tumors are essentially cells that have uncontrolled or accelerated growth , " he said .
" In contrast , aging and apoptosis are processes involved in the halting of cell growth and eventually cell death .
If there is too much tumor suppression , there may be no cancer , but the tissue may age more rapidly .
It is interesting to speculate whether DHC present in the diet tips this balance towards enhanced tumor suppression , and on the potential ramifications this may have on human health . "
The trick , researchers say , is to suppress tumor growth without triggering an acceleration of the aging process .
The study suggests that properly functioning sirtuin enzymes - and the agents that inhibit or activate them - play a key role in that balance .

The Goog Life：グーグルが従業員を子供扱いすることでつなぎとめている件 著者： Aaron Swartz 日本語訳： yomoyomo
以下の文章は 、Aaron Swartz による The Goog Life : how Google keeps employees by treating them like kids の日本語訳である 。
先日友達と、シリコンバレーで絶えず会話のネタになるもの、Google の話をしていた。で最後に、彼女がすべてに筋を通すヒントをくれたんだ。「子供扱いしてるのよ」と彼女は語った。「ただ飯をあてがい、洗濯をしてやり、弾力のある色鮮やかなボールの上に座らせる。彼らが成長し、自力で人生を生きる方法を学ぶ必要がないようにすべてをやってあげるわけ」
そのように見れば 、Google がやることすべてに恐ろしくつじつまが合う。
僕が Google を最後に訪問してから大した変化があったわけじゃない。キャンパスはより大きくなっている――通りの向こうの建物は、Google の留まるところを知らない成長に対応すべく、弁護士やその他の下層連中にあてがわれることなく、現在もこれまで同様技術スタッフに利用されている。しかしそこで働く人たちは、最後に僕が訪れたときほど興奮してるように見えない。誰も「僕らには世界を変える使命がある！」とはもう言わない。今じゃ彼らは、「ああ、オプションが確定するまで、もう6ヶ月ここでブラブラするつもりなんだ」とか「僕としては今のグループを抜けたいんだけど、他のどのグループももっとひどいんじゃないか心配でね」と言っているんだ。
それでも、キャンパスには露骨な変化が二つあって、それはメインのビルの中央に宙吊りにされた巨大でひどい見た目のスペースシップワンの模型と建物の外に立つ恐竜の骨格模型だ。「それってまるで、この場所は七歳児に飾りつけされてますって感じ」と友人は評する。僕もロバート・ライヒ（訳注：元アメリカ合衆国労働長官）のニュート・ギングリッジ（訳注：元アメリカ下院議長）についてのコメントを思い出す。「彼のオフィスは恐竜のフィギュアで飾られていて、いつか強く大きくなることを夢見る男の子の寝室みたいだ」
恐竜や宇宙船は確かに子供扱いというテーマに合致するし、Google 社員が飛びこみ、ボール遊びを興じることができる浴槽大のボールピットもまたしかり。僕が知るそこで働く人は皆、子供っぽく振舞うか（大勢のプログラマ）、ものすごく青臭いか（彼らのマネージャや監督者）、あるいは芯までシニカルか（第一線のプログラマ）のいずれかである。彼らにしても
Google を離れたいと思うかもしれないが、この子供扱い戦略が効いてきた。彼らは自分たちが
Google 以外のところでは生きてゆけないのではないか心配なのだ。
Google は大学から直接プログラマを雇用し、彼らを大学生活にあるあらゆる利点でひきつける。事実、求人パンフレットが強調するように、その職場はあからさまに大学を模している。ひところ僕は、どうして
Google はいくところまでいって社員寮を作らないのかと思ったものだ。結局のところ、自分と同じく頭の切れる人間と深夜に学生寮で交わす会話こそ大学生活の最良のものの一つじゃなかっただろうか？ でも 、Google の威光が薄れるにつれ、それが誰もそんなに長くたむろしたいと思う場所でない理由が僕にも分かる。マウンテンビュー郊外の砂漠でさえもそれよりはマシだ。
Google の有名な秘密主義は、実際には競争相手から情報を守るのにあまり役に立っていない。本当に好奇心の強い人なら、十分なリーク情報を手に入れ、どうやって大方すべてが機能しているのかを理解するのに十分な記事を読むことは可能だ。けれども
Google があえてそうしているのは、場の周辺に不可能性のオーラを作り出すためである。人々は講演や学術論文で
Google の技術についてエアブラシ加工されたものを読み
、Google には驚くほど強力な技術を有する驚くほど大きなコンピュータ研究所があると考える。しかし、十分な時間
Google 社員とつるんでみれば、彼ら が GFS（訳注 ： Google File System）の信頼性のなさや、実は負荷に対応するのに十分なコンピュータがないのに不平を言うのを聞くことになるだろう。
「 ソーセージが実際に作られるところを見るのはいつだって恐ろしいものだ」とあるプロダクトマネージャは説く。そしてそれこそが、Google の秘密主義が防がなければならないものなのだ。その壁の内側にいる少数の精鋭たちが真実――そこに「そこ」はない（訳注：there is no there there ガートルード・スタインの有名な言葉）――を知り、この重責に縛り付けられている一方で、世界中の残りの人たちは、Google をその内部世界にあらゆる神秘を備えた計り知れない組織だと見ている（
「君はそこで256日働いてその秘密主義を教えてもらったと聞いてるけど」と xkcd は説明している） 。
そうした戦略は 、Google 社員が少数精鋭だった初期にはうまく機能したのかもしれないが、企業規模が大きくなり、従業員の
Google との一体感が薄くなるにつ れ 、Google は従業員の順応を強化しなくてはならなくなる。そこで等身大の恐竜模型の登場ですよ。可能なうちに、巨大でパワフルなのを楽しむがいい。なぜなら恐竜同様、いずれ
Google も滅びるんだから 。

In the late 1960s , a young Israeli man named Uri Geller gained a substantial amount of attention and fame following a collection of remarkable demonstrations on US and British television .
In full view of astonished audiences , Uri was seemingly able to manipulate metal with his mind .
Spoons softened in his hands , keys curled at the gentle stroke of his fingers , and he was able to cause compasses to wobble at his cajoling .
He was also known to restart stopped wristwatches by merely holding them in his hands .
According to Geller , these feats were the products of sheer will , a phenomenon known as psychokinesis .
In addition to his mental metallurgy and magnetism , the dashing young Israeli demonstrated potent psychic abilities , most notably in his ability to reproduce drawings which he had never seen .
A volunteer would draw a picture while Uri was not watching , and Geller would use his gifts to attempt to reproduce the image .
Although his recreations were not always completely accurate , they were sufficiently similar as to provoke astonishment from onlookers .
Geller ’s high - profile exploits in the 1970s significantly raised awareness of “ paranormal science ” worldwide , and since that time many have gone on to mimic his feats .
Though there are throngs of skeptics who have reproduced his handiwork under the harsh light of reality , there are still a handful of yet - to - be - explained effects exhibited by Geller and his spoon - bending contemporaries .
Most Americans became acquainted with the charismatic Uri Geller following a series of high - profile television and magazine appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
As the cameras looked on , spoons softened and became almost taffy - like in his fingers .
Often his audiences were awestruck when a spoon ’s head separated from its body and clattered to the floor .
An early Uri Geller TV appearance
When he reanimated wristwatches on television , he further dumbfounded observers by urging viewers to each hold their own broken wristwatch if they had one , allowing him to act as the psychic conduit .
Much to their amazement , some of the viewer ’s watches reportedly started ticking again .
By 1972 , the media frenzy surrounding Geller finally drew serious attention from the scientific community as supporters and skeptics began to polarize .
In order to better understand Uri ’s methods , the scientists at the Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) asked him to participate in a series of impartial experiments .
Uri eagerly agreed .
For five weeks , researchers Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ made the controversial character the target of their scientific scrutiny as he was subjected to a host of laboratory adventures .
Following some informal demonstrations by Geller , Stanford ’s first test revolved around a number of drawings which had been made prior to the experiments and placed in nested envelopes .
Uri was asked to recreate each selected image on his own paper .
Some of the drawings had been examined by the researchers before entering the experiment room with Uri ; some were double - blind , where not even the researchers knew what was within each envelope before it was opened ; and some of the images were brought in by outside consultants , sealed in their envelopes before arriving at the facility .
Before most of these experiments Geller expressed a measure of insecurity about his abilities , and in fact he declined to respond about 20 % of the time due to lack of confidence in his response .
But for those he did complete , he displayed a shocking level of accuracy .
His representations were crude , but they frequently bore an unmistakable resemblance to the original , though sometimes reversed .
Samples of Gellar 's drawings ( right ) and the researchers ' ( left )
The Stanford researchers also conducted tests to measure Geller ’s ability to detect materials without seeing them , a skill known as dowsing .
In each of these experiments , he was presented with a box of ten numbered aluminum canisters and asked to determine which one of them contained an object .
Before they were presented to Uri a third party placed the object in a random canister and then shuffled the cans ’ positions .
The objects used were ball bearings , magnets , room - temperature water , and sugar cubes .
Geller was not allowed to touch the cans or the box , otherwise the experiment would be listed as a failure .
The protocol indicated that he was to eliminate the cans one by one by pointing to them or calling out their number until only two remained , then he was required to guess which of the remaining two held the contents by calling out its number and writing it down .
Later this method was criticized as needlessly complex , leaving too many gaps where trickery might be used .
At first Uri spent a lot of time waving his hands over the canisters before selecting each one for removal , but as as the tests progressed he seemed to gain confidence until he eventually would simply call out the number of the correct canister upon entering the room .
In fourteen tests , there were two occasions that he declined to guess , but in all of the other twelve trials he made the correct selection .
Puthoff and Targ were understandably intrigued by their subject ’s performance .
There were no detectable signs of deception , yet the odds of correctly guessing in all twelve tests was one in 10 ^ 12 , or one in a trillion .
Another test where Geller showed startling accuracy was one which made use of a standard six - sided die in a metal box , both of which were provided by SRI .
The die was placed in the box and shaken , and Uri was asked to state which face would be showing when the lid was opened .
During the ten tests he declined to respond on twice , but in the other eight he was 100 % accurate in his predictions .
Geller attempting to manipulate a one gram weight on a scale
Uri ’s metal manipulation demonstrations were somewhat less impressive .
Though he had previously claimed the ability to bend metal objects without making physical contact , he was unable to demonstrate this in the laboratory .
When allowed to lightly touch the spoons , forks , and rods with his hands , they did indeed bend ; but such evidence was useless due to the inability to determine the amount of force Geller was using .
Another of the psychokinetic tests proved moderately successful , this one involving a one gram steel weight on an electric scale .
Without touching the weight or scale⁠ — which were both covered by a glass dome ⁠ —
Uri was able to cause measurable changes in a scale ’s reading .
The resulting SRI report was published in the science journal Nature in 1974 .
The researchers were n’t quick to draw conclusions , and they largely dismissed the psychokinesis results as inconclusive , but they felt that he had performed successfully enough that the phenomenon warranted further scientific study .
Puthoff and Targ coined the term “ Geller - effect ” to describe his remarkable displays of apparently paranormal powers .
Geller ’s charisma and talents won him regular appearances on television and in the print media over the next few years , and he was soon celebrated as a supernatural superstar .
With the Stanford research seemingly corroborating his claims , the skepticism surrounding him began to erode .
Soon another man appeared who could also demonstrate these remarkable feats before audiences of his own .
His name was James Randi , otherwise known as The Amazing Randi .
He , too , appeared to possess the astonishing ability to soften spoons with a gentle touch .
But Randi made no claims to supernatural powers .
In fact , he was a stage magician and a scientific skeptic .
He prepared the spoons in advance by bending them back and forth until the neck was sufficiently weakened .
He also convincingly tweaked keys and cutlery , quickly bending them with his hands as he directed the viewers ’ attention elsewhere .
After performing each trick he explained to his audience how he accomplished the simple illusions .
Randi was careful to point out that his demonstrations were not proof positive that Geller was a fraud , but rather that trickery was a more reasonable explanation than supernatural powers .
The Amazing Randi
In 1973 The Amazing Randi received a telephone call from the producers of The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson who had booked Geller as an upcoming guest .
Johnny Carson himself had spent some time as a stage magician , so he was skeptical of Geller ’s claims and he wanted Randi ’s assistance in sidestepping any shenanigans .
Randi suggested that the producers present Geller with an assortment of their own unprepared spoons , aluminum cans , and sealed drawings .
When Uri walked out on stage , he was uncharacteristically nervous as his gaze fell on the collection of objects .
When prompted to demonstrate his skills later in the show , he was unable to proceed , complaining that he was not feeling “ strong ” on that particular evening .
The incident had little effect on Uri ’s popularity , and over the next few years Geller amassed a fortune .
He claimed that his wealth was largely the result of dowsing services performed for major oil , gold and mineral mining companies , but at least a portion of his riches were the fruit of his fame .
He remained a fixture of the popular media , and he continued to astonish audiences .
Others people around the world began to claim similar abilities , and spoon - bending shortly became a staple of psychic demonstrations .
In the late 1970s , the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research in St. Louis began an organized effort to locate and study individuals who could convincingly demonstrate the Geller effect .
James Randi contacted the researchers and gave them advice on how to avoid being duped , but the scientists did not welcome his skeptical input .
During the early phases of the testing many of the applicants were disqualified for failing to demonstrate their skills in the lab , but two young men⁠ — Mike Edwards and Steve Shaw⁠ — appeared to be authentic .
In a series of publicized experiments the two men contorted an assortment of cutlery , caused objects to levitate , coaxed compasses to quiver , and recreated drawings which were provided in sealed envelopes .
It seemed that science had vindicated Uri Geller and his contemporaries yet again .
Left to right : Shaw , Edwards , and Randi
In 1981 , after four years of testing at the McDonnell labs , Edwards and Shaw held a press conference in New York City with Discover magazine .
The pair of famous psychics made an announcement which left their audience agape .
Mike Edwards told the crowd , “ The truth is , we are not psychics .
We are magicians . ”
Steve Shaw added amidst the murmuring , “ Yes , for the past four years we ’ve been fooling people . ”
They went on to explain that they were participating in Project Alpha , an effort launched by James Randi to illustrate that modern paranormal research was so blinded by bias that it was incapable of detecting deception .
Edwards and Shaw demonstrated many of their methods to the assembled press , mostly consisting of basic sleight of hand .
In some of the laboratory spoon - bending tests , they explained how they secretly switched the tags between various spoons so the researchers ’ angular measurements before and after the experiments would show detectable changes in each spoon ’s shape .
In others , they handled one spoon in plain sight to direct the experimenters ’ attention away from their other hand , which was manually bending another spoon in concealment .
Later , the bent spoon would be presented as evidence of success .
They also employed small magnets for many of their illusions , and they even used their breath to make certain objects move .
In nearly every instance , the recommendations Randi had made to McDonnell labs at the outset would have caught the deception .
Some of the paranormal researchers were so desperate to reject these confessions that they accused Edwards and Shaw of being real psychics who were lying about their true abilities .
The field of parapsychology was crippled by the news of the ruse , and many of the researchers involved were discredited by Project Alpha .
Its goal had not been to embarrass anyone , but rather it was a social experiment used to demonstrate that parapsychologists are susceptible to deception and self - deception , regardless of their intelligence and training .
Project Alpha beautifully illustrated the human tendency to seek only that evidence which supports one ’s preconceptions , a phenomenon known to psychology as confirmation bias .
Uri Geller on the Tonight Show
Though he was not directly discredited by the events , Uri Geller ’s fame faded over the following years .
In 1988 a British businessman named Gerald Fleming offered to donate £ 250,000 to charity if Geller could execute a spoon - bend under controlled laboratory conditions , but Geller never responded to the invitation .
Geller maintains to this day that his talents are genuinely supernatural , though he acknowledges that some of his feats can be mimicked using simple stage magic or natural phenomena .
For instance , a stopped watch will often become temporarily reanimated after being held in the hands for several minutes due to movements and body heat .
However not all of Geller ’s SRI demonstrations have been fully explained , such as his double - blind remote drawing tests , or the die - in - a - box .
The James Randi Education Foundation ( JREF ) currently offers a reward of one million US dollars to any psychic who can convincingly demonstrate their paranormal powers under controlled conditions .
According to the rules , both he and the party accepting the challenge must agree in advance regarding what constitutes a success or a failure .
Though over one thousand applicants have made the attempt , none have successfully collected the reward .
So far Uri Geller has not taken this opportunity to prove himself , nor have the other high - profile self - proclaimed psychics such as Sylvia Browne or John Edward .
These days Geller can occasionally be coaxed into contorting some tableware or wobbling a compass , but he seldom performs for crowds .
Recently some video evidence has appeared which seems to show Uri utilizing magicians ’ tricks ⁠— such as his use of what appears to be a false thumb⁠ — but no concrete evidence of fraud has yet been uncovered .
Geller and his Geller effect Cadillac
Today Geller directs much of his energy into his family and creative pursuits .
He is an accomplished artist , and his creative juices have been wrung out upon the pages of newspapers and magazines for years .
He also designs clothing and jewelry .
He gives occasional interviews , and he can sometimes be seen driving around in his 1976 Cadillac he calls the “ Geller effect . ”
Its outer surfaces are bristling with bent tableware , each of which came from the mouth of a celebrity or historical figure .
He has stated that he intends to drive it around the Middle East in an effort to bring peace to the region .
Given their unwillingness to subject themselves to controlled laboratory testing , Geller and his spoon - bending colleagues are likely to remain filed in the interesting - but - unlikely drawer for some time to come .
Were it not for the handful of as - yet - inexplicable demonstrations , it would be easy to disregard such illusionists entirely .
Whether Geller ’s gifts spring from an inner well of creative deception or from the the realm of magic , unicorns and fairies , it is certain that he is a highly talented and charismatic individual .
His exploits have demonstrated beyond a doubt that the human mind possesses incredible powers of manipulation .
All of this assumes , of course , that there is indeed a spoon .
The recipient , in Cascade near Grand Rapids , said her husband opened two packages - one containing a liver , the other a partial human head .
" He started the second one , but stopped as soon as we saw the ear , " she told the Grand Rapids Press newspaper .
The delivery company , DHL , said it was not immediately clear what happened but the labels were reportedly in Chinese .
The company says it is co-operating with investigators .
The authorities believe 28 more bubble - wrapped human organs could have been dispersed across the country .
The body parts - which are preserved - were for medical research , police spokesman Roger Parent said .
" There will definitely be a shock to people if they see these things , but there is no hazard to health , " he added .

Greg Sargent has a post describing his discouraging talk with a a liberal Dem Hill staffer .
Here 's the situation in a nutshell , as best as we understand it .
The White House says it simply wo n't accept any sort of timetable , even a waivable one .
It says it wo n't accept any kind of benchmarks for progress in Iraq if there are any consequences for not meeting them .
So aside from sending the bill back there are only two apparent possibilities left : Either the White House gives on one of these points .
Or the Dem Congressional leadership caves and produces a bill with some sort of benchmarks but no accountability -- in other words , something that 's effectively meaningless .
According to our Hill staffer , some liberals are beginning to fear that it will ultimately be the latter .
And this has produced a kind of gloom among some libs in the House right now who are persuaded that the Dem leadership will ultimately back down in hopes that other future legislative routes will prove more fertile .
" If this is what they go with , it begs the question , Why did we go through this whole exercise with the first supplemental and everything else ? " our staffer asks .
" What did we really accomplish ? "
...
So barring a situation where the standoff continues past Memorial Day , something Dems seem hell bent on avoiding , that leaves just options ( a ) and ( b ) above : Either the White House gives , or Dems cave .
And some libs , at least , worry that it 'll be ( b ) .
On the other hand , the Dem leadership insists it 's committed to not giving Bush a blank check , and it has consistently hung much tougher than anyone expected and has steadily defied expectations in the process .
So anything , of course , can happen .
~ Building a Log Cabin in Alaska~
One night in the spring of 2004 , probably at 2 am , Aaron and I were sitting at the computer , each drinking a beer , and looking for land in Alaska .
We could n't believe it when we found a piece that was n't only affordable .... VERY affordable , but was in our favorite area of Alaska .
We bought our five acre parcel of land and started dreaming up what we were going to do on it .
We told our folks we were going to build a cabin ; I think my parents did n't believe me and thought I was a little crazy !
Aaron and I were so excited we just started cutting trees , branches , anything .... oh the feeling of owning your own piece of land !
Over the course of five months Aaron and I drove every single weekend five hours to our land and gradually a cabin came together .
Aaron 's brother , Adam , joined us for 2.5 months ; we 'd never have done it without his help !
Please take your time on these pages , click on the pictures to see the bigger view , and enjoy the building process of a log cabin by two people who have never built much of anything before !
The links above will take you through each process of the building .
Originally all the photos were on one page , but that was like 300 pictures , so I split the building process up into six pages .
Preparing the Land After buying five acres of land in Alaska , we started preparing the land for this vision of a cabin we had .
We used all our own logs from the land for the walls .
It was quite a process cutting them down and peeling each by hand .
The Log Walls
We really had no idea what we were doing .
We had a book about building a log home in Alaska that showed some variations of notches .
We decided to use the round notch .
Each log we scribed to try and get a fit as tight as possible .
This was n't easy with the crooked logs we had to use .
With each log placed , our cabin slowly took form .
The Gables , Roof , and Windows With winter quickly closing in on us , we hurried along to get our cabin closed from the outside elements .
The first night we spent inside our drafting cabin was luxurious .
We had a stove to keep her warm , but lots of trim work to do around the windows and ceiling to keep the winds out .
Alaska Log Cabin in Winter
We could get the temperature inside up in the 70s , while outside it was well below zero .
We had high hopes of spending Christmas at our cabin , but a nasty storm dashed our plans .
Lots of work to do inside yet .
We spent the cold days building a log table , finishing up some rock work around the stove , and drinking coffee .
Log Spiral Stairs Building stairs to the loft was a work of creativity .
We did n't like the first design , but are quite pleased with the second .
Spent the early spring finishing up more details inside and putting window covers on to discourage the bears from trying to find a way in the cabin .
The Cabinets & Porch Some finishing touches for the outside with a porch and stairs .
Makes it much easier to get inside and out !
Also finished up our kitchen area in the cabin .
River rock for a counter top is interesting .
Spent a day sealing the logs with Wood Guard , and prepared the cabin for visitors .
Log Cabin Living 2006
We moved to our cabin for about three months during the late summer and fall of 2006 .
We had to say the goodbye ( temporarily ) to the cabin as we were moving back to Montana .
I think I could live at the cabin for a year or two and really enjoy it .
It 's fun trying to learn new tricks when it comes to every day living in the woods without the comforts we are used to .
Return to our Cabin 2008
At last we are back in Alaska , and this time for good .
The cabin is in great shape ; almost exactly as we left it .
Bunk Room addition 2017
We desperately needed more sleeping space in our cabin now that we are a family of five .
We decided this was the time to do it !
Check our our bunkroom build addition to our cabin .
A compound found naturally in blood could form the basis for an entirely new class of Aids drugs , according to scientists .
The chemical prevents the HIV virus from entering human immune cells and it is effective even against strains of the virus that are resistant to other drugs .
" You want a lot of drug classes , because multi- drug resistant viruses are starting to show up more and more , " said Frank Kirchhoff at the University of Ulm in Germany , one of the authors of the study .
The newly identified compound prevents the virus from attaching a molecular anchor to the cell it is invading .
No existing drugs affect this stage of infection , so the team hopes the compound could be modified to form a new class of similar drugs .
With nearly 40 million people living with HIV worldwide and 3 m deaths last year , new approaches are urgently needed .
The team discovered the compound - called Virus - Inhibitory Peptide or VIRIP - by screening hundreds of proteins from human blood .
" A number of studies have suggested that some compounds in the human blood are able to inhibit HIV - 1 and control it , " said Prof Kirchhoff .
One way was by adding proteins to cells that fluoresce when the virus is active .
If the protein turned the lights off they knew it might be stopping HIV .
The results are reported in the journal Cell .
VIRIP is a fragment of a larger protein , but the team is not sure whether it has a function itself .
Nor do the researchers know yet exactly how it inhibits HIV .
They do know its precise sequence is crucial : adding or subtracting just one of its 20 protein building blocks destroys its ability .

2) Who Is The Zohar For ?
As mentioned in answer no .
1 , The Zohar was written for people who have already achieved spiritual perception .
It contains the depictions of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai ( Rashbi ) , who attained all 125 degrees of the spiritual ladder of degrees .
Rashbi expressed the entire spiritual path and titled it Zohar ( “ radiance ” in Hebrew ) .
The Zohar is built so that only those who achieve a certain spiritual level can benefit from what they read in it .
Prior to studying
The Zohar , one needs to study other texts that teach how to properly approach the text in The Zohar .
1 ) What Is The Zohar ?
The Zohar is a collection of commentaries on the Torah , intended to guide people who have already achieved high spiritual degrees to the root ( origin ) of their souls .
The Zohar contains all the spiritual states that people experience as their souls evolve .
At the end of the process , the souls achieve what Kabbalah refers to as “ the end of correction , ” the highest level of spiritual wholeness .
To those without spiritual attainment , The Zohar reads like a collection of allegories and legends that can be interpreted and perceived differently by each individual .
But to those with spiritual attainment , i.e. Kabbalists ,
The Zohar is a practical guide to inner actions that one performs in order to discover deeper , higher states of perception and sensation .
The Zohar contains all the spiritual states that people experience as their souls evolve .
At the end of the process , the souls achieve what Kabbalah refers to as “ the end of correction , ” the highest level of spiritual wholeness .
[ Tweet This ]
3 ) Who Wrote The Zohar , & When ?
According to all Kabbalists , and as the beginning of the book writes , The Zohar was written by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai ( Rashbi ) , who lived in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE .
There are views in scholastic circles stating that The Zohar was written in the 11th century by Kabbalist Rabbi Moshe de Leon .
This view was contradicted by Rabbi Moshe de Leon himself , who said that the book was written by Rashbi .
In the Kabbalistic approach , the question of why The Zohar was written is far more important than the question of who actually wrote it .
The purpose of The Zohar is to be a guide for people to attain the origin of their souls .
This path to the origin of one ’s soul consists of 125 stages .
Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag writes that a Kabbalist who has passed these stages and shares the same perception as that of the book ’s author , sees that its author could be none other than Rashbi .
4 ) Why Was The Zohar Hidden For So Long ?
The Zohar was kept hidden for 900 years , between the 2nd and the 11th centuries CE , since those who possessed its wisdom understood that at the time , people did not need it and would misunderstand its contents .
Only in the 16th century CE did a Kabbalist arise who explained the fundamentals of Kabbalah - The Holy Ari , Rabbi Isaac Luria ( 1534-1572 ) .
The Ari stated that from his time on , the wisdom of Kabbalah was ready to be opened to everyone .
Commentaries on the works of the Ari and The Zohar appeared only in the 20th century - the century that saw the fiercest outburst of human desires in history .
During this period , a unique soul appeared - that of Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag ( Baal HaSulam ) .
Baal HaSulam explained the wisdom of Kabbalah in a way our generation could understand .
Moreover , Baal HaSulam was the only Kabbalist in the 20th century who wrote commentaries on The Zohar and on the works of the Ari .
This does not mean that there were no great Kabbalists before him , but only that their works are not easily understood by contemporary students .
Today ’s popularity and high demand for Kabbalah testify to our generation ’s readiness to absorb its universal message , and to comprehend the authentic texts that speak of the root of our lives and how to attain it .

Cheney ordered Secret Service logs destroyed , paper reports John Byrne
Published : Saturday June 23 , 2007 Print This Email
This VP created new secret document classification , keeps ' man - size ' safes A massive piece in Sunday 's Washington Post reveals the true extent of secrecy Vice President Dick Cheney requires .
So clandestine is the Vice President 's work that he has created a new secret document designation : " Treated As : Top Secret / SCI . "
That 's not all : the piece also reveals that Cheney keeps ' man- size ' Mosler safes on hand for " workaday business " and has destroyed all Secret Service visitor logs , in addition to already refusing to comply with a national security directive issued by President Bush , which RAW STORY first reported earlier this week .
Not only does he refuse to give the names of his staff , Cheney wo n't even disclose how many people he employs .
" Across the board , the vice president 's office goes to unusual lengths to avoid transparency , " the Post article says .
" Cheney declines to disclose the names or even the size of his staff , generally releases no public calendar and ordered the Secret Service to destroy his visitor logs . "
" Stealth is among Cheney 's most effective tools , " the piece adds .
" Man -size Mosler safes , used elsewhere in government for classified secrets , store the workaday business of the office of the vice president .
Even talking points for reporters are sometimes stamped " Treated As : Top Secret / SCI . "
" Experts in and out of government said Cheney 's office appears to have invented that designation , which alludes to " sensitive compartmented information , " the most closely guarded category of government secrets , " the Post adds .
" By adding the words " treated as , " they said , Cheney seeks to protect unclassified work as though its disclosure would cause " exceptionally grave damage to national security . "
The Post intimates that Cheney 's office is like a black hole -- everything goes in , but nothing comes out .
" In the usual business of interagency consultation , proposals and information flow into the vice president 's office from around the government , but high - ranking White House officials said in interviews that almost nothing flows out , " the Post reporters note .
" Close aides to Cheney describe a similar one - way valve inside the office , with information flowing up to the vice president but little or no reaction flowing down . "

The process of smell via electron tunneling : ( a ) , an electron in the nasal receptor finds its way to the donor component of the receptor ; ( b ) and ( c ) , a scent molecule ’s vibrational frequency enables the electron to tunnel to a different energy state ; ( d ) electron travels to the acceptor unit and molecule leaves .
Credit : Marshall Stoneham , et al .
Scientists from the London Centre for Nanotechnology ( LCN ) at University College London have newly analyzed an intriguing 10 - year - old theory of smell , finding that the idea may make more sense than once thought .
Regarding smell , scientists only have a few pieces of the puzzle , and it ’s unclear how they fit into the big picture .
Basically , scientists know that odorant molecules in the air actuate several types of receptors in our noses , which then trigger nerve cells for the brain to analyze .
But while scientists know that the shape and size of molecules can make odors smell differently , some molecules with nearly identical shapes smell nothing alike .
This apparent conundrum is due to the lack of understanding of what happens before and as the odorant molecules interact with the nasal receptors .
These initial atomic - scale processes must include some selection criteria that explain why receptors react differently to molecules of the same ( or different ) shapes .
The possibility that LCN physicists Jennifer Brookes , Filio Hartoutsiou , Andrew Horsfield and Marshall Stoneham have looked into is that electrons in the receptors can be triggered to tunnel between energy states , provided the odorant molecule ’s vibration frequency matches the energy difference of these states .
The LCN group tested the physical viability of this mechanism , first suggested in 1996 by a scientist named Luca Turin , and found that a general model of this electron tunneling is consistent with physics laws as well as with known features of smell .
Quantum mechanical tunneling , a process often exploited in technology , occurs when a particle passes through a barrier despite being forbidden by classical physics .
This is possible for small - scale objects , such as electrons , due to their wave - like properties .
If an odorant molecule ’s vibrations ( or phonons ) cause electrons in a nasal receptor to tunnel between energy states , nerve signals are sent to the brain .
Different vibrational frequencies are detected by different receptors , so because different odorants have different frequencies , odorants smell different .
“ I personally was surprised that our answer seems so robust — we do n't need to fudge or to take special helpful values of parameters , ” Stoneham told PhysOrg.com .
“ At the start , we could not have been sure at all .
In fact , when I first heard of the ideas 10 years ago , I did not expect them to work out .
I liked Luca Turin 's idea — it was interesting — but what we did was certainly not proving the obvious . ”
Whereas the basic chemical image of smell in the past was a “ lock and key ” model , with different shaped molecules fitting in different receptors , the LCN team explains how the electron tunneling mechanism is more of a “ swipe card ” model .
Similar to a credit card , an odorant molecule would be “ read ” by receptors that picked up its vibration spectrum , along with matching its shape .
“ The major other theories of how receptors generate signals that are specific to certain molecules are all ones depending on molecular shape , mainly ‘ lock and key ’ mechanisms , ” said Stoneham .
“ As we say in our Physical Review Letter , this popular model fails badly for these small scent molecules ( similar molecules smell different , differently - shaped molecules smell the same , the actuation process is ill - defined ) . ”
As the LCN group ’s calculations show , this non-mechanical actuation is physically plausible : the charge transfer rate is consistent with the observed time scale ; the inelastic electron signal is decipherable ; and there does appear to be a link between a molecule ’s vibration spectrum and its odor .
Although the scientists still need to know more about the properties of receptors , the swipe card model offers insight into how selectivity works for human smell .
“ On the possibility of whether or not we might completely understand smell in the near future , there are many levels of understanding , ” Stoneham explained .
“ But to a level such that scents might be designed , probably yes ( and indeed Luca Turin and his firm , Flexitral , have been reasonably successful ) . ”

EBay just reported its earnings , and while rest of the data does n’t intrigue me as much , the Skype data is pretty telling .
In the 78 days eBay has owned Skype , the company did sales of $ 24.8 million .
No mention of profits in the press release , but they do point out that nearly 87 % of the total sales are from outside of the US .
At $ 24.8 million over seventy eight days , it works out to about $ 116 million , a shade ahead of $ 100 million annual run-rate they hoped for when the SkyeBay deal was announced .
Looks pretty good , unless you start slicing and dicing it differently .
That ’s about $ 318,000 a day in sales for Skype .
Being snarky for a minute , at that rate , the sales - to - deal - price ( $ 2.6 billion ) parity will take about 8176 days .
Roughly 22 years !
( Of course they will grow their sales , I am just having some fun here ;-) )

Gordon Brown was quizzed over Iraq and Iran at the meeting
Speaking at a Labour Party hustings meeting in Bristol , Mr Brown said it was a divisive issue for the nation .
He said the government and others had fallen short when it came to rebuilding Iraq 's economy after the war .
Mr Brown , who becomes PM on 27 June , said economic activity , employment and security were key to achieving peace .
' Economic deprivation '
He spoke candidly about the government 's failures in Iraq during a Labour question and answer session with trade unionists at the meeting .
Mr Brown said : " There 's massive unemployment in Iraq and that is a failure on our part , a failure on the part of those who 've been in Iraq , that there is still so much economic deprivation and people are not in jobs . "
Mr Brown said developing the economy and political system in Iraq was key .
" I see the next stage as us getting to a position where there is security , so our troops can move to an " overwatch position " , getting economic development so that people have jobs and have got economic prosperity .
" And getting the political system sorted out so a democracy is fully functioning .
Let us not deny that this has been a divisive issue . "
Speaking later at the Hay Festival , in mid Wales , he said he took " collective responsibility " for the decision to go to war with Iraq and reiterated that it had " clearly divided the country . "
' Peaceful settlement '
Earlier in Bristol he was asked if he could rule out military action over Iran .
Mr Brown said multilateral action and economic sanctions were the best ways to deal with the situation .
The chancellor , who has not previously elaborated on his view that sanctions against Iran were working , said : " We want a peaceful settlement to the Iran issue . "
It was " totally wrong " for countries to defy the international community and to start stockpiling nuclear weapons , he added .
" What we do n't want is a situation where we move from North Korea to Iran to African countries , where we have no control .
I think multilateral pressure is the right thing to do . "
The government has been careful not to give unequivocal assurances since former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said military action was " inconceivable " in November 2004 .
Suggestions that US anger over his stance contributed to his removal from the job in a reshuffle last year were strongly denied .
Enrichment activities
In February Mr Blair said that diplomacy , not military action , was the best way to resolve the stand - off over Iran 's nuclear programme .
He told the BBC he was not aware of any plans to attack Iran and said the only viable solution was a political one .
But he said he could not " absolutely predict every set of circumstances " .
Conservative leader David Cameron warned earlier this week that although military action could have devastating consequences , it should not be ruled out .
The UN Security Council has passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspends all enrichment activities .
The UN's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , said in a report on Wednesday that Tehran was stepping up enrichment and obstructing inspections .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of he IAEA , said it might be too late to stop Iran entirely and the focus should be on preventing large - scale enrichment - a policy rejected by US and UK diplomats .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says Iran will not be deterred from pursuing its nuclear goals and insists that it is co-operating with the IAEA .
Relations between the UK and Iran hit a low point when 15 Royal Navy personnel based on HMS Cornwall were seized by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on 23 March in the northern Gulf .
With all the spume and nonsense online and in the media regarding embryonic stem cell research , it 's actually quite hard to find a sane , well - written , scientific article that explains just why embryonic stem cell research is important .
The staff over at blog .
bioethics .
net seem have found a good example , even if it is rather diluted by discussion of funding and politics :
Although it is true that no one has to date been treated with cellular therapies based on human embryonic stem cells , I can assure you that mouse embryonic stem cells have had a major impact on medical research .
Over the past 25 years , mouse embryonic stem cells have been used to create models for scores of human diseases , including cancer , heart disease , obesity , and Alzheimer's .
Research discoveries based on these models has led to new drug development and therefore touched countless lives .
As for the criticism that no one has been cured with embryonic stem cells , the field of human embryonic stem cell research is a mere 7 years old , so it is premature to expect successful cell therapies to have already been delivered to patients .
I believe it is only a matter of time before human embryonic stem cells are used in drug development research and become the basis for important new cell therapies .
As further evidence of how human embryonic stem cells enable unique opportunities to study disease , consider research on Fanconi 's anemia .
Kids with Fanconi's anemia suffer bone marrow failure , and often develop leukemia .
Scientists have tried to model this disease in mice , but the mice do not develop bone marrow failure , and the adult blood stem cells from Fanconi 's patients cannot be maintained in culture .
Recently , a team from the Reproductive Genetics Institute of Chicago isolated a human embryonic stem cell line that carries a Fanconi 's gene mutation .
This cell line could enable us to study the uniquely human aspects of Fanconi 's anemia .
Study : Price for border fence up to $ 49 billion Study says fence cost could reach $ 49 billion / Lawmakers ' estimate falls far short of total , research service says
Where New Fence Would Go. Chronicle Graphic Where New Fence Would Go. Chronicle Graphic Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Study : Price for border fence up to $ 49 billion Study says fence cost could reach $ 49 billion / Lawmakers ' estimate falls far short of total , research service says 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The cost of building and maintaining a double set of steel fences along 700 miles of the U.S. - Mexico border could be five to 25 times greater than congressional leaders forecast last year , or as much as $ 49 billion over the expected 25 - year life span of the fence , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .
A little - noticed study the research service released in December notes that even the $ 49 billion does not include the expense of acquiring private land along hundreds of miles of border or the cost of labor if the job is done by private contractors -- both of which could drive the price billions of dollars higher .
The Congressional Research Service also questioned the effectiveness of a fence in preventing people from crossing the border illegally , especially if it does not span the entire 1,952 - mile border .
Secure fencing of some kind already exists along 106 miles of border , mostly in short stretches around cities .
The findings did not deter Congressional backers of the border fence , including Rep. Duncan Hunter , R - San Diego , the fence 's principal proponent .
" Mr. Hunter firmly supports expanding the San Diego border fence across the U.S. - Mexico border , " said spokesman Joe Kasper .
" This does n't have to be and should not be as costly an endeavor as some are suggesting . "
Congress has so far provided the Department of Homeland Security with $ 1.5 billion for upgrading infrastructure and technology at the border this fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 .
No money has been allocated specifically for the 700 miles of fence .
A spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , was circumspect as to how the money should be spent , given the report 's findings .
" Sen . Feinstein has been supportive of the idea of a fence and thinks it has been effective in California , " said Feinstein spokesman Scott Gerber .
" At the same time , we have to be realistic about the costs of both construction and maintenance .
Priorities need to be made , estimates need to be made based on the real world , and as additional information comes forward , we 'll take another look at it . "
The fence would be built under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees Customs and Border Protection .
Boeing Co. , under a September contract with Homeland Security , already has begun constructing a " virtual fence " along all 6,000 miles of the U.S. border , north and south , that is expected to run to $ 2.5 billion .
A state - of - the - art fence constructed on almost 10 miles of border in western San Diego County has reduced the number of Border Patrol arrests of illegal entrants there , the research service reported .
But " the flow of illegal immigration has adapted to this enforcement posture and has shifted to the more remote areas of the Arizona desert , " the research service said .
The number of arrests along the entire border in 2004 was 1.2 million , the same as in 1992 , before the San Diego fence was built and other enforcement was increased .
" The main difference is that , while San Diego accounted for the majority of apprehensions in 1992 , in 2004 ( the ) Tucson and Yuma sectors accounted for the majority of apprehensions , " the study noted .
When the House of Representatives first approved a border security bill last winter , Hunter estimated it would cost $ 2.2 billion .
The Congressional Budget Office echoed that figure in May with an estimate of $ 3 million per mile -- $ 2.1 billion for 700 miles .
But the Congressional Research Service noted that the 14 - mile San Diego fence is expected to cost $ 9 million per mile once it is finished .
The research service also used a larger figure -- 850 miles -- for the length of the fence .
Recent fences along the border have been constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for Customs and Border Protection .
The Corps has obtained the land , drafted the environmental protection plan , designed the project and overseen construction .
Labor has been provided by National Guard and military units on loan from the Department of Defense .
The Dec. 12 , 2006 , nonpartisan congressional report said the corps predicted that the combined cost of building and maintaining the fence over a 25 - year life cycle would range from $ 16.4 million to $ 70 million per mile , depending on how heavily and how often the fence is damaged by would - be border jumpers .
At $ 70 million per mile , a 700 - mile fence would cost $ 49 billion .
Though much land on the border in California and Arizona already belongs to the federal government , most of the Texas and New Mexico borderlands are privately held .
And 70 miles of Arizona border lie along the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation , whose leaders have vowed to fight the fence , a stance that could lead the government into a protracted legal battle .
Douglas Massey , a professor of sociology at Princeton University who studies the border and illegal immigration , said the government should spend its money differently .
" It 's a waste of money , " he said .
" If you want to increase security , better to use some of that money for ports and transportation systems .
If you want to lower the rate of Mexican immigration to the U.S. , I would spend it on development assistance for Mexico . "
A guest worker program would reduce the illegal traffic at the border , he also said , and free up the Border Patrol to focus on keeping out drug smugglers and potential terrorists .
Rep. Tom Tancredo , R - Colo. , who has spoken adamantly in favor of restricting both legal and illegal immigration , remains a supporter of the fence for security reasons as well .
" It 's simple : What did 9/11 cost us versus what would it cost to maintain a fence to help prevent that ? " said Carlos Espinosa , a Tancredo spokesman .
" If we could prevent another terrorist attack , then absolutely it 's worth it . "
In April 2001 , a respected , long - term informant gave an interview to two FBI agents .
The details of the interview are documented internally within the FBI ( on so - called " 302 forms " ) , and have been confirmed and reported in various respectable media outlets such as the Chicago Tribune .
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds , who has apparently seen the transcript of the interview , testified to the 911 Commission for more than 3 hours .
When the 911 Commission report was released , Sibel was furious that significant , relevant information that she had provided had been excluded from the report , and she decided to share some of the details in an open letter to the Commission .
In the letter , among other things , she outlined some of the information that was provided by the informant in the April 2001 interview :
Through his contacts in Afghanistan , he received information that :
1 ) Osama bin Laden was planning a major terrorist attack in the United States targeting four or five major cities ;
2 ) the attack was going to involve airplanes ;
3 ) some of the individuals in charge of carrying out this attack were already in place in the United States ;
4 ) the attack was going to be carried out soon , in a few months .
On April 14 in the Village Voice , James Ridgeway wrote :
" Despite the best efforts of the Jersey Girls , leaders of the 9 - 11 Family Steering Committee , no member of the 9 - 11 commission this afternoon asked FBI chief Robert Mueller embarrassing questions about two former FBI translators who claim to have knowledge bearing on the attacks .
One of them says she is being suppressed and can't talk because Attorney general John Ashcroft has placed a gag order on her . "
[ Michael ]
Scheuer was the head of the Bin Laden unit , Alec Station , at the CIA .
Scott asked Scheuer about the pre-911 warning that Sibel speaks of - and Scheuer said that he'd never heard of it ...
Why did n't the CIA put them on no fly lists ?
Why did n't the FBI put them on no fly lists ?
The INS ?
Remember , these officials ( like Scheuer and Clarke and Tenet ) have told us that al Qaeda were the most dangerous terrorists on planet Earth and in the summer of '01 the system was blinking red .

lukery ( here and here ) has compiled in one place what we know about what Sibel Edmonds knows about 9/11 .
I will here give a few oversized chunks ; you are encouraged to read the original .
Was this info the basis of the now - infamous August 6 Presidential Daily Brief ?
Apparently not .
That data seems to have come from elsewhere , perhaps from France 's " man inside .

Did the CIA get the info in a timely fashion ?
No .
The FBI - CIA rivalry is ancient .
Still , I can not see how the Bureau would get such data before the Agency , and no one can understand why the FBI would sit on it .
A commenter on lukery 's site asks some darn good questions regarding terrorists al - Hazmi and al - Mihdhar , whose presence within the U.S. was known , and even after they had attended the Malaysian terror summit :
Follow this trail , and you will see why the right has secretly funded what I call the " tranny " movement -- which was designed to place all non-official views of 9/11 behind what we may call a " laughter curtain . "

Ian Landsman 's 10 tips for moving from programmer to entrepreneur is excellent advice .
Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur .
One of the biggest issues I see is developers getting caught up in the code .
Spending countless hours making a function perfect or building features which show off the latest technology .
Now you have to write code to be in the software business .
It has to be high quality code that is n't filled with bugs or is insecure .
However , the best code in the world is meaningless if nobody knows about your product .
Code is meaningless if the IRS comes and throws you in jail because you did n't do your taxes .
Code is meaningless if you get sued because you did n't bother having a software license created by a lawyer .
Software developers love code .
But we 're biased .
And we write less of it than we think we do .
We spend far more time understanding code than writing it .
Anyway , as Ian points out , the importance of the code we do write is absolutely dwarfed by everything else that goes on around it .
Raise your hand if you 've ever poured your heart and soul into an application that never shipped .
I know I have .
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg ; there are hundreds of reasons the code you write may have zero impact on the world .
If nobody knows about your code , if nobody can understand your code , if for whatever reason your code does n't even ship … then have you really accomplished anything by writing that code ?
Maybe the best way to succeed as a programmer is to cut out the low value activities entirely and stop writing code altogether .
Steve Yegge explains :
Do you have any programming heroes ?
I do !
Oddly enough , though , I 've never really seen much of their code .
Most of the famous - ish programmers I respect have actually made their impact on me through writing , and it 's usually just prose , with maybe a little code interspersed .
There are programmers I admire who 've built things that I use a lot .
But when I try to come up with a list of programmers I admire ( and I specifically mean people I do n't know personally ) , I find they almost always fall into one ( or both ) of just two categories :
People who wrote a useful programming language , an operating system , or an especially important framework .
People who wrote a really neat book about programming .
When someone builds a framework – any environment that we live in and actually enjoy programming in – and there 's one person who 's chiefly identifiable as the primary author of that framework , then I think we tend to admire that person , and unlike other programmers , the person starts to become famous .
Even if they 're a crappy programmer .
Not that we 'd really know , because how often do we go look at the source code for the frameworks we use ?
How much time have you spent examining the source code of your favorite programming language 's compiler , interpreter or VM ?
And by the time such systems reach sufficient size and usefulness , how much of that code was actually penned by the original author ?
Am I really telling developers to stop writing code ?
No , not really .
Developers are already good at writing code .
It 's why they became software developers in the first place .
Writing reams of code just digs you deeper into an already deeply specialized skill .
What I am proposing is that we spend less time coding and more time developing skills in other areas that complement our coding skills .
Become a better writer .
Become a better speaker .
Improve your personal skills .
Participate in the community .
Try to spend some time talking to people instead of the compiler .
That 's how you distinguish yourself from your peers .
And that 's ultimately how you become a better software developer , too .
Of course , this is n't a zero -sum game .
You can have it both ways .
Ideally , you 'd write code , and then write or talk about the code in a way that inspires and illuminates other people .
But we do n't have an infinite amount of time , either .
If you have to choose between writing code and writing about code , remember which side of the equation is more important – and balance accordingly .

Britons could lose the privilege of visiting the U.S. without a visa because of fears over the terrorist threat from within the British Pakistani community .
U.S. security officials are deeply concerned at the ease with which young Britons who have trained in Pakistani terror camps can enter America under the visa - waiver programme .
Their concerns were heightened this week when five men , most of whom were Britons of Pakistani descent , were jailed for life for terrorism offences .
The leader of the terror cell , Omar Khyam , 25 , had trained in Kashmir , Afghanistan and Pakistan , while two of the July 7 suicide bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer , had trained in Pakistan .
U.S. officials point out that any members of the two terror cells would have been able to enter the U.S. as holidaymakers using the visa - waiver system .
Michael Chertoff , the U.S. homeland security chief , believes it is unacceptable that Britons can enter his country without a visa while Pakistani citizens have to undergo rigorous screening to obtain one .
He is holding talks with British officials aimed at closing the " loophole " .
One option on the table is to single out Britons of Pakistani descent and force them to complete a tough visa application .
The visa - waiver programme , which applies to Britain and several other countries , means Britons do not need a visa if they are travelling on a major airline or shipping line with a return ticket ; are visiting for business , pleasure or in transit ; do not plan to stay more than 90 days ; and do not have a criminal record .
Some four million Britons visit the U.S. each year - the vast majority without visas - so Britain strongly opposes any change to the current system .
U.S. officials have repeatedly voiced their concerns that the system could be exploited by terrorists .
Among the options on the table in the talks between Britain and the U.S. was the total
scrapping of the waiver programme , the New York Times reported yesterday .
It said another option would be to single out Britons of Pakistani origin , requiring them to make visa applications for the U.S. and to declare details of visits to Pakistan .
Each applicant would also have to undergo a face - to - face interview at a U.S. embassy .
British officials have told the U.S. this would lead to a bitter backlash from civil liberties campaigners .
It would also cause considerable embarrassment to Tony Blair , particularly as the majority of the British Pakistani community - which is some 800,000 - strong - has traditionally voted Labour .
They have said the U.S. should simply deport Britons who fail screening once they arrive , pointing out that details of those visiting are sent in advance by airlines .
An estimated 400,000 Britons visit Pakistan each year and the U.S. accepts it is only a tiny minority such as Khyam and Khan who could pose a threat .
But that minority is enough , Mr Chertoff believes , to introduce controls to stop potential terrorists from Britain who have no criminal record .
U.S. officials say at least four major terror trials are pending in the UK involving Britons of Pakistani origin who were unknown to the British authorities .
Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel told the New York Times that Khyam was the ' classic ' UK - Pakistani connection that Al Qaeda had used since 9/11 , adding : " His UK passport gave him international mobility . "
A British Embassy official in Washington said the visa - waiver programme was valuable and London would oppose moves to scrap it .
But he insisted Britain would not accept any special restrictions on British citizens of Pakistani heritage .
A State Department spokesman said the U.S. would " do what we can " to stop the visawaiver system being abused , but would not comment on whether it might be scrapped .
A British anti-terror investigator said yesterday : " We fully understand and share America 's concerns .
" The potential threat is obvious and the British passport provides Al Qaeda operatives with the chance of entering into the heartland of their greatest declared enemy with relative ease .
It poses a real problem . "
Six Arrested in Plot to Storm N.J. Army Base Six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to attack Fort Dix .
May 8 , 2007  --
Six members of an alleged homegrown terror cell that intended to use automatic weapons and rocket - propelled grenades in a commando - style attack on a military base in New Jersey were arrested by the FBI Monday night after a 15 - month investigation .
" Their alleged intention was to conduct an armed assault on the army base and to kill as many soldiers as possible , " a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in New Jersey said .
The Fort Monmouth Army Base in New Jersey , Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and the Coast Guard building in Philadelphia were allegedly considered as targets and put under surveillance by a New Jersey - based terror group before members settled on Fort Dix , where one cell member allegedly had unfettered access as a pizza delivery man , ABC News has learned .
Three high - level law enforcement sources told ABC News that the investigation into the plot had been ongoing for 15 months .
The suspects were described as illegal and legal residents of the U.S.
Four of the six suspects were born in Yugoslavia , one was born in Jordan and the other in Turkey .
There was no known direct link between this group and al Qaeda or other organized fundamentalist extremist groups .
The investigation began when a man walked into a photo shop and asked to convert a tape to a DVD , two law enforcement officials said .
The tape contained scenes of men conducting weapons training in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania , using handguns and rifles and firing live ammo , according to the federal complaints unsealed today in New Jersey .
The tape was intended for training purposes and to recruit more members to the group 's cause , according to law enforcement officials .
" We need to accumulate experience , and we need to think about how many we need and what they are going to do , and we need to gather the weapons , " one suspect , Mohamad Shnewer , was to have told an FBI informant in a recorded conversation , according to the federal compaint .
The technician making the dub of the training tape to DVD saw the content and notified authorities .
He told them the content he saw was " distrubing . "
The case was passed from regional counterterror officials in New Jersey to the Philadelphia FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force .
" The DVD depicted 10 young men who appeared to be in their 20s shooting assault - style weapons at a firing range in a militia - like style while calling for jihad and shouting in Arabic , ' Allah akbar , ' ( ' God is great ' ) , " the federal complaint said .
An investigation began , and it was soon determined that the men allegedly intended to assault a military base using automatic weapons .
Electronic eavesdropping and a confidential informant determined the men were serious in their intent .
Though the plot did not reach an operational phase , the alleged cell members completed their surveillance and selected Fort Dix as their target .
It was chosen because one cell member 's family owned a pizza parlor near the base , and that member was able to enter the base to deliver pizza .
The group believed this access would enable its attack to succeed .
Early today about six members of the group were arrested when they met to pick up Russian - style assault rifles described by authorities as AK - 47s and U.S. M - 16 automatic rifles for the men .
Jihadist propaganda material , including " generalized messages " from Osama bin Laden and other leaders , was seized , authorities said .
It had been downloaded from the Internet .
Five of the six defendants are charged with " plotting to kill as many soldiers as possible " in an armed assault on Fort Dix .
The sixth defendant is charged with related charges of aiding and abetting the possession of illegal firearms .
Philadelphia Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI said in a statement , " I want to especially salute the unsung hero who took the initiative to report the video to authorities . "
Those arrested and charged with plotting to kill the soldiers are Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer , 22 , Eljvir Duka , 23 , Dritan Duka , 28 , Shain Duka , 26 , Serdar Tatar , 23 .
Agron Abdullahu , 24 , was arrested and charged with aiding and abetting .

The documents have been sealed in envelopes for nearly 70 years
The documents were sent to the UK's Royal Society for safekeeping by James Chadwick , discoverer of the neutron , during World War II .
He felt their contents , which described cutting - edge science , were far too sensitive to publish at the time .
The envelopes were recently discovered in the science academy 's archives .
I can see why these papers were locked away during the war
Brian Cox , Cern
Keith Moore , head of library and archives at the Royal Society , said : " The papers have only recently been discovered as part of our ongoing programme to catalogue the Society 's archives .
" The documents have been sealed for so long it only seemed right to wait for an occasion to open them .
The anniversary of Chadwick 's discovery seemed fitting . "
' Inadvisable to publish '
The envelopes contain the work of two French scientists , Hans Von Halban and Lew Kowarski , who worked in the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge .
The documents detail experiments on nuclear fission , covering the components needed to make a nuclear reactor , how to create plutonium from uranium , and methods to stabilise nuclear chain reactions .
Dr Brian Cox , a particle physicist from Cern , said : " These papers describe what was cutting - edge science at the time .
James Chadwick realised the sensitive nature of the documents
" The sheer amount of knowledge that these papers contain amazes me - only eight years after Chadwick discovered that a neutron even existed , these scientists are already looking at how to use neutrons to bring about nuclear fission and energy .
" I can see why these papers were locked away during the war - they contain details that could be used to build a nuclear reactor . "
The sealed envelopes were accompanied by a letter from Professor Chadwick .
Recognising the possible consequences of nuclear fission 's massive energy releases , he wrote that the work was " inadvisable to publish at the present time " .
Dr Cox said : " These papers are a truly significant part of nuclear history .
They provide a fascinating insight into the inquisitive nature of scientists working in a field moving so rapidly it was almost outpacing them .
" It is fascinating to read their views on what might come of their research - and how accurate some of their predictions have been . "

As everyone finishes up their tax returns , here is a thought that college students should appreciate : Maybe they should face lower tax rates than those of us in middle age .
Current law uses many factors beyond income to set a person 's tax liability -- marital status , number of children , mortgage size , charitable giving , and so on .
Age is one variable conspicuously omitted .
Yet in a wonderful but still unpublished paper titled " Should Taxes Be Independent of Age ? " my Harvard colleague Michael Kremer suggests that younger workers should face lower income tax rates than older workers .
To understand Kremer 's argument , start with a simple premise :
An income tax discourages people from working and thus prevents the economy from reaching its full potential .
Tax cuts reduce this disincentive , encourage people to work harder , and expand the economic pie .
Yet tax cuts do not affect everyone the same .
For instance , suppose that the government were to cut the tax rates that apply to the first $ 50,000 of earnings .
Taxpayers with incomes below $ 50,000 would have a greater incentive to try to make more money because each dollar of earnings would be taxed at a lower rate .
But that is not true for someone earning above $ 50,000 .
This person would view the tax cut as infra-marginal -- the reward for additional work would not improve .
How much incentives are improved by such a tax cut , therefore , depends on the ratio of low - income to high - income taxpayers .
That ratio , in turn , varies by age .
Few 20 - year - olds make more than $ 50,000 a year , so this tax cut would encourage almost everyone in that age group to work harder .
Yet because many more 40 - year - olds are in the high - income group , the tax cut would boost incentives for far fewer of them .
Not only is it easier to improve incentives for young workers , but they are also more likely to respond .
Middle - aged workers are often locked into jobs that give them little choice about how much they work .
Young workers are still choosing career paths and have more flexibility .
As a result , their labor supply elasticities are larger .
Kremer estimates that young workers are about four times more responsive to work incentives than the middle aged .
The bottom line :
If the government wants to get the most economic gain for each dollar of lost tax revenue , tax cuts for younger workers are better than tax cuts for the middle - aged .
That is hard for me , as a 48 year old , to admit .
But I do n't see any holes in Kremer 's logic .
Update and Technical Clarification : Some of the comments on this post reflect a confusion about Kremer 's argument ( undoubtedly my fault ) , so let me try to be more precise .
Consider the marginal tax rate at an income of x .
This is the amount of extra tax a person would owe if he earned $ 1 more , so his income went to x+1 .
If we reduce just this marginal tax rate , it will have an incentive effect only for people making x .
But the tax cut will lose tax revenue for all those people making more than x , who get an inframarginal tax cut but experience no incentive effect from the tax change .
If f(x ) is the density for the distribution of income , and F( x ) the cumulative distribution , the ratio of marginal to inframarginal taxpayers at income x is f(x ) / [ 1 - F( x ) ] .
This ratio , Kremer shows , is age - dependent .
It is larger for younger workers .
As a result , reducing the tax rate at any income x will incentivize more workers per unit of lost tax revenue if the tax cut is applied to younger workers only .
Kremer 's second claim is that the young have larger labor supply elasticities .
This is a different argument for why taxes should be age - dependent which points in the same direction as the first .
The first argument is more technical and , as a theoretical matter , more novel .
However , the two points are complementary :
Tax cuts incentivize more young workers , and young workers respond more to incentives .
Kremer 's analysis concludes that the young should face a lower tax rate at any given level of income .
Thus , the fact that the young have lower tax rates because they have lower income does not mean that the Kremer recommendation is being implemented in the world .
To follow Kremer 's advice , we would need to make the tax schedule a function of age .
In the middle of the road into the Nahr al - Bared Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon , scene of fierce fighting for the past three days , a woman lay shot , her body convulsing , unreachable by the army and Red Cross as snipers continued to fire over her .
Inside the devastated camp , residents waited without water or electricity for a ceasefire to come into effect .
Coming under sniper fire from two positions , a woman clutching her child screamed , " Take us out of here , please take us out of here , they are going to kill us . "
Peering out from a doorway , an older woman cried out , ducking as the bullets cracked and hissed through the air .
" We have children in here , they need milk .
Help us . "
Many of the villagers wanted to flee but said they were refugees and had nowhere to go , even if they were able to escape the camp .
But late last night thousands were on the move - women clutching children and piling up in pickup trucks , some waving white flags , others fleeing on foot .
Ambulances could be seen evacuating the wounded .
UN relief officials said they expected up to 10,000 refugees to flee the camp through the night .
Earlier , inside a destroyed ceramics shop , a family taking shelter were huddled in the middle of the room , surrounded by shattered porcelain , taking cover from snipers at the front and rear of the building .
" We just want to leave , " said 32 - year - old mother Wafa .
" We have been trapped here for three days .
The army is shooting at us , Fatah al - Islam is shooting at us . "
The family said there had been massive civilian casualties inflicted by both the militants and the army 's indiscriminate shelling .
Some neighbourhoods had been completely destroyed , with most homes in the camp riddled with bullet holes or shrapnel scars .
Shattered glass lay strewn across the camp 's narrow streets , blast - blackened shop fronts spilling out onto the road where cars ripped apart by mortar fire lay twisted and burnt .
One resident , Marwan , described a street in the centre of town littered with bodies and said many people who had taken refuge in the ground floor of their homes were now buried under rubble .
" It 's terrible here , there is no electricity and that means no water .
There is no clinic to tend the wounded in the camp so many may die . "
He described how the camp 's mosque had been converted into a makeshift clinic where doctors from the camp were doing their best to treat the many wounded .
After much deliberation with the army and confirmation of a limited ceasefire a convoy of UN trucks bearing water , milk , food and other supplies as well as a generator was allowed into the camp .
Before it was able to unload the supplies it came under mortar fire , from the army according to one witness , and had to abandon the water and generator trucks half - destroyed by the explosions .
Residents described their hostility towards the Fatah al - Islam militants , " They are holding us hostage , we feel as if we have been kidnapped , " said Marwan , a former military commander of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
" We are pleading with the army to stop shelling the camp .
When you rescue a hijacked plane , you kill the hijacker , not all the hostages . "
Residents described a huge riot against the militants in the camp , where 300 residents had taken to the streets to demand they leave the camp .
" Fatah al - Islam fired on the demonstrators and everybody fled , " said 51 - year - old Nour .
" Everybody has wanted to leave since Sunday but the army would n't let us out .
They even shot at the ambulances coming in to help us . "
At the south entrance to the camp nervous soldiers aggressively searched the ambulance , shouting at the medics .
The Palestinian Red Crescent vehicles were relaying wounded from the makeshift clinic to the camp entrance where Lebanese Red Cross ambulances would take them on to the hospital in Tripoli .
The Red Cross , staffed entirely by unpaid volunteers , had taken on nearly 200 extra staff to cope with the overwhelming number of wounded .
A slow trickle of residents had managed to get out of the camp , braving the sniper fire with only white flags to protect them .
One witness described more than 50 bodies in the street , " You can smell them , and the smell is getting worse . "
The man blamed the Lebanese government for the carnage , " The government is attacking us .
We do n't know why .
They are meant to be hitting Fatah al - Islam but they are only killing civilians . "
Another Enemy of the People ?
Mark Graber
I am posting the below with the permission of Professor Walter F. Murphy , emeritus of Princeton University .
For those who do not know , Professor Murphy is easily the most distinguished scholar of public law in political science .
His works on both constitutional theory and judicial behavior are classics in the field .
Bluntly , legal scholarship that does not engage many themes in his book , briefly noted below , Constitutional Democracy , may be legal , but can not be said to be scholarship .
As interesting , for present purposes , readers of the book will discover that Murphy is hardly a conventional political or legal liberal .
While he holds some opinions , most notably on welfare , similar to opinions held on the political left , he is a sharp critic of ROE V. WADE , and supported the Alito nomination .
Apparently these credentials and others noted below are no longer sufficient to prevent one from becoming an enemy of the people .
" On 1 March 07 , I was scheduled to fly on American Airlines to Newark , NJ , to attend an academic conference at Princeton University , designed to focus on my latest scholarly book , Constitutional Democracy , published by Johns Hopkins University Press this past Thanksgiving . "
" When I tried to use the curb - side check in at the Sunport , I was denied a boarding pass because I was on the Terrorist Watch list .
I was instructed to go inside and talk to a clerk .
At this point , I should note that I am not only the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence ( emeritus ) but also a retired Marine colonel .
I fought in the Korean War as a young lieutenant , was wounded , and decorated for heroism .
I remained a professional soldier for more than five years and then accepted a commission as a reserve office , serving for an additional 19 years . "
" I presented my credentials from the Marine Corps to a very polite clerk for American Airlines .
One of the two people to whom I talked asked a question and offered a frightening comment : " Have you been in any peace marches ?
We ban a lot of people from flying because of that . "
I explained that I had not so marched but had , in September , 2006 , given a lecture at Princeton , televised and put on the Web , highly critical of George Bush for his many violations of the Constitution .
" That 'll do it , " the man said . "
" After carefully examining my credentials , the clerk asked if he could take them to TSA officials .
I agreed .
He returned about ten minutes later and said I could have a boarding pass , but added : " I must warn you , they=re going to ransack your luggage . "
On my return flight , I had no problem with obtaining a boarding pass , but my luggage was " lost . "
Airlines do lose a lot of luggage and this " loss " could have been a mere coincidence .
In light of previous events , however , I 'm a tad skeptical . "
" I confess to having been furious that any American citizen would be singled out for governmental harassment because he or she criticized any elected official , Democrat or Republican .
That harassment is , in and of itself , a flagrant violation not only of the First Amendment but also of our entire scheme of constitutional government .
This effort to punish a critic states my lecture 's argument far more eloquently and forcefully than I ever could .
Further , that an administration headed by two men who had " had other priorities " than to risk their own lives when their turn to fight for their country came up , should brand as a threat to the United States a person who did not run away but stood up and fought for his country and was wounded in battle , goes beyond the outrageous .
Although less lethal , it is of the same evil ilk as punishing Ambassador Joseph Wilson for criticizing Bush 's false claims by " outing " his wife , Valerie Plaime , thereby putting at risk her life as well as the lives of many people with whom she had had contact as an agent of the CIA . ... "
" I have a personal stake here , but so do all Americans who take their political system seriously .
Thus I hope you and your colleagues will take some positive action to bring the Administration 's conduct to the attention of a far larger , and more influential , audience than I could hope to reach . "

The commission says poor English skills hinder integration
The Commission on Integration and Cohesion says language is the single largest barrier to community relations .
Communities Secretary Ruth Kelly launched its report , saying far - right groups which spread " myths " about the multi-racial UK must also be tackled .
Critics say the English language proposals are " impractical " .
Ms Kelly set up the commission last summer amid pressure over multiculturalism and claims that not enough had been done to tackle issues raised by the July 2005 London bombings .
If you can't speak English , you are on a path to isolation and separation
Commission chair Darra Singh
The English challenge
In its interim report , the commission asks whether enough is being done to ensure that the correct first steps are taken to integrate two key groups into British society : foreign migrant workers and spouses .
If people do not speak any English on coming to the UK , the commission says ministers should consider changing immigration rules to ensure they have some command of the language before being allowed to come as a worker or through marriage .
Commission chairman Darra Singh said : " Learning English is clearly the responsibility of the individual , but local authorities , central government and employers have a key role in supporting migrants to improve their language skills . "
INTEGRATION COMMISSION : KEY AIMS
Examine why tension grows
Help politicians break down barriers Study how communities tackle extremism Research strong and successful communities
The cost in translation
The UK 's ties that bind
He added : " If you ca n't speak English - whether you are a new migrant or someone who has lived here for years - you are on a path to isolation and separation . "
Speaking at the London launch of the interim report , Ms Kelly said helping migrants to integrate must be accompanied by improved efforts to take on " poisonous " far - right groups .
She accused such groups of promoting division by spreading " myths and misconceptions " about Britain 's multi-racial society .
" And it is because of this that I am determined to achieve a step change in the Government 's work to tackle far - right extremists , " she added .
She said policies over past decades had sometimes " emphasised what divides us at the cost of what unites us " .
Under current proposals , only migrants who are unemployed or on benefits will qualify for free English lessons from September .
The government also proposes to cut benefits to those who cannot prove they are learning English .
' Impractical '
Rehna Azim , a barrister and editor , said suggestions that immigrants should learn English before arriving in Britain were " impractical " .
She told the BBC's Today programme : " The idea that some young woman in Pakistan or Bangladesh can go to a class in her village to learn English when she knows nothing about this country is really ... impractical and it is not going to happen . "
She said what was needed was an integration programme showing arrivals in the UK around their new cities and introducing them to available services .
Learning English would then become a practical necessity , she said .
Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood told BBC
Five Live that it was not the problems of those who could not speak English but the issues facing young radical Muslims and alienated youths who already speak the language that needed to be tackled .
Nick Pearce , director of the Institute for Public Policy Research , said the government needed to put more resources into language training .
He added : " The more people living in Britain who speak English , the better .
" But it would be impractical and unrealistic to expect the families of short - term migrant workers coming to do key jobs in our economy to pass a test before they arrive . "
Ms Kelly said her department would study the commission 's recommendations carefully in June before responding .
ARD
But , they can't touch the German Courts ( yet ) .
The story was the lead today on German TV network 's evening news program , Tagesschau .
The text , translated by yours truly from the website , follows :
CIA
Arrest warrants issued against 13 suspects
A Munich court has issued arrest warrants against 13 responsible agents of the US secret service CIA because of suspicion of their involvment in the kidnapping and abuse of the German citizen Khaled al Masri .
The State Prosecutor for Munich ( Part I ) disclosed this today in a press conference .
The 13 accused are under strong suspicion of having dragged al Masri off to Afghanistan in 2004 .
The arrest warrants specify charges of " deprivation of freedom " ( which I suspect is similar to our offenses of false arrest , false imprisonment or kidnapping ) and of causing severe bodily injury .
" Prior revelations made it possible to deduce the ( true ) names of the accused presented in the arrest warrants - from the cover names of the CIA operatives , " explained the lead State prosecutor Christian Schmidt - Sommerfeld .
Because of a legal investigative request directed to the Spanish authorities , it was first made possible in the year 2006 to " investigate concrete ( ly identified ) persons and make orderly the chronology of the kidnapping , " said Schmidt - Sommerfeld .
Additional information about these people came from the Milan Prosecutor 's office and the counsel to the EU Parliament ( Ghost Air ) investigator , Dick Marty .
Information from Spain .
The first information came from al Masri's ( personal ) attorney .
In December 2005 he turned over to the State prosecutors a list of names which a Spanish journalist had derived from a report the ( Spanish ) Guardia Civil ( a national police force ) had assembled , with ( containing ) the information that it dealt with the employment of aircraft in which al Masri himself had reported flew him from Macedonia to Afghanistan .
The prosecutor said the further analysis concentrated on the investigation of the true identities of the accused .
According to research ( revealed first ) in the ARD politcal magazine show " Panorama " , most of them live in the US state North Carolina .
In September 2006 " Panorama " had confronted three of them with the accusations , but the suspects refused all attempts to have them comment . *
In three instances the magazine show was successful in finding out the actual addresses and names of the actors **.
Once there it dealt with the pilots , who had traveled to Spain under the cover names of [ omitted by me ] , [ omitted by me ] , and [ omitted by me ] .
" Panorama " :
The covers were simple .
According to Panorama , uncovering the mens ' CIA covers proceeded relatively easily .
The men were permitted to retain their first names , their birth dates were partly modified with the help of transpositions , and the data for the required Pilot 's medical examination was kept mostly complete .
They worked openly in North Carolina for the firm Aero Contractors ; in one case the work relationship was confirmed .
The firm Aero Contractors is publicly known as ( for all intents and purposes , factually ) a successor firm to Air America , which operated in the 70s as a secret airline for the CIA .
German arrest warrants are not valid in the USA
It is expected arrests of the accused will be difficult to arrange .
The German arrest warrants have no validity in the United States , and the US Justice Department has so far rejected and refused to assist the German investigation .
Nevertheless , in the event the accused travel to Europe , they can be arrested immediately .
1 Shady black market weapons dealer : { showing off an imposing looking heavy weapon}
This plasma cannon is a quantum leap ahead of its competitors !
2 Iki Piki :
That little difference , huh ?
2
Shady black market weapons dealer : What ?
3 Iki Piki : A quantum is the smallest possible unit of change .
It 's impossible to be any more similar without being identical .
3
Shady black market weapons dealer :
What are you saying ?
4 Iki Piki : Never mind .
Your brain is clearly a quantum leap above primordial protoplasm .
4
Shady black market weapons dealer : Flattery ai n't gonna get you a better deal , bub .
The word quantum is derived from quantity , as it describes a fundamental indivisible unit of energy in modern physics theory .
In our everyday macroscopic world , we are used to energy being pretty much divisible as far as we care to play with it .
As a concrete example , we can adjust the brightness of a light source continuously from painfully bright to so dim that it starts to be difficult , or even impossible , for us to see it .
We do n't see discrete steps at any point - the amount of light varies gradually and smoothly ( assuming we have decent dimming circuitry ) .
Light behaves kind of like a fluid in this way , a stream of water if you will .
We can vary a flow of water from a torrent to a trickle , setting it to any rate of flow we like in between .
We are n't restricted to particular rates of water flow , because we can divide the water up as finely as we like and it 's still basically water with the same properties .
Except that 's not actually true when we get down to a submicroscopic level .
Water is made of molecules ( each one made of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms , but that 's an annotation in itself for another time ) .
Each molecule is a discrete particle of water , which it is impossible to divide further ( without becoming something other than water ) .
So if we reduce the water flow enough , we eventually get to a point where we are letting a fairly small number of water molecules go by .
We can imagine reducing the flow so much that we only let one molecule of water go per second .
Or per minute , or even per hour .
There is still a flow of water , but it 's no longer the smooth , rippling , infinitely divisible thing we are familiar with .
It 's like lumps of rock flowing past .
Water is quantised - exists as discrete chunks of water - and the quantum of water is a water molecule .
Water is grainy , but at a scale so small that we do n't notice it .
It 's the same thing with light .
Light looks smooth and even and infinitely controllable to us .
But it too is quantised , in tiny packets which we call photons .
If you dim a light far enough ( and not actually very far beyond the level where we can still see it ) , the light starts to look no longer like a continuous stream , but becomes detectable discrete chunks .
Again , like the water , these chunks of light are so small that in our everyday life we never notice them .
But they are there .
Light is grainy , just like water .
And that 's what a quantum is - the smallest possible unit of difference .
So when advertising people say something is a quantum leap better than something else , they really mean it 's so similar that you can't tell the difference .
The other point of view is that when studying a quantum system , the jump from one quantum state to another is often a significant change .
It kind of has to be , because it 's a " jump " , in the sense that it does n't go through any intermediate stages .
For example , the lowest energy state of an electron in a hydrogen atom is - 13.6 electronvolts ( eV ) . [ 1 ]
The next lowest energy state is - 3.4 eV .
States of energy between - 13.6 eV and - 3.4 eV are not available , by the laws of quantum mechanics .
It 's not possible for an electron to be bound in a hydrogen atom with an energy of - 9.7 eV .
So rather than going from - 13.6 eV to just - 13.5 eV , the quantum leap takes it all the way to - 3.4 eV .
So , looking at this way , the quantum leap is actually much bigger than an amount of change that you might otherwise think you could take .
But , in the big scheme of things ( i.e. from our macroscopic point of view ) , 10 eV is actually a piddlingly small amount of energy .
It would run a typical mid-sized car for approximately 10 - 22 of a second .
The energy you use to blink your eyes once would run your car for roughly 1017 ( a hundred thousand trillion ) times longer than that .
[ 1 ]
The energy states of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom have negative energies because as you pull the electron further away it gains electrical potential energy ( in the same way that if you raise a mass above the surface of the Earth it gains gravitational potential energy ) .
The zero level of energy is defined to be when the electron is not bound to the hydrogen atom .
So when it becomes bound to the atom , the electron loses potential energy from this zero starting point , resulting in a negative energy .

He flew more Spitfires than any other man and was hailed as the greatest test pilot of World War II .
He risked his life repeatedly to iron out dangerous problems with the RAF 's aircraft , saving the lives of countless aircrew .
And he was the only pilot ever to ' roll ' the massive Lancaster bomber upside - down in mid air ... just for fun .
The death of Alex Henshaw at 94 concludes a remarkable story of courage , danger , astonishing skill and devilment .
He survived numerous crashes and frequently clashed with officials who disapproved of his antics - which included bringing the centre of Birmingham to a standstill by flying his Spitfire upside - down only feet above the rooftops .
During the war years he test - flew some 3,000 Spitfires as they rolled off the production line - more than 10 per cent of all those ever built .
As recently as last year he took the controls of a Spitfire in a special flight to mark the aircraft 's 70th anniversary , and appeared to have lost little of his old skill .
Born and raised in Lincolnshire , the son of a wealthy businessman , Alex Henshaw began flying as a teenager and by his mid-20s was winning aviation prizes .
In 1939 , he set a record for the fastest solo return flight from Britain to South Africa in less than 80 hours , which still stands today .
When war broke out he volunteered to fly RAF fighters but was offered a job as a manufacturing test pilot before his application could be processed .
The Spitfire was already in service with the RAF by then , but as chief test pilot at Supermarine 's Spitfire factory in Castle Bromwich , Birmingham , he played a vital role in developing and enhancing the legendary fighter as the war went on , as well as famous bomber aircraft including the Wellington and the Lancaster .
He later commented : ' The Spitfire did n't win the Battle of Britain , but the battle would have been lost without the Spitfire , and had the battle been lost then we would have lost the war . '
Once in a high - speed test dive he was knocked out and thrown clear of the aircraft .
He regained consciousness in mid air only to find his parachute torn almost to threads - held together by a single silk strand at the edge .
Astonishingly he landed safely .
In one crash , he suffered engine failure , crashed into a row of houses and ended up huddled in a crushed section of the cockpit which somehow remained intact .
Every aircraft coming off the production line had to be test flown before delivery to hard - pressed frontline units , and he would often test 20 in a day , working for 20 hours .
After the war he went into the family 's farming and tourism business .
He died at his home in Newmarket at the weekend .
His wife Barbara died in 1996 .
He is survived by his son , also called Alex .
Bill Bond , founder of the Battle of Britain Memorial Society , said : ' Alex was a remarkable man - the greatest test pilot of the war .
His one regret was that he never flew in a frontline squadron during the Battle of Britain , but I do n't think he would have been allowed to .
His skills were too valuable .'
Wal - Mart takes aim at Democratic critics
No. 1 retailer sends ' voter guides ' to its 18,000 Iowa employees , criticizing presidential hopefuls who have joined company 's critics .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wal - Mart Stores is hitting back at some leading Democratic presidential hopefuls who have joined with the company 's critics recently .
The world 's largest retailer announced it is sending out what it terms a " voter education guide " to its 18,000 Iowa employees , criticizing politicians who have recently joined with the union - backed group " Wake Up Wal - Mart " for a series of rallies .
Iowa holds the nation 's first presidential caucus , and potential candidates are already visiting the state .
" We believe it 's wrong for these political candidates to attack Wal - Mart and the transformation under way at our company , " the letter said .
" We would never suggest to you how to vote , but we have an obligation to tell you when politicians are saying something about your company that is n't true . "
The company 's critics charge that Wal - Mart fails to provide health care for more than half its workers , pays what it calls " poverty " wages , and helps to shift U.S. jobs overseas by selling low - priced imports .
The Wake - Up Wal - Mart group issued its own release in response to the Wal - Mart voter efforts .
" We welcome Wal - Mart 's attempts to try and defend itself with its employees , political leaders and the American people , " the group 's statement said .
" The debate over Wal - Mart is of critical importance to the future of our country .
Sadly , not one single employee or any citizen will ever hear the truth from Wal - Mart about the negative impact it has on its workers or working families because Wal - Mart does everything it can to hide its real record . "
Wal - Mart said it would invite the candidates to come to its Iowa stores and meet its employees .
It released a letter it sent to one of the hopefuls , Sen . Evan Bayh , D - Indiana , from its regional manager in Iowa in which it said it wanted Bayh to visit " without the fanfare of media or staff or supporters .
" We do n't want this to be about politics - the union - funded groups are already doing enough of that for the both of us , " the letter said .
The company 's letter to its Iowa employees said it is important that they help it respond to criticism .
" We want you to know that your voice matters when these political candidates attack your company .
We urge you to talk with your friends , your family and your neighbors about the good Wal - Mart does , " the letter said .
The company 's press release said that polling data shows voters do not agree with attacks on Wal - Mart by candidates .
According to the release , 62 percent of those surveyed by Democratic pollster Thomas Riehle for the Cook Political Report disapprove of " Democratic candidates making Wal - Mart an issue in November 's elections , " while only 21 percent approve .
Even a majority of union households opposed this strategy , according to the company .
Overall , 40 percent of registered voters would vote against an anti-Wal - Mart Democratic candidate , while just 18 percent would vote for such a candidate , the company 's statement said .
Wal - Mart 's letter to its employees says that published schedules show U.S. Sens.
Evan Bayh of Indiana and Joseph Biden of Delaware , and Govs. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Tom Vilsack of Iowa are taking part in the rallies against the company .
The company 's letter does not mention Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , another prospective candidate who the Wake - Up Wal - Mart site said has also joined the group in criticism of the company .

Why YCombinator is a waste of time
Let me tell you a story about my cousin , Steven .
Steven wanted to become a musician .
He had a rock band he diligently put together , and they actually came together and recorded an Album .
When he played the album for me , he described it as a mixture of Green Day with some Linkin Pa rk .
He told me how he took the best of both bands and c reated his own sound .
The problem was , his music was boring , and his band sounded like hundreds of other indie bands .
Steven was just an average looking guy , his band was good but not brilliant , his music was solid , but not different .
Steven believed in his band , and he was just good enough for everyone to encourage him to go on working on music , but never good enough to attract a fan base .
But Steven never even tried to build up fans .
He never played his music for totally random people , and asked them for their opinion .
All he did was try to get the people at the record labels inter ested in his music .
He called and hounded , he stalked and staked out .
He kept chasing those labels for years and years , and then suddenly gave up .

D. radiodurans is one of the hardiest organisms known
A handful of bacteria on Earth today have the ability to survive exposure to extremely high levels of radiation that would kill other organisms .
Now , a team of scientists argues that the bugs could only have evolved this unusual ability on a planet like Mars .
The claims by a Russian - American team appear in the journal Astrobiology .
Recent discoveries of water in the permafrost on Mars and signs of subsurface water in mid-latitude regions have raised hopes that the Red Planet might host the right conditions for life .
According to one theory , impacts on the surface of the Red Planet could have thrown Martian rocks into space , which wandered the vaccum before tumbling through Earth 's atmosphere and crashing down as meteorites .
If these Martian meteorites contained any life forms able to survive the journey , they might have been able to gain a foothold on our own planet , scientists speculate .
' Conan the bacterium '
The best - studied radiation - resistant microbe is Deinococcus radiodurans .
It can withstand several thousand times the lethal dose of radiation for humans , and has been nicknamed " Conan the bacterium " by microbiologists .
But other scientists say that radiation tolerance is a side effect of the defence mechanism bacteria such as D. radiodurans have developed to protect against dehydration .
D. radiodurans and other radiation - resistant bacteria survive because they are very efficient at repairing their DNA .
But this is also useful for surviving extreme desiccation in arid environments .
The team led by Alexander Pavlov at the University of Arizona , US , rejects this alternative explanation .
" Our hypothesis of a Martian origin for radio - resistant bacteria provides an explanation for their ability to withstand ionizing radiation , a trait that appears to be of no value on Earth at any time in its history , " the scientists write in Astrobiology .
The clement background levels of radiation on Earth are not thought to have changed significantly for the last four billion years .
As such , there has been no evolutionary pressure for bacteria to develop resistance to such high levels of radiation , the researchers argue .
Trained up
But the Martian permafrost , where radiation levels are 100 times higher than on Earth , could provide a plausible environment where bacteria could pick up radiation - resistant genes .
In their paper , Professor Pavlov and his colleagues outline several pieces of evidence which cast doubt on the dehydration theory .
For example , they argue there is no evidence that the degree of resistance to radiation is related to the degree of resistance to dehydration in bacteria .
Instead , Pavlov and his colleagues argue that these are independent attributes .
Scientists have also carried out experiments in which they blast " ordinary " bacteria with gamma rays , allow the survivors to recover , and then repeat the process again and again .
After many cycles , the bacteria develop resistance to high levels of radiation .
But bugs exposed to successive cycles of dehydration and hydration in the lab develop resistance only to desiccation , not to radiation .
Scientists who are sceptical of the group 's claims have pointed out that the genome of D. radiodurans is very similar to that of " ordinary " terrestrial bacteria , arguing against an extra-terrestrial origin .
Pavlov and his colleagues say that frequent exchanges of bacteria carried on meteorites between Mars and Earth could explain this similarity .
Nasa says around 34 of the 24,000 meteorites so far found on Earth have been identified as coming from Mars .
Iran announced yesterday it would stage a conference to question the authenticity of the Holocaust , a move certain to stir international anger .
The statement follows a series of inflammatory remarks by Iran 's hawkish president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has described the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis in the second world war as a myth and called for Israel to be " wiped off the map " .
He has also suggested an alternative Jewish state should be set up in Europe or Alaska .
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said the proposed conference would examine the Holocaust 's " scientific aspects and its repercussions " .
The description echoes Mr Ahmadinejad 's characterisation of Holocaust denial earlier this month as a " scientific debate " .
It is not clear who will attend .
But following a chorus of anti-Zionist rhetoric since the president was elected last June , the announcement will trigger suspicions that the aim is to deny that the Holocaust happened .
Last month , Mr Ahmadinejad dismissed it as a concoction invented to justify Israel 's existence in the heart of the Muslim world .
His comments drew widespread condemnation .
At a meeting with President George Bush last week , the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , described Mr Ahmadinejad 's position on the Holocaust as unacceptable .
At a rare news conference on Saturday , however , the Iranian president was unrepentant .
He described Mrs Merkel and Mr Bush as terrorists and war criminals , who would soon be put on trial for their support of Israel .
Describing the Holocaust as a question that had to be cleared up by scholars , he added : " My question was very clear .
On the pretext of the killing of Jews in Europe , are they supporting the aggression and massacres [ of Israel ] ?
They will not intimidate me .
Instead they have to answer me .
If you started this killing of the Jews , you have to make amends yourself .
This is very clear .
It 's based on laws and legal considerations .
If you committed a mistake or a crime , why should others pay for it ?
Those who murdered [ the Jews ] should permit them to go back to their own fatherlands .
That should be the end of it .
You should n't say that nobody is permitted to say anything about this . "
Mr Ahmadinejad initially provoked an international storm by calling for Israel 's removal for the map last October .
His remarks repeated what had been official Iranian policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Support for the Palestinian cause is a central pillar in the ideology of Iran 's Islamic regime , which regards Israel 's existence as an affront to Muslims .
However , Mr Ahmadinejad has surpassed previous Iranian leaders in consistently attacking what he sees as the intellectual and moral basis for Israel 's existence .
Under his more liberal predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , anti-Zionist rhetoric was toned down .
Iranian officials said they would respect a Middle East peace settlement as long as it was acceptable to the Palestinians .
In denial
Some 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust .
However , deniers claim that Jewish deaths during the war were not caused by genocide .
The most prominent denier of recent years is historian David Irving , in custody in Austria , where Holocaust denial is illegal .
Mohammed Mahdi Akef , leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood , has also called the Holocaust a ' myth ' .

It was Donald Rumsfeld who said something about known knowns , known unknowns , and unknown unknowns , and whilst that might have sounded like just more gibberish , he did have a point .
Think back to the last time you sat an exam ; perhaps you had a reasonable idea of whether or not you were going to do well in it .
This is because you had an understanding of your knowledge on the subject that was to be tested and could make a prediction .
This reflection about your mental processes is termed metacognition , and it has been identified in humans and other primates , but the trait was always thought to be the preserve of our extended family tree .
Now , new data published online in Current Biology shows that rats have this ability too .
You 're probably wondering how one would test for metacognition in a species that is n't too good with essay questions .
The way it works is as follows : the animals are familiarized to a test that utilizes knowledge that they might have gained during a study period .
The animals are then given the chance to accept or decline the test .
If the test is accepted and passed , there is a large reward , and if it is declined there is a small reward .
If the test is accepted but failed , then there is no reward at all .
In this study , Allison Foote and Jonathon Crystal at the University of Georgia tested rats ' abilities to pass a duration - discrimination test where they heard either a short ( 2 - 3 sec ) or long ( 4 - 8 sec ) noise and then had to class the noise as either short or long by poking their noses into one of two holes .
The study found that the harder the discrimination task was , the more often it would be declined by the rats , and that if they were not given the option to decline the test , their accuracy declined .
This is the first time that such behavior has been demonstrated in animals other than primates , and may well provide the opportunity to further study the molecular basis of metacognition , and also the evolution of different cognitive skills across the animal kingdom .
Back in August of 2006 I wrote about a guy who had his unlimited Verizon EVDO Wireless Data Service canceled because buried deep into the Terms of Service ( TOS ) they mentioned some things that were unacceptable .
Some of these things included downloading / streaming music and videos … which is what the Internet is all about these days .
At the time Verizon did n’t explicitly state that their unlimited service really was limited , but I was looking at the service once again yesterday for someone and decided to see what the terms look like 7 – months later .
Now they explicitly come out and say that their unlimited plan can only be used for up to 5GB a month otherwise your usage will be considered unacceptable and your service will be terminated ( the bold text points out the important things ) :
Unlimited Data Plans and Features ( such as NationalAccess , BroadbandAccess , Push to Talk , and certain VZEmail services ) may ONLY be used with wireless devices for the following purposes : ( i ) Internet browsing ; ( ii ) email ; and ( iii ) intranet access ( including access to corporate intranets , email , and individual productivity applications like customer relationship management , sales force , and field service automation ) .
The Unlimited Data Plans and Features MAY NOT be used for any other purpose .
Examples of prohibited uses include , without limitation , the following : ( i ) continuous uploading , downloading or streaming of audio or video programming or games ; ( ii ) server devices or host computer applications , including , but not limited to , Web camera posts or broadcasts , automatic data feeds , automated machine –to–machine connections or peer–to–peer ( P2P ) file sharing ; or ( iii ) as a substitute or backup for private lines or dedicated data connections .
This means , by way of example only , that checking email , surfing the Internet , downloading legally acquired songs , and / or visiting corporate intranets is permitted , but downloading movies using P2P file sharing services and / or redirecting television signals for viewing on laptops is prohibited .
A person engaged in prohibited uses , continuously for one hour , could typically use 100 to 200 MBs , or , if engaged in prohibited uses for 10 hours a day , 7 days a week , could use more than 5 GBs in a month .
For individual use only and not for resale .
We reserve the right to protect our network from harm , which may impact legitimate data flows .
We reserve the right to limit throughput or amount of data transferred , and to deny or terminate service , without notice , to anyone we believe is using an Unlimited Data Plan or Feature in any manner prohibited above or whose usage adversely impacts our network or service levels .
Anyone using more than 5 GB per line in a given month is presumed to be using the service in a manner prohibited above , and we reserve the right to immediately terminate the service of any such person without notice .
We also reserve the right to terminate service upon expiration of Customer Agreement term .
So all the service is really good for is viewing websites and sending emails since you cannot download or upload anything .
They say that sending emails is okay , but what about if you constantly have large attachments in your email which results in high bandwidth usage ?
Does that fall under the download / upload restriction that can terminate your account , or is that considered acceptable use since it is an email ?
One of the other restrictions that they mention is that you must have another Internet service as well since you cannot use it as a substitute or backup of a dedicated Internet connection .
Even if all you do is check emails for work , you must have another Internet connection as your primary source for access .
So why would anyone use the service ?
Many people use it because their employers pay for it , and I ’m sure they never inform their employees about what they can and ca n’t do with it .
For that reason , a lot of people are “ inappropriately ” using the service which is good news for Verizon because they can terminate your account whenever they want .
I look at it as Verizon ’s way to cover their own back since they can sell the service to as many people as they possibly can , and then when their network starts to see a pattern of overall heavy usage , they can just terminate the people who use their accounts the most .
This will maximize their revenue while keeping the network usage to a minimum .
I definitely understand their reasoning for limiting the service to only 5GB of bandwidth per month , but what boggles my mind is how they can advertise this as unlimited when they explicitly say that any usage over 5 GB will cause your account to be terminated ?
Hello ladies .
Perhaps you 've been reading over at Life After the Oil Crash or The Die-Off .
Maybe you 're just observant and smart enough to have realized that the current Cornucopian Era is at an end , and things are going to get very bad , very fast as we approach the Olduvai Cliff in a few years and five billion or so people find themselves without a place on this planet .
It 's overwhelming , to be sure .
All the things you thought were in your future ...
The nice , new house in the suburbs , the SUV , the college - bound kids , the modern career ...
All of it gone like a waft of smoke in the wind .
The real future for most folks in America is going to be a choice of moving into the Government - run urban areas ( Fedghettos ) , where you 'll live under an unabashed Police State , but will probably have semi-regular access to the basics of modern life , or staying Outside , where there will be no reliable infrastructure .
No police , food distribution , water , power , gasoline , etc .
A relative handful of people have seen this coming for a while , and have taken steps to live free on the Outside without modern infrastructure .
This is a daunting task in reality .
Stocking a bunker with supplies and fuel only delays the inevitable .
Long - term living ( not just survival ) on the Outside will require not only physical resources , but knowledge and skills which have been nearly lost to the current generations .
If you 're just now realizing the truth of the situation , there is probably far too little time to save yourself .
Unless ...
I 'm a tall , brawny , 40 - something , 19th Century throwback of a man with farming , traditional blacksmithing , hunting , horsemanship ( of course ) , and other skills valuable to those trying to live Outside the Fedghettos in a post - collapse America .
My lovely wife of twenty years and I saw the writing on the wall some time ago , and have been striving to build a good - sized , sustainable homestead farm .
We 're working on a model of circa 1910 technology ( horse - drawn equipment , wood heat , etc. ) augmented by a few bits of infrastructure - independent modern technology ( solar - powered running water , radio communication , etc. ) .
We have a few more things to do , but we 're on - track to be as self - sufficient as it is possible to be in the near future .
The wife and myself can run this place after the grid fails and the gas stations , grocery stores , and feed mills shut down .
But it'd take both of us going full - out all the time .
Not only is that a poor way to live , it leaves no leeway in case either of us should get sick or injured .
After all we 've done to build an island of civilized , rural living that can withstand TEOTWAWKI , it'd be very sad to know it 'll disappear without a trace when we shuffle - off our mortal coils .
This is where you might come in ...
We need a concubine or two .
I use the term here to denote an " assistant wife " .
Someone to help the wife with all of her duties around the place .
Not just a harem girl .
Someone who might eventually become a sort of junior partner in our little operation .
( I do n't use any form of the term " wife " for the position because my wife has been a full partner through thick and thin for too long to ever have an equal . )
Our concubine will have a safe home when Law and Order crumbles .
She 'll have wholesome food and clean running water while many other people will be surviving on Government rations or scrounging for scraps .
She 'll have a warm woodstove in the Winter , and a clean " cement pond " in which to escape the Summer heat .
She wo n't be scared , hungry , or alone ...
And , after a couple of years to make sure everyone is happy with the situation , she can look forward to her child having a relatively civilized upbringing with an extensive , if informal , education .
Of course , it wo n't be a free ride .
The horses and I do the " heavy lifting " around here , but there are always plenty of other chores to be tended to .
It 's a simple , rustic kind of life .
But probably a darned sight better than living in the Fedghetto ( think about the Superdome after Katrina ) , popping out babies destined to be drafted into the endless Resource Wars .
Qualities of a potential concubine ...
Youth , within legal limits , of course .
It 'd be much easier for a younger woman to adapt to a radically different lifestyle , especially the inherent ' junior ' nature of the concubine 's initial role .
It 'd also be best if her Biological Clock alarm were n't already going off , causing her to want to have a baby before she 'd been on the farm long enough to know she could make it here .
Health .
If you rely on modern medicine to keep you going , you 'd probably have a better chance in the Fedghetto .
Fitness .
Every girl this side of Olive Oyl thinks she needs to lose weight .
That 's not going to be a problem .
We 'll all be getting skinny soon enough .
But country life is physical , and you need to be fit to live it .
Being at least somewhat athletic is a big plus .
Open mindedness ... Kinda ' goes without saying , as we are talking about a rather non-traditional living arrangement here .
( Amish Anarcho - libertarian Hippies ? )
A healthy libido and adventurous nature .
It ai n't all about growing corn and haying the horses back here .
I 've spent my whole life in the country , avoiding the various testosterone - reducing agents that have made so many American men unable to function without pills ...
And it shows .
The ability to deal with weapons .
You do n't need to be an expert .
Just willing to learn .
We 're not paramilitary " survivalist " stereotypes .
Our place is secluded , and our primary defense is staying " below the radar " .
But 911 is just Government - sponsored ' Dial - a - Prayer ' in the best of times , and wo n't even exist in the future .
We 'll be on our own , which means each of us is expected to have everyone else 's back when things get rough .
Which requires everyone to be able to handle the firearms safely and effectively .
The ability to deal with animals .
Again , you do n't need to be an expert .
We 'll teach you .
We 're fond of the draft horses , but remember they are working animals , not pets .
Remember that the pigs and freshening calves are food , so do n't get attached .
Unattached .
This is a lifeboat , and there 's limited space on - board .
Discreet .
When things settle down , and the small town within riding distance adapts into something akin to what it was a hundred years ago , we 'll trade and interact with the local community ...
But we 'll be doing better than most folks around here , do it would be wise to limit the amount of information we share , lest we invite envy and theft .
Ability to be content .
Some people never are .
Generations raised in the Cornucopian
Age often crave more , just for the sake of more , even though they are n't even using and enjoying what they already have .
To be happy here , you need to be able to appreciate " plenty " and be satisfied with it .
If you think you might be qualified and interested , respond here , send an email , or pop on over at the LATOC Forums and post a message .
The Modesto California Bee is reporting Hundreds delinquent on taxes .
Modesto and Patterson this summer are preparing to speed the foreclosure process on hundreds of homes because an unusually large number of residents in six subdivisions are delinquent on their Mello Roos taxes .
About 145 homes are at risk in parts of the Village I neighborhood in east Modesto and in the Fairview Village development in southwest Modesto .
In Patterson , 489 homes are delinquent on their Mello Roos taxes in the Patterson Gardens , Walker Ranch , Miraggio and Sutter Point developments .
Residents in those subdivisions could receive foreclosure notices by September because of the accelerated collections process in the special tax districts , Modesto City Manager George Britton and Patterson City Manager Cleve Morris said this week .
The Mello Roos taxes are different from the property taxes all homeowners pay .
Failure to pay general property taxes would not trigger foreclosure for five years .
The Mello Roos taxes are charges the cities established to support public improvements within the subdivisions .
The concentration of delinquent taxes in those subdivisions is so great that a clause was triggered in the bonds that forces the agencies to move to collections after just one missed tax payment .
Foreclosures
The percentage of U.S. mortgages entering foreclosure in the first three months of the year was the highest in more than 50 years , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
As the association released its numbers , the Federal Reserve held a hearing to determine whether regulators could do anything to crack down on abusive lending practices , which have exacerbated the problem .
The problems were n't uniformly spread around the country .
Doug Duncan , chief economist for the mortgage bankers group , said the rate of new foreclosures would have dropped had it not been for big jumps in California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona .
He said high rates in Ohio , Michigan and Indiana also drove up the overall percentage of loans in foreclosure .
Dumbness
Doug Duncan , chief economist for the mortgage bankers group , said the rate of new foreclosures would have dropped had it not been for big jumps in California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona .
Except for the problems I have , I would n't have any problems
Proof of income from borrowers .
No penalties for early mortgage payments .
And a guarantee that property taxes and insurance bills are covered .
The Federal Reserve is considering these and other measures as a way to remedy the troubled market for high - risk , or subprime , mortgages .
The central bank held an all - day hearing on the matter Thursday .
Lawmakers are pushing the Fed to act as late payments and new foreclosures on adjustable - rate home mortgages made to people with spotty credit climbed to all - time highs in the first three months of the year .
“ We have had more than enough talk , ” Sen .
Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio , said in a statement .
His state has been hit particularly hard by a wave of foreclosures .
“ The Federal Reserve should have acted long ago to stamp out the abuses we have seen in Ohio and across the country . ”
“ Certainly the headlines have n't been pretty , ” President Bush 's housing secretary , Alphonso Jackson , said in a speech at a mortgage market conference in Washington .
Jackson called the current housing slump “ a needed correction ” of an overheated market , which still has room to grow , he said .
The headlines have n't been pretty
a needed correction
needed
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson has a message to sub - prime lenders : " We need to reach out " to African - American , Hispanic and other first - time buyers with better loan concepts , more flexible guidelines and quicker service , said Jackson in an interview .
" I am absolutely emphatic about winning back our share of the market " that has slipped away to subprime lenders . "

Five Things

Yes that is just a couple of small subdivision in one state , but the same mess is playing out in state after state .
I simply do not have time to list them all .
But the important point is : as go rising delinquencies , so goes foreclosures .
Therefore it should be no surprise that the Nationwide Foreclosure Rate Hits Historic High Now there 's a silly comment for you .
It 's like saying " " . Congress also wants in on the dumbness act as does the Fed : Federal Reserve weighs options as housing market 's troubles worsen Foreclosure filings were up 90 percent in May compared with last year according to RealtyTrac .
Congress is just acting now .
As for Alphonso Jackson's " " but it 's “ ” I have to ask : was he admitting we needed a correction a year ago ?
Two years ago ?
Somehow in the aftermath of massive delinquencies and foreclosures we find out this was " " .
Well I agree it 's needed .
But also needed is for Alphonso Jackson and his entire department to be tossed .
Flashback May 18 , 2005 near the very peak of the housing bubble :
Should the government sell bread , orange juice , or mortgages ?
If that is not one of the dumbest things anyone in government ever said , what is ?
Since when is it the role of government to be " " ?
Few things can top Alphonso Jackson 's statements in terms of " " but that does not stop people from trying .

From a
previous CD post
: " Over the last thirty years , there have been two approaches to saving elephants in Africa : a ) a ban on commercial use of elephants and elephant products like ivory , and a ban on private ownership of elephants ; or b ) allow commercial use of elephants like trophy hunting licenses and the sale of ivory , and promote private property rights for elephants .
After a quarter century of both approaches operating in different African countries , the evidence is clear : elephant herds are decreasing significantly in countries like Kenya that ban private ownership and commercial use , and elephant herds are increasing significantly in countries like Zimbabwe and Botswana where elephants can be owned and where commercial uses like hunting and ivory sales are allowed ( see graph above ) . "
From this IHT article "
African states reach compromise on ivory sales
, " it appears that Kenya still has n't learned much from its failed conservation policies that have caused its elephant herds to dwindle , and is still resisting the market - based approaches that have helped elephants in Zimbabwe and Botswana .
An agreement was reached in the Netherlands yesterday by the 171 - member Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species that will allow South Africa , Namibia , Botswana and Zimbabwe to empty government inventories of ivory in a single sale to Japan , which guaranteed not to reexport the raw ivory .
Revenues from the sale are earmarked for conservation programs .
Botswana , Zimbabwe , Namibia and South Africa , came to this year 's conference with a proposal to end the 1989 international ban on ivory sales and establish annual quotas , furthering the market - based approaches that have allowed them to succeed at increasing elephant herds ( see graph above ) .
Kenya worried that the one - time sale will stimulate a demand that can not be legally met .
" It will encourage the illegal market , and that 's what kills elephants , " said Michael Wamithi , the Kenya - based elephant expert for the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
It also sends a signal to consumers " that ivory is back in style , " he said .
It 's obvious by looking at the graph above that what kills elephants is Kenya 's approach to elephants , which is to ban private ownership and ban commercial use of elephants , a tragic outcome for Kenyan elephants , and another predictable " tragedy of the commons " result .
The reality is that if nobody owns elephants in Kenya , and commercial use of elephants is not allowed , then nobody cares about Keynan elephants , and they will eventually disappear .
The Psychedelic Shakespeare Solution presents : I UNDERSTAND PHILIP K. DICK by Terence Mckenna
1991
Afterword which appeared in the book : In Pursuit of Valis : Selections from the Exegesis edited by Lawrence Sutin
____________
True stories have no beginnings and neither does the tale of PKDs encounters with the Overmind .
But we writers understand narrative economy , and for purposes of narrative economy his story seemed to him to begin with the mysterious break in and riffling of his papers that was made notorious by an article in Rolling Stone , which brought Phil long - delayed and much - deserved fame .
The break - in date was 11/17/71 .
It was a date and a style of referring to time that Phil used frequently .
I turned twenty - five the day before .
It was no casual birthday either .
I met my natal day by sifting down and sincerely preparing myself for an Apocatastasis , the final Apocalyptic ingression of novelty , the implosion really , of the entire multidimensional continuum of space and time .
I imagined the megamacrocosmos was going to go down the drain like water out of a bathtub as the hyperspatial vacuum fluctuation of paired particles that is our universe collided with its own ghost image after billions of years of separation .
The Logos assured me that parity would be conserved , all sub-atomic particles except photons would cancel each other , and our entire universe would quietly disappear .
The only particles that would remain , according to my fantastic expectation , would be photons , the universe of light would be exposed at last , set free from the iron prison of matter , freed from the awful physics that adhered to less unitary states of being .
All mankind would march into the promised garden .
I felt I was well situated for the event as I , quite consciously and deliberately , and to the concern of my friends , had placed myself in the teeming , hallucinogen saturated center of the largest garden I could find , the trackless rain forest of the Upper Amazon Basin of Colombia .
My confidence in my vision was unshakable .
Had not the Logos itself lead me to this vision , not only by revelation but by painstaking explanation ?
I had no radio , no way to contact the outside world at all .
Who needed that ?
I knew with perfect clarity that the world of time , the illusion of history was ending .
Divine Parousia was entering the world , and the just , the meek and the humble were leaving their fields and factories , pushing back their chairs from their office desks and workbenches and walking out into the light of a living sun that would never set for there could be no setting for the eternal radiance of the Logos .
Tears of joy streaming down their cheeks , the illumined billions were turning their eyes at last to the sky and finding there a consolation that they had never dared hope for .
However , Nixons weary world ignored the eschatological opportunity I thought my brothers inspired fiddling with hyperspace had afforded .
The world continued grinding forward in its usual less than merry way .
There was only one small incident that might subsequently be construed , even within the framework of the schizoid logic that was my bread and butter then , to support my position .
Unknown to me , a struggling , overweight SF writer , an idol of mine since my teens , discovered the next day that his house have been broken into , his privacy violated by the Other .
How peculiar that on the first day of the new dispensation in my private reformist calendar , he had been burglarized by extraterterrestials the CIA or his own deranged self in an altered state .
The torch had been passed , in a weird way the most intense phase of my episode of illumination / delusion ended right where Phils began .
This raises some questions :
Can we refer to a delusional system as a folie a ' deux , if the deux participants have never met and are practically speaking , unaware of each others existence ?
Does the delusion of one visionary ecstatic validate the delusion of another ?
How many deluded , or illuminated ecstatics does it take to make a reality ?
PKD proved that it only takes one .
But two is better .
When my brother looked over the edge in the Amazon and felt the dizziness of things unsaid in March of 1971 , he came back with two words bursting from his lips , " May Day !
May Day !" &emdash ; the pilots call of extreme emergency .
May Day found me in Berkeley sheltered by friends so concerned about my state of mind that they considered committing me .
I was only a few miles from Phil , who was rapidly going nuts too , as his psych admission of 3 May  71 attests .
It was always like that with PKD and me .
We never met but we lived around each other for years .
In Berkeley , we both lived on Francisco St. within five blocks and a few years of each other .
We both had roots in Sonoma County , in Orange County .
How many times were we a table or two away from each other in the Cafe Med ?
How many times did I hurry past him on the Ave on some stoned errand ?
Later his homeopathic doctor was my doctor .
There is a garbled mention of me ( or my brother ) on pg. 74 of this book .
Yah , yawn , the world is fuckin strange , right bro ?
Wrong .
Or rather , of course , sure .
But that is not the point , the point is that I understand Philip K. Dick .
I know that sounds like hubris and if I am wrong I am sorry ( as * Phil says somewhere . )
( as* PKD lived at 1126 , then a few years later and for six months I lived at 1624 . )
But part of the delusional system in which I live contains and adumbrates the notion that I know what happened to the poor dude .
We shared an affliction , a mania , sort of like Queequeg and Ishmael .
And like one of those whale chasing sailors " I alone escaped to tell thee of it " .
Phil wasnt nuts .
Phil was a vortex victim .* Schizophrenia is not a psychological disorder peculiar to human beings .
Schizophrenia is not a disease at all but rather a localized traveling discontinuity of the space time matrix itself .
It is like a travelling whirl - wind of radical understanding that haunts time .
It haunts time in the same way that Alfred North Whitehead said that the color dove grey " haunts time like a ghost . "
There is an idea that wants to be born , it has wanted to be born for a very long time .
**
And sometimes that longing to be born seffles on a person .
For no damn good reason .
Then you re " it , " you become the cheese , and the cheese stands alone .
You are illuminated and maddened and lifted up by something great beyond all telling .
It wants to be told .
It s just that this idea is so damn big that it cant be told , or rather the whole of history is the telling of this idea , the stuttering rambling effort of the sons and daughters of poor old Noah to tell this blinding , reality - shattering , bowel - loosening truth .
And Phil had a piece of the action , a major piece of the action .
But I anticipate myself .
Those who grasp a piece of the action end up with two things on their plate ; the experience and their own idiosyncratic explanation of the experience based on what they have read , seen and been told
__________ * " ZEBRA ( VALIS ) : a vortex of intelligence extending as a supra- temporal field , involving humans but not limited to them , drawing objects & processes into a coherency which it arranges into information .
A FLUX of purposeful arrangement of living information , both human & extra-human , tending to grow & incorporate its environment as a unitary complex of subsumations ." ( pg. 72 ) ** " Okay , fertilization is what takes place : it is nt a seed such as a plant has , but an egg such as a human woman ovulates , and cosmic spermatika fertilizes it ; a zygote is produced . " ( pg. 22
The experience is private , personal , the best part , and ultimately unspeakable .
The more you know the quieter you get .
The explanation is another matter and can be attempted .
In fact it must be told , for the Logos speaks and we are its tools and its voice .
Phil says a lot of things in the Exegesis , he is aware that he says too much , so he keeps trying to boil it down to ten points or twelve parts or whatever .
I have my own experience , equally unspeakable , and my explanation , equally prolix .
Phil ( sometimes ) thought he was Christ , * I ( sometimes ) thought I was an extraterrestrial invader disguised as a meadow mushroom .
What matters is the system that eventually emerges , not the fantasies concerning the source of the system .
When I compare Phils system to mine , my hair stands on end .
We were both contacted by the same unspeakable something .
Two madmen dancing , not together , but the same dance anyhow .
Truth or madness , you be the judge .
What is trying to be expressed is this :
The world is not real .
Reality is not stranger than you suppose , it is stranger than you can suppose .
Time is not what you think it is .
** Reality is a hologram .
***
Being is a solid state matrix and psychosis is the redemptive process ne plus ultra .
****
The real truth is splintered and spread throughout time .
__________ * " 1 am a homoplasmate : Zebra acting in syzygy with a human . " ( pg. 79 but also : " Did I do something ?
Absolutely .
But I dont know what I did , so I dont know who ( so to speak ) I am in the drama . " ( pg. 42 . ) ** " If the Logos is outside time , imprinting , then the Holy Spirit stands at the right or far or completed end of time , toward which the field - flow moves ( the time flow ) .
It receives time : the negative terminal , so to speak . " ( pg. 64 . )
See also " If there is to be immortality , there must be another kind of time : one in which past events ( i.e. , the past in its entirety ) can be retrieved &emdash ; i.e. , brought back .
I did experience such a time . " ( pg. 79 . ) *** " It ( reality ) is a hologram .
1 ) My augmented sense of space proves it .
And 2 ) the information element ; consisting of two parts : set and ground .
" All this points to : hologram .
Based on two information - rich signals . " ( pp. 98-99 . ) ****
" The Gospels , then , depict a sacred mythic rite outside of time , rather than a historical event .
" Note : This whole process can be regarded as a psychological transformation , that of a redemptive psychosis . " ( pg. 95 .
Appearances are a vast and interlocking lie . *
To finally know the Logos truly , if that means anything , is to know it as for , as what Phil called a " unified abstract structure . "
In a way this was where PKD went wrong .
It was nt his fault .
He saw that the world of 1975 was a fiction and behind that fiction was the world of AD 45 .
But he lacked an essential concept , lacked it because it really hadnt been invented yet .
Anyhow the man was a SF writer and a scholar of classical philosophy , he could not be expected to stay in touch with arcane discoveries beginning to take place on the frontiers of research mathematics .
But he got very close , his intuition was red hot when he reached the conclusion that a unified abstract structure lay behind the shifting always tricky casuistry of appearances .
The concept he needed was that of fractals and fractal mathematics .
The infinite regress of form built out of forms of itself built out of forms of itself * unto infinity .
The principle of self similarity .
Phil was right , time is not a linear river .
He was right , the Empire never ended .
Parallel universes is too simple a concept to encompass what is really going on .
The megamacrocosmos is a system of resonances , of levels , of endlessly adumbrated fun - house reflections .
PKD really was Thomas and Elijah and all the other precursive concrescences that came together to make the cat - loving fat man who compacted trash into gold .
The logic of being that he sought , and largely found , was not an either - or logic but a both - and and and - and kind of logic .
_____________
* " Probably the wisest view is to say : the truth&emdash ; like the Self&emdash ; is splintered up over thousands of mile and years ; bits are found here and there , then and now , and must be recollected ; bits appear in the Greek naturalists , in Pythagoras , in Plato , Parmenides , in Heraclitus , Neo-Platonism , Zoroastrianism , Gnosticism , Taoism , Mani , orthodox Christianity .
Judaism , Brahmanism , Buddhism , Orphism , the other mystery religions .
Each religion or philosophy or philosopher contains one or more bits , but the total system interweaves it into falsity , so each as a total system must be rejected , and none is to be accepted at the expense of all the others ... " ( pp. 111-112 )
PKD was never more right than when he wrote :
I actually had to develop a love of the disordered & puzzling , viewing reality as a vast riddle to be joyfully tackled , not in fear but with tireless fascination .
What has been most needed is reality testing , & a willingness to face the possibility of self - negating experiences : i.e. , real contradictions , with something being both true & not true .
The enigma is alive , aware of us , & changing .
It is partly created by our own minds : we alter it by perceiving it , since we are not outside it .
As our views shift , it shifts .
In a sense it is not there at all ( acosmism ) .
In another sense it is a vast intelligence : in another sense it is total harmonia and structure ( how logically can .
it be all three ?
Well , it is ) . *
One can not learn these things .
One can only be told these things .
And it is the Logos that does the telling .
The key is in the I Ching , which Phil loved and used but which occupies a disappointingly small fraction of his ruminations in the Exegesis .
**
Almost as if the counter flow , the occluding intelligence , kept Phils eyes diverted from the key element necessary to the universal decipherment that he was attempting .
Time is a fractal , or has a fractal structure .
All times , moments , months and millennia , have a pattern ; the same pattern .
This pattern is the structure within which , upon which , events " undergo the formality of actually occurring , " as Whitehead used to say .
The pattern recurs on every level .
A love affair , the fall of an empire , the death agony of a protozoan , all occur within the context of this always the same but ever different pattern .
All events are resonances of other events , in other parts of time , and at other scales of time .

* ( pg.91 . ) ** " MITHC seems to be a subtle , even delicate questioning of , what is real ?
As if only the 2 books in it , GRASSHOPPER & the I CHING are really the only actual reality .
Strange . " ( pg. 181 . ) *** " Through anamnesis and restoration to the Form realm you have access to several space - time continua based on your universals . " ( pg. 102 . )
The mathematical nature of this pattern can be known .
*
It can be written as an equation , just like the equations of Schrodinger or Einstein .
The raw material , the Ur text , out of which this mathematical pattern can be drawn is the King Wen sequence of the I Ching .
That is where the secret lies .
In the worlds oldest book .
Of course .
Once possessed the pattern can then be discerned everywhere .
Of course .
It is ubiquitous .
One of Phils favorite words .
I know this because the Logos taught me the pattern and I escaped the black iron prison of the world to tell thee of it .
I have published it , I have lectured it and have had it written into software .
My books are on the way , some with Phils old publisher Bantam .
I would bet dollars to donuts that if Phil had lived to see , to feel , and to understand what this PKD - inspired servant of the Logos has managed to drag home from the beach , he would embrace it .
This can not be said without sounding like a madman or a jackass .
I am sorry about that .
As Phil Dick said ,
" What s got to be gotten over is the false idea that hallucination is a private matter . " **
What is important is that the birth of this idea is now very near , has in fact already happened , and PKD showed the way .
The answer is found .
And this incredible genius , this gentle , long - suffering , beauty - worshipping man showed the way .
When it counted he was right .
All hail Philip K. Dick .

Here is a question for those running web hosting companies today : “ Are life - time hosting plans feasible ? ”
Do they present a valid business model ?
Is it possible to run life - time plans , i.e. your users pay once and once - only for a hosting plan that runs as long as either the user or the hosting company shall live .
It actually sprung out from this discussion thread at Whirlpool forums , where many Australian Internet users hang out .
OP asked “ any reason why I should n’t go with life - time hosting ? ” and used one small US - based hosting company as an example , where for USD $ 120 out - right you can get a life - time hosting plan with 6,000 MB of disk space and unlimited bandwidth .
Let us not discuss how unlimited bandwidth is feasible — it is obviously guarded by heavily overselling and a very strict ToS .
However I just want to focus on this “ life - time ” hosting plan concept .
In that discussion thread on Whirlpool forums , the said host has been grilled because it offered “ life - time ” hosting plan , and representatives from different Australian hosting companies jumped in to say how unsustainable it is .
There seem to be only two people who defended the life - time hosting concept — Adam from Jumba and yours truly .
Well , Adam has been in the web hosting industry for a while and I respect his way of running Jumba ( although I no longer host with them ) .
I myself have never worked in a hosting company , let along running one .
However over the last 12 months I think I have seen how this industry worked , especially amongst the massive oversold US - based shared hosting .
Thus I can only conclude that there is certainly a possibility to run sustainable life - time hosting plans .
Instead of replying on that discussion thread and gets flamed back by other Australian hosts trying to protect the industry there , I shall post my thoughts here instead .
It Is All About Raising The Capital
I am a software engineer , however being a breadwinner of my one wife and 2 kids , I think I understand what it means to be sustainable .
It simply means being able to bring in enough incomes to cover the expenses , although income does not necessarily need to be recurring , nor are the expenses .
Therefore I do not think it is justifiable to say that life - time hosting is not sustainable because there is no direct recurring payments from your hosting customers .
After all , grow your business at the size of your profit ( income – expense ) is so pre-industrial revolution and pre-our capitalist society !!
To kick start an enterprise , you need capital — to buy servers , bandwidth , etc .
You can either borrow it from the banks , look around for venture capital funding , or get it straight from your customers !
And I see getting a lump sum of money from customers for a long term contract in the hosting industry is all about raising the capital .
Once you get the capital , there are many ways to use that money to make a business sustainable , by either reducing the recurring expense , creating new recurring income , or creating opportunities to raise more funding .
Many Hosting Companies Are Already Doing It
When I surveyed the web hosting companies , many are already practising this little trick to get more funding up - front .
Why is there set up fees for shared hosting if paying on monthly basis ?
DreamHost — $ 49.95 .
Lunarpages — $ 30 .
Surely it does not cost that much to push a button on the software to sign up new clients , assuming everything is already automated ( judging by their size , I ’ll be very surprised if they are n’t ) .
Why is 12 month or 24 month plan so much cheaper comparing to paying on monthly basis ?
BlueHost ‘s $ 6.95 plan only applies if you pre-pay 24 months ( $ 166.80 ) .
Just one month please ?
No such option .
How about 3 months in advance ?
$ 9.95 / month + $ 30 setup — much more than the advertised price .
All these are set up in a way to lure the customers to pre-pay for 12 or 24 months when they see how much they can save .
So instead of getting 10 bucks a month from them , you can get $ 100 - $ 200 up front — enough to rent an entire dedicated server for a month !
When you multiple that by 100 , you can get enough cash to buy a few low - end boxes to form your own cluster !
There is nothing wrong with how it works either .
When you think about it , not just web hosting companies , but pre-payment discount exists in many other industries , so companies will have enough capital to get started , grow and expand .
How Do You Define “ Life - Time ” ?
Another interesting thing to consider is , how do you define “ life - time ” when you are offering such hosting plans ?
When people heard about the life - time plans , they immediately react in the way that hosting company is going to serve that customers ’ site until the second coming of Christ .
In reality , “ life - time ” can be much shorter than that , and with good management and planning , hosting company ’s life time might out - last its customers ’ .
Customer might die , and he / she will cease to be a customer .
Lots of people die everyday by ageing or from disasters , and they leave their websites behind .
Not that you should advertise “ life time plan only available to those 80 years or older ” 🙂
People lost interests in making a website .
What is the average age of a website ?
A lot of them do n’t even last 2 - 3 years .
People might also sell those sites on the market , or simply forget to renew the domain .
People need a better hosting package .
5 years from now , even a 6GB disk space package would be nothing .
People will either see something bigger and leave , or they got fed up with your draconian terms of services and move on .
With that in mind , “ life - time ” hosting is nothing more than just putting the life - time of the plan on the overselling metrics , together with often oversold bandwidth and disk spaces .
A hosting company can promise you the lot ( forever hosting ! ) , but it also understood that only a very small percentage of customers might use it .
Some Example Scenarios
I have shown a simple example in the Whirlpool discussion on how life - time hosting might work .
Of course it is just some simple mathematics plus lots of assumptions .
Take our Hosting Entrepreneur working part - time in his basement for example ,
Income : $ 120 life - time hosting plan
Expense : $ 150 per month dedicated server + software license
Assuming there is no other expense especially expensive HR , as our Hosting Entrepreneur also happens to know a bit of Linux and only needs to sleep 4 hours a day .
1. Recurring Income from Investing the Initial Capital
Good thing about having lots of cash on hand is that you can put them on investments that actually yield better than your hosting business .
I am conservative so I will just take monthly interests from those on - line banks .
Currently in Australia , INGDirect yields 6 % p.a. interest .
However at the moment it is also easy to get 12 % p.a. on a diversified portfolio , or 20 + % p.a. on just the index fund .
Oops , I am not supposed to provide financial adviser , am I ?
In order to cover $ 150 / month dedicated server expense , I will need $ 30,000 in the bank — which I can raise from 250 new signups to my hosting plan .
What happen if I get more than 250 sign ups ?
I can either invest on a bigger server , or just make it as profit !
Totally self - sustaining business model !
Now the question is , whether a $ 150 / month dedicated server can support 250 users .
I guess that is where the fine lines in terms of services come from 🙂
Obviously it is a bit unrealistic — where can I find 250 customers right from the beginning ?
Let us look at another example then .
2. Recurring Income from New Signups
To offset the $ 150 / month expense on a dedicated server , all I need is 2 new sign ups per month to my $ 120 life - time hosting plan .
I will also get $ 90 / month to spare on other stuff — like a bit of advertising , which you probably need to constantly get 2 new sign ups each month .
You first few customers will be good evangelists as well , as they experienced great performance when they had the whole server to themselves .
2 new signups a month ca n’t be too hard , can it ?
5 years down the track , you will only have 120 customers on that server , assuming they all like to keep their website up for 5 years ( unlikely ) .
Moreover , it is likely you wo n’t be on the same server .
In 5 years , for $ 150 / month you will get a monster in today ’s standard , which enables you to host even more clients on that box .
I know there are many holes in these two example , but I am just trying to show that it is possible to make lifetime hosting plans sustainable .
However , I would like to emphasis that being sustainable is probably not the focus in today ’s enterprise .
Rather , those who want up - front payments usually care more about raising the capital , and then use the fund raised to rapidly increase market share .
Real Life Cases
Did I say that it might be difficult finding 250 customers right from the beginning ?
How long does it take for a start - up hosting company to find 250 new signups to its life - time plan ?
Not sure about 250 , but with 200 — Dean and Jason from TextDrive ( now part of Joyent ) did in less than 80 hours !
Back in May 2004 , Dean Allan of TextPattern wanted to set up a hosting company to host users of his open source CMS product .
So he teamed up with Jason Hoffman , and created TextDrive .
In order to raise the initial capital , hosting plan VC200 was born — 1GB of web space for life for $ 199 !
All 200 accounts sold out in 3 days , raised enough capital for TextDrive to create one of the most developer - focused web hosting company today .
So , someone has done it before , and they are still around 3 years later .
I am not saying anyone can be TextDrive — Dean certainly has his charisma and had hard - laboured over the years on TextPattern .
I am just saying that life - time hosting plans are indeed possible .
So , The Verdict is …
So , what is the verdict ?
Am I going to sign up a life - time hosting plan for $ 120 ?
No way .
You can smell the dodgyness miles away by looking at some of those life - time hosting web pages .
However I will not go with them not because they offer life - time hosting , but they are just intrinsically dodgy !
You would not go with a hosting company that promises unlimited bandwidth but has a ToS with a 2 inch thick string attached , would you ?
However , I am writing this article to show that the big players — those big oversellers with hundred thousands of domains hosted — out there have all the mathematics worked out .
I think for them the game is not just about recurring revenue , but a continuous growth — and these up - front payments can really make those big storage / big bandwidth plans possible .
Moreover a large capital can further fund more marketing , a good affiliation network , etc that might bring in even more customers .
No wonder they are so much hated by smaller hosts in forums like WebHostingTalk and Whirlpool .
The truth is that Putin , like George Bush and Tony Blair , has an urgent date with history .
He can plead two terms as president in which he has stabilised , if not deepened , Russian democracy , forced the pace of economic modernisation , suppressed Chechen separatism and yet been remarkably popular .
But leaders who dismiss domestic critics crave international opinion , and are unaccustomed to brickbats .
Hence Putin 's outburst at the Munich security conference this month , when he announced he would " avoid extra politesse " and speak his mind .
Putin 's apologists ask that he be viewed as victim of an epic miscalculation by the west .
Here is a hard man avidly courted at first by Bush , Blair and other western leaders .
After 9/11 he tolerated US intervention along his southern border with bases north of Afghanistan .
Yet when he had similar trouble in Chechnya , he was roundly abused .
When he induced Milosevic to leave Kosovo ( which he and not " the bombing " did ) , he got no thanks .
When Putin sought to join Nato in the 1990s he was rebuffed .
Then Nato broke its post - cold - war promise and advanced its frontier through the Baltics and Poland to the Black Sea .
It is now planning missile defences in Poland and the Czech Republic and is flirting with Ukraine and Georgia .
Against whom is this directed , asks Putin .
The west grovels before Opec , but when Putin proposes a gas Opec it cries foul .
America seizes Iraq 's oil , but when Putin nationalises Russia 's oil that , too , is a foul .
Meanwhile , every crook , every murdered Russian , every army scandal is blazoned across the western press .
True , Russia is still a klepto - oligarchy that steps back as often as forward , but what of America 's pet Asian democracies , Afghanistan and Iraq ?
In his Munich speech Putin asked why America constantly goes on about its " unipolar world " .
Does Washington really seek a second cold war ?
Russia is withdrawing from Georgia and Moldova .
Why is Nato advancing bases in Bulgaria and Romania ?
The west is handling Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran with the arrogance and ineptitude of 19th - century imperialists .
Is it surprising Russia is seeking allies where it can , in China , India , Iran and the Gulf ?
At an Anglo - Russian conference in Moscow last weekend I was bemused by the talk of a return to " east - west " confrontation .
Diplomats have a habit of listing complaints like marriage counsellors inviting couples to catalogue what most irritates them about each other .
The list seems endless , but it surely points to a proper talk rather than a divorce .
Do n't they really need each other after all ?
Having visited Russia three times since the demise of the Soviet Union , I remain impressed by its progress .
Debate and comment are open .
Russia is not squandering its energy wealth but setting $ 100 bn aside in an infrastructure fund .
The links between Russia and western business are worth $ 30bn in inward investment .
Cultural and educational contacts are strengthening .
Moscow and St Petersburg are booming world cities , their skylines thick with cranes .
The west views pluralist democracy as so superior that any state coming to it fresh must surely welcome it with open arms .
When there is backsliding , as in former Yugoslavia , Ukraine , Russia and parts of Africa , let alone the Arab world , the west behaves like a peevish car salesman whose client has not obeyed the repair manual .
If the west can do fair elections , market capitalism , press freedom and regional secession - after a mere two centuries of trial and error - why can newly free states not do them overnight ?
The tough response to Putin is easy .
It is the one he has from Washington and Nato .
We won the cold war .
You lost .
Shut up .
If , as Russia 's top general said last week , you want to withdraw from the intermediate - range nuclear forces treaty , then withdraw .
If you think gas and oil enables you to play the superpower again , see what happens .
Bush and Blair may be screwing up " Islamistan " , but their successors will be more canny .
Our defence budget is bigger than yours and we have you surrounded .
All this makes for good realpolitik .
But what Putin actually said in Munich reflected not belligerence but puzzlement at the aggressive course of western diplomacy .
In the old days , he said , " there was an equilibrium and a fear of mutual destruction .
In those days one party was afraid to make an extra step without consulting the others .
This was certainly a fragile peace and a frightening one , but seen from today it was reliable enough .
Today it seems that peace is not so reliable . "
Putin is hardly seeking a return to the certainties of the cold war .
He has no more interest than the west in stirring the hornet 's nest of Islamic nationalism , stretching as it does deep into Russian territory .
His desire for " ever closer union " with Europe and Nato after 1997 was sincere and was surely welcome .
While Putin appears to have been conducting his diplomacy over the past decade from weakness and the west from strength , the reverse has been nearer the truth .
Britain and America have been led by essentially reactive politicians with no grasp of history .
A terrorist outrage or a bombastic speech and they change policy on the hop .
When Bush and Blair go , they will leave a world less secure and more divided in its leadership than when they arrived .
Their dismissive treatment of Russia 's recovery from cold war defeat has been the rhetoric of natural bullies .
Russia and the west have everything to gain from good relations .
Putin has struggled to modernise his economy while holding together a traumatised and shrunken Russian federation .
The west may feel he errs towards authoritarianism , but second - guessing Russian leaders is seldom a profitable exercise .
This is a huge country , rich in natural and human resources .
It is hard to think of somewhere the west would be better advised to " hug close " .
Instead , Putin will hand his successor an isolated and bruised nation .
Under a less confident president , it could retreat into protectionism and alliances the west will hate .
To have encouraged that retreat is truly stupid .

Of the extrasolar planets astronomers have discovered , it ’s the hot jupiters that really boggle the imagination .
These worlds can be much larger than Jupiter , but tear around their parent star in just a few hours .
Or in the case of newly discovered TrES - 3 , in just 31 hours .
This latest discovery , titled TrES - 3 : A Nearby , Massive , Transiting Hot Jupiter in a 31 - Hour Orbit , will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
As with many planetary discoveries , this was a team effort , made by astronomers and observatories around the world .
The story begins when astronomers measured a periodic dimming around parent star GSC 03089-00929 – a G - dwarf star 90 % the mass of the Sun .
Since the discovering instruments were part of the Trans- atlantic Exoplanet Survey ( TrES ) network , this is how the planet got its name .
Once the astronomers had a candidate , other astronomers performed follow up observatories using the Hungarian Automated Telescope Network , the Fred L. Whipple Observatory , the Submillimeter Array atop Mauna Kea , and a handful of other instruments around the world .
By the time they were done , hundreds of observations had been made in many wavelengths .
It ’s currently estimated to have a mass of approximately 1.92 the mass of Jupiter .
As mentioned , it orbits its parent star once every 31 hours – at a distance of only 0.0226 AU ( 1 AU = the distance from the Earth to the Sun ) .
That sounds fast , and it is .
The current record is OGLE - TR - 56 b , which orbits every 29 hours .
So TrES - 3 comes in a close second .
Based on their observations , TrES - 3 is not a grazing transit .
In other words , the planet passes directly between the star and the Earth , fitting its disk entirely within the disk of the star at mid-transit .
The transit itself takes only 1.3 hours to complete .
This provides astronomers with a useful testbed for theoretical models of gas giants .
Astronomers want to understand what happens to planets this close to their parent star ; how their orbits decay , and rate of thermal evaporation from being so close .
And here ’s the mystery .
At this close distance to its star , TrES - 3 must be going furious evaporation of its gas .
Astronomers are wondering if a planet could form this close , and still be around billions of years later .
Another possibility is that it formed further out , and was pulled in close over millions of years .
TrES - 3 is so close that its gravity tidally effects the star , modifying the rate at which its orbit decays , and confusing the calculations .
The astronomers are planning follow up observations of TrES - 3 with the powerful Spitzer Space Telescope , since it ’s an ideal candidate for attempts to detect reflected starlight .
This will allow astronomers to measure the planet ’s albedo , or reflectiveness .

Civilization might recover from the damage of a nuclear war , but judging by past static empires in Egypt and China , it might never recover from world government , there being no chance of external intervention .

In praise of philistines
It is said that man does n't live by bread alone .
Sometimes this is unfortunate , because people who cannot live by bread alone too often kill other people in consequence of the fights they get into .
The word ``philistine '' as a pejorative is used in a variety of senses , but a common one refers to a person interested only in money and the goods and amusements money can buy .
Usually it does n't refer to someone who will do anything for money but rather a person who if he makes a reasonable amount of money will spend his time enjoying it without considering either the arts , the advance of science , or righting the injustices of the world --- unless one of the above happens to be his job .

Officials said Mr. Gonzales had faced direct criticism in most of the meetings with the prosecutors .
At a meeting in Denver , attended by about a dozen mainly Western prosecutors , Mr. Gonzales was told that the dismissals had cast a cloud over all the United States attorneys ’ offices , not only over the prosecutors who were removed .
But at that meeting , according to one official briefed on the discussion , prosecutors focused on steps to improve communications between the attorney general and United States attorneys .
The criticism from prosecutors in the Justice Department ’s field offices comes as the uproar over the dismissals appears to also have eroded confidence in Mr. Gonzales at the agency ’s headquarters , where top officials have been focused for weeks on little else .
Mr. Gonzales and Mr. McNulty , who are expected to testify before Congress in two weeks , are said by officials to have maintained a working relationship , but their staffs have feuded over who is to blame .
Some of Mr. Gonzales ’ aides have blamed Mr. McNulty for inflaming the issue by testifying on Feb. 6 that one of the ousted prosecutors , H. E. Cummins III , was removed for no reason .
Mr. McNulty ’s aides have blamed Mr. Sampson and Monica Goodling , the liaison to the White House , for failing to disclose their conversations with the White House before the removals .
In Washington , one Republican lawmaker said he was less concerned with Mr. Gonzales ’s personal situation than how it was affecting the day - to - day performance of the Justice Department .
“ I ca n’t imagine a department being more demoralized with what ’s going on there , ” said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
Mr. Specter said in an interview that Mr. Gonzales needed to demonstrate his candor about the dismissals and assure people about his competence to retain his post .

Current / Central Intelligence Bulletin Collection Central Intelligence Bulletin Harry Truman was the first U.S. president to receive a daily intelligence digest .
At his direction , the Daily Summary began production in February 1946 , and continued until February 1951 .
President Truman was pleased with the product , but a survey group commissioned by the National Security Council in 1949 was critical of the Daily Summary and issued several recommendations to improve it .
The new version , called the Current Intelligence Bulletin , began production on 28 February 1951 , and this remained the format of the president 's daily digest through Dwight Eisenhower 's two terms , although it was retitled the Central Intelligence Bulletin in 1958 .
The Current / Central Intelligence Bulletin grew longer than its predecessor over time with the addition of more items and more analysis , and would eventually contain more graphics as printing technology improved .
2 January - 30 June 1961
The new Kennedy Administration confronted a full array of international issues in 1961 .
In April , a group of CIA - trained Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Cuba with the goal of overthrowing the Fidel Castro regime and establishing an anti-Communist government .
The outnumbered invading force was quickly repelled by Castro 's troops .
The year 's reports were dominated by the worsening Congo crisis , with the fragmentation of the country widening despite the efforts of the United Nations , and US concern over the high tempo of Soviet testing of space vehicles and intercontinental ballistic missiles .
The situation in Laos deteriorated , as the Communist Pathet Lao insurgency gained strength against the US - backed Royal Lao government .
The changes at the CIA following the Bay of Pigs included a format update for the president 's daily intelligence report .
The new version , called the President 's Intelligence Checklist ( PICL ) , was first delivered on 17 June 1961 .
The Central Intelligence Bulletin continued to be produced as a separate publication until 10 Jan 1974 , when it was replaced by the National Intelligence Daily .
The PICL , however , was the president 's primary written intelligence source through the remainder of the Kennedy Administration .
The Kennedy PICL reports are available here
This historical release includes : the Central Intelligence Bulletin reports from 2 January - 30 June 1961 ( 2752 pages ) .
This release is the thirteenth and final release in the Current / Central Intelligence Bulletin series .

Aquiline aquiline adj . of or like the eagle .
Aerial intelligence collection platforms have played a critical role in US national security from the earliest beginnings of aviation .
CIA 's 1960s OXCART Program and its use of U - 2s are examples of collection innovations that have kept US leaders informed about adversaries ' capabilities and intentions .
Despite their success , however , use of these platforms carried significant risks and repercussions , including detection and even pilot loss , such as the downing of the U - 2 flown by Francis Gary Powers in 1960 .
Ever-evolving research by the CIA led to the development concept of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) as collection platforms .
An innovative Agency program in the 1960s codenamed Aquiline was the very first to test this concept .
Based initially on the study of flight characteristics of birds , Aquiline was envisioned as a long - range vehicle that could safely and stealthily provide a window into denied areas such as the Soviet Union through photography and other capabilities , and would even support in - place agent operations .
While it never became operational , the concept proved invaluable as a forerunner to today 's multi-capability UAVs .

The Collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe : A 30 - Year Legacy The Collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe : A 30 - Year Legacy
This collection includes a broad sampling of articles from the National Intelligence Daily — the CIA 's principal form of current intelligence analysis at the time — from February 1989 to March 1990 .
These articles represent much of the Agency 's short - term analysis of events unfolding in Central and Eastern Europe as popular opposition to Soviet misrule erupted and quickly surpassed anything the Communist regimes were prepared to understand or to which they could respond .
The material also represents a major source of information and insight for US policymakers into what was happening in these countries , where the situation was heading , and how a collapse of Communist rule in Europe and the beginnings of the breakup of the Soviet Union would impact Europe and the United States .
Please note :
Some of the material is marked " NR " or " not relevant . "
This means that material is unrelated to events in Central and Eastern Europe , and was therefore not reviewed for declassification as part of this collection .

Lunik on Loan : A Space Age Spy Story Lunik on Loan : A Space Age Spy Story The Cold War and the emerging space race were in full swing in the late 1950s .
CIA kept President Eisenhower regularly apprised on the progress of the Soviet space program , which became a subject of worldwide attention following the successful 1957 launch of Sputnik — the first artificial satellite and the first manmade object to be placed into earth 's orbit .
The Soviets ' achievement , which indicated that they had intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the United States , stunned the American public and set off a debate in the United States about the " Missile Gap , " and America 's competence in science and technology .
In 1959 , a Soviet exhibit of the USSR 's industrial and economic achievements toured several countries .
This exhibit included displays not only from Sputnik but also the Lunik or Luna ( Lunar ) spacecraft — the Soviet 's first lunar probe .
In September of that year , the Lunik 2 became the first manmade object on the moon — a feat that only compounded fears in the United States that the USSR was winning the space race .
CIA conducted a covert operation to access the Lunik display to learn more about the USSR 's moon program .
A team of CIA officers gained unrestricted access to the display for 24 hours , which turned out not to be a replica but a fully - operational system comparable to the Lunik 2 .
The team disassembled the vehicle , photographed all the parts without removing it from its crate before putting everything back in its place , gaining invaluable intelligence on its design and capabilities .
And the Soviets were none the wiser .
Sound like something from a movie script ?
It really happened .

CIA 's Animal Partners
Throughout history , trained animals have been used in security roles to fulfill mission requirements , notably by the armed forces , whether for transport , communication , or threat detection .
From carrier pigeons in World War I to today 's explosives - detecting dogs , government agencies have turned to animals to do the important jobs humans could n't do .
CIA is no exception , and it once worked on developing ways animals could help with intelligence collection .
This collection of declassified documents highlights the diverse programs involving the feasibility of using marine and avian animal capabilities in support of intelligence operations .
For a variety of technical and other reasons , none of the programs ever became operational .
Yet these documents provide a window into the innovative thinking applied to the intelligence mission aimed at countering increasingly sophisticated foreign adversaries .

Fall of the Libyan Monarchy Fifty years ago , on 1 September 1969 , the first and only King of Libya was deposed .
The documents in this collection highlight the bloodless coup by a group of Libyan military officers which removed King Idris I .
The group , which called itself the Revolutionary Command Council , was motivated by the ideology of Arab socialism modeled by Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser .
Within a short time , a young officer named Muammar Qadhafi emerged as a leader of the group , and he would rule Libya for the next 40 years .
These documents cover major developments related to the coup , including US reaction .
The Nixon administration believed that Washington need not be overly distressed by the coup and felt the US could have a working relationship with the new regime .
Also discussed in the documents is Libya 's intention to honor treaty obligations regarding Wheelus Air Base , a major US Air Force installation in Libya that supported Mediterranean operations .

Daily Summary Collection Do You Know What Came Before the PDB ?
You probably know that the CIA provides the President of the United States a summary of critical intelligence issues every day .
But did you know that this was happening even before there was a CIA ?
The Central Intelligence Agency was not formally established until 1947 .
In January 1946 , however , President Harry Truman directed the newly - formed Central Intelligence Group to provide him with a coordinated intelligence report known as the Daily Summary .
This report evolved over the years and its name has changed — it ’s now called the President ’s Daily Brief or PDB — but the tradition begun in 1946 of informing the President with a coordinated daily report continues to this day .
Once “ for the President ’s eyes only ” ( and those of his most senior advisors ) , these reports can now be released to the public .

How to Make a Great First Impression
First impressions can be quite important .
Everyone stereotypes everyone on first impression , even if we are reluctant to do it .
We all get a first impression of a new person that creates a mental image of his or her personality in our minds .
That image of you often lasts and can affect the relationship that follows .
Another thing is that we often play different roles in relationships .
With our parents we play one role , with friends another , with someone we are interested in / in love with a third , when shopping for clothes in a store a fourth .
And so on .
A good or great first impression can create a positive role in the minds of the new people we meet .
When we meet them again , we are often drawn back into this role .
Sometimes it happens almost unconsciously until you after a few minutes notice that you have fallen into your old role – like when you meet friends you haven
Â´t seen in years – in that dynamic once again .
You may not always be drawn into that role .
But if you do it sure is better to have a positive than a negative role saved for you .
Here are some of the things Iâ€™ve learned about improving first impressions .
Of course , different environments like business meetings with suits and ties or parties with umbrella - drinks come with different goals and expectations so figure out what Â´s appropriate and useful in each meeting .
Act as if you are meeting a good friend
If you just imagine that the person you have just met and are talking to is one of your best friends youâ€™ll probably adjust unconsciously and start to smile , open up your body - language to a very friendly and warm position and reduce any nervousness or weirdness in your tone of voice and body - language .
DonÂ´t overdo it though , you might not want to hug and kiss right away .
The nice thing about this is that you may also start to feel positive feelings towards this new person , just as you do with your friend when you meet him / her .
This is a pretty good starting - point for getting them to reciprocate and for developing a good relationship .
Keep you body language open
Smile .
Donâ€™t cross your arms or legs .
Turn your body towards the people youâ€™re are shaking hands with or talking to so that your body language is friendly and open .
Make relaxed eye contact â€ “ donÂ´t stare â€ “ when talking or listening .
DonÂ´t look the person in the eye all the time .
When you break eye - contact try to do it kinda slow , donÂ´t let your eyes just dart away .
Making eye - contact can be a bit hard or scary but if you work at it you Â´ll get used to it .

Stand up straight
Keeping a good posture certainly improves on the impression one makes .
DonÂ´t slouch .
Sit or stand up straight .
Be positive
Sometimes you can go in all positive in a first meeting .
Sometimes it may not be the best approach to go in too positive as it can be seen as bit abrasive or inappropriate .
A better way to convey a positive attitude in a first meeting can then be to read the mood of person (s ) before you start talking â€ “ by just watching them – and then match it for a short while .
Then – when you have an emotional connection and the other person feels you are similar to him / her – you can let your positivity arise a bit more .
Regardless if you start out positive from the get - go or a short , short while into the meeting , be sure to positive .
If you , for instance , start a first meeting by complaining , there Â´s a big chance the people you meet will mentally label you as a complainer or a negative person .
Donâ€™t think too much
Try , as much as possible , to stay outside of your head and focus on the people you are talking to rather than focusing on yourself .
Mentally rehearse before you even enter the room
Visualize how great the events will unfold – see and hear it – and also how great will you feel at this meeting .
See yourself smiling , being positive , open and having a great time .
See the excellent outcome in your mind .
Then release by visualizing that it has already happened , that the meeting is over with the desired result .
This is surprisingly effective and will get you into a great and relaxed mood before even stepping into the first , second or twentieth meeting .

Do you make these 10 mistakes in conversation ?
for more information on stuff like listening , hogging the spot - light , what to talk about ( and not to talk about ) and the very common need to be right .
What you say is nÂ´t that important
IÂ´d say that mental rehearsal followed by acting as if you Â´re meeting a friend are the most important parts of all of this .
They often solve the rest of pointers in this article unconsciously and automatically and keeps your thoughts focused outwards instead of inwards .
The problem with an inward - focused meeting – where you focus on what you just said , how you look and what the other person thinks of you right now – can reduce anyone to a bumbling , second - guessing , fidgeting shadow of their former self as the self - consciousness becomes almost paralyzing .
Also , as long as you try to use the first and the last point it doesnâ€™t really matter too much what word or phrase you use to start the conversation .
The words are only 7 percent of your communication .
93 percent is in your tone of voice and your body - language .
So , a simple â€ œ Hi!â€ may do just fine .

Apparently , HMO's only have a 15 % approval rate with Americans .
People do n't like the waits , and the institutional service , but , more than anything , they do n't like someone in the HMO back office rationing their care based on pre-set formulas about what care or test is appropriate in each given situation .
All well and good .
However , if this is so , then why does the idea of universal government health care appeal to so many people ?
Because if universal health care turns out as well as it possibly could , then the best we could expect is that it will resemble ... current HMO's .
And unfortunately , it will probably be worse .
Because today , the guy in the HMO back office who is setting up the allowed care formulas knows that if he cuts things back too far , you will go to another competitor .
No such threat or incentive will exist for the government bureaucrat , who will be setting the formulas based on stupid mindless rules and interst - group pressures and absolutely no concern about your satisfaction .
More than a decade after the Internet went mainstream , the world 's richest information source has n't necessarily made its users any more informed .
A new study from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press shows that Americans , on average , are less able to correctly answer questions about current events than they were in 1989 .
Citizens who call the Internet their primary news source know slightly less than fans of TV and radio news .
Hmmm ... maybe a little less Perez Hilton and a little more Jim Lehrer .
* The five questions : Who is the vice president ?
Who is your state 's governor ?
Does the US have a trade deficit or surplus ?
Which party controls the House of Representatives ?
Is the chief justice of the Supreme Court a liberal , moderate , or conservative ?

TONY Blair feared George Bush would " nuke the s**t " out of Afghanistan in revenge for 9/11 , a sensational documentary will claim this week .
Giving the inside story on the war , former British ambassador to the US Chris Meyer reveals : " Blair 's real concern was that there would be quote unquote ' a kneejerk reaction ' by the Americans ... they would go thundering off and nuke the s**t out of the place without thinking straight . "
Nuclear strikes would have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths - and sparked a wave of al - Qaeda attacks .
In Channel 4's candid two - part documentary The Rise and Fall of Tony Blair , Mr Meyer claims the threat explains why the Prime Minister vowed to stand " shoulder - to - shoulder " with Bush over the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan - to thwart his allguns blazing battle plan .
But it meant sending British troops to Iraq knowing Washington had NOT made preparations for its post - war reconstruction .
Mr Blair 's ally Peter Mandelson tells award - winning documentary - maker Andrew Rawnsley : " Obviously more attention should have been paid to what happened after , to the planning and what we would do once Saddam had been toppled .
But I remember him saying at the time , ' Look , you know , I can't do everything .
That 's chiefly America 's responsibility , not ours ' . "
Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's envoy to Baghdad after the war , blames the lack of preparation for today 's problems in Iraq in the programme , to be shown on Saturday at 7 pm .
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell blasted the revelations as " a devastating indictment " of the PM 's policies .
Mr Rawnsley said last night : " But for Iraq , Tony Blair would probably not be leaving Number 10 in 10 days ' time . "
Meanwhile , a suicide bomber blew up a police bus carrying new recruits in the Afghan capital of Kabul yesterday killing 24 .
And in Kandahar , three soldiers and their interpreter died when a coalition vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb .

Alberto Gonzales 's long - awaited appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee has been postponed until Thursday in light of the tragedy at Virginia Tech .
Rather than trying to comment on that tragedy ( I would n't even know what to say ) , I thought I 'd take the opportunity presented by the delay in Gonzales ' testimony to suggest a few lines of questioning that the Senators on the Judiciary Committee might wish to pursue .
With all due respect to those Senators , I have n't been terribly impressed by their cross-examination skills in past hearings .
Good lines of questioning , particularly in the context of a Congressional hearing , are ones that are capable of boxing the witness into a corner and forcing him to make an important concession , no matter which way he chooses to answer the question .
To do that , you have to anticipate the witness 's possible answers and be prepared to proceed in different directions depending on how the witness responds .
Too often Senators get flustered and lose their train of thought when the witness does n't answer their initial , deeply penetrating question in quite the way they had expected , and they end up just moving on to the next question .
Senators also have a tendency to ask questions that are heavy on spin and contain many layers of embedded assumptions , the idea being to trick the witness into accepting the Senator 's preferred framing of the issue .
This rarely works , though .
Most of the time the witness is prepared for this tactic and spends the entire time deconstructing the questions instead of answering them .
Asking these kind of loaded questions may produce a few good soundbites , but it rarely advances the ball in any significant way .
It 's far more productive to ask fair , pointed questions , questions the witness can't really object to .
Better yet , use the witness 's own testimony or prior statements as the basis for your questions ( it 's much harder to object to your own words ) .
And finally , though this runs against every instinct Senators have , it 's best to avoid all the introductory grandstanding .
The most effective time to insert a pointed editorial comment is immediately after the witness has made a damaging admission , not before you 've even asked a question .
The latter , if done right , comes across as natural and warranted by the facts , while the former invariably comes across as scripted and obnoxious ( and , again , it invites the witness to spend the entire time rebutting your opening remarks instead of answering your questions ) .
With the preceding in mind , here are the five lines of questioning that , in my humble opinion , would be the most fruitful to pursue during Gonzales 's hearing .
If any staffers for Senators on the Judiciary Committee happen to be reading this , please feel free to borrow these wholesale .
First Line of Questioning : Authority Issues
Mr. Gonzales , in your prepared testimony you said that you delegated the task of selecting which U.S. Attorneys to remove to your chief of staff , Kyle Sampson .
You said that Mr. Sampson came up with a list of prosecutors who would be asked to leave , and that you eventually signed off on that list .
You also testified , and I quote , " Mr. Sampson explained to me the plan to inform the U.S. Attorneys of my decision . "
Is it your testimony , sir , that the President was not involved in this process , that you made the final call ?
If no : Please explain the extent of the President 's involvement .
Did he sign off on the final list ?
Was he given prior notification that these eight U.S. Attorneys would be asked to resign ?
If yes :
You are aware , sir , are you not , that by statute , the power to remove U.S. Attorneys belongs to the President , not the Attorney General ?
( 28 U.S.C. 541( c ) : " Each United States attorney is subject to removal by the President . " )
As you pointed out in your testimony today , U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president ; not at the pleasure of the attorney general -- and certainly not at the pleasure of Kyle Sampson .
By what authority did you feel empowered to make these kind of personnel decisions ?
To replace presidential appointees ?
Is it your practice to exercise exclusively presidential powers without getting the president 's sign off ?
Follow up :
The Albuquerque Journal recently reported that Senator Pete Domenici called you in the Spring of 2006 and told you that he wanted David Iglesias removed from his position as U.S. Attorney for New Mexico .
According to the Journal , you refused and told Domenici that you would only do so on orders from the President .
Is that account accurate ?
If yes :
Why did you require a Presidential order then , but not later ?
Iglesias was obviously added to the list at some point .
What changed ?
Did the president ever indicate to you or anyone on your staff that he wanted Iglesias removed ?
Did he give a reason ?
If no : What about that account is inaccurate ?
Did you speak with Sen. Domenici ?
Please describe that conversation .
What was the substance of Domenici 's complaint about Iglesias ?
How did Iglesias ' name come to be on the removal list ?
Second Line of Questioning : Knowledge of Substantive Basis for Dismissals
Sir , you 've testified that you delegated the task of determining which U.S. Attorneys to remove to your former chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , and that you merely signed off on the recommendations he brought to you .
When this controversy first erupted , however , the man you delegated this important task to resigned over his handling of this issue .
That was over a month ago .
Have you personally made any effort to go back and examine the process and reasoning Mr. Sampson used to come up with the final list of eight U.S. Attorneys ?
Or to put it another way , sir , do you know , as you sit here today , why each of the eight U.S. Attorneys were put on that list ?
If yes :
Can you please walk us through the substantive case for dismissing each of these attorneys ?
Let 's start with David Iglesias . . .
If no :
Do you mean to tell me , sir , that you spent weeks preparing for this testimony , but you have no answer to THE most fundamental question on everyone 's mind : why were these attorneys removed ?
How can you sit here and testify that you " firmly believe that these dismissals were appropriate " when you 're not even sure how and why the names of these eight prosecutors made it onto your chief of staff 's list ?
I understand that you claim to have delegated this task , but did n't you at least have an obligation to educate yourself on the substance of these decisions after the fact , particularly after this erupted into a major controversy ?
What did you do to satisfy yourself that Kyle Sampson had made the right calls ?
Are you simply taking on faith the word of a man who was forced to resign over his handling of this matter ?
Follow up :
In an op -ed in the USA Today last week , you wrote that these prosecutors " simply lost my confidence . "
Does n't that statement imply that you were in on the evaluation and decision - making process ?
What specifically did each of these eight prosecutors do to lose your confidence ?
Do n't you owe them some sort of explanation , particularly in light of the fact that you and your deputies have publicly stated that they were let go for " performance - related " reasons , thereby damaging their professional reputations ?
Third Line of Questioning : Monica Goodling
One of your senior aides , Monica Goodling , has refused to testify before this committee and has invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination .
Last week , she , like your chief of staff before her , resigned abruptly .
How do you reconcile Ms. Goodling 's behavior with your claim that nothing inappropriate happened here ?
Do you have any idea why your senior aide believes her truthful testimony would incriminate her ?
Mr. Gonzales , you are the nation 's chief law enforcement officer .
Putting that hat on for a moment , imagine you were overseeing an investigation into a large company , and one of its senior officers refused to speak with you , choosing instead to invoke the Fifth Amendment .
Under those circumstances , would you simply accept the CEO 's assurance that " nothing inappropriate " had happened ?
Really ?
And would n't the DOJ , as a matter of policy , insist that the company fire the uncooperative employee ?
Why was Monica Goodling allowed to remain on the Justice Department payroll after invoking the Fifth Amendment ?
Why was she not fired ?
Fourth Line of Questioning : What About the Eighth U.S. Attorney ?
You wrote in your recent op - ed in the USA Today that " it was for reasons related to policy , priorities and management — what have been referred to broadly as ' performance - related ' reasons — that seven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign last December . "
Yet as you stated in your testimony today , eight U.S. Attorneys were asked to resign .
You even listed them by name .
By implication , are n't you conceding here that one U.S. Attorney — who I assume is Bud Cummins of Arkansas — was let go for reasons unrelated to " policy , priorities , and management " ?
If yes :
If not for " reasons related to policies , priorities , and management , " why exactly was Bud Cummins asked to resign ?
Who made that decision ?
Did you sign off on it ?
Did the President ?
What was your understanding at the time as to why this decision was made ?
What is your understanding as you sit here today ?
If no : So Bud Cummins was let go for " performance - related " reasons ?
What were the reasons ?
Why did you mention only seven U.S. Attorneys in your op - ed ?
Why did your Deputy , Paul McNulty , testify that Cummins ' dismissal was not for performance - related reasons but rather to make way for Tim Griffin , an associate of Karl Rove ?
Fifth Line of Questioning : Carol Lam and the Appearance of Impropriety
When Kyle Sampson brought you the list of prosecutors whom he recommended removing , did any of the names stand out at you ?
You were aware , were you not , that Carol Lam of San Diego was responsible for a number of high - profile public corruption prosecutions involving high - ranking Republican officials such as Congressman Duke Cunningham and the number - three man at the CIA , Dusty Foggo ?
Were you at all concerned that Lam 's name may have been added to this list in order to influence these prosecutions or as some sort of retribution for pursuing them ?
If yes :
What did you do to dispell those concerns ?
What were the actual reasons for Lam 's dismissal ?
If no : Did n't it at least occur to you that others -- who were not privy to your private deliberations -- might suspect that Lam was targeted for dismissal because of her prosecution of Republican politicians ?
It 's not like U.S. Attorneys are routinely replaced in the middle of an administration .
And except for perhaps Patrick Fitzgerald , Lam was the most well - known U.S. Attorney in the country .
Were n't you at all concerned that removing Lam might reflect poorly on the department ?
That it would cause reasonable people to suspect that partisan politics was behind her dismissal ?
Shortly after Carol Lam announced her resignation , the chief of the San Diego FBI office , Dan Dzwilewski , was quoted as saying " I guarantee politics is involved . ”
Is it really your testimony , sir , that it never occurred to you or your staff that asking Lam to leave would create at least the appearance of impropriety ?
If a high - ranking official in the Justice Department like Dan Dzwilewski was positive that politics led to Lam 's removal , can you blame the rest of us for making the same inference ?
( original post here )
It 's the one secret radical open information activist John Young can't crack : what drove his ISP , Verio / NTT , to finally pull the plug on his website , Cryptome.org , where for years he 's posted every sensitive document , photo or map he could get his hands on .
Young – a 72 - year - old architect in New York – has hosted countless government documents with the " For Official Use Only " markings intact ; exposed the names of long - ago CIA collaborators ; the alleged identities of current British intelligence agents ; compiled a travelogue - style guide to the Pennsylvania mountain believed to be the vice president 's " undisclosed location " ; and even put up a map showing where major Manhattan gas pipelines are buried , which he posted ahead of the Republican National Convention in New York .
So what happened , after all that , to make Verio decide to stop hosting him now ?
Verio is n't saying .
Spokeswoman Marla Kramer sent THREAT LEVEL this statement :
Verio customer information is confidential .
As a matter of policy , Verio will not discuss the specific details of any customer .
Verio consistently investigates and works with its customers to resolve issues .
Recent events , however , related to Cryptome presented a different situation that Verio was unable to reconcile with its AUP .
Based on these events , Verio made the decision that it could no longer support Cryptome as a customer .
On April 20 , 2007 , Verio provided Cryptome with notification of the termination via both email and certified mail .
Verio provided Cryptome with two week 's notice to allow the organization to obtain another service provider .
Verio respects both the rights of its customers and those of third parties .
Verio is confident that it has been fair and consistent in its approach to these matters , and stands by its decision in this instance .
It 's admirable that Verio wo n't discuss confidential customer information with a reporter , but somewhat baffling that it 's stonewalling Young on the same question , referring him to its AUP .
Maybe he violated the clause prohibiting subscribers from " engaging in activities , whether lawful or unlawful , that Verio determines to be harmful to its subscribers , operations , reputation , goodwill , or customer relations . "
Or maybe he did n't violate any clause , and that 's why they can't say .
Maybe the wrong person at Verio finally read Young 's site .
Young goes overboard , but there 's always been something comforting about Cryptome 's existence .
Remember , the New York Times sat on the NSA domestic surveillance story for a year , and the L.A. Times killed its story on AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein after talking to the top U.S. intelligence official .
If a CIA document ever leaked that revealed JFK was killed by space aliens , Cryptome was the one outlet that I was 100 % sure could not be cowed into hiding the truth .
Young has until Friday to find a new home .
He vows to keep Cryptome online , " in the US or elsewhere .
Or if necessary , underground , or via means not easily shuttered , or by way of whatever is invented for opposing technologies of information control . "
Maybe Young will find his own undisclosed location .
If I told you to choose between two technical books , one by renowned Windows author Charles Petzold , and another by some guy you 've probably never heard of , which one would you pick ?
That 's what I thought too .
Until I sat down to read both of them .
Take a look for yourself :
Charles Petzold 's Applications = Code +
Markup :
Adam Nathan 's Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed :
Beyond the obvious benefit of full color printing , which adds another dimension to any text , it 's not even close .
The Nathan book is the clear winner :
It 's full of diagrams , screenshots , and illustrations showing the meaning of the code .
the meaning of the code .
The text is frequently broken up by helpful color - coded sidebars such as " digging deeper " , " FAQ " , and " warning " .
The code / markup snippets are smaller and easier to digest ; they do n't dominate page upon page of the text .
Liberal use of bullets , tables , subheadings , and other textual elements provides excellent scannability .
The book has a sense of humor without being obnoxious or cloying .
Did I mention it's in color ?
The Nathan book is brilliant .
It reads like a blog and competes toe - to - toe with anything you 'd find on the web .
Petzold 's book , in contrast , is a greyscale sea of endless text and interminable code .
There are so few diagrams in the book that you get a little thrill every time you encounter one .
It also artificially segregates code and markup : the first half is all C# code ; it 's not until the second half that you see any XAML markup whatsoever , even though XAML is one of the most important new features of WPF , and the one developers will be least familiar with .
I suppose this sort of old - school treatment is typical Petzold .
What do you expect from a guy who thinks Visual Studio rots the minds of software developers ?
The difference in approach is immediately obvious to anyone who opens both books .
One looks compelling , fun , and inviting ; the other looks like a painful , textbook slog that 's the equivalent of writing code in Notepad .
Petzold 's an excellent writer , but writing alone can't make up for the massive layout deficiencies of his book .
It 's too bad , because I loved Petzold 's earlier book Code , which was a love letter to the personal computer filled with wonderful illustrations .
As much as I respect Petzold , you should avoid his WPF book .
Get the Nathan book instead -- you 'll love it .
Publishers , take note : I 'd sure be buying a heck of a lot more technical books if more of them were like this one .
Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
October 2006
In the Q & A period after a recent talk , someone asked what made startups fail .
After standing there gaping for a few seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question .
It 's equivalent to asking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of failure , you succeed — and that 's too big a question to answer on the fly .
Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction .
If you have a list of all the things you should n't do , you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by negating .
And this form of list may be more useful in practice .
It 's easier to catch yourself doing something you should n't than always to remember to do something you should . [ 1 ]
In a sense there 's just one mistake that kills startups : not making something users want .
If you make something users want , you 'll probably be fine , whatever else you do or do n't do .
And if you do n't make something users want , then you 're dead , whatever else you do or do n't do .
So really this is a list of 18 things that cause startups not to make something users want .
Nearly all failure funnels through that .
1. Single Founder
Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person ?
Even companies you think of as having one founder , like Oracle , usually turn out to have more .
It seems unlikely this is a coincidence .
What 's wrong with having one founder ?
To start with , it 's a vote of no confidence .
It probably means the founder could n't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him .
That 's pretty alarming , because his friends are the ones who know him best .
But even if the founder 's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet , he 's still at a disadvantage .
Starting a startup is too hard for one person .
Even if you could do all the work yourself , you need colleagues to brainstorm with , to talk you out of stupid decisions , and to cheer you up when things go wrong .
The last one might be the most important .
The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone .
When you have multiple founders , esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws .
Each thinks " I can't let my friends down . "
This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature , and it 's missing when there 's just one founder .
2. Bad Location
Startups prosper in some places and not others .
Silicon Valley dominates , then Boston , then Seattle , Austin , Denver , and New York .
After that there 's not much .
Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley .
In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it 's too small to measure .
Why is the falloff so sharp ?
Probably for the same reason it is in other industries .
What 's the sixth largest fashion center in the US ?
The sixth largest center for oil , or finance , or publishing ?
Whatever they are they 're probably so far from the top that it would be misleading even to call them centers .
It 's an interesting question why cities become startup hubs , but the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is for any industry : that 's where the experts are .
Standards are higher ; people are more sympathetic to what you 're doing ; the kind of people you want to hire want to live there ; supporting industries are there ; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the same business .
Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit , but it 's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each .
3. Marginal Niche
Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem : choosing a small , obscure niche in the hope of avoiding competition .
If you watch little kids playing sports , you notice that below a certain age they 're afraid of the ball .
When the ball comes near them their instinct is to avoid it .
I did n't make a lot of catches as an eight year old outfielder , because whenever a fly ball came my way , I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it .
Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing with fly balls .
If you make anything good , you 're going to have competitors , so you may as well face that .
You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas .
I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious .
It 's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue smaller ones because they seem safer .
Your unconscious wo n't even let you think of grand ideas .
So the solution may be to think about ideas without involving yourself .
What would be a great idea for someone else to do as a startup ?
4. Derivative Idea
Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company .
That 's one source of ideas , but not the best .
If you look at the origins of successful startups , few were started in imitation of some other startup .
Where did they get their ideas ?
Usually from some specific , unsolved problem the founders identified .
Our startup made software for making online stores .
When we started it , there was n't any ; the few sites you could order from were hand - made at great expense by web consultants .
We knew that if online shopping ever took off , these sites would have to be generated by software , so we wrote some .
Pretty straightforward .
It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally .
Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer , Google because Larry and Sergey could n't find stuff online , Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith could n't exchange email at work .
So instead of copying the Facebook , with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored , look for ideas from the other direction .
Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems they solved , look for problems and imagine the company that might solve them . [ 2 ]
What do people complain about ?
What do you wish there was ?
5. Obstinacy
In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you want to achieve , and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you encounter .
Starting startups is not one of them .
The stick - to - your - vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal , where the problem is well - defined .
Startups are more like science , where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads .
So do n't get too attached to your original plan , because it 's probably wrong .
Most successful startups end up doing something different than they originally intended — often so different that it does n't even seem like the same company .
You have to be prepared to see the better idea when it arrives .
And the hardest part of that is often discarding your old idea .
But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right .
Switching to a new idea every week will be equally fatal .
Is there some kind of external test you can use ?
One is to ask whether the ideas represent some kind of progression .
If in each new idea you 're able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones , then you 're probably in a process that converges .
Whereas if you keep restarting from scratch , that 's a bad sign .
Fortunately there 's someone you can ask for advice : your users .
If you 're thinking about turning in some new direction and your users seem excited about it , it 's probably a good bet .
6. Hiring Bad Programmers
I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list , because nearly all the founders I know are programmers .
This is not a serious problem for them .
They might accidentally hire someone bad , but it 's not going to kill the company .
In a pinch they can do whatever 's required themselves .
But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the 90s , it was bad programmers .
A lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it .
That 's actually much harder than it sounds — almost impossibly hard in fact — because business guys can't tell which are the good programmers .
They do n't even get a shot at the best ones , because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy .
In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers ( it says here on his resume that he 's a Microsoft Certified Developer ) but who are n't .
Then they 're mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters .
This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company , but without the advantages .
So how do you pick good programmers if you 're not a programmer ?
I do n't think there 's an answer .
I was about to say you 'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people .
But if you can't recognize good programmers , how would you even do that ?
7. Choosing the Wrong Platform
A related problem ( since it tends to be done by bad programmers ) is choosing the wrong platform .
For example , I think a lot of startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build server - based applications on Windows .
Hotmail was still running on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it , presumably because Windows could n't handle the load .
If Hotmail 's founders had chosen to use Windows , they would have been swamped .
PayPal only just dodged this bullet .
After they merged with X.com , the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1 % as well on Windows as Unix .
Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead .
Platform is a vague word .
It could mean an operating system , or a programming language , or a " framework " built on top of a programming language .
It implies something that both supports and limits , like the foundation of a house .
The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that seem to outsiders to be fine , responsible choices and yet , like Windows in the 90s , will destroy you if you choose them .
Java applets were probably the most spectacular example .
This was supposed to be the new way of delivering applications .
Presumably it killed just about 100 % of the startups who believed that .
How do you pick the right platforms ?
The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them choose .
But there is a trick you could use if you 're not a programmer : visit a top computer science department and see what they use in research projects .
8. Slowness in Launching
Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done .
It 's intrinsic to the medium ; software is always 85 % done .
It takes an effort of will to push through this and get something released to users . [ 3 ]
Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch .
Most are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday life .
There 's something that needs to happen first .
Maybe .
But if the software were 100 % finished and ready to launch at the push of a button , would they still be waiting ?
One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually finish some quantum of work .
Nothing is truly finished till it 's released ; you can see that from the rush of work that 's always involved in releasing anything , no matter how finished you thought it was .
The other reason you need to launch is that it 's only by bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it .
Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching : working too slowly ; not truly understanding the problem ; fear of having to deal with users ; fear of being judged ; working on too many different things ; excessive perfectionism .
Fortunately you can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch something fairly quickly .
9. Launching Too Early
Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too fast , but it is possible to launch too fast .
The danger here is that you ruin your reputation .
You launch something , the early adopters try it out , and if it 's no good they may never come back .
So what 's the minimum you need to launch ?
We suggest startups think about what they plan to do , identify a core that 's both ( a ) useful on its own and ( b ) something that can be incrementally expanded into the whole project , and then get that done as soon as possible .
This is the same approach I ( and many other programmers ) use for writing software .
Think about the overall goal , then start by writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful .
If it 's a subset , you 'll have to write it anyway , so in the worst case you wo n't be wasting your time .
But more likely you 'll find that implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you see more clearly what the rest should do .
The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant .
They do n't expect a newly launched product to do everything ; it just has to do something .
10 . Having No Specific User in Mind
You can't build things users like without understanding them .
I mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had .
Perhaps there 's a rule here : perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how well you understand the problem you 're solving , and the problems you understand best are your own . [ 4 ]
That 's just a theory .
What 's not a theory is the converse : if you 're trying to solve problems you do n't understand , you 're hosed .
And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone , they 're not sure exactly who , will want what they 're building .
Do the founders want it ?
No , they 're not the target market .
Who is ?
Teenagers .
People interested in local events ( that one is a perennial tarpit ) .
Or " business " users .
What business users ?
Gas stations ?
Movie studios ?
Defense contractors ?
You can of course build something for users other than yourself .
We did .
But you should realize you 're stepping into dangerous territory .
You 're flying on instruments , in effect , so you should ( a ) consciously shift gears , instead of assuming you can rely on your intuitions as you ordinarily would , and ( b ) look at the instruments .
In this case the instruments are the users .
When designing for other people you have to be empirical .
You can no longer guess what will work ; you have to find users and measure their responses .
So if you 're going to make something for teenagers or " business " users or some other group that does n't include you , you have to be able to talk some specific ones into using what you 're making .
If you can't , you 're on the wrong track .
11 . Raising Too Little Money
Most successful startups take funding at some point .
Like having more than one founder , it seems a good bet statistically .
How much should you take , though ?
Startup funding is measured in time .
Every startup that is n't profitable ( meaning nearly all of them , initially ) has a certain amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop .
This is sometimes referred to as runway , as in " How much runway do you have left ? "
It 's a good metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you 're going to be airborne or dead .
Too little money means not enough to get airborne .
What airborne means depends on the situation .
Usually you have to advance to a visibly higher level : if all you have is an idea , a working prototype ; if you have a prototype , launching ; if you 're launched , significant growth .
It depends on investors , because until you 're profitable that 's who you have to convince .
So if you take money from investors , you have to take enough to get to the next step , whatever that is . [ 5 ]
Fortunately you have some control over both how much you spend and what the next step is .
We advise startups to set both low , initially : spend practically nothing , and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype .
This gives you maximum flexibility .
12 . Spending Too Much
It 's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little .
If you run out of money , you could say either was the cause .
The only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other startups .
If you raised five million and ran out of money , you probably spent too much .
Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be .
Founders seem to have learned that lesson .
Plus it keeps getting cheaper to start a startup .
So as of this writing few startups spend too much .
None of the ones we 've funded have .
( And not just because we make small investments ; many have gone on to raise further rounds . )
The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people .
This bites you twice : in addition to increasing your costs , it slows you down — so money that 's getting consumed faster has to last longer .
Most hackers understand why that happens ; Fred Brooks explained it in The Mythical Man-Month .
We have three general suggestions about hiring : ( a ) do n't do it if you can avoid it , ( b ) pay people with equity rather than salary , not just to save money , but because you want the kind of people who are committed enough to prefer that , and ( c ) only hire people who are either going to write code or go out and get users , because those are the only things you need at first .
13 . Raising Too Much Money
It 's obvious how too little money could kill you , but is there such a thing as having too much ?
Yes and no .
The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it .
As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said , " Once you take several million dollars of my money , the clock is ticking . "
If VCs fund you , they 're not going to let you just put the money in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen .
They want that money to go to work . [ 6 ]
At the very least you 'll move into proper office space and hire more people .
That will change the atmosphere , and not entirely for the better .
Now most of your people will be employees rather than founders .
They wo n't be as committed ; they 'll need to be told what to do ; they 'll start to engage in office politics .
When you raise a lot of money , your company moves to the suburbs and has kids .
Perhaps more dangerously , once you take a lot of money it gets harder to change direction .
Suppose your initial plan was to sell something to companies .
After taking VC money you hire a sales force to do that .
What happens now if you realize you should be making this for consumers instead of businesses ?
That 's a completely different kind of selling .
What happens , in practice , is that you do n't realize that .
The more people you have , the more you stay pointed in the same direction .
Another drawback of large investments is the time they take .
The time required to raise money grows with the amount . [ 7 ]
When the amount rises into the millions , investors get very cautious .
VCs never quite say yes or no ; they just engage you in an apparently endless conversation .
Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge time sink — more work , probably , than the startup itself .
And you do n't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your competitors are spending theirs building things .
We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first reasonable deal they get .
If you get an offer from a reputable firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms , just take it and get on with building the company . [ 8 ]
Who cares if you could get a 30 % better deal elsewhere ?
Economically , startups are an all - or - nothing game .
Bargain - hunting among investors is a waste of time .
14 . Poor Investor Management
As a founder , you have to manage your investors .
You should n't ignore them , because they may have useful insights .
But neither should you let them run the company .
That 's supposed to be your job .
If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies they fund , why did n't they start them ?
Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them .
In our startup , we erred on the ignoring side .
A lot of our energy got drained away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product .
But this was less costly than giving in , which would probably have destroyed the company .
If the founders know what they 're doing , it 's better to have half their attention focused on the product than the full attention of investors who do n't .
How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on how much money you 've taken .
When you raise VC - scale money , the investors get a great deal of control .
If they have a board majority , they 're literally your bosses .
In the more common case , where founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside directors , all the investors have to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company .
If things go well , this should n't matter .
So long as you seem to be advancing rapidly , most investors will leave you alone .
But things do n't always go smoothly in startups .
Investors have made trouble even for the most successful companies .
One of the most famous examples is Apple , whose board made a nearly fatal blunder in firing Steve Jobs .
Apparently even Google got a lot of grief from their investors early on .
15 . Sacrificing Users to ( Supposed ) Profit
When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want , you 'll be fine , you may have noticed I did n't mention anything about having the right business model .
That 's not because making money is unimportant .
I 'm not suggesting that founders start companies with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before they tank .
The reason we tell founders not to worry about the business model initially is that making something people want is so much harder .
I do n't know why it 's so hard to make something people want .
It seems like it should be straightforward .
But you can tell it must be hard by how few startups do it .
Because making something people want is so much harder than making money from it , you should leave business models for later , just as you 'd leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2 .
In version 1 , solve the core problem .
And the core problem in a startup is how to create wealth ( = how much people want something x the number who want it ) , not how to convert that wealth into money .
The companies that win are the ones that put users first .
Google , for example .
They made search work , then worried about how to make money from it .
And yet some startup founders still think it 's irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning .
They 're often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes from less malleable industries .
It is irresponsible not to think about business models .
It 's just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product .
16 . Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty
Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money from it .
And not just the lazy ones .
Larry and Sergey apparently felt this way too at first .
After developing their new search algorithm , the first thing they tried was to get some other company to buy it .
Start a company ?
Yech .
Most hackers would rather just have ideas .
But as Larry and Sergey found , there 's not much of a market for ideas .
No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and use that to grow a user base .
Then they 'll pay big time .
Maybe this will change , but I doubt it will change much .
There 's nothing like users for convincing acquirers .
It 's not just that the risk is decreased .
The acquirers are human , and they have a hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for being clever .
When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot of users , they can tell themselves they 're buying the users rather than the cleverness , and this is easier for them to swallow . [ 9 ]
If you 're going to attract users , you 'll probably have to get up from your computer and go find some .
It 's unpleasant work , but if you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of succeeding .
In the first batch of startups we funded , in the summer of 2005 , most of the founders spent all their time building their applications .
But there was one who was away half the time talking to executives at cell phone companies , trying to arrange deals .
Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker ? [ 10 ]
But it paid off , because this startup seems the most successful of that group by an order of magnitude .
If you want to start a startup , you have to face the fact that you can't just hack .
At least one hacker will have to spend some of the time doing business stuff .
17 . Fights Between Founders
Fights between founders are surprisingly common .
About 20 % of the startups we 've funded have had a founder leave .
It happens so often that we 've reversed our attitude to vesting .
We still do n't require it , but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly way for people to quit .
A founder leaving does n't necessarily kill a startup , though .
Plenty of successful startups have had that happen . [ 11 ]
Fortunately it 's usually the least committed founder who leaves .
If there are three founders and one who was lukewarm leaves , big deal .
If you have two and one leaves , or a guy with critical technical skills leaves , that 's more of a problem .
But even that is survivable .
Blogger got down to one person , and they bounced back .
Most of the disputes I 've seen between founders could have been avoided if they 'd been more careful about who they started a company with .
Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people .
Which means they 're inevitable .
And most founders who 've been burned by such disputes probably had misgivings , which they suppressed , when they started the company .
Do n't suppress misgivings .
It 's much easier to fix problems before the company is started than after .
So do n't include your housemate in your startup because he'd feel left out otherwise .
Do n't start a company with someone you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you wo n't find anyone else .
The people are the most important ingredient in a startup , so do n't compromise there .
18 . A Half - Hearted Effort
The failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular flameouts .
Those are actually the elite of failures .
The most common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes , but the one that does n't do much of anything — the one we never even hear about , because it was some project a couple guys started on the side while working on their day jobs , but which never got anywhere and was gradually abandoned .
Statistically , if you want to avoid failure , it would seem like the most important thing is to quit your day job .
Most founders of failed startups do n't quit their day jobs , and most founders of successful ones do .
If startup failure were a disease , the CDC would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs .
Does that mean you should quit your day job ?
Not necessarily .
I 'm guessing here , but I 'd guess that many of these would - be founders may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company , and that in the back of their minds , they know it .
The reason they do n't invest more time in their startup is that they know it 's a bad investment . [ 12 ]
I 'd also guess there 's some band of people who could have succeeded if they 'd taken the leap and done it full - time , but did n't .
I have no idea how wide this band is , but if the winner / borderline / hopeless progression has the sort of distribution you 'd expect , the number of people who could have made it , if they 'd quit their day job , is probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make it . [ 13 ]
If that 's true , most startups that could succeed fail because the founders do n't devote their whole efforts to them .
That certainly accords with what I see out in the world .
Most startups fail because they do n't make something people want , and the reason most do n't is that they do n't try hard enough .
In other words , starting startups is just like everything else .
The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough .
To the extent there 's a secret to success , it 's not to be in denial about that .
Notes
[ 1 ] This is not a complete list of the causes of failure , just those you can control .
There are also several you can't , notably ineptitude and bad luck .
[ 2 ] Ironically , one variant of the Facebook that might work is a facebook exclusively for college students .
[ 3 ] Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying " Real artists ship . "
This is a fine sentence , but unfortunately not true .
Many famous works of art are unfinished .
It 's true in fields that have hard deadlines , like architecture and filmmaking , but even there people tend to be tweaking stuff till it 's yanked out of their hands .
[ 4 ] There 's probably also a second factor : startup founders tend to be at the leading edge of technology , so problems they face are probably especially valuable .
[ 5 ]
You should take more than you think you 'll need , maybe 50 % to 100 % more , because software takes longer to write and deals longer to close than you expect .
[ 6 ] Since people sometimes call us VCs , I should add that we 're not .
VCs invest large amounts of other people 's money .
We invest small amounts of our own , like angel investors .
[ 7 ] Not linearly of course , or it would take forever to raise five million dollars .
In practice it just feels like it takes forever .
Though if you include the cases where VCs do n't invest , it would literally take forever in the median case .
And maybe we should , because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that they take a long time .
That 's the best case .
The real danger is that you 'll expend a lot of time and get nothing .
[ 8 ] Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see if you have the balls to ask for more .
It 's lame that VCs play such games , but some do .
If you 're dealing with one of those you should push back on the valuation a bit .
[ 9 ] Suppose YouTube 's founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told them " Google Video is badly designed .
Give us $ 10 million and we 'll tell you all the mistakes you made . "
They would have gotten the royal raspberry .
Eighteen months later Google paid $ 1.6 billion for the same lesson , partly because they could then tell themselves that they were buying a phenomenon , or a community , or some vague thing like that .
I do n't mean to be hard on Google .
They did better than their competitors , who may have now missed the video boat entirely .
[ 10 ] Yes , actually : dealing with the government .
But phone companies are up there .
[ 11 ]
Many more than most people realize , because companies do n't advertise this .
Did you know Apple originally had three founders ?
[ 12 ] I 'm not dissing these people .
I do n't have the determination myself .
I 've twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb , and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur of poverty I just was n't willing to endure the stress of a startup .
[ 13 ]
So how do you know whether you 're in the category of people who should quit their day job , or the presumably larger one who should n't ?
I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge for yourself and that you should seek outside advice , before realizing that that 's what we do .
We think of ourselves as investors , but viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for advising people whether or not to quit their day job .
We could be mistaken , and no doubt often are , but we do at least bet money on our conclusions .

Why pi ?
Simon Cozens wrote to me yesterday to ask what the heck was up with π : what property of a circle makes it . . . an irrational number .
. . perhaps about as arbitrary a number as you can get .
I thought about this pretty hard , and , to my amazement , I came up with a plausible answer .
So here we are .
The one - paragraph summary :
My theory is that the association of the very weird and complex number π with a geometric object as simple as a circle is a reflection of the underlying fundamental complexity of Euclidean geometry : specifically , that its metric is a nonlinear function .
First I 'm going to spend some time arguing that π does require explanation .
I expect that almost everyone will agree that π is weird ; if you do agree , feel free to skip this section .
Then I 'll discuss Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries .
This is important , because the relation between π and circles appears to be a special property of Euclidean geometry , one which does not occur , for example , in spherical geometry .
Finally , I 'll look at the essential properties of Euclidean geometry , and why I think it is more complex than people usually realize .
π is complex and bizarre
In this section , I 'm going to argue that the question is indeed worth asking .
π is an extremely peculiar number , even by mathematical standards .
You often hear π mentioned in the same breath with e , another constant of fundamental mathematical importance .
But e is much more tractable than π is , and much better understood .
In fact , the degree to which π is not understood is rather shocking when you consider its ubiquity .
If you do n't need to be persuaded that π is unusually weird , even as transcendental numbers go , you may want to skip to the next section .
Really , this section is here to address people who think they know more mathematics than they do , who want to argue that π is no more or less complicated than any other number .
But I think it is .
It should be fairly clear that , as a representation of real numbers , decimal fractions are not very satisfactory .
For example , you might like simple numbers to have simple representations .
But the representation of 1/3 is 0.33333 .... , which is n't even finite .
The fact that a complicated number like like 3674/31250 ( " 0.117568 " ) has a simpler representation than a simple number like 1/3 just demonstrates that the system is defective .
3674/31250 gets a simple representation not because it is a simple number , but because 31250 happens to divide 106 .
This being the case , it is perhaps not too surprising that nobody can make head or tail of the representation of π , which is 3.14159265358979 ... .
As far as I know , the state of our current understanding of this representation of π can be summed up as : None But that might just be the fault of the representation .
The representation is based on the number 10 , and it is not clear that π has anything to do with 10 , so our failure to find an answer here may just indicate that the question was not worth asking .
There are better representations of real numbers ; one such is the so - called " continued fraction representation " .
I do n't want to explain this in detail in this article , but I can refer you to a talk I gave on the subject .
But an itemization of this representation 's desirable properties may be persuasive even if you do n't know how it works :
In continued fraction notation , a number has a finite representation when , and only when , it is rational .
The representation is not inappropriately snuggly with the number 10 , or with any other number .
Simple rationals have simple representations and more complicated rationals have more complicated representations .
For example , 1/3 is represented as [ 0 ; 3 ] and 3674/31250 is represented as [ 0 ; 8 , 1 , 1 , 43 , 4 , 5 ] .
Some irrational numbers have simple ( although infinite ) representations .
For example , in the customary system , √ 2 is an incomprehensible soup of digits starting 1.414213562 ... .
In the continued fraction system , it is [ 1 ; 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , ... ] .
If you turn an irrational number into a rational one by chopping off the infinite tail of the continued fraction representation , you get a very closely - related rational result , one that is numerically as close as possible to the original number .
This is not true of the decimal fraction .
If you chop off √ 2 after a couple of terms of decimal fraction , you get 1.41 , which is 141/100 .
If you chop off √ after a couple of terms of continued fraction , you get [ 1 ; 2 , 2 ] , which is 7/5 .
This is slightly less accurate than 141/100 , but the denominator is twenty times smaller .
If you chop a little later , you get [ 1 ; 2 , 2 , 2 ] , which is 17 / 12 , which is a lot more accurate than 141/100 , even though the denominator is only 12 .
So maybe our problems with π will be solved by considering its continued fraction representation , which we might hope would be simple and tractable .
Sometimes this works , as with √ 2 .
The decimal expansion of e is incomprehensible ( 2.7182818284590452 ... ) but it has a very nice continued fraction representation : [ 2 ; 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 1 , 6 , 1 , 1 , 8 , 1 , 1 , 10 , 1 , ... ] .
But it does n't work for π .
The continued fraction representation of π is [ 3 ; 7 , 15 , 1 , 292 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 3 , 1 , 14 , ... ] , and as far as I know , the state of our current understanding of this representation of π can be summed up as : None So much for continued fractions .
We might hope for some understanding about why π is irrational .
The proof that √ 2 is irrational is elementary , and dates back to the Greeks ; you can understand it as being related to the fact that 2 is not a perfect square .
π was not shown to be irrational until 1761 , and the proof is not simple , which means that nobody knows a simple argument about why it should be the complicated thing it is , rather than a simple fraction .
So π is complex and poorly - understood , even compared with other important transcendental numbers like e. Euclidean geometry M. Cozens asked :
Is pi inherent in our definition of a circle , or our particular geometry , or our planet , or could the ratio be different in different worlds ?
I think this question is very insightful .
π , at least as it relates to circles , is inherent in a particular geometry , namely , Euclidean geometry .
Euclidean geometry takes its name from Euclid , who wrote Elements , an extremely influential treatise on geometry , about 2300 years ago .
Most of the Elements is concerned with plane geometry , which takes place in an infinite , flat two - dimensional space .
π arises naturally in this kind of space as the perimeter of a circle .
Non-Euclidean geometry
In non-Euclidean spaces , π is geometrically much less important .
For example , consider geometry done on a sphere .
If we keep the definition of " line " as the path of shortest distance between two points , then our " lines " turn out to be great circles on the sphere — that is , circles whose centers are at the center of the sphere ; the equator is an example .
The 49th parallel is not a " line " because it 's not a path of shortest distance ; for any two points on the 49th parallel , there 's a path between them over the surface of the sphere that is shorter than the one along the parallel .
( This may seem strange , but it 's true , and it's why direct flights from New York to Taipei often stop off in Anchorage , Alaska . )
In addition to being a line , the equator is also an example of a circle .
What 's a circle ?
Circles look pretty much the way you expect them to .
A circle is the set of all points that are some fixed distance from a center point .
The equator is all the points that are a certain fixed distance from the north pole .
The 49th parallel is also a circle ; its center is also the north pole .
The " diameter " of a circle is the longest possible " line " you can draw from one point on the circle to another .
A diameter of a circle has the property that it always goes through the center of the circle , as you would hope and expect .
For the equator , a diameter goes through the north pole .
The picture to the right shows the equator in red , its center , the north pole , in yellow , and a diameter of the equator in blue .
The 49th parallel is in green .
Let 's say that the circumference of the equator , the red line , is 1 .
Then the length of the equator 's diameter , the blue line , is 1 / 2 .
If we were expecting to divide the circumference by the diameter and get π , we are in for a surprise , because we just got 2 instead .
For the 49th parallel , the ratio of circumference to diameter is larger : I calculate about 2.88 .
For smaller circles , the ratio is larger still .
For very small circles , the ratio is very close to π , because a small circle can't tell whether it's on a sphere or in a plane ; up close the two things look the same .
So the relation between π and circles is actually a special property of Euclidean geometry .
Circles in non-Euclidean spaces have a perimeter - to - diameter ratio that is different from π.
Euclidean metric
The single fundamental property of Euclidean geometry is that the distance between two points , say ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) , is ( (x 2 -x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 -y 1 ) 2) 1/2 .
( Or , in higher - dimensional spaces , the obvious extension of this formula . )
If you change the way you measure distance , you get a different kind of geometry with different kinds of circles that have different perimeter - to - diameter ratios .
In an earlier article , I discussed an alternative distance function , called the Manhattan distance , which gives diamond - shaped circles whose perimeter - to - diameter ratio is always 4 .
The Euclidean distance function is nothing more than the familiar Pythagorean theorem .
It is very difficult for me to imagine any reasonable way to do plane geometry without the Pythagorean theorem .
It is just too simple .
Even the proof is simple :
Each blue triangle has area ab / 2 .
The left - hand large square is made of four triangles and two smaller squares , for a total area of 4 ( ab / 2 ) + a 2 + b2 ; the right - hand large square is made of four triangles and one smaller square , for a total area of 4 ( ab / 2 ) + c2 .
Each large square has edges whose lengths are a + b , so the two large squares are the same size , and 4 ( ab / 2 ) + a 2 + b2 = 4 ( ab/2 ) + c2 , or a 2 + b2 = c 2 .
End of proof .
So the relationship of π ( which is complicated ) to circles ( which appear to be simple ) is grounded in the Euclidean distance formula .
If you change the distance formula , π is no longer related to circles .
So the weirdness must be due , at least in part , to some complexity in the Euclidean distance formula .
But what 's complex about the Euclidean distance formula ?
How could it be simpler ?
Actually , I think it only seems simple because it is so familiar .
The Euclidean distance formula is , in some ways , deeply weird .
I realized this a few months ago , but everyone I mentioned it to acted like I was insane .
But now I 'm pretty sure .
I think the essence of the problem with π is that the Euclidean distance function is nonlinear in the two spatial coordinates x and y .
Nonlinearity of the Euclidean metric Linear functions are very well - behaved .
If F is a linear function , then F ( a+b ) = F ( a ) + F( b ) , which means that you can calculate the contributions of a and b independently of each other .
To calculate F of some very complicated argument , you can break the argument into simple components and deal with them all separately .
With quadratic functions like the Euclidean distance function , you cannot do this ; complex problems are not easily decomposable into simple ones .
For the Euclidean metric , it means that the horizontalness and verticalosity are not independent , but are tangled together and cannot be separated .
What do we really mean by the perimeter of a circle ?
The circle is the set of points ( x , y ) which are at distance 1 from the point ( 0,0 ) .
The only meaningful way I know to talk about the length of this set is to calculate it as a limit of an approximate polygonal path as the path gets more and more segments .
So you are necessarily dragging in an infinite limiting process , and such processes are always complicated .
If the distance function were linear , it would n't matter , because then you could treat the horizontal and vertical components separately , and when you did that , you would be dealing with paths in one dimension , which , being straight lines , would be simple .
You can see this if you consider the Manhattan distance function :
It does n't matter how you get from ( x 1 , y 1 ) to ( x 2 , y 2 ) ; whatever path you take , whether you take a lot of steps or only one , the distance is always |x 2 -x 1 | + |y 2 -y 1 | , because the distance function is linear , and thus there is no interaction between the x parts and the y parts .
But with a nonlinear distance function like the Euclidean metric , it does matter what path you take .
I was thinking a few months ago about how peculiar this is .
I cannot think of anything else that behaves this way .
Suppose you have two jugs and you start filling them with milk .
You find that to fill each jug separately requires one quart , but to fill both at once requires only 1.4142 quarts .
Would n't that freak you out ?
But space does behave like that .
To drive ten miles north takes a gallon of gas .
To drive ten miles east takes a gallon of gas .
North and east are perpendicular and should be completely independent of each other .
To drive ten miles north and ten miles east should require two gallons of gas .
But it requires only 1.4142 gallons .
How the heck did that happen ?
I believe that this strange entanglement between north and east , two things one might have supposed were independent , is the ultimate root of what makes the circumference of a circle such a peculiar number .
I was very pleased to have this confirmation that the entanglement between horizontal and vertical is strange and complex , because , as I mentioned before , when I tried to explain to people what I found strange about it , they thought I was nuts .
One - dimensional circles
My theory is that the peculiar length of a circle 's perimeter is a result of the peculiar interaction between the otherwise apparently independent spatial dimensions in Euclidean space .
If this theory is correct , we should expect that the corresponding perimeter in a one - dimensional space will not be peculiar .
A one - dimensional Euclidean space , having only one dimension , has no strange interactions between independent directions .
And indeed , this is the case !
The perimeter of a one - dimensional circle does not involve π.
It 's simply 2 ; the " area " ( which is really length ) is 2r .
You only get difficult numbers in spaces of at least 2 dimensions .
Why 3 ? M. Cozens also asked me why the number came out to be around 3 , rather than around 5 or 57 , and there I was on much shakier ground .
I did not have any clever insights , and all I could do was itemize a bunch of stuff that seemed to bear on the issue .
It will probably appear here in a future article .

peers
Our style is to refer to peers by the name by which they are most widely known , which in most cases will be the one they had before their peerage .
Use this at first mention , a simple title ( Lord or Lady ) at second mention , and thereafter surname only .
Some examples :
Andrew Adonis ( first mention ) , Lord Adonis ( second mention ) , Adonis ( thereafter ) .
Paddy Ashdown , Lord Ashdown , Ashdown .
Sebastian Coe , Lord Coe , Coe .
Norman Foster , Lord Foster , Foster .
Tony Hall , Lord Hall , Hall .
Greville Janner , Lord Janner , Janner .
Jenny Jones , Lady Jones , Jones .
Martha Lane Fox , Lady Lane - Fox ( note hyphen ) , Lane Fox .
Andrew Lloyd Webber , Lord Lloyd - Webber ( note hyphen ) , Lloyd Webber .
Peter Mandelson , Lord Mandelson , Mandelson .
David Owen , Lord Owen , Owen .
John Prescott , Lord Prescott , Prescott .
John Reid , Lord Reid , Reid .
Richard Rogers , Lord Rogers , Rogers .
Chris Smith , Lord Smith , Smith .
Sayeeda Warsi , Lady Warsi , Warsi .
For people who were not widely known before becoming peers , or who are better known by their title , use a simple title at first mention , and thereafter surname only .
Examples :
Lord Sewel ( first mention ) , Sewel ( thereafter ) .
Lady Stowell , Stowell .
Even if you claim to be on good terms with the peer in question , avoid such constructions as “ Lady Helena Kennedy ” or “ Baroness Shirley Williams ” : call them Helena Kennedy QC at first mention , then Lady Kennedy , then Kennedy ; Shirley Williams , then Lady Williams , then Williams .
Do not use Baron , Baroness etc unless there is a particular reason to do so – for example , for satirical or ironic purposes ( “ Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham ” ) .
Where two or more peers share the same name , make it clear which one you are writing about , for example :
Lola Young , the former actor , artist and academic ( first mention ) , Lady Young of Hornsey ( second mention ) , thereafter Young .
Barbara Young , a former chief executive of the Environment Agency and Care Quality Commission ( first mention ) , Lady Young of Old Scone ( second mention ) , thereafter Young .
Peers in historical pieces should be given their titles only if they had received them at the time , for example Herbert Asquith ’s Liberal government and Margaret Thatcher ’s Tory government ( not Lord Asquith ’s , Lady Thatcher ’s ) – they had not yet been given peerages
peewit
peking duck
pendant
noun ; pendent adjective
peninsula
noun ; peninsular adjective
penknife
penny , pence
1p is one penny , not “ one pence ”
pensioners
not “ old age pensioners ” or “ OAPs ” ; older people is preferable to “ elderly people ” or ( even worse ) “ the elderly ” .
While this term is useful in headlines , it should be avoided in text as a description of an individual .
As one of our readers notes : “ This usage defines older people by their non-participation in the workforce and immediately typifies them as dependents or drains on the public purse .
Rupert Murdoch and Michael Caine are never described as ‘ pensioners ’ because they are perceived as still contributing to the economy , so does the term only apply to the little people ? ”
Reporters should ask what job people used to do and then describe them as a retired banker / powerboat racer or former whatever ( including homemaker )
peony

people - smuggling
The hyphen helps to clarify such sentences as : “ The problem of people smuggling between north Africa and Europe has increased ”
Pepsi-Cola
TM ; a brand of cola ; the company is PepsiCo
per
avoid ; use English : “ She earns £ 30,000 a year ” is better than “ per year ” .
If you must use it , the Latin preposition is followed by another Latin word , eg per capita , not per head .
Exception : miles per hour , which we write mph
per cent
% in headlines and copy
percentage rises
seem to give us a lot of problems : an increase from 3 % to 5 % is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2 - point increase , not a 2 % increase ; any sentence saying “ such and such rose or fell by X % ” should be considered and checked carefully
peremptory
not open to challenge ; perfunctory careless : if you carry out a task in a perfunctory way , you may face peremptory dismissal
Pérez de Cuéllar , Javier
Peruvian diplomat and former UN secretary general
perfect storm

were known as Peps
personal independence payment ( Pip )
persons
are people in our papers , even if they are the luckiest persons in the world
Perspex
TM
perspicacious
shrewd ; perspicuous easily understood
peruse
Some maintain that to peruse is to scrutinise or study carefully , rather than browse or skim , although Samuel Johnson defined it in the latter sense .
So if you use it your meaning will be unclear and , even if you are being ironic , you will sound pretentious
peshmerga
Kurdish armed fighters ( it means “ those who face death ” )

poet laureate
Carol Ann Duffy took over from Andrew Motion in 2009
‘ poet laureate of punk ’
a cliche best avoided , not least because we have used it to describe the following people : Patti Smith ( who has perhaps the best claim to the title ) , John Cooper Clarke , Ian Dury , Elvis Costello , Iggy Pop , Dee Dee Ramone , Katie Harkin ( Sky Larkin , Sleater - Kinney ) and Tim “ TV ” Smith ( the Adverts )
poetry
Ideally , run line by line , as it was written :
I struck the board and cry’d , ‘ No more ;
I will abroad . ’
What , shall I ever sigh and pine ?
My lines and life are free ; free as the rode ,
Loose as the winde , as large as store .
If you do n’t have room to run it line by line , separate the lines with spaces and a slash :
I struck the board and cry’d , ‘ No more ; / I will abroad . ’ /
What , shall I ever sigh and pine ? /
My lines and life are free ; free as the rode , / Loose as the winde , as large as store .
Italics are acceptable , though not essential
point - to - point
pointe
( ballet ) ; on pointe , not on point or en pointe
Pokémon
singular and plural
Polari
A form of language used mostly by gay men and lesbians , derived in part from slang used by sailors , actors and prostitutes and popularised in the 1960s BBC radio comedy Round the Horne by the characters Julian and Sandy .
Example : “ Vada the dolly eke on the bona omee ajax ” ( Look at the gorgeous face on that nice man over there ) ; “ naff ” is an example of Polari that has passed into more general use , as are “ butch ” , “ camp ” and “ dizzy ”
Polaroid
pole position
The fastest qualifier in a motor race starts from pole position or on pole , alongside one other driver ( on occasion , two or more others ) on the front row of the grid .
Take care if using metaphorically , and do not spell it “ poll position ” , even in election stories , as we have been known to do
Police Federation
Normally no need to use its full title , the Police Federation of England and Wales , but note initial caps .
The style for individual force federations is Metropolitan police federation , Essex police federation , etc .
It ’s fine to use “ the federation ” after first mention but make it clear whether you are referring to the national body or a local one
police forces
Metropolitan police ( the Met after first mention ) , West Midlands police , New York police department ( NYPD at second mention ) , etc , but note Royal Military Police and British Transport Police .
Police forces are normally plural : Kent police are investigating , etc , but note that while the Metropolitan police are plural , the Met is singular , as is Police Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI at second mention )
police ranks
Use abbreviation at first mention , then just surname , eg DCI Jane Tennison , thereafter Tennison .
Other abbreviations : PC ( for both male and female police constables ) , Sgt , DS ( Detective Sergeant ) , Insp , DI , Ch Insp , DCI , Supt , Ch Supt , Det Supt ( Detective Superintendent ) , DCS .
Do not abbreviate commissioner , commander , etc

and similar phrases confusing location with perpetrator should not be used when referring to countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the second world war ; the appropriate phrase here would be “ Nazi death camps in German - occupied Poland ” or similar
politburo
political correctness
a term to be avoided on the grounds that it is , in Polly Toynbee ’s words , “ an empty rightwing smear designed only to elevate its user ”
political language
Use quotation marks around partisan or questionable phrases such as “ big society ” ( at first mention ) , “ broken Britain ” and “ death tax ”
political parties
Always lowercase for the word “ party ” : Labour party , Green party , Communist party of Great Britain ( Marxist - Leninist ) , UK Independence party , etc .
Note that it is Scottish National ( not “ Nationalist ” ) party ; Plaid Cymru ; and in the US , Democratic ( not “ Democrat ” ) party , although its supporters are Democrats .
Abbreviate where appropriate ( for example , election results ) as follows : Con , Lab , Lib Dem , Green , SNP , PC , Ukip .
In Northern Ireland : Social Democratic and Labour party ( abbreviation : SDLP ) , Sinn Féin ( SF ) , Alliance party , Democratic Unionist party ( DUP ) , Ulster Unionist party ( UUP ) .
Political parties are normally singular , eg Labour is promising to raise taxes , the Conservative party is not very compassionate ; but the Conservatives are the nasty party , the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats , etc
pollack

polo neck
pomp or prime ?
We should say that someone is “ in his prime ” rather than the football commentator ’s cliche “ in his pomp ”
poncey

popular
liked ; populist wants to be liked : a party ’s policies may be populist , but its politicians may remain unpopular
populism
Broadly speaking , this refers to political actions or strategies that claim to promote the interests and views of ordinary people , often in opposition to the perceived elite .
Populism is often mistakenly used as a synonym for far - right politics but populists can appeal to people across the political spectrum so be clear about what kind of populism is being referred to eg leftwing populism , the far - right populist etc
pore or pour ?
You might pore over the style guide after pouring a cup of coffee
pornography
is preferable , as a term , to “ porn ”
Portakabin , Portaloo
TM ; say portable building , portable toilets , or you are certain to receive a letter from the Portakabin lawyers pointing out the error of your ways

Port of London authority
PLA on second mention
portuguese man o’war
not strictly a jellyfish , although jelly - like ; lowercase P unless you are writing about the 15th - century Portuguese navy .
As with , say , bass , deer and sheep , the plural is the same word as the singular : one portuguese man o’war , two portuguese man o’war , etc , unless you really are talking about ships , in which case it ’s men o’war
possessive gazetteer
“ A BBC newsreader was heard to announce that a detective had flown from Singapore ’s Raffles hotel to London ’s Heathrow to continue inquiries in London ’s Mayfair .
“ The possessive gazetteer – Birmingham ’s New Street , Liverpool ’s Mersey , Brighton ’s pier , Cornwall ’s St Ives , etc – is now in use everywhere , except in the everyday English used by newspaper readers .
“ It has no purpose and does n’t save space ( Birmingham ’s New Street is in fact one en longer than New Street , Birmingham ) . ”

potatoes
lower case , eg king edward , maris piper , unless a protected origin variety such as Jersey Royals
potentially
rarely necessary : verbs such as could and might already convey potentiality , so “ could potentially ” and “ might potentially ” are tautologous , as well as clumsy
pound
in text , symbol £ only when figures are used ( Britain saves the pound ; Oliver saved £ 1 ; pound ( weight ) abbreviates to lb , eg 2lb
POV
abbreviation for point of view
Pov
term coined by a Guardian journalist to depict laboured attempts to produce synonyms by writers seeking what Fowler called “ elegant variation ” ( and Orwell “ inelegant variation ” ) , often descending into cliche or absurdity .
Thus Dalí becomes “ the moustachioed surrealist ” and Ireland “ the cockatoo - shaped landmass ” .
Pov , incidentally , stands for “ popular orange vegetable ”
PoW
abbreviation for prisoner of war
Powergen
powerpop
one word ; musical genre defined by nostalgia for the 60s , in the form of chiming electric guitars and vocal harmonies .
Its proponents often profess to being inspired by the Beatles and the Byrds , but are never as good as either
powwow

practice
noun ; practise verb
practising homosexual
Do not use this expression , or the equally grotesque “ active homosexual ” ; where it is necessary to discuss someone ’s sex life , for example a story about gay clergy , it is possible to use other expressions , eg the Anglican church demands celibacy from gay clergy but permits the laity to have sexually active relationships

prepositions
appeal against , protest against , over or at , not “ appealed the sentence ” , “ protested the verdict ” , etc .
Schoolchildren used to be told ( by English teachers unduly influenced by Latin ) that it was ungrammatical to end sentences with a preposition , a fallacy satirised by Churchill ’s “ this is the sort of English up with which I will not put ” and HW Fowler ’s “ What did you bring me that book to be read to out of for ? ”
Take care after phrases following “ to ” : the subheading “ to we Conservatives , Labour looks as if it ’s heading back to the old horrors of the winter of discontent ” drew numerous protests from readers pointing out that it should have been “ to us Conservatives … “ ( The mistake was ours , not the shadow cabinet minister who wrote the piece )
prepubescent
pre-Raphaelite
prescribe , prescriptive
do something ; proscribe , proscriptive do n’t : prescriptive grammarians love to tell you what to do and to proscribe things they disapprove of
presently
What exactly does this mean ?
I will tell you presently – soon – is the traditional British English usage , whereas in American English it means at present , and is usually redundant ( “ we are presently third in the table ” ) .
To avoid ambiguity , say soon when you mean soon , and do n’t say anything when you mean now .
There is a similar problem with momentarily , which means for a moment or briefly in British English , and very soon to American ( and some British ) speakers .
Best avoided
president
lc except in title : President Obama , but Barack Obama , the US president
president - elect
press , the
singular : eg the British press is a shining example to the rest of the world
Press Complaints Commission
PCC on second mention
Press Gazette
formerly UK Press Gazette
pressure
Use put pressure on or pressed to mean apply pressure , ie not “ the Baggies pressured [ or pressurised ] the Wolves defence ”
prestigious
For centuries this meant deceptive , as in a conjuring trick ( prestidigitation ) .
The modern meaning is having prestige or status
Pret a Manger
food
prêt-à- porter
fashion
preteen
pretext
by its nature false , so while it may or may not be true that Tony Blair went to war on a pretext , it is tautologous to say he did so on a false one
prevaricate
Can mean speaking or acting with intent to deceive as well as avoiding giving a direct answer or making a firm decision , so take care when accusing someone of doing it .
Similar alternatives might include procrastinate ( putting something off ) , equivocate ( using ambiguous language to avoid speaking directly ) or vacillate ( being indecisive )
preventive
rather than preventative
prewar
but make clear which war you are talking about
PricewaterhouseCoopers
PwC after first mention ; PwC Consulting , which for some reason was widely ridiculed for changing its name to Monday , was bought by IBM
prima donna
plural prima donnas
prima facie
not italicised
primary care trusts
abolished in 2013 as part of the top - down reorganisation of the NHS that the Conservative party had promised would not happen ; their work was taken over by clinical commissioning groups
primate
another word for archbishop ; primate of All England : archbishop of Canterbury ; primate of England : archbishop of York ; but “ the primate ” on second reference
primates
higher members of the order Primates , essentially apes and humans
prime minister
David Cameron , the prime minister ; not prime minister David Cameron or “ prime minister Cameron ”
primitive
should not be used to describe tribal people
See Stone age
Prince Charles
or the Prince of Wales at first mention ; thereafter the prince or Charles
Prince ’s Trust
principal
first in importance ; principle standard of conduct : “ a vital principle , perhaps my principal rule in life , is to always split the infinitive ”
principality
should not be used to describe Wales
prior to , previous to
the word you want is “ before ”
prise
apart , open ( not prize )
prisoners
preferable term , but inmates is an acceptable alternative
prison officer
not warder , a term that the Prison Officers ’ Association regards as “ degrading , insulting and historically inaccurate ” ( the Home Office changed it from warder in 1922 )
Prison Service
but immigration service lc ( it is properly called the Immigration and Nationality Directorate )
pristine
If you restore something to pristine splendour , you have returned it to its original state , not just given it a bit of a clean
private finance initiative
PFI on second mention
private member ’s bill
plural : private members ’ bills
privy council
but privy counsellor
prizefighter series
televised boxing tournament created by Barry Hearn
prize money
prizes
Man Booker prize , Nobel prize , Whitbread prize , etc
prize winner
Two words for prize winners in general as well as when referring to a specific prize :
The six prize winners included a Nobel peace prize winner , a Man Booker prize winner and a Whitbread prize winner
prize - winning
a prize - winning author , the Nobel peace prize - winning campaigner , etc
proactive
jargon word , best avoided
probe
a dental implement , not an inquiry or investigation
pro-choice
not pro-abortion
procrastinate
to delay or defer ; often confused with prevaricate
Procter & Gamble
procurator fiscal
Scottish public prosecutor ; the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service ( COPFS ) , in Scotland , more wide - ranging than the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales , is responsible for the prosecution of crime , investigation of sudden or suspicious deaths , and investigation of complaints against the police
prodigal
means wasteful or extravagant , not a returned wanderer ; the confusion arises from the biblical parable of the prodigal son , but he was prodigal because he wasted his inheritance , not because he wandered off .
Thus a prodigal striker is one who misses lots of chances to score goals , not one who has played for lots of clubs ( who will also invariably be described as “ much - travelled ” )
profession
Strictly , to enter a profession you need a specific qualification , such as that acquired by a doctor , lawyer , social worker or teacher .
As anyone with a mobile , a laptop and a bit of cheek can be a journalist , or at least claim to be one , journalism is not a profession but a trade , craft or racket .
Much the same applies to politics
profile
a noun , not a verb
program
in Australia and the US , and for computer programs everywhere ; otherwise programme in the UK : “ I saw a fascinating TV programme about computer programs ”
prohibition
lc for US prohibition ( 1920 - 33 ) , a result of the 18th Amendment
pro-life
should not be used to mean anti-abortion
prolific
means abundant or fruitful , so a “ prolific striker ” scores lots of goals ; it is a positive attribute , and phrases such as “ one of Britain ’s most prolific paedophiles ” ( which we used ) strikes completely the wrong tone
Proms
concerts
proms
seafronts
prone
face down ; supine face up
pronouns
Some people use they / them / their rather than he / she etc .
This should be respected at the same time as avoiding creating confusion for the reader .
One option is to mention that the person uses the singular they .
For example : ‘ Jones , who uses they , said …’.
Alternatively , although they and their are sometimes used in the singular in speech , it may be clearer to rewrite or repeat the person ’s name if the use of they / them / their is not explained .
For example , “ They said the show was brilliant ” can simply become “ Jones said the show was brilliant ”
proofreader , proofreading
propeller
prophecy
noun ; prophesy verb
prophet
the prophet Muhammad
pros and cons
prosecco
prostitution
( see sex worker )
protagonist
The person who drives the action , from the ancient Greek meaning “ first actor ” .
Not the same as adversary or rival , so strictly you ca n’t have “ two protagonists ”
protege
male and female , no accents
protest
against , over or about – not , for example , “ protest the election result ” , which has appeared on our front page
Protestant
protester
not protestor
proven
proved is the past tense of prove ; beware the creeping “ proven ” , a term in Scottish law ( “ not proven ” ) and in certain English idioms , eg “ proven record ”
province
should not be used to describe Northern Ireland .
Ulster is one of the four provinces of Ireland , comprising nine counties – six in Northern Ireland , and three in the Republic of Ireland ( Cavan , Donegal and Monaghan )
proviso
plural provisos
Ps and Qs

put
athletics ; putt golf
Pwllheli
Pyeongchang
venue for the 2018 Winter Olympics .
Not PyeongChang , the spelling adopted by the South Korean government as a rebranding exercise just for the Games
pygmy
plural pygmies , lc except for members of Equatorial African ethnic group
pyjamas
not pajamas
pyrrhic
A pyrrhic victory is not a hollow one , as often assumed , but one achieved at great cost .
King Pyrrhus of Epirus defeated the Romans twice , in 280BC and 279BC , but suffered such heavy losses that he said one more such victory would undo him
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Other experts contend , though , that such fears are overblown .
Germany has long sent its scientists and engineers to work or study abroad , they say , with the number of returnees historically balancing out those who leave .
The latest statistics merely reflect an acceleration of that trend , as German academia and industry adjust to an increasingly global economy .
“ Whenever the subject of migration comes up , Germans get very nervous , ” said Claudia Diehl , a sociologist at the University of Göttingen who has studied migration patterns .
“ First they were nervous about people coming ; now they are worried about people leaving . ”
The numbers , she said , may also overstate the incidence of brain drain , because they do not distinguish between native and naturalized Germans .
For example , Turkish guest workers who adopt German citizenship and later go home are classified as German emigrants .
Germany is not the only European country losing people .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the conservative presidential candidate in France , recently held a rally in London , home to 300,000 French citizens living in Britain , urging them to return and “ make France a great nation . ”
The number of French citizens living in Britain jumped 8.4 percent in 2005 , according to government statistics .
But the total number of French people living outside the country grew only 1.2 percent , or 15,300 people , roughly equivalent to Germany ’s net loss of about 16,700 citizens .
Caveats aside , there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that Germany has become less attractive for people in fields like medicine , academic research and engineering .
Those who leave cite chronic unemployment , a rigid labor market , stifling bureaucracy , high taxes and the plodding economy — which , though better recently , still lags behind that of the United States .
As Dr. Friedrich Boettner , a German orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York , puts it : “ I make more money .
I ’ve got more opportunity .
New York was the chance of my lifetime . ”
Why Bush Will Nuke Iran
COMMENTARY : Why Bush Will Nuke Iran by PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS
Bush will attack Iran with tactical nuclear weapons because neocons believe it is the only way to rescue their goal of US ( and Israeli ) hegemony in the Middle East .
T he neoconservative Bush administration will attack Iran with tactical nuclear weapons , because it is the only way the neocons believe they can rescue their goal of US ( and Israeli ) hegemony in the Middle East .
The US has lost the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan .
Generals in both war theaters are stating their need for more troops .
But there are no troops to send .
Bush has tried to pawn Afghanistan off on NATO , but Europe does not see any point in sacrificing its blood and money for the sake of American hegemony .
The NATO troops in Afghanistan are experiencing substantial casualties from a revived Taliban , and European governments are not enthralled over providing cannon fodder for US hegemony .
The “ coalition of the willing ” has evaporated .
Indeed , it never existed .
Bush ’s “ coalition ” was assembled with bribes , threats , and intimidation .
Pervez Musharraf , the American puppet ruler of Pakistan , let the cat out of the bag when he told CBS “ 60 Minutes ” on September 24 , 2006 , that Pakistan had no choice about joining the “ coalition . ”
Brute coercion was applied .
Musharraf said Assistant Secretary of State Richard Armitage told the Pakistani intelligence director that “ you are with us ” or “ be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . ”
Armitage is trying to deny his threat , but Dawn Wire Service , reporting from Islamabad on September 16 , 2001 , on the pressure Bush was putting on Musharraf to facilitate the US attack on Afghanistan , states : “ ’ Pakistan has the option to live in the 21st century or the Stone Age ’ is roughly how US officials are putting their case . ”
That Musharraf would volunteer this information on American television is a good indication that Bush has lost the war .
Musharraf can no longer withstand the anger he has created against himself by helping the US slaughter his fellow Muslims in Bush ’s attempt to exercise US hegemony over the Muslim world .
Bush cannot protect Musharraf from the wrath of Pakistanis , and so Musharraf has explained himself as having cooperated with Bush in order to prevent the US destruction of Pakistan : “ One has to think and take actions in the interest of the nation , and that ’s what I did . ”
Nevertheless , he said , he refused Bush ’s “ ludicrous ” demand that he arrest Pakistanis who publicly demonstrated against the US : “ If somebody ’s expressing views , we cannot curb the expression of views . ”
Bush ’s defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel ’s defeat by Hezbollah in Lebanon have shown that the military firepower of the US and Israeli armies cannot defeat guerillas and insurgencies .
Bush ’s defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel ’s defeat by Hezbollah in Lebanon have shown that the military firepower of the US and Israeli armies , though effective against massed Arab armies , cannot defeat guerillas and insurgencies .
The US has battled in Iraq longer than it fought against Nazi Germany , and the situation in Iraq is out of control .
The Taliban have regained half of Afghanistan .
The King of Saudi Arabia has told Bush that the ground is shaking under his feet as unrest over the American / Israeli violence against Muslims builds to dangerous levels .
Our Egyptian puppet sits atop 100 million Muslims who do not think that Egypt should be a lackey of US hegemony .
The King of Jordan understands that Israeli policy is to drive every Palestinian into Jordan .
Bush is incapable of recognizing his mistake .
He can only escalate .
Bush is incapable of recognizing his mistake .
He can only escalate .
Plans have long been made to attack Iran .
The problem is that Iran can respond in effective ways to a conventional attack .
Moreover , an American attack on another Muslim country could result in turmoil and rebellion throughout the Middle East .
This is why the neocons have changed US war doctrine to permit a nuclear strike on Iran .
Neocons believe that a nuclear attack on Iran would have intimidating force throughout the Middle East and beyond .
Neocons believe that a nuclear attack on Iran would have intimidating force throughout the Middle East and beyond .
Iran would not dare retaliate , neocons believe , against US ships , US troops in Iraq , or use their missiles against oil facilities in the Middle East .
Neocons have also concluded that a US nuclear strike on Iran would show the entire Muslim world that it is useless to resist America ’s will .
Neocons say that even the most fanatical terrorists would realize the hopelessness of resisting US hegemony .
The vast multitude of Muslims would realize that they have no recourse but to accept their fate .
Revised US war doctrine concludes that tactical or low - yield nuclear weapons cause relatively little “ collateral damage ” or civilian deaths , while achieving a powerful intimidating effect on the enemy .
The “ fear factor ” disheartens the enemy and shortens the conflict .
University of California Professor Jorge Hirsch , an authority on nuclear doctrine , believes that an American nuclear attack on Iran will destroy the Non-Proliferation Treaty and send countries in pellmell pursuit of nuclear weapons .
We will see powerful nuclear alliances , such as Russia / China , form against us .
Japan could be so traumatized by an American nuclear attack on Iran that it would mean the end of Japan ’s sycophantic relationship to the US .
There can be little doubt that the aggressive US use of nukes in pursuit of hegemony would make America a pariah country , despised and distrusted by every other country .
Neocons believe that diplomacy is feeble and useless , but that the unapologetic use of force brings forth cooperation in order to avoid destruction .
Neoconservatives say that America is the new Rome , only more powerful than Rome .
Neoconservatives genuinely believe that no one can withstand the might of the United States and that America can rule by force alone .
It is astounding that such dangerous fanatics have control of the US government and have no organized opposition in American politics .
Hirsch believes that the US military ’s opposition to the use of nuclear weapons against Iran has been overcome by the civilian neocon authorities in the Bush administration .
Desperate to retrieve their drive toward hegemony from defeat in Iraq , the neocons are betting on the immense attraction to the American public of force plus success .
It is possible that Bush will be blocked by Europe , Russia and China , but there is no visible American opposition to Bush legitimizing the use of nuclear weapons in behest of US hegemony .
It is astounding that such dangerous fanatics have control of the US government and have no organized opposition in American politics .

IBM Mouse Balls ...
This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to all IBM Branch Offices .
The person who wrote it was very serious .
The rest of us find it rather funny .
Mouse balls are now available as FRU .
Therefore , if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically , it may need a ball replacement .
Because of the delicate nature of this procedure , replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel .
Before proceeding , determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse .
Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls .
Ball removal procedures differ depending upon manufacturer of the mouse .
Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop -off method .
Domestic balls are replaced using the twist - off method .
Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive .
However , excessive handling can result in sudden discharge .
Upon completion of ball replacement , the mouse may be used immediately .
It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction , and that any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items .
To re-order , specify one of the following :
P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls
P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse Balls
I got a new iPod Nano a couple of days ago ( short review : I love it ) .
Unfortunately it slips into a pocket a little too easily and plays with all the loose change I have in there .
Also , a little delicate device in a hip pocket is going to break sooner or later , especially when riding a bike .
I decided I needed a lanyard , but the oficial Apple version has had some bad reviews .
It holds the Nano by its dock connector and there are a few horror stories about the iPod dropping out ( usually involving traffic or toilets ) .
3rd party lanyard cases are all well and good , but in the spirit of this past weekend 's Maker Faire , it only seemed right to make my own .
So , here it is .
The Gadget Lab guide to making an inner-tube Nano case .
First of all , find an inner tube .
Old is fine , but a new one will be cleaner and the powder dusted on the inside helps the iPod slide in and out easily .
See how close they are in size ?
The Nano fits it perfectly .
Next , make a plan .
I wanted to do as little as possible to the rubber , so I decided that a flap at the top would fold over and keep the iPod secure while still allowing access to the hold switch .
The other end can remain open , but also has a flap to run the cord through .
Excuse the poor drawing .
In order to get all the holes in the right places , I grabbed a PDF template from the web .
The one I got was from Sneakmove .
It turned out to be sized for the first gen Nano , which has a different spacing between clickwheel and screen so I made adjustments .
After marking up the rubber tube , I clipped it with a bulldog clip so I could cut in from the side .
I used ordinary kitchen scissors .
The rubber is very easy to cut , even in two layers like this .
Here it is with the holes cut .
And here I checked the fit .
Snug !
Next up , flaps .
I cut these carefully , not so much for accuracy , as that comes later when gluing , but to make sure all the edges were nice and rounded .
Using rubber cement from a puncture repair kit ( and fist roughening the area with sandpaper for a good key ) , I folded and glued the flaps .
This is the top one .
And this is the bottom one .
Note that the cement is on both surfaces .
Also , after application , leave for a few minutes before pressing together otherwise it wo n't stick .
This flap folds iside the case .
It 's sole purpose is to hold the neck cord .
You can thread the cord through afterwards but it 's easier to go ahead and put it in now , and then fold the flap shut over it .
A note on the cord .
Something adjustable is nice , and that might make it into v2.0 , but for this one I just cut up some junk headphones I got given at the 3GSM show , and used the cable .
Behold !
The finished product .
The scissor work is a little messy , but it looks good and works great .
I might add in a screen protector too , which should help stop the case gaping around the screen - hole .
I still have enough rubber left to make another ten of these .
I sense a garage sale coming on .

Climate change : a skeptic ’s guide
May 24 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
New Scientist has done a fabulous job of putting together a climate change guide for the skeptical or perplexed amongst us .
I ’ve looked before at some of the alternative arguments to global warming and it is important that we critically scrutinise the for and against positions , especially as the global warming debate becomes increasingly politicised .
New Scientist has gathered 26 climate myths and misconceptions and also has a guide to assessing the evidence , which is extremely helpful considering that there are many amateurs ( and a considerable number of whackos ) out there purporting to have scientific credentials , yet offer merely opinion , rather than peer - reviewed scientific papers .
To the layperson , pseudo - scientific blogs and articles look “ scientific ” but in reality are merely cuckoo science .
Of course , peer review spots some , but not all , flaws in argument .
A paper in Science in the early 1990s claimed there was a striking correlation between variations in the solar cycle length and temperature between 1880 and 1980 , which suggested that greenhouse gases may not be the major culprit .
But the correlation has n’t held up since 1980 and , despite being discredited , the graph is still trotted out as evidence against human - induced global warming .
See The Great Global Warming Swindle entry in Wikipedia for more background .
Anyway , back to the myths : I wo n’t list all 26 as you can check them out yourself , but let ’s look at a summary of some of the key ones :
It ’s been warmer in the past , so what ’s the big deal ?
even though I firmly believe that the world is heating up , I ’ve wondered about the occurence of warm spells of weather in the past , particularly in the 1930s ( no , I was n’t alive then ! ) – the so - called Modern Warming Period .
The warmest period in Earth ’s history was the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum , ( PETM ) around 55 millions years ago and the Arctic Ocean reached a very subtropical temperature of 23 °C / 73 °F .
Mass extinctions resulted .
The PETM was caused by a massive build - up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere resulting from either a catastrophic volcanic eruption or the release of huge amounts of CO 2 from the thawing of methane clathrates in deep ocean sediments .
Either way , the Earth then cooled down but as recently as 125,000 years ago , temperatures may have been about 1 °C to 2 °C degrees warmer and sea levels were 5 to 8 metres higher than today .
What is clear from the study of past climate is that many factors can influence it : solar activity , oscillations in Earth ’s orbit , greenhouse gases , ice cover , vegetation on land ( or the lack of it ) , the configuration of the continents , dust thrown up by volcanoes or wind , the weathering of rocks and so on .
As New Scientist asks : what is the cause of the current warming period ?
It should not be dismissed as a natural variation just because we ’ve had warmer periods in the past .
And when sea levels were higher , coastal cities were wiped out .
In fact , a number of scientists consider that reports on the current climate crisis are watered - down by Governments who do not wish us to know the frightening reality .
Global warming is caused by the sun , not humans .
I talked about this in an earlier post .
Have solar changes contributed to recent global warming ?
According to solar physicists , the sun emitted a third less energy about 4 billion years ago and has been steadily brightening ever since .
Yet for most of this time , Earth has been even warmer than today , a phenomenon sometimes called the faint sun paradox .
The reason : higher levels of greenhouse gases trapping more of the sun ’s heat .
Milankovitch cycles ( ( caused by wobbles in the planet ’s orbit ) have caused fluctuations in solar heating , which in turn have affected cooling and warming during the ice ages and interglacial periods .
But scientists have found that there is no correlation between solar activity and the strong warming during the past 40 years .
For the period for which we have direct , reliable records ( since 1978 ) , the Earth has warmed dramatically even though there has been no corresponding rise in any kind of solar activity .
The Hockey Stick Graph is Just Plain Wrong .
The Hockey Stick graph shows average Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past 1000 years based on numerous indicators such as tree rings .
It shows temperatures holding fairly steady until the latter part of the 20th century and then suddenly shooting up .
You can see the graph here .
Since 2001 , the graph has been the subject of heated debate with accusations of using outdated statistics thrown at it .
The US National Academy of Science waded into the fray in 2006 and confirmed that an array of evidence supports the Hockey Stick graph ’s temperature reconstructions .
Mars and Pluto are heating up too .
This is one of my personal favourites !
This myth tries to prop up the ‘ sun is to blame ’ argument .
Apparently , temperatures on Mars and Pluto ( recently demoted or ‘ plutoed ’ ) have been increasing and this is due to changes in solar activity .
Not quite sure why the sun would pick on Mars and poor old Pluto – why not include the rest of the planets in a solar fry - up ?
And since a year on Pluto lasts 248 Earth years , I ’m not sure how conclusions about warmer temperatures have been reached .
Cosmic Rays are the culprit .
Another personal favourite , smacks of 1950s sci- fi films with gamma rays and so on .
But the argument goes like this : increased sunspot activity is known to strengthen the Sun ’s magnetic field , which deflects more of the galactic cosmic rays entering the solar system and thus reducing the number hitting Earth .
This would reduce cloud formation in the atmosphere , trapping heat and leading us to all say “ it ’s getting hot in here ” .
You can read more about cosmic rays in an earlier post .
Well , maybe it ’s true , but we ca n’t do anything about it .
This myth is for the passive individuals out there or those who do n’t want to acknowledge that An Inconvenient Truth will ultimately disrupt their hedonistic lifestyles .
Climate change is happening , we ca n’t stop it .
But we can all go on low carbon diets .
The developing world , and particularly the big players India and China , can learn from the stuff - ups of the developed world and work towards reducing our fondness for fossil fuels .
Developing countries need to be given technology and incentives to not use chemicals , fossil fuels etc .
If you happen to be talking to a climate change skeptic , as I was the other day , you ’ll also find Grist ’s How to Talk to a Climate Skeptic indispensable .

Strapped for money , archivists around the country are looking to private partners for help .
Google has donated $ 3 million to help start an effort led by the Library of Congress that will digitize and share materials around the globe , and has also provided technical resources for digitizing various printed materials at the library .
Google , on its own , is digitizing books at the Library of Congress , which has its hands full with other items .
And a number of other companies and foundations , including Reuters , I.B.M. and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation , have financed digitization projects around the world .
Image Despite ambitious and continuing digitization efforts at the Library of Congress , only about 10 percent of its vast collection is expected to be digitized anytime soon .
Credit ... Doug Mills / The New York Times
Even with outside help , experts say , entire swaths of political and cultural history are in danger of being forgotten by new generations of amateur researchers and serious scholars .
Consider the Library of Congress archive of one million photo prints from The New York World - Telegram & Sun ; only 5,407 have been digitized .
Of the 1.2 million images from U.S. News and World Report , the library has digitized only 366 .
Its collection of five million images from Look magazine , spanning the period from 1937 to 1971 , creates what Jeremy E. Adamson , director of collections and services at the library , calls " a fascinating portrait of America through photo stories on social and political subjects , personalities , food , fashion and sports . "
Yet only 313 of those images have been digitized .
" It 's a crying shame , " Mr. Adamson said , " as today 's public is acutely visually literate and comfortable with pictures as a means to understand the past and experience for themselves the direct look and feel of history . "
The reason for not digitizing these collections ?
" Not enough money , " Mr. Adamson said .
THE decision to put off digitizing a significant collection is seldom easy , archivists at the Library of Congress say .
Plans to digitize The National Intelligencer , a newspaper published in Washington during much of the 19th century and filled with Colonial script not easily recognized by digitizing equipment , eventually had to be put on hold because of the high expense .
" If researchers conclude that the only valuable records they need are those that are online they will be missing major parts of the story , " said James J. Hastings , director of access programs at the National Archives .
" And in some cases they will miss the story altogether . "
Maritime buffs , for example , hoping to use the Internet to piece together the story of the Silenus , one of the finest ships ever built in North America , will find a spotty narrative .
The papers of its captain , Joseph King , who lived a brief but adventurous life , from 1782 to 1806 , can be found courtesy of the Mellon Foundation , in a digitized archive from the Mystic Seaport 's collection .
Researchers will see how much Captain King paid for " 1 potte lijn oli " in 1803 , when the ship was in the Netherlands .
They got the date wrong by some 3,000 years , but the oldest detailed drawing of Stonehenge , apparently based on first hand observation , has turned up in a 15th century manuscript .
The little sketch is a bird 's eye view of the stones , and shows the great trilithons , the biggest stones in the monument , each made of two pillars capped with a third stone lintel , which stand in a horseshoe in the centre of the circle .
Only three are now standing , but the drawing , found in Douai , northern France , suggests that in the 15th century four of the original five survived .
In the Scala Mundi , the Chronicle of the World , Merlin is given credit for building Stonehenge between 480 and 486 , when the Latin text says he " not by force , but by art , brought and erected the giant 's ring from Ireland " .
Modern science suggests that the stones went up from 2,500 BC , with the bluestone outer circle somehow transported from west Wales , and the double decker bus - size sarsen stones dragged 30 miles across Salisbury plain .
The drawing , recently identified by the art historian Christian Heck , has never been exhibited , but according to the Art Newspaper it will be seen next year in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in London , marking the 300th anniversary of the Society of Antiquaries .
There are two earlier images of Stonehenge , one in the British Library and one in the Parker Library in Cambridge , but the Douai drawing is unique in attempting to show how the monument was built .
It correctly shows tenon joints piercing the lintel , a timber construction technique , although in fact the real Stonehenge tenons only go partly into the top stone .
Stonehenge is rare among prehistoric landscapes , because its sheer bulk meant it was never lost .
An Anglo Saxon poet wondered about the origin of the stones and inspired some of the earliest photographs .

But the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas makes one Texas - sized claim that few would expect in the conservative Bible Belt state -- it says it is the world ’s biggest gay church .
“ I think this shows that God has a tremendously great sense of humor , ” said senior pastor and rector Jo Hudson .
On a more serious note , she says the church , affiliated with the United Church of Christ , is a spiritual refuge for gay people of faith in a region associated with more conservative brands of Christianity .
“ Because we are in the Bible Belt we have a lot of people of tremendous faith , ” she said in an interview .
“ But a lot of them have been alienated and rejected by their faith community , which is fundamentalist , so they hanker for a place where they can encounter God , ” she said .
Gays and the church are no small matter in America .
Many of the country ’s 60 million evangelicals view homosexuality as a sinful lifestyle choice -- a stance that angers gay activists who say their sexual orientation is not a choice .
The Episcopalian church -- the American wing of the Anglican Communion -- is sharply split on the matter of gay clergy , while the Republican Party has used state ballot initiatives banning gay marriage to get its supporters out to the polls .
Hudson estimates that over 90 percent of the Cathedral ’s 3,500 members are gay , lesbian or transgender .
Founded in 1970 by a dozen gays and lesbians who gathered in a home and decided they wanted a safe and tolerant place to worship , it has grown into a large and affluent institution centered on a cavernous church that can seat up to 900 .
Last year it became part of the United Church of Christ , which claims 1.3 million members in 5,725 U.S. congregations and traditions of diversity and pioneering action on social justice .

On a recent Sunday during Lent -- a period of prayer and penance in the run-up to Easter -- mostly gay couples , men and women , streamed in for morning services .
The big pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles gave the parking lot a Texan flavor and most were on the expensive side -- highlighting the fact that being openly gay remains a mostly white - collar phenomenon in America .
The church offered liturgical worship with an Episcopalian flavor , complete with communion .
It also provides contemporary and Spanish - language services .
But there was no discussion of homosexuality from the pulpit .
One pastor spoke of South African Archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu and the importance of forgiveness .
Hudson ’s sermon focused on humanity ’s propensity to wander .
FOCUS ON THE POOR
Members of the congregation said that while the church was a place of spiritual comfort for gays , its focus was on ministering to the wider community , especially the poor .
“ We do n’t talk much about gay stuff here , ” said Coy James , who has been attending the church for almost 30 years .
“ We give over $ 1 million each year in aid and services to the poorest of the poor and we have adopted elementary schools in low - income areas and helped them with tutoring and other things , ” he said after the service .
Others are drawn by its liberal theology in a range of areas that go beyond sexual orientation .
“ I ’m from a Catholic background and have an issue with its stance on women in the priesthood , ” said Chris Kuntz , who said he joined the Cathedral in 1994 .
All of this places the church firmly on the left of America ’s political and cultural divide -- another anomaly in the red- blooded , Republican - dominated state of Texas .
The church ’s store prominently displays books such as “ The Real AntiChrist : How America Sold its Soul , ” with a cover photo of President George W. Bush with his hands clasped in prayer .
But its liberal views on sexual orientation are also clearly a big part of its attraction for many members who might not feel comfortable or welcome in other churches .
“ Homosexuality & Christianity : no matter who you are , God loves you , ” declares the church ’s Web site , which features a discussion on the matter , stressing among other things Jesus ’ silence on the subject .
Southern Baptists and other socially conservative denominations point to mostly Old Testament passages that they say shows God ’s dim view of homosexuality .
“ The Bible could not be more clear -- all forms of homosexual behavior are expressly condemned as sin , ” said R. Albert Mohler Jr. , the president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , in a recent statement on the issue .
Hudson says such attitudes both underscore the importance of her church for gay Texans and explain its size .
“ Sometimes where there is great oppression , great justice emerges , ” she said .
The debate over the costs associated with using closed - source and open - source software has been raging for years now , and a new study from the European Union is certain to add fuel to the fire .
Titled the " Economic impact of open source software on innovation and the competitiveness of the Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) sector in the EU , " the study looks at the role of OSS in the economy , its direct economic impact , indirect economic impact , and concludes with trends , scenarios , and policy strategies .
The headline - grabbing data is found about a third of the way through the 287 - page report .
In a section titled " User benefits : interoperability , productivity , and cost savings , " the study 's authors ( researchers from five European universities ) make the claim that OSS is a less - expensive alternative to proprietary software .
Six public and private organizations that have transitioned to OSS were studied , and the authors found that while OSS migration costs were high , initial purchasing costs were higher for proprietary solutions .
Maintenance costs are comparable with the OSS solution being more expensive in some cases but the overall annual total cost of ownership was lower for OSS in five of the six cases studied .
Data source : EU .
Note : TO did not report initial OSS costs
SGV : Consorzio dei Cumini della Provincia di Bolzano ; Extremadura : Spanish region ;
PP : Province of Pisa ; SK : Public Administration of the city of Skopje , Macedonia ;
TO : Törökbálint Nagyközség Polgármesteri Hivatala ; BH : Province of Bolzano - Bozen
" Our findings show that , in almost all the cases , a transition toward open source reports savings on the long - term costs of ownership of the software products , " says the study 's authors .
The organizations studied made the move from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org as part of their transition to OSS , and the study looks at the overall productivity of workers before and after .
Overall , the report found " no particular delays or lost [ sic ] of time in the daily work due to the use of OpenOffice.org . "
Researchers also surveyed workers , with 20 percent reporting that they could be just as productive using the open - source office suite , 70 percent saying that they experienced some problems but could still be just as productive , with the remaining 10 percent reporting that they were less productive with OpenOffice.org .
Researchers also looked at overall OSS penetration in Europe .
The continent 's investment in OSS software amounts to € 22 billion ( compared with € 36 billion in the US ) , which represents 20.5 percent of total software investment .
The report concludes with some recommendations for EU policymakers .
First , and foremost , policies that favor proprietary software over OSS should be changed .
Researchers suggest supporting OSS in research , avoiding vendor lock - in in educational settings , providing equitable tax treatment for OSS creators , supporting OSS in " precompetitive research and standardization , " and encouraging partnerships between the enterprise and the OSS community .
They are necessary for anyone seeking public assistance , like food stamps , or registering for the draft .
Congress decreed that the numbers be put on records including professional licenses , marriages licenses and divorce decrees to better track scofflaws of child support orders .

The Social Security number took on a second role .
It allowed collectors of data to link pieces of information together , like a driver ’s license record , credit report data and the information on the warranty card for a toaster .
That is a useful tool for marketers and just as useful for criminals .
It was only in 2004 that Congress prohibited states from using the Social Security number on drivers ’ licenses .
Yet the databases with those numbers still exist .
Until 2001 , states could sell lists with those numbers , which means that for virtually anyone 22 years or older , the name , address , phone number and Social Security number are in private databases .
The nine - digit string took on a third role — as a password that was supposed to protect all that private information from snoops and criminals .
But its ubiquity defeats that purpose , Mr. Hoofnagle said .
“ It will pass when the business community no longer needs a Social Security number , ” he said .
The Social Security Administration ’s Office of Inspector General said that 16 percent of the 99,000 fraud cases it investigated in the 12 - month period that ended Sept. 30 involved the misuse of Social Security numbers .
One involved an identify theft ring in Central Florida .
Twelve people were convicted , sentenced to prison and ordered to repay more than $ 2 million .
About 16,000 incidents are not a lot considering that 240 million numbers are currently in use , and certainly theft and fraud involving credit card numbers are much more pervasive .
But credit card numbers are rarely exposed on documents in public view .
And if a credit card is stolen or misused , obtaining a new one is a fairly simple process .
A new Social Security number is rarely granted .
( Indeed , one is limited to 3 replacements of the green paper Social Security card in a year and 10 over a lifetime . )
A fossil of a leaf - imitating insect from 47 million years ago bears a striking resemblance to the mimickers of today .
The discovery represents the first fossil of a leaf insect ( Eophyllium messelensis ) , and also shows that leaf imitation is an ancient and successful evolutionary strategy that has been conserved over a relatively long period of time .
Scientists led by Sonja Wedmann of the Institute of Paleontology in Bonn , Germany , unearthed the remains at a well - known fossil site called Messel* , in Hessen , Germany .
The 2.4 - inch - long insect had physical characteristics similar to the oblong leaves of trees living there at the time , including Myrtle trees , legumes , such as alfalfa , and Laurel trees .

The first fossil leaf insect : 47 million years of specialized cryptic morphology and behavior

Abstract
Stick and leaf insects ( insect order Phasmatodea ) are represented primarily by twig - imitating slender forms .
Only a small percentage ( approx 1 % ) of extant phasmids belong to the leaf insects ( Phylliinae ) , which exhibit an extreme form of morphological and behavioral leaf mimicry .
Fossils of phasmid insects are extremely rare worldwide .
Here we report the first fossil leaf insect , Eophyllium messelensis gen .
et sp. nov. , from 47 - million - year - old deposits at Messel in Germany .
The new specimen , a male , is exquisitely preserved and displays the same foliaceous appearance as extant male leaf insects .
Clearly , an advanced form of extant angiosperm leaf mimicry had already evolved early in the Eocene .
We infer that this trait was combined with a special behavior , catalepsy or " adaptive stillness , " enabling Eophyllium to deceive visually oriented predators .
Potential predators reported from the Eocene are birds , early primates , and bats .
The combination of primitive and derived characters revealed by Eophyllium allows the determination of its exact phylogenetic position and illuminates the evolution of leaf mimicry for this insect group .
It provides direct evidence that Phylliinae originated at least 47 Mya .
Eophyllium enlarges the known geographical range of Phylliinae , currently restricted to southeast Asia , which is apparently a relict distribution .
This fossil leaf insect bears considerable resemblance to extant individuals in size and cryptic morphology , indicating minimal change in 47 million years .
This absence of evolutionary change is an outstanding example of morphological and , probably , behavioral stasis .

* Info on the Messel Pit Fossil Site :
" ... The Messel fossil finds are extraordinary in more ways than one : entire skeletons are preserved perfectly here - birds with their feathers , mammals with skin and hair .
They provide evidence of an important period in the evolutionary history of mammals , which were able to develop at a rapid rate after the extinction of the dinosaurs .
The " Messel Propalaeotherium " represents an early European side branch of the horse family tree : they were much smaller than horses today , lived in the rainforest undergrowth and fed on foliage and fruit , as was established from their teeth and stomach contents .
The discovery of an anteater was a huge surprise for palaeontologists , since it originally came from South America .
The most common mammal finds are the bats , with the seven species that existed in those times occupying various ecological niches .
The Messel Lake also preserved an astonishingly large number of birds , various reptiles such as turtles , crocodiles and snakes , as well as fish , frogs and a diverse insect fauna .
There are 60 families of flora , including various plants whose relations thrive today in South - east Asia , Central and South America .
Botanical details have been well - preserved too : flowers in which the pollen grains have survived , as well as fruit clusters and individual fruits ... "

** Info on The Eocene Epoch :
" The Eocene epoch is part of the Tertiary Period in the Cenozoic Era , and lasted from about 54.8 to 33.7 million years ago ( mya ) .
The oldest known fossils of most of the modern orders of mammals appear in a brief period during the Early Eocene and all were small , under 10 kg .
Both groups of modern ungulates ( Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla ) became prevalent mammals at this time , due to a major radiation between Europe and North America . "

UNTIL LAST week , Micheal Ray Richardson ( that ’s how he spells it ) was slightly famous for having once told a sportswriter that his team , the New York Knicks , was “ a sinking ship . ”
When the writer asked how far the ship might sink , Richardson replied , “ The sky ’s the limit . ”
That remark , however , was n’t what got Richardson into trouble ; repeated drug use did .
He wound up banned from the NBA , a vagabond basketball player in Europe .
Lately he has been making a comeback as coach of the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Assn .
But the comeback hit the skids on Wednesday .
Once again , sportswriters were involved .
Asked about his contract negotiations , Richardson said he did n’t expect problems because “ I ’ve got big - time lawyers .
Big - time Jew lawyers . ”
Alarmed , the reporters warned Richardson that his words could be considered insulting because they fit the stereotype of Jews as crafty and shrewd .
Richardson did n’t even blink .
“ Are you kidding me ? ” he demanded .
“ They ’ve got the best security system in the world .
Have you ever been to an airport in Tel Aviv ?
They ’re real crafty .
Listen , they are hated all over the world , so they ’ve got to be crafty .
They got a lot of power in this world , you know what I mean ?
Which I think is great .
I do n’t think there ’s nothing wrong with it .
If you look in most professional sports , they ’re run by Jewish people .
If you look at a lot of most successful corporations and stuff , more businesses , they ’re run by Jewish [ sic ] .
It ’s not a knock , but they are some crafty people . ”
For these observations , Richardson was suspended by the Patroons , forbidden by team owner Ben Fernandez to even attend practice .
Predictably , Abe Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , praised this punishment and demanded an apology : “ Micheal Ray needs to understand that when he suggests that all Jews are crafty , that Jews have a lot of money and power , he is conjuring up classic anti-Semitic stereotypes .
We hope that Micheal Ray will realize the pain his words have caused to many people and make clear that he understands why his remarks about Jews were so inappropriate and offensive . ”
Excuse me , but Richardson did n’t say anything offensive ( and while we ’re on the subject of offensive , what ’s with the “ Micheal Ray ” ?
Are he and Foxman first - name buddies ? ) .
In fact , Jews , as a people , are smart , in my experience .
And they ’re proud of it ( especially the dumb ones ) .
Wake up a Jew in the middle of the night and he can rattle off the Jewish Nobel Prize winners in alphabetical order .
Believe me , I ’ve been a Jew for 59 years , and I know what I ’m talking about .
What other hurtful things did Richardson supposedly say ?
That Israel has the best airport security in the world ?
This is both true and something Israel itself brags about .
That Jews are hated and need to protect themselves ?
That ’s the founding premise of the Anti-Defamation League itself .
Sure , Richardson exaggerates when he says that Jews own most sports teams .
As far as I can tell , Jews ( about 1 % of the population ) only own about half the teams in the NBA ( and a pretty fair proportion in baseball and football too ) .
So what ?
As to the observation that Jews run a lot of successful businesses , no kidding .
Jews are very likely the most economically successful ethnic group in the U.S.
What ’s the matter with that ?
Richardson , who was a popular player in Israel during his NBA exile years , is guilty of nothing more than free speech .
Even if his observations were wrong — which they are not — there ’s nothing at all insulting about them .
What is insulting is the notion that you ca n’t speak honestly about Jews without getting into trouble .
At the moment , Jews have real enemies in the world : Al Qaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah and the mullahs of Iran , to name a few .
You want to fight anti-Semites , fight them .

The negative attitude of President Bush and the US State Department in the wake of the Mumbai blasts of July 11 is nothing new .
Protection of Pakistan from the consequences of its wrong - doing against India has been a consistent element in US policy - making towards India and Pakistan ever since our independence in 1947 -- whichever party was in power in Washington , DC .
To illustrate this , I am giving below instances , which were within my personal knowledge as an officer of the Intelligence Bureau from July 1967 to September 1968 , and of the Research and Analysis Wing ( R&AW ) from September 1968 to August 31 , 1994 :
The Sino - Indian war of 1962 brought out the serious inadequacies in the IB 's capability for the collection of technical intelligence about China .
After obtaining then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's approval , the IB sought the assistance of US intelligence for strengthening its TECHINT capability .
US intelligence , with the approval of John F Kennedy , then the US president , agreed to supply the required equipment and train IB officers who would be using this equipment .
However , it imposed a condition that this equipment would be used only for the collection of TECHINT from China and not from Pakistan .
When R&AW was formed in September 1968 , with the late Rameshwar Nath Kao as its head , the division handling this equipment was transferred to R&AW .
In the 1970s , Kao visited Washington , DC at the invitation of the then director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss Indo - US intelligence cooperation .
Some years later , Kao told me that during his discussions in Washington DC , the CIA chief told him as follows : ' Ramji , we all cheat in this profession .
I know R&AW will cheat and use the equipment given by us for the collection of TECHINT about Pakistan .
Make sure our State Department does not come to know of it .
If it does , the State Department will demand that we cancel our cooperation with you and withdraw from you the equipment given by us .
I will have to do this .'
Between 1981 and 1984 , Khalistani terrorists hijacked a number of Indian Airlines aircraft to Lahore .
When one of these aircraft landed in Lahore , Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence found the hijackers had no weapons .
They had intimidated the pilot into flying to Lahore by claiming that they had a weapon which they would use if he did not obey their instructions .
The ISI gave the hijackers a German - made revolver .
They used that revolver to intimidate the pilot to take the plane to Dubai .
The Dubai authorities terminated the hijacking , seized the revolver from the hijackers and handed it over to the Indian authorities .
R&AW sought the assistance of the then West German intelligence to find out who this revolver was sold to by the German company that had manufactured it .
After making enquiries , the West German intelligence replied that the revolver seized by the Dubai authorities from the Khalistani hijackers was part of a consignment sold by the West German company to the Pakistan army .
The State Department was not prepared to accept this as adequate proof of Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism against India .
After the Khalistanis took to terrorism in 1981 with the ISI 's assistance , the IB and R&AW collected a lot of intelligence regarding ISI training camps in Pakistani Punjab for the terrorists , the arms and ammunition supplied by the ISI to the terrorists etc .
Whenever we produced this intelligence before the US authorities and requested them to act against Pakistan , they would reject it on the ground that the intelligence was gathered during interrogation of suspects , who must have been tortured by the Indian police .
When we produced technical intercepts , they would reject them on the ground that it was difficult to prove their authenticity .
After the blowing up of Air India 's Kanishka off the Irish coast on June 23 , 1985 , Western intelligence agencies got worried over the activities of the Khalistani terrorists .
Many of them started monitoring the activities of the terrorists .
They collected valuable technical intelligence regarding the ISI 's assistance to the terrorists .
One Western agency even collected intelligence that the ISI had given shelter in Pakistani territory to Talwinder Singh Parmar , the leader of the Babbar Khalsa in Canada , who was actively involved in blowing - up the Kanishka .
These agencies ( not those of the US ) shared with R&AW all the intelligence collected by them about the links between the ISI and Khalistani terrorists .
I was asked to visit the headquarters of these intelligence agencies , meet my counterparts and request them to share with the CIA the intelligence collected by them regarding the Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism .
I did so , and told my counterparts : " Look , I have not been able to convince the CIA about the Pakistani sponsorship .
Every time I produce any intelligence , the CIA rejects it on some ground or the other .
You have collected your own independent intelligence .
If you share it with the CIA , it would find it difficult to reject it . "
All my interlocutors gave me identical replies :
" We know the CIA has more intelligence regarding the Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism against India than all of us together have .
The CIA was convinced a long time ago about the ISI 's sponsorship of terrorism .
The problem is not with the CIA .
It is with the State Department , which does not want to act against Pakistan . "
In the early 1990s , Lal Singh alias Manjit Singh of the International Sikh Youth Federation clandestinely came to India from Pakistan .
The Gujarat police arrested him .
He was wanted in a number of cases in India , the US and Canada .
I informed my counterparts in the Canadian and US intelligence that they could send their officers to interrogating him .
I assured them that no Indian officer would be present during the interrogation .
The Canadians availed of the offer and sent a police officer to interrogate him .
The US agencies decided not to avail of the offer .
I came to understand later that the State Department advised them not to send anybody to interrogate him .
It was apparently afraid that if Lal Singh gave the US interrogator details of the ISI 's role , it would find it difficult to reject his evidence as possibly obtained through torture .
In 1992 , under the instructions of ( then prime minister P V ) Narasimha Rao , the IB , R&AW and the ministry of home affairs mounted a coordinated campaign to make the international community and US political and public opinion aware of the Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism against India .
The IB and R&AW prepared a detailed dossier giving details of all the evidence collected by them against the ISI .
A team consisting of two officers of the home ministry and one from the IB was sent to Washington to hand over copies of this dossier to the US authorities and request them to declare Pakistan as a State sponsor of terrorism .
After doing so , they also presented the dossier at a press conference at the Washington Press Club .
The State Department summarily rejected the dossier .
In 1992 , terrorists belonging to the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front attacked a group of young Israeli tourists , who had gone to J&K .
They killed one of them and kidnapped another , who was subsequently released .
Following this incident , Jewish circles started criticising the unsympathetic attitude of the US towards India 's complaints against Pakistan .
Just before the presidential elections of November 1992 , President George H W Bush , the father of the present president , reportedly ordered a second look at the dossier against Pakistan submitted by India .
The officials , who did so , reportedly recommended that instead of declaring Pakistan a State sponsor of terrorism , it could be placed in a list of suspected State sponsors of terrorism .
Bush , who lost the election to Bill Clinton , did not act on the recommendation .
He left the decision to his successor .
After assuming office in January 1993 , Clinton placed Pakistan on a list of suspected State sponsors of terrorism .
The weighty nature of the Indian dossier played a role in this decision , but there was a more important reason .
The CIA had developed a strong dislike of Lieutenant General Javed Nasir , the then director general , ISI , for not cooperating with a drive launched by it to persuade the Afghan mujahideen to sell back to the US their unused stock of Stinger missiles , given to them for use against Soviet troops .
The US used the Indian dossier to force then prime minister Nawaz Sharif to remove Javed Nasir and some other ISI officers , whom it looked upon as uncooperative in its efforts to buy back the Stinger missiles .
Nawaz Sharif complied .
Benazir Bhutto , who was then the leader of the Opposition , rang up Peter Galbraith , son of former the US ambassador to India J K Galbraith , and some other university mates of hers , who were close friends of Clinton , to request them to see that Pakistan was not declared a State sponsor of terrorism .
She told them she expected elections to be held in Pakistan later that year and that she was confident of coming back to power .
She assured them that if she came back as prime minister , she would stop the ISI 's use of terrorism against India .
In July 1993 , Warren Christopher , the then secretary of state , announced that the US had decided to remove Pakistan from the list of suspected State sponsors of terrorism for want of adequate evidence .
Benazir Bhutto won the elections in October 1993 , and returned as prime minister .
But she did not ask the ISI to stop the use of terrorism against India .
R&AW must have in its archives the transcripts of Bhutto's telephonic conversations with Peter Galbraith and others .
During the investigations into the serial blasts of March 12 , 1993 in Mumbai , the IB and R&AW collected the following evidence regarding the involvement of the ISI :
Photocopies of the manifests of the Pakistan International Airlines regarding the travel of the perpetrators from Dubai to Karachi for training and their return to Dubai after the training ;
Their traveling with visas on plain sheets of paper issued by the Pakistani consulate in Dubai so that their Indian passports did not carry any entry of their visit to Pakistan ;
Evidence of their being received at Karachi airport and driven directly from the tarmac into the city without having to pass through immigration ; statements of the perpetrators in which they gave the details of the training and arms and ammunition given to them by the ISI ;
Evidence that they fled to Karachi via Dubai or Kathmandu after the blasts and from there were taken to Bangkok and kept there for a month by the ISI .
All this evidence was rejected by the US as falling short of proving Pakistani complicity .
The police recovered from the blast site some hand grenades of Austrian design and a timer .
Austrian experts flew to New Delhi , examined the hand - grenades and certified in writing that these grenades were of Austrian design and had been manufactured in a Pakistani government ordnance factory with technology and machine tools sold by an Austrian company to the Pakistan government .
They said the Government of India could use their report for any purpose it desired .
American counter - terrorism experts , who visited Mumbai at our invitation , saw the timer and said that it looked like timers manufactured in the US .
They wanted to take it to the US for forensic examination .
They promised they would return it after the examination .
I agreed to it .
After some days , they sent me an unsigned report on a plain piece of paper that the timer had been manufactured in the US and was part of a consignment given by the US to Pakistan in the 1980s .
I pointed out this was the smoking gun which they had been asking for and said they should now be able to declare Pakistan a State sponsor of terrorism .
They said this was not sufficient evidence against the government of Pakistan .
They claimed that there were instances of leakage of arms and ammunition from Pakistan government stocks into the hands of arms smugglers and contended that the terrorists could have procured it in the smugglers market .
They also said their report could not be used by us in a court of law .
When I asked them to return the timer , they claimed their forensic laboratory had destroyed the timer by mistake and that they were taking action against the lab for negligence .
After my retirement , I used to narrate to Kao and others how the Americans cheated me by destroying the timer .
Once , Kao asked : " How were you so naive in trusting them and handing over the timer to them ?
One should never trust the US in matters concerning Pakistan .
The US will never act against Pakistan for anything it does to India . "
This is as valid today as it was in the past .
A woman going through security at Los Angeles International Airport put her month - old grandson into a plastic bin intended for carry - on items and slid it into an X - ray machine .
The early Saturday accident — bizarre but not unprecedented — caught airport workers by surprise , even though the security line was not busy at the time , officials said .
A screener watching the machine ’s monitor immediately noticed the outline of a baby and pulled the bin backward on the conveyor belt .
The infant was taken to Centinela Hospital , where doctors determined that he had not received a dangerous dose of radiation .
Officials , who declined to release the 56 - year - old woman ’s name , said she spoke Spanish and apparently did not understand English .
She initially did n’t want the baby transported to a hospital , but security officials called paramedics and insisted that the child be examined by a doctor .
The grandmother and the child were subsequently allowed to board an Alaska Airlines flight to Mexico City .
The rare incident drew attention to whether officials are staffing often - busy security checkpoints enough to prevent such an accident .
And it raised questions about the danger of X - rays used to pick out suspicious metal shapes in passenger bags , given the medical community ’s warnings that even low amounts of radiation can build up over a lifetime .
“ Rather than focus on the radiation dose , which is a small amount , we need to focus on why this happened , so it does n’t happen again , ” said Dr. James Borgstede , a diagnostic radiologist at Penrose - St. Francis Health Systems in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and president of the American College of Radiology .
“ Human beings were n’t meant to go through those things . ”
In the several seconds the baby spent in the machine , the doctor added , he was exposed to as much radiation as he would naturally get from cosmic rays — or high energy from outer space — in a day .
Security experts said the incident underscored a more widespread concern about the screening process at LAX and other airports .
“ The screeners are still reporting that they ’re being pushed , ” said Brian Sullivan , a retired Federal Aviation Administration security agent .
“ If a baby can get through , what the hell else can get through ? ”
Nico Melendez , a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration , which manages LAX screeners , said the agency does n’t have enough workers to constantly stand at tables in front of the screeners to coach passengers on what should or should not be sent through X - ray machines .
But in some cases , airlines contract with private companies to staff the tables and assist travelers .
The TSA will also occasionally put employees at the tables if extra workers are available .
TSA screeners often ask passengers to put their coats , shoes , laptops and other items into the bins , Melendez said .
But they cannot observe everything people place there , because they must monitor screening equipment , he added .
Still , he said that the TSA works hard to educate passengers about what carry - on objects require screening and that travelers must take responsibility for knowing these rules .
“ There ’s an obligation on the traveler to use some common sense , ” said Larry Fetters , the TSA ’s federal security director at LAX .
“ If they do n’t understand , they should ask somebody .
If they ask us , we are generally able to find someone who speaks that language and assist them . ”
On its website , the TSA posts extensive tips for travelers , including a section titled “ Traveling With Children . ”
One item reads : “ Never leave babies in an infant carrier while it goes through the X - ray machine . ”
There are also signs posted in English and Spanish at ticket counters and near security checkpoints warning passengers that they must put metal objects , such as cellphones , pagers and car keys , into bins that go through X - ray machines .
“ This was an innocent mistake by an obviously inexperienced traveler , ” said Paul Haney , deputy executive director of airports and security for the city ’s airport agency .
“ This is only the second time in nearly 20 years that anyone can recall a traveler mistakenly putting an infant through an airport X - ray machine .
Since then LAX has served more than 1 billion travelers without an incident of this type , ” he said .
In 1988 , an infant in a car seat went through an X - ray machine at LAX Terminal 4 .
Also that year , officials at Winnipeg International Airport in Canada accidentally sent a 2 - month - old wrapped in blankets through an X - ray machine .
The TSA said it is continuing to review Saturday ’s incident at LAX .
“ We ’re trying to figure out what changes we can make , short of putting up signs saying , ‘ Do n’t put your baby through the X - ray machine , ’ ” Melendez said .
“ We ’re trying to determine how we can make this not happen again . ”

Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has said that every user of the open source Linux system could owe his company money for using its intellectual property .
The statement will confirm the worst fears of the open source community .
Microsoft recently signed a deal for SUSE Linux , a Novell - owned distribution of the Linux operating system .
The two companies pledged that they would improve the interoperability of their products .
Open source advocates were amazed at the deal , but Ballmer 's comments could vindicate the suspicions of some .
Ballmer said in a question and answer session at a technology conference that Microsoft signed the deal because Linux " uses our intellectual property " and it wanted to " get the appropriate economic return for our shareholders from our innovation " .
Those claims to rights in Linux will set alarm bells ringing in the open source community .
Some had argued that the deal was a sophisticated way of claiming rights over the software .
The deal involved a payment of $ 440 m from Microsoft to Novell for coupons which Microsoft users can redeem against support for SUSE Linux .
A payment that now looks to be more important , though , is a $ 40 m payment from Novell to Microsoft , reported to be a pledge that Microsoft will not sue its users for patent infringement .
Ballmer was explaining the rationale behind that deal .
" Novell pays us some money for the right to tell customers that anybody who uses SUSE Linux is appropriately covered , " he said , according to Computerworld .
" This is important to us , because we believe every Linux customer basically has an undisclosed balance sheet liability . "
The comments will provoke fury amongst open source advocates who believe that Microsoft has no claims at all on the intellectual property contained in Linux .
In explaining the deal before Ballmer 's comments , Roger Levy , vice - president of open platform solutions at Novell , told a Paris press conference that the deal solved a problem which was costing both firms money .
" Customers were afraid they'd get sued if they crossed platforms and this meant that they were hesitating on buying decisions , " said Levy .
" As part of the deal Microsoft will agree not to sue our customers and we agreed not to sue their customers .
This is not an agreement between companies – we can still sue each other for any number of reasons – but ultimately our respective customers needed peace of mind to make decisions . "
Red Hat , which also distributes commercial versions of Linux , refused to sign a similar deal with Microsoft .
Red Hat " does not believe there is a need for or basis for the type of relationship defined in the Microsoft - Novell announcement " , deputy general counsel Mark Webbink told news agency Bloomberg in a statement .

The next time you " catch a yawn " from someone across the room , you 're not copying their sleepiness , you 're participating in an ancient , hardwired ritual that might have evolved to help groups stay alert as a means of detecting danger .
That 's the conclusion of University at Albany researchers Andrew C. Gallup and Gordon G. Gallup , Jr. in a study outlined in the May 2007 issue in Evolutionary Psychology ( Volume 5.1. , 2007 ) .
The psychologists , who studied yawning in college students , concluded that people do not yawn because they need oxygen , since experiments show that raising or lowering oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood fails to produce the reaction .
Rather , yawning acts as a brain - cooling mechanism .
The brain burns up to a third of the calories we consume , and as a consequence generates heat .
According to Gallup and Gallup , our brains , not unlike computers , operate more efficiently when cool , and yawning enhances the brain ’s functioning by increasing blood flow and drawing in cooler air .
To research the theory that yawning evolved to cool the brain , the UAlbany psychologists had students watch videotapes of people yawning and counted the number of contagious yawns .
In one experiment they found that 50 percent of the people who were instructed to breathe normally or through their mouths yawned while watching other people yawn , while those told to breathe through their nose did not yawn at all .
In another experiment they found that subjects who held a cold pack to their forehead acted similarly to those who were instructed to breathe through their nose -- they , too , did not yawn , while those who held a warm pack or a room temperature pack to their forehead yawned normally .
Evidence shows that blood vessels in the nasal cavity and face send cool blood to the brain , and by breathing through the nose or by cooling the forehead , the brain is cooled , eliminating the need to yawn .
Recent evidence has linked multiple sclerosis , a demyelinating disease , to thermoregulatory dysfunction .
Excessive yawning is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis , and some MS patients report brief symptom relief after they yawn .
The UAlbany researchers also suggest , again contrary to popular opinion , that yawning does not promote sleep but helps mitigate the need to sleep .
Since yawning occurs when brain temperature rises , sending cool blood to the brain serves to maintain optimal levels of mental efficiency .
Therefore , the psychologists say , when mental processing slows and someone yawns , the tendency for other people to yawn contagiously might have evolved to promote group vigilance as a means of detecting danger .
So the next time you are telling a story and a listener yawns there is no need to be offended -- yawning , a physiological mechanism designed to maintain attention , turns out to be a compliment .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The White House said Wednesday it had mishandled Republican Party - sponsored e-mail accounts used by nearly two dozen presidential aides , resulting in the loss of an undetermined number of e-mails concerning official White House business .
Congressional investigators looking into the administration 's firing of eight federal prosecutors already had the non-governmental e-mail accounts in their sights because some White House aides used them to help plan the U.S. attorneys ' ouster .
Democrats were questioning whether the use of the GOP - provided e-mail accounts was proof that the firings were political .
Democrats also have been asking if White House officials are purposely conducting sensitive official presidential business via non-governmental accounts to get around a law requiring preservation — and eventual disclosure — of presidential records .
The announcement of the lost e-mails — a rare admission of error from the Bush White House at a delicate time for the administration 's relations with Democratically controlled Capitol Hill — gave new fodder for inquiry on this front .
The Republican National Committee set up the accounts for about 20 Bush aides , such as Karl Rove and his deputies , who get involved in politics , spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
Having the GOP create non-White House addresses and provide separate BlackBerries , laptops and other communications gear was designed to avoid running afoul of Hatch Act rules barring federal employees from engaging in political activities with government resources or on government time , he said .
Under President Clinton , White House aides used separate equipment for political spadework but did not have separate accounts .
" This is entirely appropriate , " Stanzel said of the Bush White House practice .
He said staffers used their RNC accounts instead of White House accounts to discuss the prosecutor issue or conduct other official business for several reasons , including extra caution about complying with the Hatch Act as well as the convenience of using one account instead of several .
Stanzel said he could not speak to whether anyone was intentionally trying to avoid White House archiving because he had not spoken to all those involved .
Stanzel said some e-mails have been lost because the White House lacked clear policies on complying with Presidential Records Act requirements .
Before 2004 , for instance , e-mails to and from the accounts were typically automatically deleted every 30 days along with all other RNC e-mails .
Even though that was changed in 2004 , so that the White House staffers with those accounts were excluded from the RNC 's automatic deletion policy , some of their e-mails were lost anyway when individual aides deleted their own files , Stanzel said .
He could not say what had been lost , and said the White House is working to recover as many as they can .
The White House has now shut off employees ' ability to delete e-mails on the separate accounts , and is briefing staffers on how to better make determinations about when — and when not — to use them , Stanzel said .
The disclosure could complicate a standoff between the White House and congressional Democrats over the fired prosecutors .
The White House had promised to look through its staffers ' e-mails for anything relevant to the prosecutors ' dismissal .
No matter the domain name , it said it would provide documents to the Senate and House Judiciary committees as long as they are not internal communications , but exchanges with people outside the White House .
But the White House also had insisted that this offer of documents be accepted , all - or - nothing , along with its insistence that aides would talk to Congress about the firings , but not under oath .
So far , Democrats have refused .
Democrats have begun highlighting the separate accounts because they say their use appears to go beyond the strictly political .
" We have become increasingly sensitized over the last several days to the White House staff wearing several ' hats ' and using Republican National Committee and campaign e-mail addresses , " said a letter from the Senate and House Judiciary chairmen to White House counsel Fred Fielding on March 28 .
" We hope you agree that such sleight of hand should not be used to circumvent and compromise the comprehensiveness of our investigation . "
The non-governmental accounts were accidentally discovered by Democrats when the Justice Department released hundreds of documents related to the prosecutor firings .
One exchange showed deputy White House political director J. Scott Jennings sending an e-mail titled " USATTY " to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' then - chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , from an address with a gwb43.com domain name .
" Does a list of all vacant , or about to be vacant , US Attorney slots exist anywhere ? "
Jennings wrote on Dec. 3 from his political account .
Replied Sampson , a few minutes later : " My office .
Want me to send to you tomorrow ? "
Jennings had also communicated with Sampson and other Justice Department officials in August from his RNC - supplied address about how to install the administration 's preferred replacement , onetime Rove aide Tim Griffin , for Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins .
In one , Jennings passed on a strategy he said was suggested by Cummins , to have Griffin come on as an attorney in the Little Rock office until Cummins finalized his post - government plans .
Jennings said the plan would " alleviate pressure / implication that Tim forced Bud out . "
Sampson 's e-mails all appeared to be from his official usdoj.gov account .
The separate e-mail accounts also have become an issue in the case of disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who was convicted on bribery charges and is in prison for fraud .
Abramoff had several exchanges with Susan Ralston , then a Rove assistant , via non-government e-mail addresses with domain names like rnchq.org and georgewbush.com , to discuss issues in the Interior Department affecting the lobbyist 's Indian clients .

The Haskell community has a very nice implementation - independent mechanism for building libraries and applications , called Cabal .
I spent a few hours over the past couple of days hacking on Cabal to add the ability to build RPM packages .
You can fetch my darcs repository from here :
darcs get -- partial http://darcs.serpentine.com/cabal-rpm
This new capability is easy to use .
It adds a single new Cabal command , called rpm .
runhaskell Setup .*hs rpm
This generates a spec file , and builds source and binary RPMs .
Here ’s a quick example , of trying to build the Haskell XML - RPC library :
~/src/darcs / haxr $ runghc Setup .*hs rpm Source tarball created : dist / SOURCES / haxr-3000.0.0.tar.gz error : Failed build dependencies : HaXml - ghc66 >= 1.13 is needed by haxr - 3000.0.0 - 1.i386 HaXml-ghc66 < 1.14 is needed by haxr - 3000.0.0 - 1.i386 Setup.lhs : rpmbuild failed with status 1
The rpm command has converted the dependencies in the haxr.cabal file into build - time and runtime dependencies in the haxr .
spec file that it generated , but rpmbuild ca n’t find the HaXml package .
Having earlier built a HaXml package using the rpm command , I can install it with the system ’s rpm command .
# rpm - i haxml - ghc66-1.13.2-1.i386.rpm
Reading package info from stdin ... done .
Saving old package config file ... done .
Writing new package config file ... done .
The RPM ’s post - install scriptlet informs GHC ’s package manager about the package ’s availability :
# ghc - pkg list -- simple | tr ' ' '
' | grep - i haxml HaXml - 1.13.2
Now if I try to build haxr again , it will succeed .
By default , the rpm command builds both normal and profiling - enabled libraries .
It also uses Haddock to generate library documentation .
It ’s possible to control these behaviours from the command line .
The command also provides a - - gen- spec option , which only generates a spec file .
You can use this > spec file as a basis for crafting one of your own .
By the end of the century , the Earth could be more than 6C hotter than it is today , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
We know that would be bad news - but just how bad ?
How big a rise will it take for the Alps to melt , the oceans to die and desert to conquer Europe and the Americas ?
Mark Lynas sifted through thousands of scientific papers for his new book on global warming .
This is what the research told him ...
Nebraska is n't at the top of most tourists ' to - do lists .
However , this dreary expanse of impossibly flat plains sits in the middle of one of the most productive agricultural systems on Earth .
Beef and corn dominate the economy , and the Sand Hills region - where low , grassy hillocks rise up from the flatlands - has some of the best cattle ranching in the whole US .
But scratch beneath the grass and you will find , as the name suggests , not soil but sand .
These innocuous - looking hills were once desert , part of an immense system of sand dunes that spread across the Great Plains from Texas in the south to the Canadian prairies in the north .
Six thousand years ago , when temperatures were about 1C warmer than today in the US , these deserts may have looked much as the Sahara does today .
As global warming bites , the western US could once again be plagued by perennial drought - devastating agriculture and driving out human inhabitants on a scale far larger than the 1930s " Dustbowl " exodus .
On the other side of the Atlantic , today 's hottest desert could be seeing a wetter future in the one - degree world .
At the same time as sand dunes were blowing across the western US , the central Sahara was a veritable Garden of Eden as rock paintings of elephants , giraffes and buffalo , also dating from 6,000 years ago , attest .
On the borders of what is today Chad , Nigeria and Cameroon , the prehistoric Lake Mega - Chad spread over an area only slightly smaller than the Caspian Sea does now .
Could a resurgent north African monsoon drive rainfall back into the Sahara in a one - degree world ?
Models suggest it could .
Also in Africa , Mount Kilimanjaro will be losing the last of its snow and ice as temperatures rise , leaving the entire continent ice - free for the first time in at least 11,000 years .
The Alps , too , will be melting , releasing deadly giant landslides as thawing permafrost removes the " glue " that holds the peaks together .
In the Arctic , temperatures will rise far higher than the one - degree global average , continuing the rapid decline in sea ice that scientists have already observed .
This spells bad news for polar bears , walruses and ringed seals - species that are effectively pushed off the top of the planet as warming shrinks cold areas closer and closer to the pole .
Indeed , it is the ecological effects of warming that may be most apparent at one degree .
Critically , this temperature rise may wipe out the majority of the world 's tropical coral reefs , devastating marine biodiversity .
Most of the Great Barrier Reef will be dead .
In the highly unlikely event that global warming deniers prove to be right , we will still have to worry about carbon dioxide , because it dissolves in the oceans and makes them more acidic .
Even with relatively low emissions , large areas of the southern oceans and parts of the Pacific will within a few decades become toxic to organisms with calcium carbonate shells , for the simple reason that the acidic seawater will dissolve them .
Many species of plankton - the basis of the marine food chain and essential for the sustenance of higher creatures , from mackerel to baleen whales - will be wiped out , and the more acidic seawater may be the knockout blow for what remains of the world 's coral reefs .
The oceans may become the new deserts as the world 's temperatures reach 2C above today's .
Two degrees may not sound like much , but it is enough to make every European summer as hot as 2003 , when 30,000 people died from heatstroke .
That means extreme summers will be much hotter still .
As Middle East - style temperatures sweep across Europe , the death toll may reach into the hundreds of thousands .
The Mediterranean area can expect six more weeks of heatwave conditions , with wildfire risk also growing .
Water worries will be aggravated as the southern Med loses a fifth of its rainfall , and the tourism industry could collapse as people move north outside the zones of extreme heat .
Two degrees is also enough to cause the eventual complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet , which would raise global sea levels by seven metres .
Much of the ice - cap disappeared 125,000 years ago , when global temperatures were 1 - 2C higher than now .
Because of the sheer size of the ice sheet , no one expects this full seven metres to come before the end of the century , but a top Nasa climate scientist , James Hansen , is warning that the mainstream projections of sea level rise ( of 50 cm or so by 2100 ) could be dangerously conservative .
As if to underline Hansen 's warning , the rate of ice loss from Greenland has tripled since 2004 .
This melting will also continue to affect the world 's mountain ranges , and in Peru all the glaciers will disappear from the Andean peaks that currently supply Lima with water .
In California , the loss of snowpack from the Sierra Nevada - three - quarters of which could disappear in the two - degree world - will leave cities such as Los Angeles increasingly thirsty during the summer .
Global food supplies , especially in the tropics , will also be affected but while two degrees of warming will be survivable for most humans , a third of all species alive today may be driven to extinction as climate change wipes out their habitat .
Scientists estimate that we have at best 10 years to bring down global carbon emissions if we are to stabilise world temperatures within two degrees of their present levels .
The impacts of two degrees warming are bad enough , but far worse is in store if emissions continue to rise .
Most importantly , 3C may be the " tipping point " where global warming could run out of control , leaving us powerless to intervene as planetary temperatures soar .
The centre of this predicted disaster is the Amazon , where the tropical rainforest , which today extends over millions of square kilometres , would burn down in a firestorm of epic proportions .
Computer model projections show worsening droughts making Amazonian trees , which have no evolved resistance to fire , much more susceptible to burning .
Once this drying trend passes a critical threshold , any spark could light the firestorm which destroys almost the entire rainforest ecosystem .
Once the trees have gone , desert will appear and the carbon released by the forests ' burning will be joined by still more from the world 's soils .
This could boost global temperatures by a further 1.5 ºC - tippping us straight into the four - degree world .
Three degrees alone would see increasing areas of the planet being rendered essentially uninhabitable by drought and heat .
In southern Africa , a huge expanse centred on Botswana could see a remobilisation of old sand dunes , much as is projected to happen earlier in the US west .
This would wipe out agriculture and drive tens of millions of climate refugees out of the area .
The same situation could also occur in Australia , where most of the continent will now fall outside the belts of regular rainfall .
With extreme weather continuing to bite - hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today 's top - level Category Five - world food supplies will be critically endangered .
This could mean hundreds of millions - or even billions - of refugees moving out from areas of famine and drought in the sub- tropics towards the mid-latitudes .
In Pakistan , for example , food supplies will crash as the waters of the Indus decline to a trickle because of the melting of the Karakoram glaciers that form the river 's source .
Conflicts may erupt with neighbouring India over water use from dams on Indus tributaries that cross the border .
In northern Europe and the UK , summer drought will alternate with extreme winter flooding as torrential rainstorms sweep in from the Atlantic - perhaps bringing storm surge flooding to vulnerable low - lying coastlines as sea levels continue to rise .
Those areas still able to grow crops and feed themselves , however , may become some of the most valuable real estate on the planet , besieged by millions of climate refugees from the south .
At four degrees another tipping point is almost certain to be crossed ; indeed , it could happen much earlier .
( This reinforces the determination of many environmental groups , and indeed the entire EU , to bring us in within the two degrees target . )
This moment comes as the hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon locked up in Arctic permafrost - particularly in Siberia - enter the melt zone , releasing globally warming methane and carbon dioxide in immense quantities .
No one knows how rapidly this might happen , or what its effect might be on global temperatures , but this scientific uncertainty is surely cause for concern and not complacency .
The whole Arctic Ocean ice cap will also disappear , leaving the North Pole as open water for the first time in at least three million years .
Extinction for polar bears and other ice - dependent species will now be a certainty .
The south polar ice cap may also be badly affected - the West Antarctic ice sheet could lift loose from its bedrock and collapse as warming ocean waters nibble away at its base , much of which is anchored below current sea levels .
This would eventually add another 5 m to global sea levels - again , the timescale is uncertain , but as sea level rise accelerates coastlines will be in a constant state of flux .
Whole areas , and indeed whole island nations , will be submerged .
In Europe , new deserts will be spreading in Italy , Spain , Greece and Turkey : the Sahara will have effectively leapt the Straits of Gibraltar .
In Switzerland , summer temperatures may hit 48C , more reminiscent of Baghdad than Basel .
The Alps will be so denuded of snow and ice that they resemble the rocky moonscapes of today 's High Atlas - glaciers will only persist on the highest peaks such as Mont Blanc .
The sort of climate experienced today in Marrakech will be experienced in southern England , with summer temperatures in the home counties reaching a searing 45C .
Europe 's population may be forced into a " great trek " north .
To find out what the planet would look like with five degrees of warming , one must largely abandon the models and venture far back into geological time , to the beginning of a period known as the Eocene .
Fossils of sub-tropical species such as crocodiles and turtles have all been found in the Canadian high Arctic dating from the early Eocene , 55 million years ago , when the Earth experienced a sudden and dramatic global warming .
These fossils even show that breadfruit trees were growing on the coast of Greenland , while the Arctic Ocean saw water temperatures of 20C within 200 km of the North Pole itself .
There was no ice at either pole ; forests were probably growing in central Antarctica .
The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects , which also saw a major mass extinction in the seas , but also because of its likely cause : methane hydrates .
This unlikely substance , a sort of ice - like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure , may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense " ocean burp " , sparking a surge in global temperatures ( methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ) .
Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on subsea continental shelves .
As the oceans warm , they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago .
In the process , moreover , the seafloor could slump as the gas is released , sparking massive tsunamis that would further devastate the coasts .
Again , no one knows how likely this apocalyptic scenario is to unfold in today 's world .
The good news is that it could take centuries for warmer water to penetrate down to the bottom of the oceans and release the stored methane .
The bad news is that it could happen much sooner in shallower seas that see a stronger heating effect ( and contain lots of methane hydrate ) such as in the Arctic .
It is also important to realise that the early Eocene greenhouse took at least 10,000 years to come about .
Today we could accomplish the same feat in less than a century .
If there is one episode in the Earth 's history that we should try above all not to repeat , it is surely the catastrophe that befell the planet at the end of the Permian period , 251 million years ago .
By the end of this calamity , up to 95 % of species were extinct .
The end - Permian wipeout is the nearest this planet has ever come to becoming just another lifeless rock drifting through space .
The precise cause remains unclear , but what is undeniable is that the end - Permian mass extinction was associated with a super - greenhouse event .
Oxygen isotopes in rocks dating from the time suggest that temperatures rose by six degrees , perhaps because of an even bigger methane belch than happened 200 million years later in the Eocene .
Sedimentary layers show that most of the world 's plant cover was removed in a catastrophic bout of soil erosion .
Rocks also show a " fungal spike " as plants and animals rotted in situ .
Still more corpses were washed into the oceans , helping to turn them stagnant and anoxic .
Deserts invaded central Europe , and may even have reached close to the Arctic Circle .
One scientific paper investigating " kill mechanisms " during the end -Permian suggests that methane hydrate explosions " could destroy terrestrial life almost entirely " .
Acting much like today 's fuel - air explosives ( or " vacuum bombs " ) , major oceanic methane eruptions could release energy equivalent to 10,000 times the world 's stockpile of nuclear weapons .
Whatever happened back then to wipe out 95 % of life on Earth must have been pretty serious .
And while it would be wrong to imagine that history will ever straightforwardly repeat itself , we should certainly try and learn the lessons of the distant past .
If they tell us one thing above all , it is this : that we mess with the climatic thermostat of this planet at our extreme - and growing - peril .

How climate change has already had an impact around the world
Antibodies isolated from the blood of human survivors of the avian flu offered varying degrees ofprotection to mice infected by the virus .
Two monoclonal antibodies protected against two clades ( roughly , " lineages " ) , while two others protected against only one .
The research , published in PLoS Medicine , noted that a crude form of this tactic – using antibodies from survivors through plasma transfers – halved the death rate during the
1918/9 Spanish flu epidemic .
Mice received protection if given the antibody either one day before , or one to three days after viral infection .
The researchers end with a note of caution :
Before passive immunotherapy can help to halt an H5N1 pandemic , they warn , the monoclonal antibodies will have to be tested to see whether they can neutralize not only all the currently circulating H5N1 viruses but also any emerging pandemic versions , which might be antigenically distinct .
The virus has yet to mutate so that it can be transmitted through mere human contact , which is why the original fears never manifested .
That possibility does still exist , so researchers want to be prepared .
Blood of Bird Flu Victims Offers Treatment [ Reuters ]
Richard Turnbull , appointed two years ago , made the claim in a speech to the annual conference of Reform , a conservative evangelical pressure group within the Church of England .
If he truly believes it , the figure would encompass at least all non-evangelical Christians , including many members of the Church of England , and those of all other religions and none .
A recording of the speech , made in October last year and seen by the Guardian , was posted last night on the Thinking Anglicans liberal website .
In it , Dr Turnbull also warns against the danger of liberalism in the church , talks of " the strategic nature " of evangelical control of training colleges and calls on conservatives to syphon off 10 % of their financial contributions to the Church of England to help pay the costs of like - minded colleges .
The message excludes even evangelicals who are regarded as more liberal in their beliefs .
Dr Turnbull told them : " We are committed to bringing the gospel message of Jesus Christ to those who do n't know [ him ] and in this land that 's 95 % of the people : 95 % of people facing hell unless the message of the gospel is brought to them . "
Traditionally Wycliffe , a permanent private hall of Oxford University founded in 1877 , has trained evangelical Anglicans for the clergy , but its reputation has been as an open evangelical college , welcoming would - be ordinands from a wide range of theological and liturgical beliefs .
Critics within the college have accused the principal of taking it in a much more restrictive and exclusionary direction .
At least a third of the academic staff have resigned and its best - known member , the Thought for the Day contributor Elaine Storkey , has been threatened with disciplinary action , allegedly for raising concerns at an internal staff meeting .
In his speech , the principal criticised the Church of England for " restrictive trade practices " in limiting funding for its students and added : " I view [ my ] post as strategic because it would allow influence to be brought to bear upon generations of the ministry ... capture the theological colleges and you have captured the influence that is brought to bear . "
He warns that unless like - minded parishes fund colleges such as his own , they face closure within 10 years .
At the same conference in Derbyshire , Reform members agreed to remain within the Church of England for the time being but to set up an advisory panel to support conservative clergy and encourage ordinands of their viewpoint .
They were told by one senior member , the Rev David Holloway , vicar of Jesmond , that the church was a dysfunctional body with incompetent leadership .
In an article to be published in tomorrow 's Church of England Newspaper - a more broadly - based evangelical publication - Dr Turnbull 's message appears rather more tolerant .
He writes : " For me and for Wycliffe , inclusive means exactly that , rather than the exclusion of particular views .
So issues which divide ... have to be debated in the open , albeit with care and sensitivity ... "
Dr Turnbull was not available for comment last night .
Concerning Global Warming More Generally
In controversies over global warming , one issue that keeps coming up is whether it is anthropogenic , whether if the world is getting warmer it is our fault .
So far as I can tell , the question stated in that way is almost entirely irrelevant to the controvery ; it reflects a confusion between moral and practical arguments .
Suppose the cause of global warming is not human action but changes in solar activity or some other external factor .
Suppose also that the consequences of global warming will be catastrophic .
Finally suppose that there is something we can do to prevent global warming , say raising the albedo of the earth with orbital mirrors , high altitude pollution , or whatever .
Is n't the argument for doing it precisely the same as if we were causing the warming ?
Hence is n't " whose fault is it " a wholly irrelevant distraction ?
Of course , the questions of causation and prevention are not unrelated .
If we are causing global warming that suggests one possible way of preventing it — stop whatever we are doing that causes it .
But doing that may be , indeed very likely is , enormously costly , perhaps more costly than letting global warming happen .
It might even be impossible , if what we have already done is enough to cause long run catastrophe even if we do n't do any more of it .
And even if we are causing it and could stop doing so , there might be better solutions .
I should add that I am taking no position here on the other usual questions about global warming .
I do not know if it is happening , although it seems likely enough .
I do not know if , if it is happening , it is due to human action , although that again seems a plausible enough guess .
And it is not all clear to me that , if it happens , it will be a bad thing , let alone a catastrophe .
The crucial fact for me is that the more persuasive predictions of bad effects are well into the future ; at one point the estimate was a sea level rise of half a meter to a meter over the next century .
In my view , the next century is sufficiently uncertain so that it makes little sense to take expensive precautions against risks that far off .
By the time the risk arrives , if it arrives , we may have already wiped outselves out in some other way .
If we have not wiped ourselves out , our lives may have changed in a way that eliminates or even reverses the problem ; communting via virtual reality produces little CO2 .
If we are still around and the problem is still around , we are likely to have a level of technology and wealth that will make possible a range of solutions well beyond what we are currently considering .
All of these are reasons why I think a persuasive case for doing something about global warming requires evidence , not yet available , of serious negative effects in the fairly near future .
But that conclusion does not depend on whether whatever is happening to the climate is or is not our fault .
WASHINGTON , April 26 — George J. Tenet , the former director of central intelligence , has lashed out against Vice President Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials in a new book , saying they pushed the country to war in Iraq without ever conducting a “ serious debate ” about whether Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat to the United States .
The 549 - page book , “ At the Center of the Storm , ” is to be published by HarperCollins on Monday .
By turns accusatory , defensive , and modestly self - critical , it is the first detailed account by a member of the president ’s inner circle of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the decision to invade Iraq and the failure to find the unconventional weapons that were a major justification for the war .
“ There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat , ” Mr. Tenet writes in a devastating judgment that is likely to be debated for many years .
Nor , he adds , “ was there ever a significant discussion ” about the possibility of containing Iraq without an invasion .
Mr. Tenet admits that he made his famous “ slam dunk ” remark about the evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
But he argues that the quote was taken out of context and that it had little impact on President Bush ’s decision to go to war .
He also makes clear his bitter view that the administration made him a scapegoat for the Iraq war .
In July , President Donald Trump shook up his campaign leadership when he announced that he was promoting Bill Stepien to be his campaign manager and demoting Brad Parscale , who had been serving in that role .
The message appears , so far , to have found little resonance in Washington as President Bush sets out , after the shock of the midterm elections , to review American policy on Iraq .
The closest anyone with the White House ’s ear has come to suggesting anything short of democratic rule , let alone an authoritarian model typical of other countries in the Middle East , are leaks from the bipartisan commission headed by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton , which is charged with suggesting a new American approach to Iraq ; some of its members have said that the group has considered recommending that stability , rather than democracy , should become the principal objective there .
For the Bush administration , which made democracy - building here a cornerstone of everything it did after the American - led invasion , abandoning that goal now would be tantamount to abandoning one of its core missions .
Coming on top of the failure to find the weapons of mass destruction that were the original justification for going to war with Mr. Hussein , it would constitute an about - face of historic proportions .
But many Iraqis believe that it may now be the only hope — and a slim one , at that — of halting their country ’s descent into catastrophe .
Of the many hard lessons America may take from its enterprise here , the impracticality of grafting American political values onto a society as different as Iraq ’s , by measure of culture , religion and historical experience , will surely be one .
History may judge that attempting it in the midst of a savage war was the greatest of follies .
Far from Iraq becoming a beacon of democracy for the Middle East , some Arab scholars have said , the violence in Iraq will embolden other Arab leaders who defend their authoritarianism as a bulwark against chaos .
Lately , President Bush has put less emphasis on building democracy in his evolving definition of the American objective in Iraq .
“ A government that can defend , govern and sustain itself ” was the way he put it at his news conference on Wednesday , a formulation that suggests that he , too , may have reduced the focus on the Jeffersonian ideals prevalent in the headier days after the American - led invasion .
Then , L. Paul Bremer III , head of the American occupation authority , set aside $ 750 million for what was called “ democracy building , ” sometimes with results that bordered on the comical .
One example was a democracy center in the southern city of Hilla , led by a man Mr. Bremer described as one of the most remarkable Iraqis he had met , Sayyid Farquat al - Qizwini .
Mr. Qizwini , a towering figure with a bird ’s - nest beard and a black turban signifying his descent from the Prophet Mohammed , moved onto the American payroll after he “ liberated ” a mosque Saddam Hussein had built and named for himself , and used it for democracy classes for Shiite imams and tribal leaders .
Away from the Americans , Mr. Qizwini liked to make a joke of the enterprise , saying he had once had to sing the praises of Mr. Hussein and , for $ 100 a day , was happy to do the same for the Americans .
TEMPE , Ariz . --
A sheet of molten rock roughly 10 miles thick spreads underneath much of the American Southwest , some 250 miles below Tucson , Ariz .
From the surface , you can't see it , smell it or feel it .
But Arizona geophysicists Daniel Toffelmier and James Tyburczy detected the molten layer with a comparatively new and overlooked technique for exploring the deep Earth that uses magnetic eruptions on the sun .
Toffelmier , a hydrogeologist with Hargis +
Associates , Inc. , in Mesa , Ariz. , graduated from ASU 's School of Earth and Space Exploration in 2006 with a master 's degree in geological sciences .
Tyburczy , a professor of geoscience in the school , was Toffelmier 's thesis advisor .
Their findings , which grew out of Toffelmier 's thesis , are presented in the June 21 issue of the scientific journal Nature .
" We had two goals in this research , " says Tyburczy .
" We wanted to test a hypothesis about what happens to rock in Earth 's mantle when it rises to a particular depth - and we also wanted to test a computer modeling technique for studying the deep Earth . "
He adds , " Finding that sheet of melt - rock tells us we we 're on the right track . "
Deep Squeeze
In 2003 two Yale University geoscientists published a hypothesis about the composition and physical state of rocks in Earth 's mantle .
They proposed that mantle rock rising through a depth of 410 kilometers ( about 250 miles ) would give up any water mixed into its crystal structure , and the rock would then melt .
" This idea is interesting and fairly controversial among geophysicists , " says Tyburczy .
" So Dan and I thought we 'd test it . "
Geophysicists often study the planet 's structure using earthquake waves , which are good at detecting changes in rock density .
For example , seismic waves show that Earth 's density abruptly alters at particular depths .
The biggest change , or discontinuity , comes at the core - mantle boundary , some 2,900 kilometers ( 1,800 miles ) deep .
Another lies at a depth of 660 km ( 410 mi ) , while the third most - prominent discontinuity occurs 410 km ( 250 mi ) down .
But seismic waves do n't tell scientists much about rocks ' chemical makeup , or about minor elements they contain , or their various mineral phases .
Scientists need a different method to study mantle rocks that change composition as they shed water at 410 kilometers ' depth and become partly molten in the process .
A geophysical survey technique sensitive to these factors is called magnetotellurics or geomagnetic depth sounding .
" Basically , " says Toffelmier , " this method measures changes in rocks ' electrical conductivity at different depths . "
Calibrated by laboratory work , magnetotelluric methods permit scientists to estimate the composition of rocks they wo n't ever be able to hold in their hands .
" Rocks are semiconductors , " explains Tyburczy .
" And rocks with more hydrogen embedded in their structure conduct better , as do rocks that are partially molten . "
A common source for hydrogen , he notes , is water , which can lodge throughout a mineral 's crystal structure .
But how to measure the conductivity of rocks buried hundreds of miles underfoot "
The answer lies 93 million miles away .
Outsourcing
The sun emits a continuous flow of charged atomic particles called the solar wind .
This varies in strength as activity on the sun rises and falls .
When gusts of particles reach Earth , they induce changes in the planet 's magnetosphere , causing in turn weak , but measurable electrical currents to flow through terrestrial rocks deep inside the Earth .
Toffelmier and Tyburczy used electromagnetic field data collected by others for five regions of Earth : the American Southwest , northern Canada , the French Alps , a regionally averaged Europe and the northern Pacific Ocean .
Only these few data sets contained information gathered over a long - enough period to be useful in the computer modeling .
" The long - period waves tell you about deep events and features , " says Tyburczy , " while short - period ones resolve shallower features . "
Think of it like an inverted cone extending down into the Earth , he says .
The deeper you go , the wider the area that 's sampled , and the coarser the resolution .
The modeling approach Toffelmier and Tyburczy used was to start with an initial guess as to rock composition at different depths , run the model , compare the results to the actual field data , and then alter the run 's starting point .
As they worked , they found that only the data for the southwestern United States showed signs of a water - bearing melt layer at the 410 kilometer ( 250 mile ) depth .
" Without a melt zone at that depth , " explains Toffelmier , " we ca n't match the field observations . "
But , says Tyburczy , " When we added a highly conductive melt zone , 5 to 30 kilometers [ 3 to 20 miles ] thick , we got a much better fit . "
The extent of the melt sheet is unknown , however , because the data set is limited in area .
There 's little chance , the researchers say , that any molten rock from it would erupt at the surface .
Seismic surveys show the 410 - kilometer discontinuity is global in scope .
But Toffelmier and Tyburczy 's work shows that melting at the 410 - km depth is patchy at best and far from global .
So the Yale hypothesis remains only partly confirmed .
What 's next "
" Our modeling has been only in one dimension , " explains Tyburczy .
" We need to start looking in two and three dimensions .
We also need to understand better how rocks and minerals change at the incredible pressures deep inside the Earth . "
Says Toffelmier , " We 've seen only the tip of the iceberg . "

先週末 のRuby勉強会＠関西で、Rubyにおけるcallccの使い方について発表させていただきました。
継続の説明については 「なんでも継続」がよく参照されるんだけど、
ちょっと説明がボトムアップすぎると思うので(僕も最初に読んだときは全然分からなかった)、「callccで何ができるか」という応用面から攻める 構成にしてみました。
最初は 「 継続かわいいよ継続 」 「それをすてるなんてとんでもない」と思ってたんだけど、
いろいろ調べてるうちになんでcallccが嫌われるのかが理解できてしまった。callccはかわいいけど、非常に手のかかる奴らしい。
しかも、面白い利用例はいっぱいあるけど実用的な例があんまりないんだよね^^;。
callccが無くなるとRuby の「かっこよさ」が1さがる。そのかわりに「がんじょうさ」が1あがる。さあ、あなたはどちらを望みますか？
以下テキスト版 。
要旨
callccって何？ RPGのセーブ・ロードみたいに、プログラム中でセーブポイントを作って「そこからやり直し」したりできるものだよ
callccは凄い！ 利用例をいくつか紹介します
callccは危ない！ プログラムを変なところから「再開」できてしまうので、Ruby本体や拡張ライブラリの実装が面倒になるよ
Ruby 1.9では、callccの機能の一部を実現する「 Fiber」という機能がテストされてるよ
callccって何？
キーワード：継続 、Continuation 、callcc
ドラクエ的に言うと 王様と話すとセーブできる ドラゴンのこうげき！ 89 のダメージ まつもとはしんでしまった 王様 「 まつもとよ、しんでしまうとはふがいない 」 →セーブしたところからやりなおし
callccはセーブポイントに似ている callccでセーブ、cc.callでロード
callcc{}の返り値： cc.call ( arg ) で飛んできたときはarg そうでない時( 最初の一回 ) はブロックの返り値
まとめ セーブ ＝ callcc{|cc| … } # ccがセーブポイント ロード ＝ cc.call callccの 「次の処理」から再開される
callccは凄い！
(1) 3 重ループを一発で脱 出
callcc{|cc| for i in ( 0..10 ) for j in ( 0..10 ) for k in ( 0..10 ) if i==j && j==k cc.call end end end end }
それcatchでできるよ
catch ( : escape ) { for i in ( 0..10 ) for j in ( 0..10 ) for k in ( 0..10 ) if i==j && j==k throw : escape end end end end }
google code searchではループ脱出にcallccを使ってる例が 結構あったけど、throw/catchでできるよ
( 2) メソッド を 「 少しずつ」実行する
ゲームのイベント処 理
def event king .say ( “ おお#{@name}よ、しんでしまうとはふがいない ” ) wait_ok king .say ( “ そなたにもういちどきかいをあたえよう ” ) wait_ok king .
say ( “ では ゆけ #{@name}よ！ ” )
end
wait_okをどのように実装すればいい？
def wait_ok loop do input. poll break if input [ ” ok ” ] # これは他の処理が sleep 1 #止まってしまうのでダメ end end
普通に書くと非常にめんど う( ´・ω ・｀)
def event ( input ) case @step when 0 king .
say “ おお#{@name} ！ しんでしまうとはふがいない ” @step += 1 when 1 @step += 1 if input [ “ ok ” ] when 2 king .
say “ そなたに もういちど きかいを あたえよ う ” @step += 1 when 3 @step += 1 if input [ “ ok ” ] when 4 king .
say “ では ゆけ #{@name}よ ！ ” end end
callccを使うと…
def event king .say ( “ おお#{@name}よ、しんでしまうとはふがいない ” ) wait_ok king .say ( “ そなたにもういちどきかいをあたえよう ” ) wait_ok king .
say ( “ では ゆけ #{@name}よ！ ” )
end
メソッド を 「 少しずつ」実行できる
wait_okが呼ばれたたら、セーブしてreturn
次回の呼び出しはセーブしたところから再開
( 3) 全探索を簡単 に
あるマンションに５人の男が住んでいる bakerは5Fではない cooper は1Fではない millerはcooperより上の階にいる smithとfletcherは1つ隣の階にいる…
require " amb " A = Amb.new baker = A.choose ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) cooper = A.choose ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) fletcher = A.choose ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) miller = A.choose ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) smith = A.choose ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) A.assert ( [ baker , cooper , fletcher , miller , smith].uniq.length == 5 ) A.assert ( baker !=
5 ) A.assert ( cooper !=
1 ) A.assert ( fletcher != 1 && fletcher !=
5 ) A.assert ( miller > cooper ) A.assert ( ( smith - fletcher ) .abs !=
1 ) A.assert ( ( fletcher - cooper ) .abs !=
1 ) p [ baker , cooper , fletcher , miller , smith ]
( 4 ) each を 「 少しずつ 」 回 す
C++風のイテレータ
requrie ‘ generator ’ ( 標準添付 )
g = Generator.new ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) while g.next ?
p g.next end
(5) ppp
変数名も出力してくれるpメソッド http://www.rubyist.net/~rubikitch/computer/ppp/
いちいち p " a=#{a} " みたいに書かなくていいので便利
irb ( main ) : 109:0 > a = 1 1 irb( main ) : 112:0 > ppp :a a = 1
実装は超複 雑
Ruby 界 の3 大黒魔術が夢の競演！ eval系 ( eval , * _eval ) フック系 ( * _missing , set_trace_func ) callcc
こんなもん誰が考えたんだ Binding .of_caller として Rails ( ActiveSupport ) で導入されたのが初出 ？ 1.8.5以降だと動かない…。
callccは危ない！
なぜ危ない？ ( Rubyの ) バグの原因になりやすい 油断する とRubyが落ち る
例：fooというブロックを取るメソッドがCで実装されていたとする。
foo do puts " hoge " puts " moge " end
static VALUE rb_foo( VALUE ary1 ) { int * p = malloc ( ... ) ; … rb_yield ( ) ; … free (* p ) ; }
ブロック内でcallccを使うと、rb_yield ( ) ; 以下が2回実行されてしまい、メモリを2重開放しようとしてRubyが落ちる。
これを避けるには、Ruby開発陣や拡張ライブラリの作者が常にcallccの存在を気にしてコーディングしなければならない。
まとめ
callccを使うと スパゲッティコードが簡単に書ける！
callccはとても強力 処理の流れを自在に操れる
でも他人に読めないコードになりやすい 見えないところに隠そう
callccは楽しい 思いもよらないことができる
でもRubyインタプリタのバグ要因になり易い 将来無くなるかも
おま け( Fiberについて )
callccの代表的な使い方は
( A) 処理の中断 /再開 ( generator , wait_ok )
( B) 処理のやり直し ( amb , ppp )
の 2通りが挙げられる 。
callccが危険なの は( B ) ができてしまうからだ。 じゃ あ( A) の機能だけなら残してもいいかも？ということで、Ruby 1.9ではFiberという機能が検討されている。
Fiber はThreadみたいなものだけど、Threadのように自動的に並列実行はされず、Thread#yieldで明示的に移動先を切り替えてやる。
軽量スレッドとも呼ばれるらしい。( Thread＝糸、Fiber＝繊維 )
Fiberを使うと、callccの機能のうち( A ) を簡単に実現できる。
Ruby1.9は継続と“ Fiber ” をサポート - @IT …と書かれてるけど、実際はまだ決まってない。あり得る選択肢は：
Fiberだけが残る callcc もFiberも残る callccもFiberも残らない callccだけが残る

Story Highlights • NEW : Iran claims British sailors and marines admit to being in Iranian waters
• Iran claims UK sailors entered Iranian waters in " suspicious act "
• 15 British personnel on patrol in the Persian Gulf " seized " by Iranian navy
• Incident could exacerbate tensions with West over Iran 's nuclear program
Adjust font size :
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran says the 15 British sailors and marines seized by Iran in the Persian Gulf have confessed to trespassing into Iranian territory , the semi-official FARS News Agency reported Saturday .
But the British Ministry of Defense would not confirm the report .
( Watch reports on UK troops ' confessing ' to being in Iran waters )
The British government said its request to communicate with the detained troops has not been granted by Iran .
Earlier Saturday , FARS reported that the sailors and marines -- including at least one woman -- were brought to Tehran to explain their " aggressive behavior . "
( Watch how British sailors and marines were seized )
The British Ministry of Defense said Friday the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy surrounded and seized the marines while they were conducting a routine inspection on a merchant vessel .
They were then " escorted by Iranian vessels into Iranian territorial waters . "
( Location of incident )
Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday condemned the British government for attempting to cover up its " blunder " and said it should stop " putting blame on others , " according to IRNA , the state - run Iranian news agency .
Hours after reports of the arrests surfaced , a flurry of diplomatic activity ensued .
Britain announced it had called Iran 's ambassador for a meeting and demanded the immediate release of the marines , while Iran announced on state - run TV that it had asked Britain 's representative to Tehran to explain why the personnel had crossed into Iranian territory .
Iran waited until late Friday to release a statement .
The report was aired on state - run TV and sourced Iranian foreign ministry officials .
There was no mention of where the marines were being held or what would happen next , only that they were arrested for trespassing .
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Friday her office was making clear it expected the personnel to be released immediately , along with " a full explanation of what happened . "
The European Union also called for the " immediate liberation " of the captured sailors .
A U.S. military official who monitors the region told CNN the marines stopped a vessel suspected of smuggling automobiles , and boarded it for an inspection .
While the marines were on board , as many as six ships from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy showed up and claimed the British had entered Iranian waters .
A dispute ensued over whether the marines were on Iraqi or Iranian territorial waters , and the 15 were then seized along with the two small rigid hull inflatable boats they had used to get from their ship to the vessel , the U.S. military official said .
The official insisted on anonymity because the incident did not involve the U.S. military .
Nick Lambert , commodore of the ship , said his marines were inside Iraqi territorial waters when they were arrested .
There was no fighting and no use of weapons , he told a BBC pool reporter on the ship .
" It was entirely peaceful . "
The incident threatened to exacerbate the tension between Iran and much of the West on the eve of a U.N. Security Council vote to impose new sanctions on Iran .
The world powers will meet Saturday to consider that next step in the dispute over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
( Full story )
There have been similar incidents in the past .
In 2004 , Iran stopped three British boats and seized eight sailors and six marines .
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said at the time the three boats had crossed into Iran 's territorial waters .
The detained service members appeared on Iranian television blindfolded .
They were released after Iran said it determined they had mistakenly crossed into Iran 's waters .

CNN : Young officers leaving service at ' alarming ' rate
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email This
CNN reported on Friday about the " alarming number " of mid-level army officers leaving the military as soon as they complete their initial commitment , many of them citing family reasons and multiple deployments .
The army has been forced to offer new incentives for re-enrolling , including bonuses and extra training .
The percentage of career officers deciding not to stay in the military is the highest it has been since the Vietnam War and includes many West Point graduates , " creating a brain drain in the top ranks . "
A general interviewed by CNN expressed concern that " we 're losing the next generation of future combat leaders for the army . "
The following video is from CNN's American Morning .
Officials in the government and the telecommunications industry who have knowledge of parts of the program say the N.S.A. has sought to analyze communications patterns to glean clues from details like who is calling whom , how long a phone call lasts and what time of day it is made , and the origins and destinations of phone calls and e-mail messages .
Calls to and from Afghanistan , for instance , are known to have been of particular interest to the N.S.A. since the Sept. 11 attacks , the officials said .
This so - called " pattern analysis " on calls within the United States would , in many circumstances , require a court warrant if the government wanted to trace who calls whom .
The use of similar data - mining operations by the Bush administration in other contexts has raised strong objections , most notably in connection with the Total Information Awareness system , developed by the Pentagon for tracking terror suspects , and the Department of Homeland Security 's Capps program for screening airline passengers .
Both programs were ultimately scrapped after public outcries over possible threats to privacy and civil liberties .
But the Bush administration regards the N.S.A.'s ability to trace and analyze large volumes of data as critical to its expanded mission to detect terrorist plots before they can be carried out , officials familiar with the program say .
Administration officials maintain that the system set up by Congress in 1978 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act does not give them the speed and flexibility to respond fully to terrorist threats at home .
A former technology manager at a major telecommunications company said that since the Sept. 11 attacks , the leading companies in the industry have been storing information on calling patterns and giving it to the federal government to aid in tracking possible terrorists .
" All that data is mined with the cooperation of the government and shared with them , and since 9/11 , there 's been much more active involvement in that area , " said the former manager , a telecommunications expert who did not want his name or that of his former company used because of concern about revealing trade secrets .
Such information often proves just as valuable to the government as eavesdropping on the calls themselves , the former manager said .
まずmeasureを定義。関数定義はlispと同様でdefun。アイデアとしては、まずa<=bとなるような組が最初、次に(a>b and b<=c)となるようなやつが、その次にそれ以外が来るように。二番目と三番目のクラスはa-bでさらに順序付けられています。
ACL2 !>( defun m ( a b c ) ( if ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ) ( if ( <= a b ) 0 ( if ( < = b c ) ( cons ( cons 1 1 ) (- a b ) ) ( cons ( cons 1 2 ) (- a b ) ) ) ) 0 ) )
こんなのが返ってきて定義されたことを伝えてくれます。
Since M is non-recursive , its admission is trivial .
We observe that the type of M is described by the theorem ( OR ( EQUAL ( M A B C ) 0 ) ( AND ( CONSP ( M A B C ) ) ( NOT ( TRUE -LISTP ( M A B C ) ) ) ) ) .
We used primitive type reasoning .

たらいまわし関数を定義。再帰を一回手動展開しています。このおかげで三番目の引数をあんまり気にしなくて良くなるので楽です。変なことが起こった場合にはnilを返すようにしています。例えばmeasureがちゃんと動いていないとか。ACL2は停止が確認されなければ関数が定義されないので、未定義を付け加えちゃうわけですな。そうすると、関数はとりあえず定義できた上で、全ての入力に関して整数が返ってくるならば停止性が証明されたことになります。declareとかxargsとかはよくわかりませんが、とりあえずこう書くとmeasureとして(m a b c ) を使ってくれます。
最初 はACL2からの出力もこぴぺしてたんですが、長すぎるので割愛。
( defun tak ( a b c ) ( declare ( xargs : measure ( m a b c ) ) ) ( if ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ) ( if ( < = a b ) b ( let ( ( a1 ( tak ( 1- a ) b c ) ) ( b1 ( tak ( 1- b ) c a ) ) ) ( if ( <= a 1 b1 ) b1 ( if ( o< ( m ( 1- c ) a b ) ( m a b c ) ) ( let ( ( c1 ( tak ( 1- c ) a b ) ) ) ( if ( o< ( m a 1 b1 c1 ) ( m a b c ) ) ( tak a 1 b1 c1 ) nil ) ) nil ) ) ) ) nil ) )
defthmと書いてから証明したいことを書くと、それを証明しようと頑張ってくれます。長々と途中経過も説明しつつ。証明できればそれが定理として保存されて、そうでない場合には文句を言われます。a<=bの場合はいくらなんでも明らか。
ACL2 !>( defthm lemma1 ( implies ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ( <= a b ) ) ( equal ( tak a b c ) b ) ) )
But simplification reduces this to T , using the : definition TAK and primitive type reasoning .

所要時間45.86秒ですか。お疲れ様。あ、私の環境は貧弱なのでほとんどのところではもっとすばやく終わるでしょう。
問題はa>b>cのとき。この場合には、bとcを固定してaに関する帰納法でやっつけるんですが、それを理解してもらうのが一苦労。ちょっと複雑な帰納法をやるには、それと同じ参照構造を持っている帰納的に定義された関数を定義して、それをhintとして渡します。渡し方の文法は適当にサンプルからこぴぺ。
このケースでは自動証明が十分賢くなくて、b-1==cの場合とb-1>cの場合に分けないとやってくれません。というわけで、b-1==cのときは(a-1 , b , c ) を参照、b-1>cのときは( a , b , b-1 ) を参照しておきます。
( defun m_scheme ( a b c ) ( if ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ) ( if (> a b ) ( if ( equal ( 1- b ) c ) (- a b ) ( cons ( cons 1 1 ) (- a b ) ) ) 0 ) 0 ) ) ( defun scheme ( a b c ) ( declare ( xargs : measure ( m_scheme a b c ) ) ) ( if ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ) ( if (> a b ) ( if ( equal ( 1- b ) c ) ( scheme ( 1- a ) b c ) ( scheme a b ( 1- b ) ) ) t) t ) )
まずb-1==cのとき。この場合には、tak(a , b , c ) =tak ( tak ( a - 1 , b , c ) , tak ( b - 1 , c , a ) , tak ( c - 1 , a , b ) ) =tak ( tak ( a - 1 , b , c ) , tak ( c , c , a ) , tak ( c - 1 , a , b ) ) =tak ( tak ( a - 1 , b , c ) , c , a ) になるんで帰納法+既に片付けたケースで大丈夫。
( defthm lemma3 ( implies ( and ( integerp a ) ( integerp b ) ( integerp c ) ( >= a b ) (> b c ) ( equal ( 1- b ) c ) ) ( equal ( tak a b c ) a ) ) : hints ( ( " Goal " : induct ( scheme a b c ) ) ) )

なんか、ここまでお膳立てしたのにずいぶん長い出力があるんですが、いったい何をやっているんでしょうか？

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Brad Duke , 34 , a manager for five Gold 's Gym franchises in Idaho , pocketed a lump sum of $ 85 million after winning a $ 220 million Powerball jackpot in 2005 .
He spent the first month of his new life assembling a team of financial advisors .
His goal : to use his winnings to become a billionaire .
Here 's what Duke has done with his money so far .
Did you often buy lottery tickets or was this a one - time thing ?
I played the lottery often when I won .
I had developed a little numbering system .
Since I 've won , there 's been a lot of numbering systems for lotteries all over the Internet .
Before that , there were n't any .
I really thought I was going to win .
I even wrote it down in my journal in 2002 .
How did you develop your system ?
How to choose my lottery numbers started through a trial and error process .
I just started playing number games with myself about how to capture the most diverse numbers .
Then I looked at the most recent Powerball numbers over the last six months and took the set of 15 numbers that were most commonly coming up .
My Powerball numbers were going to be those 15 .
So I starting messing around with it , and my number games got a little more complex and a little bigger .
I was starting to win smaller amounts like $ 150 and $ 500 .
So many lottery winners have sad endings .
Did you worry about that ?
I 've always handled responsibility well .
If you accept that check , you accept an amazing responsibility to yourself and whomever you decide to include in it .
I was quiet about winning for a month before I decided to come out .
During that time , I was getting as much research as I could on existing lottery winners and what their stories were .
Most of them lose all the money within a short amount of time .
I 'm looking at statistics where people in ten years have nothing .
In ten years , I wanted to be worth about ten times as much .
I think a lot of people who play the lottery are people who live on hope .
What was your first major purchase ?
A trip to Tahiti for me and 17 of my friends .
At the same time , I paid off my mortgage and student loans .
[ What was your biggest purchase ? ]
The family foundation was the biggest allotment of money .
$ 1.3 million .
What else did you do with your money ?
I wanted to make the most of the opportunity that was given to me , so I put together a team with the intent to reach and maintain a $ 1 billion status over a particular period of time .
I wanted to do it in 10 years , which I knew was aggressive .
My team talked me into looking at 15 years .
But it looks like we 're on track for 12 years .
When you do something like that , the more you become worth , the quicker your growth curve is .
My total net worth right now is at an unofficial value of $ 128 to $ 130 million .
We 've done very well for the first year and a half .
What about a big new house or a fancy new car ?
I guess I 'm more worried about spending time on my investments and helping my consulting company along and doing fun things with my family and friends .
I will have a new home and a great car at some point , but just not now .
The great thing about the lottery was that I get to experience amazing things with people I care about .
I started up a consulting company and am employing some people that helped me along the way with my employment .
I took my family on a cruise .
You had to have treated yourself to something .
I bought bicycles .
I 'm probably own upward of 17 bikes .
I also bought a 2002 Jetta .
I gave my 2005 Jetta to my nephew .
So it 's the exact same car except for his is white and mine is black .
You had a newer car that you gave to your nephew and you bought an older car ?
That 's correct .
I wanted a black VW Jetta with a black interior .
Believe it or not , those are really hard to find .
I went to the local dealership and had them track one down for me .
They had to go to Texas to get it .
It fit my bicycle rack really well .
What happened to your job at Gold 's Gym ?
I still teach a spinning class there twice a week .
I took some time off after the whole thing because everybody had investment opportunities that were the greatest thing since sliced bread , and there were 100 of them every day .
So I had to get out of there for a while , but when I went back , the people I 'd been teaching for the last 8 years were still the same people , and I was still the same instructor .
Have you given money to members of your family ?
One of the first things I did was give everyone in my family the maximum amount without tax consequence .
I have all of my nieces ' and nephews ' college funds set up , and they 're set .
And there 's no debt for anyone anymore .
Everybody is happy .
Are you happier since you�ve won the money ?
Absolutely .
When it comes down to it , I get to do the things professionally that I 've always wanted to do .
I get to invent a piece of equipment that I 've always been thinking about doing .
I get to give back to some people that have given to me over years .

I ’ve long agreed with Lysander Spooner who wrote :

The Secret Ballot
What is the motive behind the secret ballot ?
This , and only this :
Like other confederates in crime , those who use it are not friends , but enemies , and they are afraid to be known , and to have their individual doings known , even to each other .
They can contrive to bring about a sufficient understanding to enable them to act in concert against other persons ; but beyond this they have no confidence , and no friendship , among themselves .
In fact , they are engaged quite as much in schemes for plundering each other , as in plundering those who are not of them .
And it is perfectly well understood among them that the strongest party among them will , in certain contingencies , murder each other by the hundreds of thousands ( as they lately did do ) to accomplish their purposes against each other .
Hence they dare not be known , and have their individual doings known , even to each other .
And this is avowedly the only reason for the ballot : for a secret tyranny ; a tyranny by secret bands of tyrants , robbers , and murderers .
And we are insane enough to call this liberty !
To be a member of this secret gang of tyrants , robbers , and murderers is esteemed a privilege and an honor !
Without this privilege , a man is considered a slave ; but with it a free man !
With it he is considered a free man , because he has the same power to secretly ( by secret ballot ) procure the robbery , enslavement , and murder of another man , and that other man has to procure his robbery , enslavement , and murder .
And this they call equal rights !
If any number of men , many or few , claim the right to “ govern ” the people of this country , let them make and sign an open compact with each other to do so .
Let them thus make themselves individually known to those whom they propose to “ govern . ”
And let them thus openly take the legitimate responsibility of their acts .
How many of those who now support the pretended “ constitution , ” will ever do this ?
How many will ever dare openly proclaim their right to “ govern ” ? , or take the legitimate responsibility for their acts ?
Not one !
I therefore take a dim view of those who go out and vote for people .
Like other crimes , such as murder or theft , I want it to go away entirely .
So I am especially happy to hear that one Zoila Meyer has been arrested and charged with the crime of voting .
Unfortunately , the state considers her act a crime not because she voted , but because she voted despite having spent the first 9 months of her life outside the United States .
Normally , I would be sympathetic to her – after all most people who do vote do so defensively ; few people I know voted for John Kerry to be president because they thought he would make a good one .
Most of them voted for him because they wanted George Bush not to be president anymore .
I have no sympathy for Mrs. Meyer , because she voted out of desire for personal gain ; she actually ran for office !
The damning evidence :
She got the idea to run for office after she and several neighbors failed to save the job of a Bradach Elementary School principal .
She worked the phones and got neighbors and other civic leaders to turn out and support the principal .
Even though the effort failed , many people told her she should run for office , she said .
Then , 10 days before the cutoff date to file as a City Council candidate , she was at City Hall paying her water bill and expressed her dissatisfaction with how little the city is doing to help children .
“ I was in here paying my water bill and they said , ‘ Why do n’t you run , instead of complaining ? ’ ” Meyer said .
Unfortunately , an ex- in - law who had it in for her ratted her out for the crime of being born outside the United States :
She was living in nearby Adelanto when she was elected to the City Council there in 2004 .
At that point , a member of her husband ’s family who dislikes Meyer contacted officials and told them she was born in Cuba , prompting an investigation .
Eventually , “ the police came to me and said , ‘ Zoila , you ’re not a citizen .
You ’re a legal resident but you ’re not a citizen , ' ” Meyer said .
She resigned after 10 weeks in office .
“ I apologized .
It hurt me to do that , too , ” she said
Having been arrested , she is becoming dimly aware of the true nature of the criminal gang that she almost joined :
“ It makes me feel like we ’re all just numbers , ” she said of her case .
“ I see people writing ‘ this is my country . ’
It really is n’t .
It belongs to the government and they decide who stays and who goes .
You think you ’re free : you ’re really not .
If they can do this to me , they can do it to anybody . ”
But not completely : she is oblivious to the fact that she was , for a period of ten weeks a criminal too :
Meyer also said she doubted her case would have come to light if she had not run for a political office .
“ Everybody flies under the radar .
I try to do something positive for my community , my children , ” she said .
The Kafkaesque moment comes when the judge concludes that she did not know she was lying when she claimed to be a U.S. citizen in her filing papers , but demands she stand trial anyway :
At a preliminary hearing Monday , the judge decided Zoila Meyer was under a misunderstanding of a federal law and believed she was a U.S. citizen when she filled out the candidacy application stating she was a citizen , said Deputy District Attorney Frank Vanella .
…
Meyer will still stand trial on two misdemeanor charges of fraudulent voter application and fraudulent voting , the district attorney said .
The trial is set for Oct. 5 in Victorville Superior Court .
Mrs. Meyer , pleaded no contest to those charges .
I think she needs to kick her lawyer in the crotch , since he obviously was working for the DA when he suggested she take a dive .
So now she faces an immigration judge , who will deport her unless she can convince him to let her stay in the United States .
If she is unsuccessful , the United States government will put her on a plane to Canada .
But wait !
The tale is even more Kafkaesque : it turns out she may have been a citizen all along !
The Daily Press spoke to a few Friday about her situation , and many said the same thing – if her parents were naturalized before she turned 18 , she ’s already an American .
According to attorneys , the law changes so often that it ’s “ confusing and convoluted ” to the point that many lawyers and government agencies have no idea what the laws are .
Meyer said she was told the laws that apply to her are the one ’s on the books the year she was born . ”
I think Charles Dickens said it best in “ Oliver Twist ” : “ The Law is an ass – an idiot ” .
Good thing that these guys are n’t in charge of our medical care , huh ?
OK , Snark aside , I wish Mrs. Meyer the best of luck .
I certainly hope she is not sent to Canada .
The New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , announced yesterday that his office had filed a lawsuit against Dell Inc. and its Dell Financial Services unit , accusing them of deceptive business practices and of failing to provide adequate customer service .
At a news conference in his Manhattan office , Mr. Cuomo said the suit came after an investigation and more than 700 complaints by Dell customers in New York State .
“ At Dell , customer service means no service at all , ” Mr. Cuomo said .
“ Dell ’s consumers were intentionally misled , and they had to pay for that privilege . ”
A spokesman for Dell , Bob Kaufman , defended the company ’s practices and said that its customers were generally satisfied with the services .
“ While our customers remain our top priority , Dell will vigorously defend itself in court , ” Mr. Kaufman said in a statement .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chen
Yan waves at a crowd of onlookers bemused at seeing China ’s late helmsman , Mao Zedong , brought back to life by a middle - aged woman .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Chen , 51 , from Mianyang , in China ’s southwestern province of Sichuan , has been dressing up as Mao since she was discovered on a local TV show in 2005 impersonating another actor who had played Mao in movies .
“ I was impersonating ( the actor ) when the beautician saw some similarities between me and Mao , ” Chen said , as make - up artists fussed over her in a Mianyang hair salon .
The beautician saw a dollar to be made in Chen ’s prominent cheekbones and imperious demeanor , and invited her for a make - over , she said .
Suited up in a grey , button - up waistcoat , Chen looks similar to the man who ruled China with an iron grip for decades , and is happy to ham it up for the cameras .
But the effortless poses belie fastidious preparations behind the scenes .
Chen spends up to 800 yuan on make - up and styling to create Mao ’s famous receding hairline .
“ I need to wear a pair of specially designed shoes to increase my height to 1.80 meters ( 5 ft 11 in ) since I am only 1.55 meters .
Then I dress up in Sun Yat - sen suits which Mao also likes , and hold a cigarette without the filter , ” Chen said .
The financial hardships had forced her to call the media for a public photo shoot to “ gain support and understanding from the public . ”
“ My family are against me doing this , ” Chen said .
“ They do n’t think it ’s a good thing for a woman to impersonate a man . ”
Chen , however , is determined to make a living from impersonating Mao , even to the point where she is cagey about revealing details about her former occupations .
“ I ’m not telling anyone anything until I become famous , ” she said .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Yang
Zhou is no cyberdissident , but recent curbs on his Web surfing habits by China ’s censors have him fomenting discontent about China ’s “ Great Firewall ” .
Yang ’s fury erupted a few days ago when he found he could not browse his friend ’s holiday snaps on Flickr.com , due to access restrictions by censors after images of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre were posted on the photo - sharing Web site . ”
“ Once you ’ve complained all you can to your friends , what more can you do ?
What else is there but anger and disillusionment ? ”
Yang said after venting his anger with friends at a hot - pot restaurant in Beijing .
The blocking of Flickr is the latest casualty of China ’s ongoing battle to control its sprawling Internet .
Wikipedia , and a raft of other popular Web sites , discussion boards and blogs have already fallen victim to the country ’s censors .
China employs a complex system of filters and an army of tens of thousands of human monitors to survey the country ’s 140 million Internet users ’ surfing habits and surgically clip sensitive content from in front of their eyes .
Its stability - obsessed government says the surveillance machinery , commonly known as the “ Great Firewall ” , is necessary to let Internet users enjoy a “ healthy ” online environment and build a “ harmonious ” society .
Yang just thinks it ’s a pain .
“ I just want to look at some photos !
What ’s wrong with that ? ” said the 24 - year - old accountant , typical of millions of young urban - dwelling professionals who are increasingly aware of and fed up with state intrusions into their private life .
Privacy , once regarded with suspicion in pre-reform China , has become a sought - after commodity among China ’s burgeoning middle class , according to Nicholas Bequelin from Hong Kong - based Human Rights Watch .
“ Of course , it ’s the first thing people seek when they have the economic resources , ” Bequelin said .
“ We see this growing in China in the wake of ideas of ownership and property . ”

PRIVACY BATTLES
Away from cyberspace , the battle for privacy between China ’s secretive government and its increasingly active citizens has turned violent in recent months .
In Bobai county , in the southern region of Guangxi , hundreds of farmers smashed government offices and burnt cars after local officials imposed punitive fines on residents who had defied family planning laws and had too many children .
The battle for control of China ’s Internet , however , will remain much more covert than confrontational , according to Liu Bin , an IT consultant with Beijing - based consulting firm BDA .
He believes it will take a long time before the government loosens control over web content , especially because the Internet - savvy middle class is unlikely to take to the streets -- like the farmers of Bobai county -- over lack of web access .
“ Many educated people feel they can accept the current status quo because it does n’t have much impact on their daily lives ...
They have been living with government propaganda for over 1,000 years , ” Liu said .
Such an attitude grates on Du Dongjin , a 40 year - old IT worker in Shanghai .
Du has decided to sue his Internet service provider , the Shanghai branch of state - owned behemoth China Telecom , who he said had blocked a Web site that had carried financial software he hoped to market .
“ If the court authorities are n’t influenced and they can hear the case fairly , I will win , ” Du said .
ANONYMOUS GRIEVANCES
Most frustrated Web surfers , however , would rather air their grievances in the relatively safe realms of Internet anonymity .
They still have their anonymity because a state push to have China ’s millions of bloggers register with their real names to ensure they only posted “ responsible ”
Web content was abandoned after an outcry from the Internet industry and due to the impossible task of keeping lists of exploding numbers of users .
“ The thirst for information in China is so strong , it is very difficult for the ( Communist ) Party to stay ahead of the curve , ” Bequelin explained .
Within days of the blocking of Flickr , links to browser plug-ins and how - to explanations to subvert the filters and see Flickr photos were gleefully posted on blogs and in chat - rooms .
Many posts were preceded by tirades against the censors for “ harmonizing ” Flickr .
One blogger posted an image of a voodoo doll , calling it the Great Firewall and inviting users to -- digitally -- stick pins in it .
Yang said restrictions on Flickr probably would n’t motivate him to write a blog , much less push him down the road of “ potentially dangerous ” activism .
But he liked the idea of the Great Firewall voodoo doll .
“ Have you got the link ?
Maybe I ’ll go stick a pin in it , ” he said .

The Nation that Freaked Out
We 've been at war with terrorism for about five months now , which may come as a shock to you if you 're an eccentric hot air ballooner just coming down from your ridiculous two year trip around the world .
In which case , let me tell you , we 've been doing a lot of freaking out .
We 've almost stabilized , so I 've categorized the specific types of freaking out we did and possible ways to avoid them in the future just in case terrorism wins the war and we end up living in a world where it 's required by law to be terrifying .
Reaction One-- Increased Secutiry : Pretending to be Idiots
Security immediately became our main concern after 9 - 11 .
The only problem with security is that it 's based around pretending to be an idiot .
A clerk asking me if I packed my own bag is n't going to foil anyone 's smuggling operation , but the two of us have to pretend to be stupid enough to think we 're keeping the world safe .
Airport security quadrupled after September 11th , which meant that security personnel had to pretend to be idiots four times as hard .
I saw a business man get searched a month aftwards .
A security woman found his nail clippers , got pissed off , broke off the file part of them , and saved each and every one of our lives .
Afterwards she even made eye contact with me as if I might share her intolerance for all these fucking business men that may at any time want to clean under their toenails .
Now , I might have an unusual perspective as the world 's foremost donkey basketball enthusiast , but to me , if you think crippling bathroom devices is the key to passenger safety , you 're either a fucking moron or playing make - believe .
Even if he was the kind of kung fu master who would try to take on a plane with nail clippers , he has the same chance of doing so with or without the little pointy thing .
Over the holidays , I saw airport security take away a 60 - year - old woman 's tweezers .
Tweezers .
I want to tell everyone right now , you do n't need to pretend to be stupid that hard to make me feel safe .
In fact , if I 'm ever a passenger on a plane that gets taken over by a 60 - year - old woman with a pair of tweezers , I fucking deserve to die .
And after I 'm dead , I 'll walk up to the pearly gates and say , " Hi , Saint Peter , I 'm with the group that got killed by the old lady with tweezers .
I assume there 's a section of Heaven for unbelievable pussies ? "
It 's not rocket science spotting terrorists , airport security .
Newspaper headlines are going to read , " Twitchy mutant freak caught on a plane trying to explode own shoe . "
You 'll never read " Loving grandmother of six and wanted terrorist , Henrietta Fields is wanted in connection with 98 fatal tweezer stabbings . "
You have a better chance of reading , " Novelty Menudo drum wanted in connection with transforming into Voltron and curing bowel cancer . "
There are some airports that have never had a problem with terrorism .
Over the holidays I was at the airport at Boise , Idaho where five camoflaged armed soldiers at every [ the ] metal detector were eyeballing everyone .
The only problem is that their camoflage was made to blend into a jungle envirornment and forgive me if you 're the type of genius who already knew this , but there are n't any jungles in the airport .
That means that if they ever end up in a gunfight against a group of elderly passengers with contraband nose hair trimmers they 're all going to have to hide in the same rubber tree plant .
One of the biggest tragedies involving airport security was the huge number of editorials that appeared in every paper , magazine , and TV show in the country complaining about it .
That 's fine ; you should complain every time someone shoves a bomb - sniffing dog three feet into your asshole for wanting to ride their plane .
Those do n't bother me .
The editorials that bothered me were the ones by people complaining security was n't tight enough .
There were all these brave investigative journalists that were outraged they managed to get through checkpoints with a butter knife in their carry on .
Some people even got arrested after they got through checkpoints and screamed " Look !
I got a pocket knife through !
I could have killed everybody ! "
These fuckers should n't think they 've spotted the hole in our safety net because non-terrorists like themselves are allowed to get through with harmless everyday items .
That does n't mean we 're all going to die .
All it means is that the person at the metal detector was n't a complete fucking moron .
If commuters really only feel safe when they 're getting punished for something somebody else did , they 're going to love my new invention .
They 're called Airport Pants , and they electrify your genitals every time I think about having sex with Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
Now that our airport security is a gag taken straight out of a movie about a possible dark future where nazi Germany won , we should embrace people who do n't highjack planes .
Like women .
My statistics might be off by a decimal or two , but in between the time they spend having pillow fights and slowly trying on lingerie , not one woman has ever highjacked a plane .
In fact , they 're so unlikely to kill us , I think airport security should issue them helmets that launch rockets .
That way , if one of these white people with their nail clippers ever starts some shit we 'll have people on our side ready to flex cybernetic hat implants that release a high - powered rocket payload into their faces .
Security agents need to use their heads .
While airport security agents are pretending that tweezers are deadly weapons , they 're also pretending not to notice that slightly over one hundred percent of terrorists are of middle eastern descent .
I know racial profiling upsets all the people who still believe the lyrics in Whitney Houston songs , but everyone will understand if airport security uses a little bit of common sense when they 're deciding who is likely to explode something and who is just a person who might need a fingernail file .
Maybe it 's wrong to discriminate against a people just because they occasionally blow up a plane , but I 'm going to try to talk you into it .
Say , for example , you 're an Arab at the airport .
First of all , welcome to one of my country 's beautiful airports , suspicious traveller from afar .
You 'll notice that security searches everyone in the airport including you .
That means you have to wait in line for three to four hours while they go through the luggage of all the old ladies ahead of you for no good reason other than try to not hurt you and and your people 's feelings .
Now imagine how nice it would be if they ignored everyone else and went straight for your luggage .
You just saved four hours of standing in line , and all you have to do to get on the plane is not carry a bomb .
I want to make it clear that no one is accusing you of being a highjacking murderer , we 're only accusing you of being of the only race that has a CHANCE of being a highjacking murderer .
Searching white people and hoping to find a terrorist is like searching white people and hoping to find a talking birthmark that can predict the future .
It 's certainly possible , but mostly you 're just wasting everyone 's time , you god damn idiot .
On to Part Two
I have a lasting impression of Geology Professor Craig Bond Hatfield , University of Toledo , circa 1980 : a no-nonsense man in white shirt and skinny tie , flattop buzz cut , and tortoise - shell glasses .
At the outset of each class , he would draw a map of North America 's coastline as it currently looks in freehand on the blackboard , and then lecture us on the past coastlines and sedimentary basins of the continent .
To have several hundred million years collapsed into a few weeks of Hatfield ’s course in Historical Geology is about as close as I ’ve come to a mystical experience .
" Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better , than that a man should rejoice in his own works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ? " ( Ecclesiastes )
In late 2003 , while reading an on - line article about something called " peak oil , " I saw a bottom - of - the - page citation that permanently influenced how I view the subject :
Oil Back on the Global Agenda .
Craig Bond Hatfield in Nature , Vol. 387 , page 121 ; May 8,1997 .
I decided that if Professor Hatfield was involved in the subject , it was clearly something that must be taken seriously .
Another early article , " How Long Can Oil Supply Grow ? " first published in 1997 by the M. King Hubbert Center , lays out all the peak oil arguments in a clear and succinct way – several years before forums like this one began giving voice to such concerns .
His was among the earliest voices warning of oil shortages to come in the twenty - first century .
Some articles of his go back to the early 1980s .
After a couple of years of dawdling , I decided to look up the professor again after not seeing him for over twenty - five years .
You see , I never completed my geology major : that career - goal foundered on the shoals of math and chemistry .
Now I 'm an adjunct professor of English in Maine , and I use my writing course to inform students about the importance of such basic scientific concepts such as evolution and energy .
My visit to Mr. Hatfield 's house was not done with this essay in mind .
We spent most of the time catching up .
He was curious about my life in Maine , and I was delighted to hear that his children had interests in common with me :
His son is a paramedic in Ann Arbor ( I'm a volunteer EMT ) ; his daughter , a History professor in Austin , enjoys playing old time tunes on the fiddle , my favorite hobby , too .
Turning to peak oil : I was curious to know – as he had n't written about the subject in years – if he had written anything lately that showed he was still of the opinion that oil was going to peak soon and that this was a bad thing .
Little did I suspect the simple message he would give me :
" Michael , it 's too late . "
Recently I submitted a list of questions for Professor Hatfield to answer to get a better look at his current thinking on the subject .
*
Please summarize how you first got involved in publishing warnings about the energy crisis .
During the late 1960s , 1970s , and early 1980s , I taught annually a graduate course in petroleum geology to geology majors who were just about to complete their master 's degrees and enter the petroleum industry in exploration for crude oil or natural gas .
Throughout this time , I had to keep up with the current literature in petroleum geology , and by the late 1970s , it had become apparent to me that the petroleum industry , in the U.S. and globally , was becoming progressively less successful at finding oil .
That is , in spite of steadily improving technology for exploration and drilling , and in spite of increasing rates of exploration for oil , global discovery rates were declining from a peak reached in the early 1960s .
In other words , we were drilling more and finding less .
This , coupled with the drop in U.S. oil production rate after 1970 , is what made me start writing about future oil supply problems .
The timing seemed opportune , because the temporary oil shortages of 1973 and 1979 had made the public aware of our dependence on oil .
So in 1979 , I started collecting rejection slips from editors of popular magazines and newspapers , and occasionally an article got accepted for publication .
You have called M. King Hubbert " the premier living authority on fossil fuels " ( this was several years before he died in 1989 ) .
Had you ever met Hubbert ?
I met M. King Hubbert twice .
The first time was in March , 1956 , in San Antonio , Texas , at a meeting of petroleum geologists and petroleum engineers .
I was a 21 - year - old undergraduate student at the time , and one of my geology professors had been kind enough to let me come along with him to the meeting .
I heard Dr. Hubbert give the talk in which he first publicly predicted that U.S. oil production rate would reach its maximum between 1966 and 1971 and permanently decline thereafter .
This was the talk on which his 1956 paper Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels was based .
Being a typical undergraduate student , I did n't know my ankle from my elbow , so I did not have enough critical information to be able to evaluate his talk .
But his conclusion about future U.S. oil production was clear enough .
My professor introduced me to him after the talk , and I got to shake his hand .
I was thoroughly impressed by all this , because Hubbert was already well known in geologic circles for his contributions to geophysical techniques useful in subsurface exploration .
My second meeting with Dr. Hubbert came thirteen years later , in April 1969 , at the annual meeting of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in Dallas , Texas .
We met on an elevator in the convention hotel , and I told him that I had heard his 1956 talk and asked him if he still thought that U.S. oil production was about to stop growing and start declining .
He said it would start to decline within the year .
We talked for maybe an hour sitting in the hotel lobby – mostly about fishing .
He was an avid fisherman ( fresh water lakes – not deep sea ) .
You mentioned that you stopped publishing after your retirement in 1999 because " it 's too late . "
Was there a specific moment or incident that prompted you to say " enough " ?
Because development of large - volume , economical substitutes for oil is likely to require many years if not decades , and because I think that global oil production rate is likely to start declining around the year 2010 , it seemed to me that , by 1999 , when I retired , we probably no longer had enough time to develop substitutes for petroleum adequate to compensate for the coming decline in oil production rate .
Also , on a more personal note , retirement meant that I no longer had to teach courses or direct master 's theses , which in turn meant that it was no longer necessary to keep up with all the diverse and voluminous literature on petroleum geology and other energy matters .
I eagerly anticipated this release but also realized that abandoning the current literature on energy would soon render me incompetent to write about oil supply problems .
Besides , by 1999 I was in my mid-sixties and had been writing about long - term fuel supply problems for twenty years without discernible beneficial effect .
This was discouraging ; I was tired , and my wife and I were looking forward to permanent vacation , travel , play , and no alarm clocks .
Your 1994 article for the Journal of Geological Education , " A Permanent Solution to the Fuel - Supply Problem , " states , " World oil production is likely to begin its permanent decline by ... about 2020 . "
Yet you mentioned to me that you were " pressured " by a representative of the USGS to use that date instead of your own estimate ( mentioned in the Washington Post in 1997 ) of a " permanent decline before 2010 . "
Have your ideas about the date changed ?
I still think that global oil production rate is likely to reach its maximum and begin to permanently decline around the year 2010 .
Such a forecast , of course , is necessarily imprecise and is influenced by several unpredictable variables both geological and political .
I would not be surprised to see world oil production rate start to decrease any time between now and 2013 .
I will if it does not start to diminish until after 2015 .
You said that you have n't read the oil journals since you retired ; yet you mentioned having read your friend Kenneth Deffeyes ' recent book " Beyond Oil . "
Do you have any thoughts about his prediction ( now a post - diction ) that world oil production peaked at the end of 2005 ?
I think that Kenneth Deffeyes ' prediction of Thanksgiving Day , 2005 , as the time of maximum world oil production rate was a playful reflection of his sense of humor and was meant to draw attention to the fact that no one can know precisely when oil production rate will peak or precisely when it will begins its long - term decline .
He probably thought that an obviously facetious forecast , far more precise than available data can permit , might at least draw some attention to the problem and its urgency .
More power to him !
Anything that might interest the public in this problem is worthwhile .
You stated pointedly in the Chicago Tribune , " Today 's population and living standards cannot be maintained without continuation of the profligate fuel consumption that fostered them . "
That was back in 1983 , when world population was a mere 4.6 billion ( it is now circa 6.5 billion ) .
Do you still believe , as you say at the end of that article , " we will experience ... truly catastrophic effects " when fuel supply begins declining ?
To gain an appreciation of the economic effect of decline in oil production rate , it may help to remember the oil shortages of the 1970s .
Those shortages were largely political in origin , very temporary , and minor as well .
Demand exceeded supply by a very few percent .
Yet , we had rampant global inflation .
We briefly had double - digit inflation even here in the United States .
The world experienced economic hardship and strain on the global monetary system .
Economic growth was severely impacted .
If we can envision that situation on a permanent rather than temporary basis , with world oil production rate declining every year indefinitely into the future , then we can begin to appreciate the magnitude of the problem .
Today , because of more efficient fuel use , we get more economic product per unit of oil consumed than we did in the 1970s .
But this does not mean that economic growth and oil consumption have been decoupled .
They are still strongly coupled .
What I envision is , after a few years of decline in oil production rate , a situation reminiscent of the depression of the 1930s , except that this depression will be permanent and worsening rather than temporary and improving – until we develop a large volume , inexpensive substitute for petroleum .
You gave a talk titled " Limits to energy " in 1998 at the Gordon Research Conference on " Assessing Resource Limits . "
What sort of persons attended this conference , and what was the response ?
I gave my talk ... to the most prestigious audience I have even been honored to address .
They included researchers in physics , chemistry , geology , biology , various fields of engineering , environmental studies , geography , and economics .
Included were faculty from Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Berkeley , Penn State , MIT , Carnegie Mellon , Columbia , Stanford , and various universities in Europe , Australia , and Japan .
Others worked in research and development at AT&T , Bechtel Corporation , Alcoa , General Electric , Worldwatch Institute , Monsanto , the EPA , the USGS , Motorola , General Motors , World Resources Institute , Bell Labs , and the National Science Foundation .
Because of the nature of the audience , I prepared more fully thank for any other talk I 've ever given , made super - clear , colorful power - point slides to accompany my statements , and even rehearsed my answers to every question that I could imagine might come in response to my talk .
I was loaded for bear , and I gave what I am certain was the best talk of my career .
Questions after the talk continued for about twenty minutes , and , luckily , I had anticipated every one of them .
The response was the most positive I have ever received for a talk .
I felt profoundly grateful for this good fortune with such an elite audience .
You 've probably heard of Matthew Simmons ' book " Twilight In the Desert , " an expose of " the Saudi miracle . "
In the wake of declines in Burgan ( Kuwait ) and Cantarell ( Mexico ) , everyone on The Oil Drum seems to be waiting with bated breath for confirmation that the super giant Ghawar field is also in decline .
Do you think this to be as imminent and catastrophic as Simmons makes it out to be ?
I did read Matthew Simmons ' book .
I lack expertise on the Ghawar oil field , but I have heard statements from other petroleum geologists who do have experience with the Ghawar field and whose views are not very different from those expressed in Twilight In the Desert .
It will be interesting to see how long secondary recovery efforts can maintain Saudi oil production at or above its present level .
One of my favorite quotations for my writing students to ponder comes from your piece in the Hubbert Center Newsletter of 1997 :
Our nation 's current attitude toward this dilemma is serene apathy .
We have no long - term energy plan .
We do n't even seem to recognize the existence of a long - term problem .
Rather , we simply vacillate from panic to complacency in response to short - term shortages and surpluses .
Recent events have certainly borne that out .
I find it ironic that complacency now reigns at $ 61 a barrel .
Have you done anything to prepare for a possible Mother of All Panics ?
A financial advisor whom my wife and I use did his master 's thesis in geology under my direction a few decades ago .
After working in petroleum exploration for several years , he left the oil industry and , with some additional training in other areas , joined A. G. Edwards as a financial consultant .
He 's been there for many years now .
He has helped me choose energy stocks for our portfolio as a hedge against the coming oil supply problem , but he admits that owning the right energy stocks probably will not be adequate protection for the economic difficulty that declining oil production will bring .
I have asked him what we should do , and he answered , " I do n't know . "
My thanks to Professor Hatfield for taking the time to provide such articulate answers .
" And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven ... and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit ....
For in much wisdom is much grief : and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .

I do enjoy looking at old predictions of the future .
Eventually , the future arrives and we can compare it with the predictions .
Sometimes , the predictions are better than the reality .
Sometimes , reality outpaces not only the predictions but even the dreams of the past .
And sometimes , the predictions end up being pretty - much spot on .
That ’s the case with a piece about the “ answer machine ” of the future , which appeared in the book Childcraft Volume 6 : How Things Change , published by Field Enterprises Educational Corporation in 1964 .
( Thanks to Paleo - Future for bringing this to my attention . )
Here ’s how it starts :
I think Google can handle that :
What else can our Answer Machine do for us ?
A single click from Google ’s first result shows us this picture :
Yep , “ File | Print ” does the job nicely .
The original “ Mary Had A Little Lamb ” recording was not kept , but we can listen to Edison re-enacting it or to an 1899 recording made on Edison ’s 1878 tinfoil phonograph .
A Google Video search does n’t disappoint , although you do need to scroll past movies about Edison Lighthouse .
I especially like this movie , filmed by Edison , which demonstrates that the more things change , the more they stay the same .
Someday ?
I already have an answer machine that can do all those things .
And if that fails , I can ask my question at Uclue .
I ’m feeling lucky .
When Charlie Bowden 's beloved dog died , the youngster was devastated .
After a tearful night , the 14 - year - old 's father decided his son was too upset to attend school that day and rang to explain why he would be absent .
Cliff Bowden was astonished when two truancy officers turned up at his home a few hours later and demanded Charlie go back to school .
Seeing his son was still upset , Mr Bowden told the two officers to leave .
Charlie is not a boy who needs coercion to attend classes .
Indeed , the youngster has won awards for his excellent attendance record .
Until the death of his pet , Susie , he had not missed a day of school this year .
Last year , he had a 99 per cent attendance record .
" I could n't believe it when there was the knock on the door , " said Mr Bowden , 49 .
" Charlie has never played truant in his life but they said the death of his dog was not a good enough reason for him to be absent .
" They tried to suggest he put on his uniform and go back but he was still really upset . "
Susie , a nine - year - old mongrel , died on Sunday night after having a fit .
Charlie had owned her since she was a puppy .
Mr Bowden , an art gallery assistant from Anfield , contacted his son's school , North Liverpool Academy , on Monday to say his son would not be present that day .
" When he woke up his eyes were still red and he did n't want to go to school because he just did n't feel up to it , " said Mr Bowden .
" He thought he might get upset in front of his friends .
" Charlie had grown up with Susie , he always played with her and took her for walks after school .
They were great companions .
" The dog was also a great comfort to Charlie when his mother died of ovarian cancer four years ago . "
Mr Bowden said that when the officers told his son to put his uniform on and go to school , he " did n't like their attitude " and asked them to leave .
" If I 'd lied and said Charlie was ill there would have been no problem , but because I had told the truth the school sent the attendance officers around , " he said .
" What annoyed me was Charlie never plays truant .
I suppose I 'm lucky in that sense because he loves school and does n't like missing classes .
" There must be loads of children who do n't even know what the inside of a school looks like that they should have been looking for . "
Mr Bowden added : " In my mind it 's all about figures .
The school seems more bothered about hitting truancy targets and keeping absenteeism down .
" The principal has said children have got to leave their emotional baggage on the school steps but sometimes that 's just impossible .
" Losing a pet is an emotional experience for a child .
It was just really heartless . "
North Liverpool Academy - one of the Government 's 27 flagship city academies - opened last month as an amalgamation of the former Anfield and Breckfield comprehensives .
Principal Kay Askew apologised to the Bowden family for the visit by education welfare officers .
" Their role is not designed to punsih children for not going to school .
Rather , it is to look after the welfare of children and encourage them to go back to school , " she said .
In 2003 , Liverpool City Council was awarded £ 250,000 by the Government to tackle truancy .
As part of the scheme , schools send officers to visit parents the first day a child misses class , except if the pupil is ill .
Daren
S knew that his days were numbered .
He was a troublemaker bent on changing The Way Things Were and The Director was hot on his tail .
Though Daren worked discreetly , improving his coworkers ' productivity a little bit at a time , it only was inevitable that The Director would eventually find out .
One does not become The Director by letting such things slide .
A financial services provider , Daren 's company did a lot of data processing and aggregation from a lot of different sources .
The Director acknowledged that their processes were " a little rough around the edges " but insisted that they ran " smooth , like a factory . "
An accurate analogy I 'd say , especially considering what the typical industrial factory is like : poisonous steam pipes spewing death gas every three seconds ; razor - sharp pinwheel governors spinning at different yet predictable intervals ; and giant , spiked stampers slamming down on conveyer belts running different speeds in varying direction , all placed inconveniently at the entrance and exit so that they must be meticulously navigated to avoid a significant loss of Life Points .
At least , that 's what every factory I 've been in was like .
Also like a factory , the company 's processes were developed over several years by many different engineers who carelessly bolted additions to the diabolical machinery .
The most convoluted of these processes was the bi-weekly Hedge Report .
One of the business ' most critical reports , it took two people two full days to create .
It was also Daren 's new maintenance responsibility and , consequently , his downfall .
The Hedge Report needed data from four different sources aggregated into a single SQL Server .
The aggregation was entirely manual : spreadsheets were generated , copy / pasted to each other , emailed , processed with a special script , emailed again , and so on .
Daren 's first mistake was to create a Visio diagram that modeled this process .
Everyone knew how it worked , so said The Director , and Daren could have just asked any one of the many people involved .
Daren 's second mistake was to make a minor change to a VB5 application that extracted data from another SQL Server .
Before his change , the application would inform its user of a null datum by crashing and leaving a half - processed file that required the user to dig through , go back to the original SQL Server source , and change the null datum to the string " NULL . "
Though it shaved a few hours off of the report generation time , The Director felt it was a waste of time , because they had a completely suitable workaround .
Daren 's third mistake would have been his suggestion to change an AppleScript that processed semi-raw data to a more manageable VBScript .
But he was starting to learn .
Although this AppleScript required that someone at another location logon to the company 's only Mac workstation , run the script , and email back the results , Daren figured this would be a battle for a much later day .
Sadly , Daren never got to fight that battle .
Fed up by Daren 's constant requests to " improve " the process , The Director demanded to know what exactly was wrong with the ASP.
NET module that Daren kept asking to change .
After all , he personally oversaw the addition and paid good money on consultants to build it .
Daren printed out the Page_Load ( ) method using a half - spaced six - point font with two " screens " per page .
He highlighted the buggy and incorrect code , spliced the pages together , and went back to The Director 's office .
In a move that may not have been the wisest career choice , Daren held the first page in the air above his head and let the other taped - together pages cascade to the floor .
With over seven - feet of highlighted code in hand , Daren said : " this is what 's wrong with the code . "
Our country was founded on guerilla warfare .
The British military was the strongest , most disciplined army in the world .
No one could stand up to them in a " fair " fight .
The British " Square " was invincible unless met with such overwhelming force that it could be annihilated .
Washington 's war , for years , was a series of masterful retreats , with a sting in its tail .
Americans did not stand up in rows to exchange fire , they sniped from behind trees and buildings , then ran away to reload and snipe some more .
Where British troops were armed with the " Brown Bess " musket and trained to fire into the " brown " of the enemy , many Americans were using their hunting rifles with much greater range and accuracy .
They could pick off their man from a distance , well out of range of anything approaching accurate musket fire .
Americans wore homespun , earth colored clothes which blended in with the surroundings .
The British wore bright red and marched in massed columns .
So what do we read today ?
Senior U.S. civilian and military officials still do n't get it .
" They can't beat us in a stand - up fight , " bragged our vice president just two months ago , echoing recent words of a U.S. Army colonel in Iraq .
This completely misses the point , and calls to mind the sad month of April 1975 , when Col.
Harry Summers was sent to negotiate with a North Vietnamese colonel the terms of American withdrawal from Vietnam .
Summers reported the following exchange : " ' You know , you never beat us on the battlefield , ' I said to Colonel Tu , my North Vietnamese counterpart .
' That may be so , ' he said , ' but it is also irrelevant . ' "
In Iraq , we are the ones identifiable , we move in convoys , we are " invincible " in battle .
The Iraqis are nearly invisible in battle .
They snipe and run away , bomb and sabotage and run away .
We kill everyone in sight and think we won .
Every time we spray a bunch of civilians with machine gun fire , we have recruited more " insurgents . "
Every man who has lost a wife or child is happy to try to kill as many of the enemy as he can before he , too , is killed .
Unfortunately , we are that enemy .
A poll in Iraq last year came up with 80 % of the Iraqis wanting the United States out of Iraq .
They said if killing us is what it takes , then they are all for it .
This was across the board , Sunni , Shia , and a lot of the Kurds .
At the current rate of US deaths , we are looking at another 1,000 to 1,500 dead and a lot more wounded , just to hang around in Iraq for another twelve to eighteen months .
If we would negotiate a cease fire and pullout , we might be able to cut the losses to near zero .
It might even get the various factions in Iraq to talking with each other .
The only way we are going to see this is if Congress stops waffling and cuts off the funding for Bush 's wars except for enough to bring them home .
That includes banning Bush from starting any new wars in the Middle East , such as Iran or Syria .
The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war , not the executive .
When our country was founded , diplomacy and negotiation was the first line of defense in international affairs .
War was the last thing resorted to after all else had failed and an attack was imminent .
Under Bush / Cheney , diplomacy is the last resort if we 've failed to kill everybody .
We have got to get the United States back into the community of nations .
The way to do it is to end funding for Bush 's wars and to remove Bush / Cheney et al. , from the government by impeachment .
If Congress will just read the Constitution they have sworn to uphold , the rest is a " no- brainer . "

Through the controversy over the eight U.S. Attorneys who were fired , I 've been personally most interested in a potential ninth name on the list , since the ramifications involve the Congressman from Redlands , California , my home town .
Details on this at the end of this post .
But there is a new development involving the original eight attorneys that potentially dwarfs in outright evil anything said , suggested , or suspected in the whole saga up till now .
Indeed , the implications would be so appalling , if true , that for now I find it hard actually to believe the worst .
Here are the facts :
Five and a half years ago , Thomas Wales was murdered in Seattle .
He was shot , through the window of his home , as he sat working at his computer late at night .
This was Tom Wales :
The killing took place on October 11 , 2001 .
If the ruins of the World Trade Center had not still been smoking at the time , and if the nation 's attention had not been completely ( and naturally ) riveted by that event , Tom Wales 's death would likely have become major national news .
He was 49 years old , and he had spent the previous 18 years as a federal prosecutor in Seattle , mainly working on white - collar crime cases .
He was gregarious , modest , humorous , charming , vigorous , very active in community efforts , widely liked and admired .
A significant detail is that one of the civic causes for which Tom Wales worked was gun safety and at the time of his death was head of Washington Cease - Fire .
This FBI 's " Seeking Information " poster issued after his killing is surprisingly forthcoming , even loving - sounding , about the background and virtues of the fellow law - enforcement officer whose murder the agency was investigating .
My wife and I did not know him well , but during the two years we spent in Seattle in 1999 and 2000 we met him through his brother - in - law , our close friend Eric Redman , and greatly enjoyed the time we spent with him .
No one has been charged or arrested in his killing .
But among the strange aspects of the case is that law enforcement officials fairly quickly began acting as if they knew exactly who they were looking for .
For instance , a story last year in the Seattle Times said this about the case :
Agents have focused on a Bellevue airline pilot as their prime suspect .
The pilot had been targeted by Wales in a fraud case that concluded in 2001 .
Other reports over the years have emphasized that this same " prime suspect " was a gun enthusiast and zealous opponent of anyone he considered anti-gun .
If - as is generally assumed - Wales was murdered for reasons related to his gun safety efforts and his past prosecutions , he would be the first federal prosecutor killed in the line of duty .
As best I have been able to tell from a distance , through the years law - enforcement and political officials from Seattle and Washington state have frequently complained that federal officials in Washington DC were not putting enough resources or effort into the case .
The same Seattle Times story mentioned above goes into one of the disagreements .
Everyone on the Seattle side of the story remembers that the Department of Justice in Washington DC sent no official representative to his funeral .
Until now , the heartbreak of the Tom Wales case , and the Washington - vs - Washington disagreement over how intensively the search for his killer was being pursued , had seemed entirely separate from Seattle 's involvement in the eight - fired - attorneys matter .
John McKay , the U.S. attorney in Seattle who was among the eight dismissed , appeared to have earned the Bush Administration 's hostility in the old - fashioned way : by not filing charges of voter fraud after an extremely close election that went the Democrats ' way .
But this weekend 's story in the Washington Post , based on testimony by Alberto Gonzales 's former deputy Kyle Sampson , suggests that McKay 's problems may have begun with his determination to keep on pushing to find Tom Wales 's killer .
If this is so , it is obscene .
Tom Wales represented everything the American public can hope for from its public servants .
He made less money than he might have , in order to enforce the rules that made Americans ' lives in general safer , more predictable , and more honorable .
He showed that people with many options in life could choose a career in public service .
He was a wonderful man .
For his commitment , he was murdered , which was in a deep sense a crime against the entire public .
The public in general has no way to punish or avenge that crime , but the law enforcement system does .
If an administration has chosen to neglect that effort because - as has now been suggested - it did n't want to ruffle feathers in the pro-gun camp , that is as low an act as any we have heard of in modern politics .
It would take us back to , say , the murders in Philadelphia , Mississippi more than 40 years ago -- but with the local officials trying their best to find the truth and the federal government covering up a crime .
I hope it proves not to be true - and that the dismissal of McKay was " simply " a matter of strong - arm partisan politics .
That is what now passes for " good news " when it comes to the Administration 's approach to the rule of law .
This story may well have been all over the blogosphere already .
I 'm not sure , because I 'm writing now from Rangoon , Burma , where making internet contact of any sort is a challenge .
That is another story .
Oh , yes , the hometown case : The ninth U.S. attorney .
She is Debra Wong Yang , a U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles who resigned just before last fall 's midterm elections .
Before she resigned , she had been reportedly investigating corruption charges against Republican Rep. Jerry Lewis , who was then head of the House Appropriations Committee and who was then head of the House Appropriations Committee and who since 1978 has been a safe - seat Congressman - for - life from inland southern California .
After she resigned , Ms. Yang reportedly received a $ 1.5 million bonus to join the well - known L.A. firm Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher .
As Adam Cohen pointed out in the New York Times :
She was hired to be co-leader of the Crisis Management Practice Group with Theodore Olson , who was President Bush 's solicitor general and his Supreme Court lawyer in Bush v. Gore .
Gibson , Dunn was defending Mr. Lewis in Ms. Yang 's investigation ... [ A ] possibility is that the timing of her departure was coincidental .
That would make her lucky indeed : after more than 15 years of working for government , she decided to take a private sector job precisely when the White House counsel was apparently trying to fire her .
Good luck for one federal prosecutor .
Terrible luck for another -- and , especially , for his children .
They deserve to know the truth .

Jimmy Carter 's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski appeared on Late Edition this morning to discuss his new book Second Chance : Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower .
Brzezinski is truly a great scholar of history and provides an incisive analysis of the geopolitical climate , particularly with regard to the disaster unleashed by our hasty invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq .

BRZEZINSKI : I think what this president has done to America 's position in the world is unconscionable and will take years to undo after 2008 , provided we do n't plunge into some terrible expanded conflict before he leaves office .
And what concerns me the most about Iraq is now that it is no longer a war of national interest .
It 's a war of presidential hubris and has the potential for expanding into Iran .
In case you missed it , Mr. Brzezinski was on The Daily Show last week .
He also testified before Congress last month and had some very disturbing predictions about Iraq and a potential showdown with Iran .

BLITZER : Welcome back to " Late Edition . "
I 'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington .
Our next guest sounded one of the early alarms against the war in Iraq and warned of potentially disastrous results .
The former national security Zbigniew Brzezinski served under former President Jimmy Carter .
He is the author of an important new book , " Second Chance : Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower . "
Dr. Brzezinski is a frequent guest here on " Late Edition . "
Thanks for coming in .
ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI , FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER :
Wolf , it 's good to be with you .
BLITZER : Congratulations on this new book .
Let me summarize briefly , as far as Iraq is concerned , three of your conclusions in this book .
The war in Iraq caused calamitous damage to America 's global standing , it 's a geopolitical disaster and it's increased the terrorist threat to the United States .
Are those three of your main summaries ?
BRZEZINSKI : Yes .
BLITZER : Let 's talk about each one .
It 's caused calamitous damage to America 's global standing .
How calamitous would you assess the damage ?
BRZEZINSKI : I 'll just give you one example , but one could talk literally for an hour .
The BBC recently conducted a worldwide poll asking people to rank countries in terms of their most positive contributions to world affairs and the ones that have made the most negative .
The three most negative countries rated by some 28,000 responders were in this sequence :
The worst , I 'm sorry to say , Israel .
Second , Iran .
Third , the United States .
Now , this is 15 years after we became the only global superpower , when we had a chance to really shape the world .
And this is now how we 're rated .
BLITZER : And you also say this has become a geopolitical disaster for the United States ?
BRZEZINSKI : Yes .
Because in the Middle East there is now great turmoil , and in many respects Iran has benefited geopolitically from the destruction of Iraq , and that , of course , creates problems for us .
And beyond that , we seem to be bogged down .
BLITZER : Are the 28 million or so , 27 million people of Iran better off now than they were under Saddam Hussein ?
BRZEZINSKI : You mean of Iraq .
BLITZER : I mean of Iraq .
BRZEZINSKI : Look , today in The New York times , there has come the big box which measures conditions .
It 's very hard to say that they 're better off .
I think in some respects , they 're worse off .
And then there 's a further statistic which is not there , with which I am somewhat familiar .
The country had about 25 million people when we were there .
Two million left , probably the very best , the best educated .
They literally have left to Jordan , to Syria and so forth .
About a million and half have been displaced from their homes , so they 're internal refugees .
And maybe as many as half a million were neither born because of a lower birth rate or died earlier because of higher mortality or were physically killed .
So we have deprived that country of close to three million people .
And we devastated the country .
BLITZER : You also say instead of reducing the terror threat against the United States , the war in Iraq has increased the terror threat to the United States .
Explain what your thinking is on that .
BRZEZINSKI : Yes .
It has intensified hostility toward the United States , in the Middle East , and increasingly in the Muslim world at large .
We have contributed to that not only by what we have been doing in Iraq , but we have contributed to it also by a kind of Islamophobic language which identifies almost all Muslims as enemies .
And that of course creates a wider , bigger , more fertile recruiting ground for terrorists .
BLITZER : But you also heard Stephen Hadley , the current national security adviser , say by fighting al Qaida in Iraq , the United States is preventing them from coming over here and committing terrorist acts in the U.S. homeland .
BRZEZINSKI : Look , if you were to extend that logic to its logical conclusion , we should be fighting , and we might be fighting before long also in Iran , more deeply in Afghanistan , potentially in Pakistan .
What the administration fails to understand , and it's a fundamental historic error is that we cannot be acting like an imperial power in the post - imperial age , like a colonial power in a post - colonial age .
The only way to eradicate terrorism is to have the support and consensus of all the moderates in the countries that potentially breed terrorists .
And not trying to do it by ourselves with means which increasingly alienate people .
BLITZER : You 're a professor , and you give grades to three U.S. presidents .
You teach at my alma mater at Johns Hopkins University at the School of Advanced International Studies .
Now let 's talk about the grades that you give these presidents .
You give the first President Bush a solid B .
You give President Clinton an uneven C , and you give the current President Bush a failed F .
All right , let 's talk about the first President Bush .
Why does he get a solid B ?
BRZEZINSKI : Because he did extremely well in handling the disintegration of the Soviet bloc , really skillfully , much better than Reagan would have done it .
And he acted with resolution , but inconsequentially in the Middle East .
He failed to exploit the enormous standing he had , really enormous , to set in motion some larger , more compelling vision of the new world that the United States would shape , being now the global leader .
BLITZER : And he did presumably well , at least you say , in dealing with Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait .
BRZEZINSKI : But did n't follow up on it .
And did n't follow up on the possibility ...
BLITZER : But here 's what I do n't understand .
You say he did n't follow up .
You criticize the current President Bush for going in and getting rid of Saddam Hussein , but you 're saying that the first President Bush should have gotten rid of Saddam Hussein then ?
BRZEZINSKI : No .
I 'm saying he could have exploited it by being politically more persistent and more insightful to overthrow Saddam from within .
I think the Army , the Baathists might have overthrown Saddam in those circumstances , especially if we were prepared to push on against the Iraqi armed forces .
But even more significant failure was the failure to exploit the remarkable standing he had , including participation of Arab countries in the war , to push for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians .
That was the moment to make a really basic push .
BLITZER : All right .
Now , what about Bill Clinton ?
You give him an uneven C , even though for eight years of his presidency the country was basically at peace .
BRZEZINSKI : Yes .
It was basically at peace .
It was prosperous .
But I also say that he was full of good intentions but rather self - indulgent .
And I do n't mean anything necessarily personal about him or only in part .
The country became self - indulgent .
It became kind of disinclined to really make any sacrifices .
Hedonism almost became a virtue .
We were n't prepared to undertake the kind of self - restraint , self - denial that is necessary in this modern world to provide leadership .
He would n't address the problems of poverty , of social injustice , not to mention ecology .
BLITZER : But how did he handle the crisis in Bosnia and Kosovo ?
BRZEZINSKI : Very well .
And I give him credit for that .
BLITZER : Because an uneven C , a lot of students , graduate students of yours would be unhappy if they got a C .
BRZEZINSKI : Well , I was known to be a tough grader .
But his major failing again was the Middle East .
Instead of exploiting the special standing of the United States as a mediator , he essentially kind of embraced Israel in a way in which , while giving more support to Israel , he diminished his ability to mediate between the Israelis and the Palestinians and create peace , which Israel more than anybody else needs badly .
And hence , he left eight years kind of slip , out of self - indulgence .
BLITZER : You give an F , a failed F , to the current president .
BRZEZINSKI : Yes .
BLITZER : That is a total failure .
BRZEZINSKI : I 'm sorry to say , this is terrible .
I think what this president has done to America 's position in the world is unconscionable and will take years to undo after 2008 , provided we do n't plunge into some terrible expanded conflict before he leaves office .
And what concerns me the most about Iraq is now that it is no longer a war of national interest .
It 's a war of presidential hubris and has the potential for expanding into Iran .
BLITZER : Even in these final two years of his presidency ?
BRZEZINSKI : That 's I think the biggest danger that we face right now .
BLITZER : The book is entitled " Second Chance : Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower . "
Zbigniew Brzezinski is the author .
Thanks for coming in , Dr. Brzezinski .
BRZEZINSKI : Wolf , as always .
Buying The Right Parts
As humans , we just have to measure the worth of things using some sort of value .
It can be objective or subjective but no matter which metric we choose , it allows us to compare stuff and decide on their worth .
In life , we can use our senses , observations and logical reasonings to form these deductions .
However , such subjective methods cannot help much when it comes to computers .
For example , if you compare two different processors , how would you know which is faster ?
By the size of those processors or their cost ?
Now , how ridiculous would that be ?
My processor is faster than your processor because it 's bigger !
For the best comparisons of PC hardware , we need objective metrics .
Even the long - abused MHz and GHz are useful as measures of performance when applied properly .
So , this guide will be using a combination of objective metrics in helping you decide on the right parts for your PC .
This will be an on - going work and will be updated as necessary .
This guide will take up many pages , so for your convenience , we have taken the liberty of splitting it up into several small sections .
A macadamia farm in Australia is home to what may be one of the most innovative , ecologically friendly Mac recycling projects to date .
While Apple has drawn the spotlight to its new eco-friendly commitment and is offering schools a helping hand with a new recycling program , at least one organization is taking its own approach to spare old systems from the landfills .
The Australian state of New South Wales is home to Piccadilly Park , a farm just south of Bangalow that has seen a transformation from a cattle farm to a hybrid macadamia orchard and wetland restoration project where rainforest trees frequently outnumber the crops .
Encouraging the growth has brought in an array of birds that not only lend a more organic feel to the farm , but also serve as a natural substitute for the toxic pesticides that would otherwise be used to kept insects at bay .
But to help these birds find a home , farm owner Rex Harris has thought of a unique approach to building nesting boxes : converting old Macintosh computers .
Instead of building the avian homes solely from scratch , Piccadilly Park has taken to emptying and then reusing the plastic shells of vintage Macs as birdhouses , mounting them on poles throughout the farm to provide nests in open areas .
Reworking the classic computers has proven successful .
The green and tan boxes are now home to the Eastern Rosella parrots shown in the photos .
Butcherbirds and kestrels also find sanctuary if the entry holes are the right size , according to Harris .
And in a perhaps unsurprising turn , the Mac casing of choice for the makeover is the original all - in - one design , first seen in 1984 .
The body is particularly well suited to the conversion process .
" The old Macs are perfect for nesting boxes with ventilation slots along the front , rear , and under the hand space where you lift them , " Harris says .
" We tried the original iMacs , but they are too big and get too hot . "
Locating the preferred systems can be difficult .
Most are " very very hard to find " in the present day , Harris adds , and will usually turn up in garage sales .
Still , the pursuit is said to be worthwhile and results in a large batch of nests for the farm .
About twenty receive the treatment on a rainy day , when the weather lends itself to working indoors .
Harris would also like to note that orchards are n't the only possible homes for the Mac aviaries .
Repurposing the old systems could easily become " something schools and nature lovers could take up " as a hobby , he tells AppleInsider .
He also explains that while he is n't limited to using any one variant of the initial Mac chassis for the nesting boxes , there 's at least one edition he would choose for Piccadilly Park above the others .
" We have used whatever we can get , even the last [ Color Classic ] model , " he says . " [ But ]
I love the original box , the one with the signatures of the development team on the inside . "
“ Many of them buy off plan , because they ’re fearless , ” she added , referring to the custom of putting money down on apartments long before they are completed .
Of course , people from all over the world have been contributing to the sustained demand for apartments in Manhattan .
But developers and brokers said the Irish seem to be the voracious newcomers of the moment , though their purchases have drawn less attention than previous buying sprees by the Japanese and the Saudis , who made splashes by acquiring trophy properties like Rockefeller Center and the Plaza hotel .
“ Because of the weak dollar , we ’re seeing a lot of European buyers and it just seems like there ’s a disproportionate amount from Ireland , ” said Jonathan J. Miller , president of Miller Samuel , a real estate consulting company .
Jules Demchick , who has developed several buildings in Manhattan , said the Irish are following a long parade of foreign buyers .
“ I ’ve seen the Persians and the French and the Dutch and the Germans and the South Americans do this , ” said Mr. Demchick , the president of J. D. Carlisle .
Still , he said he was surprised when Cathal McGinley , managing director of the Irish broker Kean Mahony Smith , offered to take a block of apartments in the Centria , a high - rise near Rockefeller Center , and sell them in Ireland .
After Mr. McGinley ’s company quickly sold the first 25 , he came back for more .
Eventually , most of the units in the building were sold to Irish investors , most of whom planned to rent them .
“ Bar none , the No. 1 investment strategy for an Irish person is through property , ” Mr. McGinley said .
“ Your average Joe on the street has probably got two , three , four , five residential assets .
It ’s considered to be a safe play . ”
Units tend to be something that was originally almost an arbitrary choice .
For example , when I want to cook fish , I know that it takes 10 minutes per inch , and so I use the first joint on my forefinger to see how thick the fish is and to decide how long to cook it .
( And it works out quite well ) .
When I need to buy something to length , I can get a first sense of how much I need by spreading my palms and touching my thumbs and from one side of one hand to the other side of the other is close enough to a foot .
But a Quadrillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000 in the US – add 000,000,000 to the end for the British system ) is a little hard to visualize .
Showing the volume occupied by a quadrillion pennies does n’t really help much .
And as for the Btu , well it ’s the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit .
Which would be good to know if I could remember how much volume there was in a pound ( Oh !
Yes there are 8 fluid ounces to a cup ) .
So how can we get a real sense of how much energy we are talking about ?
After all we measure natural gas in thousands of cubic feet ( or meters ) , coal in tons ( or is it tonnes ) ; oil in barrels ; while wind , solar , nuclear and hydro usually are given in either billion kilowatt hours a year or in megawatts ( though sometimes acre - feet has an impact on hydro ) .
So how do we decide if spending $ 138 million on a wind farm in New Zealand that will produce 88 megawatts , or one that will generate 132 megawatts in Maine is a better idea that , say , installing an LNG vaporization plant that will produce 400 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in Connecticut .
Well to begin with it would help if we could reduce all the different terms to a common comparative base .
And so that is what this post is about .
When we talk about Energy , it is often hard to get a good feel for the quantities that we are talking about .
The United States uses about 100 Quads of Energy a year where a Quad is a quadrillion Btu’s .
When I first saw that , I had to go away and look up how much a Quadrillion was , and could barely remember a British Thermal Unit ( Btu ) from when I was in school .
And given that we are now thinking of using Exajoules instead ( a Btu being roughly 1,000 joules ) , life seems to be getting a little beyond the stretches of my imagination .
Since this is the Oil Drum , and we have an idea as to how big an oil barrel is ( though remember that it is 42 gallons and not 55 ) , I am going to use a barrel of oil as the basic unit for comparison , and will insert a comparison table just a little further down the post .
But you need to bear in mind that not all oil is created equal .
There are sweet crudes , and sour crudes , heavy crudes and light ones , and they can all be refined to give different fractions of their volume into a variety of hydrocarbon products .
( See Robert 's informative post on this ) .
So the number that I use will be an average .
But it also helps to remember how powerful this fluid is .
Consider that the average car might weigh 3,500 lb which , with a couple of folk inside could readily get the weight up to two tons .
Now if the average mileage it gets is 21 mpg , and lets say it gets this while doing 63 mph , then it takes 20 minutes and 1 gallon of gas to get the car moving those 21 miles .
Put another way , in a minute the car will have gone just over a mile and used 0.4 pints of gas , or , in a second it will have used almost a teaspoon of gas , and moved the car and contents some 92 ft .
Pretty powerful stuff !
And so , as a measure of performance , a barrel of oil will move the average car and family , about 900 miles .
( Incidentally at an efficiency of around 1 - 2 % but that will be another story ) .
In 1954 there were 511,000 oilwells in the United States , with an average production of 12.4 barrels a day ( bd ) .
By 2005 the number of wells had dropped to 506,000 with an average production of 10.1 bd .
In Europe it is more common to find the amount of oil produced being given in tonnes , thus when a story , such as the restart of oil flows through Belarus comes along it often contains both sets of units , which may make it a little more difficult to understand .
Based on a discussion we had in comments , one can multiply the tonnes by 7 to give barrels , so that the tax that Belarus was seeking to apply was some $ 6.50 a barrel .
Alternately when Russian production is reported as 438.7 million tonnes from January to November we divide by 11 and multiply by 12 , to convert it to an annual rate , then divide by 50 and get a production rate of 9.57 mbd .
In the same way as oil has a variety of assays – or contents , so also is coal not a simple product and so for this also we use an average .
A ton of coal fills about a cubic yard of space ( depending on how it is packed ) .
Back in the days of hand - loading coal , a miner might expect to mine up to 20 tons a shift , depending on the conditions .
( Remember the song “ Load fifteen tons and what do you get ? )
On the other hand China produced 2.3 billion tons last year .
That is the equivalent of about 24.5 million barrels of oil a day ( mbd ) .
The Chinese production is about 35 % of world production , yet the industry is so inefficient that the average miner will only produce around 321 tons a year ( about 1,250 barrels of oil ) .
Very roughly a ton of coal is equivalent to around 4 barrels of oil .
In 2005 there were 670 underground , and surface coal mines in the United States and they produced 369,370,807 tons from underground and 765,662,208 tons from surface mines , for a total of 1,135,033,015 tons , the equivalent of 12 mbd .
When one looks at natural gas , the difference between Europe and the United States is reflected in that one measures in cubic meters , and the other in cubic feet .
So by normalizing to barrels a day of oil equivalent we can get over that confusion .
For example while the Shah Deniz gas field came back into production too late to save Lord Browne ’s job , it is now producing 3.4 million cubic meters of gas a day .
It sounds a lot but is only the equivalent of 16,000 bd – though since that is coming from a single well it is definitely not something to be sneezed at .
And going back to that LNG facility in Connecticut .
If it plans to vaporize 400 mcf of natural gas a day , that is 0.146 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) of natural gas a year , the equivalent of 70,000 bd .
And that brings us to the direct power producers , the wind turbines , hydro- electric power plants and nuclear facilities .
And here also you find some confusion between reported production numbers that requires that you know the difference between kilowatts , megawatts and kilowatt hours .
There is also an efficiency factor in the conversion of the wind / solar energy / nuclear pellet to electric power that sometimes can , and sometimes cannot easily be changed .
Consider , for example , that a single nuclear pellet in a reactor is about 0.3 inches in diameter and half - an - inch long and yet has the power of 3.5 barrels of oil .
Here is not the place to get into a discussion of the varying power demands over the course of a day or year , and the changes in power prices that go with them .
But it is necessary to talk just a little about the difference between power and energy .
To start at the beginning a generator ( wind turbine , nuclear pellet , solar cell ) puts out a certain amount of power .
This instant value is generally measured in watts ( a kilowatt being 1,000 watts and a megawatt being a million watts , and a gigawatt is a million kilowatts ) .
Thus , to use the example cited , a light bulb might consume 75 watts .
If it burns for an hour then it will use 75 watt - hours , or 0.075 kilowatt hours ( kwh ) .
But because demand varies , so the size of the power supply that is required must also not only vary , but be able to cope with the largest demand placed on it .
For instance , a 100 MW rated wind farm is capable of producing 100 MW during peak winds , but will produce much less than its rated amount when winds are light .
As a result of these varying wind speeds , over the course of a year a wind farm may only average 30 MW of power production .
Similarly , a 1,000 MW coal plant may average 750 MW of production over the course of a year because the plant will shut down for maintenance from time - to - time and the plant operates at less than its rated capability when other power plants can produce power less expensively .
The ratio of a power plant 's average production to its rated capability is known as capacity factor .
In the previous example , the wind farm would have a 30 percent capacity factor ( 30 MW average production divided by 100 MW rated capability ) and the coal plant would have a 75 percent capacity factor ( 750 MW average divided by 1,000 MW rated capability ) .
Load factor generally , on the other hand , is calculated by dividing the average load by the peak load over a certain period of time .
If the residential load at a utility averaged 5,000 MW over the course of a year and the peak load was 10,000 MW , then the residential customers would be said to have a load factor of 50 percent ( 5,000 MW average divided by 10,000 MW peak ) .
Knowing the peak and average demand of a power system is critical to proper planning .
The power system must be designed to serve the peak load , in this example 10,000 MW .
But the actual load will vary .
The load might be 10,000 MW at noon , but only 4,000 MW at midnight , when fewer appliances are operating .
The capacity or load factor gives utility planners a sense of this variation .
A 40 percent load factor would indicate large variations occur in load , while a 90 percent load factor would indicate little variation .
Residential homes tend to have low load factors because people are home and using appliances only during certain hours of the day , while certain industrial customer will have very high load factors because they operate 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
The amount of electricity consumed by a typical residential household varies dramatically by region of the country .
According to 2001 Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) data , New England residential customers consume the least amount of electricity , averaging 653 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) of load in a month , while the East South Central region , which includes states such as Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee , consumes nearly double that amount at 1,193 kWh per household .
More detailed energy use for households can be found at the EIA website .
So if we have a power plant that has a maximum operating capacity , for example , of 750 MW and runs at 50 % capacity , on average , then it will produce 750,000 x 365 x 24 x 0.5 = 3.3 billion kWh per year , the equivalent of 16,000 bd of oil .
There are other posts on the site , that I will gradually find and incorporate , that discuss such things as wind turbine load factors , but I think I may have given you enough to think about for now .
I will end with a couple of tables for conversions , which I adapted from those given by Stobaugh and Yergin , from their book “ Energy Futures . ”
And for those who , in times when power supplies are questionable , rely on a wood stove .
From Wood : An Alternative Source for Home heating ( pdf file ) .
Oh , and for those of you who wondered about the Quad , it is the equivalent of 470,000 bd of oil for a year .
And , to make a final point , when the Government are reporting that the ethanol target for 2012 is 7.5 billion gallons , remember that you divide first by 42 , which gives 178 million barrels a year , and then you divide by 365 to get 489,000 bd .
And so you may initially think that the target is a Quad , but you still have to remember that ethanol has only about 60 % of the energy of gasoline , and so the target will be around the equivalent of 300,000 bd of oil .
Does n't quite sound as much , does it ?
The Oil and Gas Journal give the following numbers for US Energy Demand in 2006
Oil 40.6 Quad
Gas 22.6 Quad
Coal 22.8 Quad
Nuclear 8.3 Quad
Hydro etc 6.5 Quad

GradeInflation .
Com ,
run by a retired Duke University professor .
Also , there is an article titled " When Bs Are Better " in the
current issue
( subscription required ) of The Chronicle for Higher Education ( subscription required ) by a Rutgers management professor :
In the fall of 2001 , The Boston Globe reported that 91 percent of the seniors who had graduated from Harvard University the previous June had received honors , prompting an investigation that concluded grade inflation was indeed a serious problem at Harvard .
Faculty members have not fulfilled the responsibilities associated with their proclaimed right to be the final judges of student performance .
In shirking that duty , they have also neglected their broader obligations to society : Teachers weaken rather than bolster the commonweal when they fail to award meaningful grades .
Grading laxness at all levels of American education has contributed directly or indirectly to a variety of problems , including declining scores on the SAT , decreases in the ability of American undergraduate and graduate students to understand prose , and poor training in mathematics and science , which puts American students behind their peers in many European and Asian countries .
Could more - realistic grading stem the tide ?
Ample evidence shows that students learn more when the bar for success is raised rather than lowered .
For example , Valen Johnson 's Grade Inflation contains analyses demonstrating that students who took prerequisite courses from teachers who were tough graders performed better in upper - division classes than did students whose prerequisite courses were taught by easier graders .
What are universities doing ?
A few universities have established grading standards , and their administrators monitor professors ' compliance .
Perhaps the most heralded example is Princeton University 's adoption of limits on the percentage of A's given in undergraduate courses .
And in the M.B.A. programs at the University of Chicago and New York University 's Leonard N. Stern School of Business , online grade - reporting systems will not accept an instructor 's grades in certain courses if the grades exceed school or departmental standards .
Carpe diem .
If you own or manage an office building or other commercial premises , the chances are that you ’re already using some sort of security system .
This may include simple alarms , video surveillance or even higher - end monitoring systems .
However , the vast majority of businesses do n’t use any sort of security alarm monitoring system .
This can lead to all sorts of problems , as break - ins and vandalism are often discovered after they have occurred .
If you install an alarm monitoring system , you will be protected in real time .
Any intrusion will result in an instant notification to your phone or computer , and you will be able to deal with it fast and efficiently .
With this in mind , we ’ve put together the following list of the top five reasons why you should seriously consider installing an alarm monitoring system for your office – if you do n’t already have one that is .
Look After Your Business Assets
This probably goes without saying , but installing some sort of alarm monitoring system will help secure your business assets .
If your premises are being monitored at all times , the chances of being broken into or vandalised drop dramatically .

Hryhoriy puts his long life down to the fact that he never married
The authorities are to mark the occasion by officially recognising him as the oldest person in Ukraine .
They say they have documents that prove that his birthday is on 15 March 1891 .
An attempt is now being made to get him into the international record books .
Hryhoriy puts his long life down to the fact that he has never been married .
To mark his birthday , Hryhoriy Nestor is having a small party - just a few friends and family will gather at his home .
Austro - Hungarian ' golden era '
Unlike many people from his village in western Ukraine , Hryhoriy has survived a brutal dictatorship , wars and grinding poverty .
In the past , the area was ruled by Poland and the Soviet Union .
But the 116 - year - old says that life was best when the region was part of the Austro - Hungarian Empire a century ago .
It was only at the age of 100 that he retired from working as a farm labourer .
He is now looked after by a relative .
Hryhoriy , who still has a full head of hair , says that being single has kept him feeling young .
He recommends a diet of milk , cheese and potatoes as well as the occasional shot of vodka .
It was a call to arms .
India , the paper announced , was ' on the brink of global success ' and it was up to readers to seize the moment and build their country into a superpower .
Posters declaring ' Our Time Is Now ' were pasted up throughout the capital .
The paper hired India 's best - loved Bollywood star , Amitabh Bachchan , to promote the message through a series of television advertisements , proclaiming in his growly baritone that ' quietly , while the world is not looking , a pulsating , dynamic new India is emerging ' , an ' India which is looking up at the sky and saying : " It 's time to fly " . '
Abandoning any false modesty , the newspaper has homed in on a rising sense of euphoria about India 's rapidly transforming economy and its growing clout on the international stage .
With investment banks predicting that India will become the world 's third largest economy within two decades and a CIA report forecasting that the 21st century will be India 's , this national self - confidence is spreading fast .
' We no longer discuss the future of India .
We say : " The future is India " , ' Trade Minister Kamal Nath likes to remark .
Last week such triumphalist excitement was on display in abundance with the news that the Mumbai - based Tata Group had bought out the Anglo - Dutch Corus Group ( which comprises what used to be British Steel ) with a $ 12.2 bn bid - the largest foreign takeover ever accomplished by an Indian company .
Beneath the headline ' Empire Strikes Back ' , one paper reminded readers that British colonial administrators had repeatedly tried to stifle the growth of the Tata family business in the early 20th century .
' Corus , the erstwhile British Steel and one of the icons of Her Majesty 's Empire will now fly the [ Indian ] Tricolour , ' the paper said .
' It 's the first step towards what we call the Global Indian Takeover , ' a front - page headline promised .
Travel a few miles outside the bubble of prosperity in Delhi or the financial capital , Mumbai , and this superpower mania can seem bewildering .
Beyond the sleek glass - tower blocks that house call - centre offices on the outskirts of the city , and the extravagant , Florida - style apartment complexes ( titled with imaginative dishonesty ' Bayview Heights ' or ' Heritage Luxury ' ) , the new India suddenly disappears .
Instead there is a vision of a more troubled India , where around 700 million people scratch a living out of agriculture and some 300 million battle to survive beneath the poverty line .
Horse - drawn carts dodge trucks as they drive the wrong way down the national highway , overloaded with leaking sacks of grain .
Visibly weak infant children break stones in the central reservation , helping to repair the road surface .
Health Minister Ambumani Ramadoss highlighted these paradoxes in a speech he made recently : ' India is on its way to becoming a superpower , but unfortunately 50 to 60 per cent of children under three years are undernourished , ' he said .
' We have the IT revolution , but then we have this pitiful infant mortality . '
The two most powerful people in India 's government are at pains ( at least in public ) to restrain the national surge of triumphalism .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh recently highlighted the inherent tastelessness in harping on about the country 's glorious economic destiny at a time when such a large portion of the population continued to be excluded from the benefits of growth .
Singh urged his listeners to remember the 'vast segments of our people who are untouched by modernisation ; who continue to do backbreaking labour , ' and , with characteristic honesty , listed the countless obstacles standing in the way of enduring economic success - illiteracy , failing healthcare , lagging education systems , crumbling infrastructure , hunger , poverty .
His words were echoed by the leader of the ruling Congress party , Sonia Gandhi , who warned against the prevailing ' superpower obsession ' , emphasising that while India had become a country of ' dazzling prosperity ' it still remained a nation of ' dehumanising poverty ' .
Both leaders have a vested political interest in avoiding the spirit of self - congratulation which surrounds them ; appearing to be sensitive to the needs of those excluded from the country 's financial boom is a vital part of their electoral strategy .
But the words of these leaders have done little to quell the simmering excitement in the media and the business community .
Indians already view themselves as the second most powerful nation in the world behind the United States , according to a study by the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs , and among international leaders there is no doubt about India 's soaring global stature .
India 's indispensability to the US was displayed last year with the sealing of a ground - breaking civilian nuclear pact .
Last month the Chancellor , Gordon Brown , came with a contingent of 150 senior business people from the UK to display Britain 's own desire to expand trade ties with India ( although his message was drowned in the far noisier debate over whether comments made on Celebrity Big Brother represented lingering racist attitudes in Britain towards India . )
There have also been visits by trade delegations from China and Russia , eager to capture business .
As part of its campaign , the Times of India has nominated 2007 as the ' Year of India ' and its columnists have no patience for doubters .
With customary self - assurance , a recent editorial explained : ' Combine our new - found economic and political clout with our increasingly influential diaspora and our status as a global soft power or superwower ( from Bollywood and Indian art to yoga and spirituality ) , and Brand India is on a roll like never before .

Last week , I discussed the artificial birds which the government uses to control migration patterns .
I also posted a video showing the differences between real birds and their man-made counterparts .
But I 'm hearing a lot of complaints from folks who are still having trouble making the distinction .
Of course , correctly identifying robot birds from a distance takes a lot of familiarity and even more practice .
Nobody said it would be easy , folks !
So let me show you an easier way to get a look up - close at these technological marvels while helping your community at the same time .
There 's a lot of information to absorb , so I 'm going to break it into several parts .
As I said , spotting a robot bird while it 's up and about is no easy trick .
When all is well , they do everything in their power to blend in to their natural surroundings .
But when something goes wrong , fallen birds send a very faint distress signal , which , given the proper equipment , we can use to track them down .
Since 1973 , the U.S. government has deployed over 400 million robotic birds .
While many of these birds are still in service today , over 10 million are unaccounted for .
Chances are , you 've got at least one in your yard .
Searching for these derelict birds will not only bring you face to face with the latest and greatest in cybernetic technology , but will help your community .
These robotic friends play an important role in ecology , law enforcement , and protecting our homeland security .
And they 're not cheap !
So after you 've had your fun , do the right thing and turn your specimen over to a government certified technician who can get your feathered companion up and flying ASAP .
In some cases , the government has reportedly given monetary rewards for birds returned in exceptional condition although official reward amounts have remained undisclosed .

In the mid-1990s , two women took a pre-feminist approach towards dating and mating that was surprisingly well received – landing The Rules™ on the national bestseller list , and into popular American culture .
Shamoon and Fein ( 1995 ) proclaimed that by following these simple , albeit oppressive , rules to dating , any woman could bag a mate in due time .
Some of these rules included avoiding the phone in an effort to play hard to get , and letting the man take the lead .
After such socially regressive rules , Redefining Seduction , the author - proclaimed " evolutionary documentary for women , " seems a breath of relief for women residing in the United States .
Contrary to the Rules of the mid-1990s , from this approach women are informed that they can take the driver 's seat , be flirtatious and assertive , and still win that prized mate .
The advice in this book stems from a different set of rules — the rules of Darwinian sexual selection .
However , hiding behind this approach are a few common mistakes that lay people make when applying evolutionary theory to everyday behavior .
The first is the original sin of evolution — committing the naturalistic fallacy .
The second is to ignore the harsh reality behind sexual selection — all mates are not created equal .
While , as a woman , I appreciate the advice for women to break out of their subordinate shells and stop changing themselves to fit into a man ’s world ( more about this below ) , as an evolutionary scientist , I must tackle the scientific issues that provide the impetus for this book .
The Naturalistic Fallacy
" His [ Darwin ’s ] theory of Sexual Selection proposed that the traits displayed by the males existed only because generations of females desired them during the mating process .
In short , females ’ mating choices had determined the evolution of their species . "
( Sheehan & Reffell , 2006 , pp. 7 - 8 ) .
" We want women to know that they have the power to change our species for the better or the worse ; it ’s all up to them .
Only they can help men redefine ‘ progress ' . "
( Sheehan & Reffell , 2006 , p. i )
Sheehan and Reffell ( 2006 ) begin their tale of seduction by giving a very brief introduction to Darwin ’s theory of Sexual Selection ( i.e. , the quote above ) .
With this theory , Darwin ( 1871 ) could explain the persistence of traits within a population that seem to detract from fitness by hindering the survival of the bearer .
For example , the brilliant plumage of some species of male birds leaves them not only an easy target for predators , but sometimes slows down the individual during escape , such as the weighty and bright tale of the peacock .
However , these survival - hindering plumages are also quite attractive to females , the choosiest member of most animal species , who in turn mate most often with the males with the brightest plumage .
Thus the trait that hinders survival increases reproductive opportunities , and is therefore subject to selection pressures .
After having been convinced of some of Geoffrey Miller 's theories in The Mating Mind : How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature , the authors claim that since women are the choosiest sex when it comes to mating , they have therefore shaped the evolution of the human species and can do so for future generations .
However , sexual selection operates differently than natural selection .
Sexually selected traits appear among the males of a species , not the females .
Therefore a sexually selected trait cannot be the sole driving force behind the evolution of a species .
Returning to the example of peacocks , peahens in comparison appear bland .
Peahens have been responsible for choosing the brightest peacocks with whom to mate , but this has not shaped all of the traits that characterize the species .
Thus women may have the ability to shape the future of particular traits among men , but not women .
The authors argue that this is enough , however .
Major wars are historically male affairs , so perhaps we could select for more gentle men who are less likely to start wars .
However , the claim that since sexual selection occurs , it should be used to help progress the species is a value - laden approach often preferred by the Good Morning Americas of the nation .
However , evolutionary theorists do not often hold such opinions .
David Buss ( 2005 ) believes that all humans are endowed with the trait to murder , but this does not mean that he believes that murderers should be exonerated because they just could not stop themselves from acting on this trait .
Likewise , that women have pre-historically been the choosier members of our species does not imply that this is good or bad — and should not automatically be capitalized upon without thought .
As an illustration , let ’s play out an example of female choice in the modern United States .
Humans do not have brilliant plumage as the result of sexual selection , but an example the authors give of a human sexually selected trait is the tendency for men to desire fast cars .
As they relay , the fast cars may hinder survival via accidents , but they attract women who see a fast car as an indication of resources .
However , fast cars are relatively poor on gas mileage and hefty on emissions , and as we all know from the daily news , we are facing the threat of global warming , which is exacerbated by carbon emissions from cars .
Should we follow the advice of the authors , women should play up their role as the choosy sex , which includes the previous selection for fast cars , which will ultimately destroy our environment .
Is this progress ?
Who should be in charge of evaluating the acts that will lead to progress ?
Finally , humans are not the product of genes alone — we have rich cultural and historical influences that have shaped us along with natural , sexual , and artificial selection .
Therefore , by returning to " nature ’s way " à la sexual selection , we are ignoring the rich multitude of influences that stand to shape humans .
If we take just one approach , we are likely to ignore other possible outcomes .
While the authors envision " … intuitive skills [ that ] were a product of evolution that could hold the key to ending the gender wars and changing patriarchy to partnership " ( Sheehan & Reffell , 2006 , p. 7 ) , they have ignored the dangers of equating selection with progress .
While an understanding of natural and sexual selection may teach us about ourselves , the theories cannot be used to promote attributes of the human species without potential danger .
After all , this line of thinking left us with the Eugenics movement of the late 19th century ( Galton , 1907 , original publication 1883 ) .
All mates are not created equal
Sheehan and Reffell ( 2006 ) base their new rules of female seduction on the theory of sexual selection , advocating that women improve the choices they make when dating .
The idea is simple — follow their rules for seducing and pairing with men , and the future generations of women will benefit by being exposed to an egalitarian - minded society .
The first step towards improved seduction is recognizing the " Male Mask , " the outer shell boys construct in adolescence to protect themselves from rejection .
This mask translates to suppressed emotional expression and hidden insecurities .
To overcome this Male Mask , women have to show that they are able to be in control , so that men can shed that rigid exterior .
Women should become self - assured and confident , approaching men with ease .
The Male Mask hides the fact that men are scared silly of women .
As there is no empirical research on this Male Mask , to my knowledge , one can only counter - speculate as to this manifestation .
If we are to begin with the assumption that this mask is prevalent , we might also assume that some masks are more developed than others .
But what if men are not willing to shed their masks ?
While women may still be in the position to sexually select traits , we also live based on the norms of our culture .
In the United States , this most often means practicing monogamy , at least serially .
Unlike other animals in which the female is the choosiest sex , women do not get to pick from among a few choice men .
Rather they are restricted based on the available men , who are not already serving as a woman ’s mate .
If not all men are willing to shed their masks then only some women will be successful in their attempts to redefine seduction .
In dominance hierarchies , both male and female , the most dominant individual is able to choose first from among the mates .
If not all men will shed their masks , as those who will get snatched up , some women will be left without mates , or with mates unwilling to shed their Males Masks .
Thus all mates are not created equal .
Some women will be able to redefine selection , and others will be stuck with the same old war - hungry men .
Issues with the new “ feminist ” rules
The authors take issue with the Rules prescribed by Shamoon and Fein ( 1995 ) .
They are not alone — even Amazon.com ( who stands to profit from sales ) writes that the authors ( Shamoon & Fein ) " whose main credentials seem to be that they are married , lay out the rules to be followed for successfully snagging a dream hunk " ( www.amazon.com editorial review of The Rules ) .
Sheehan & Reffell critique this view of women as follows : " It is the norm for her to sit at home by the telephone ( or obsessively check her email or cell ) , waiting for The Call " ( 2006 , p. 4 ) .
In the 20th century , it is amazing that so many women felt their only chance to find a husband was to follow such rules .
To dispel the myths of The Rules , Sheehan and Reffell ( 2006 ) propose their own rules .
In their effort , they describe alternative ways that a woman can basically change herself to fit with what men want .
What have we gained ?
A reader learns that she need not avoid the phone — in fact , the authors say “ call , call him again ” ( p. 62 ) — but women still should avoid talking about " You - and - Him , " and by all means , avoid asking questions such as whether he enjoyed himself ( p. 61 ) .
Instead , women must learn to be sneaky when removing the layers of the Male Mask .
What we 've learned
As a self - help book , women could stand to listen to some of the advice Sheehan and Reffell offer in Redefining Seduction .
This book is by far a step up from the rules of the mid-1990s .
However , the new rules will not work if men do not also step up to the plate and accept their own needed changes in deconstructing the Male Mask and treating women as equal partners .
As a scientific application of sexual selection , this book is less reputable .
The authors take pieces of Darwin ’s theory , a quote from Geoffrey Miller ( the modern sexual selection proponent ) and combine it with a lot of common sense and over - generalizations about males and females in the United States .
In fairness , the authors were not trying to present a data - heavy piece of writing — as evidenced by their term " Evolutionary Documentary , " and half of the sources , which were written for popular audiences .
The authors set out to write a manual to empower women in courting and partnering with men , and for some will prove a welcome addition to the self - help section .

Olbermann : The ' stuff ' Bill O'Reilly thinks is more relevant than the horrors of war David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 21 , 2007 Print This Email
This " Bill O'Reilly has resumed telling you what you can and cannot think and what you can and cannot watch , " Keith Olbermann stated on Wednesday .
" Angry at MSNBC as usual , " since Olbermann reported on his being thrown out of a baseball clubhouse for lack of credentials , O'Reilly has been attacking NBC for what he claims is excessive war coverage : " Dead Afghan kids killed in an American airstrike ?
NBC News is jazzed . " " [ O' Reilly ] also explained that he brings his listeners and viewers ' stuff that is new , stuff that is relevant to your life , ' Olbermann continued .
" We decided to give you a brief sample of the ' stuff ' Bill O ' and Fox Noise have recently decided are more relevant to your life than the horrors -- and realities -- of war . "
Olbermann than delivered a montage which interspersed soundbites of O'Reilly claiming a week ago that covering violence in Iraq shows us nothing new and only helps the terrorists with clips of his actual stories over the past week .
" Gold - medal Olympic swimmer ... undraped in Playboy ...
The increasing problems with bears ...
Who is blocking the Monkees from being in the Rock Hall of Fame ? ...
Having sex in your sleep .
Is that a legitimate defense against rape charges ? ... "
On a more serious note , Olbermann pointed out that " Bill O ' also got the Second World War wrong again " in his claim that President Roosevelt " set up the Office of War Information in 1942 , which censored , among other things , the results of enemy action and American casualty lists . "
The OWI , Olbermann explains , was actually responsible not for censorship , but for warning the public that " loose lips sink ships . "
Roosevelt himself deliberately lifted the ban on publishing photographs of dead American soldiers after determined that concealing the facts would keep Americans from realizing the seriousness of the war effort and thus harm morale .
Olbermann was joined by Arianna Huffington , who commented , " It 's actually the height of irrationality and hypocrisy and it's a new low at the same time .
...
He thinks that he 's supporting the troops by ignoring their deaths . "
She believes O'Reilly 's real problem is that if the American people know the war is not going well , they will be even more opposed to it .

One of the things i would really , really like to see some day is a working quantum computer .
Quantum mechanics is deep magic that nobody really understands , but we have learnt a lot about how to use it during the last century –including its application to some kinds of computation .
As you surely know , the most outstanding quantum algorithm is Shor ’s prime factorization , which allows factoring a number N with a time complexity .
That means that we go from exponential to polynomial time when going from classical to quantum for this particular problem ( and related ones : the Wikipedia article on QC gives a pretty good survey ; see also David Deutsch ’s introductory lectures ) .
I ’m stressing the last point because there ’s a widespread misconception that quantum computers will be able to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
Not so .
On the contrary , experts are almost sure by now that this wo n’t be the case ( note , by the way , that factoring is not NP - complete ) .
The most recent examples of such bogus claims are the reports on D - wave ’ demos of their ‘ quantum computer ’ , which are surrounded by piles of hype .
So please , before taking them at face value , see Scott Aaronson ’s The Orion Quantum Computer Anti-Hype FAQ ( more here here here ) .
Scott Aaronson is an expert in the field and the author of a PhD thesis under the title Limits on Efficient Computation in the Physical World ( for a less technical introduction to quantum computing , see his nice Quantum Computing Since Democritus lectures ) .
For an executive summary , here ’s the first entry in the FAQ :
Q : Thanks to D - Wave Systems — a startup company that ’s been in the news lately for its soon - to - be- unveiled “ Orion ” quantum computer — is humanity now on the verge of being able to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?
A : No .
We ’re also not on the verge of being able to build perpetual - motion machines or travel faster than light .
The old rule applies : no silver bullet .
But , of course , their limitations notwithstanding , quantum computers would ( will ? ) be an interesting challenge for us programmers , and we do not have to wait for the hardware to play with them : see this Brief survey of quantum programming languages , or a more in - depth description of how an imperative quantum programming language looks like , although , if you ask me , functional quantum languages like QML are nicer .
Simon Gay has also put together a comprehensive Bibliography of Quantum Programming Languages .
Finally , if you ’d rather write some code , there ’s André van Tonder ’s Scheme simulator ( which will work with any R5 RS scheme ) , and a QML simulator written in Haskell .
Haskellers will also enjoy Jerzy Karczmarczuk ’s Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics : a functional framework .
Happy quantum hacking !
That morning cuppa may not actually help get you going
University of Bristol researchers say the caffeine eases withdrawal symptoms which build up overnight , but does not make people more alert than normal .
The work , presented to the British Nutrition Foundation conference , showed only people who have avoided coffee for a while will get a buzz from caffeine .
But the British Coffee Association said regular drinkers did feel more alert .
That alertness you feel is you getting back to normal
Professor Peter Rogers , Bristol University
Those who swear by their morning caffeine fix say it wakes them up , and if they missed out they would feel sluggish and unable to get on with their day .
But the Bristol researchers , who carried out a review of previous studies into the effects of caffeine , say all the drink does is counteract the mild caffeine withdrawal symptoms people are experiencing because they have gone without the stimulant overnight .
And those who drink a caffeinated drink first thing are no more alert than those who never consume one .
' Back to normal '
Professor Peter Rogers , a biological psychologist who led the research , told the BBC : " We do feel a boost from caffeine in the morning , but that 's probably due to a reversal of the withdrawal symptoms .
" That alertness you feel is you getting back to normal , rather than to an above normal level .
" That morning boost is what people think is useful about caffeine , but if that does n't happen , maybe it 's not that useful after all . "
Professor Rogers said caffeine did have some benefits , such as preventing cognitive decline in the elderly .
But he said it was usually be best to opt for decaffeinated drinks - although the odd coffee could help .
" If you 're not a regular consumer , you might get something out of one or two drinks .
But once you 're a regular consumer , you 're in a cycle of withdrawal reversal . "
Zoe Wheeldon , of the British Coffee Association , said the research was interesting .
But she added : " There are two sides to the debate and a wealth of scientific evidence suggests that moderate coffee consumption of four to five cups per day is perfectly safe for the general population and does have a beneficial effect on alertness and performance even in regular coffee drinkers . "
A study ( PDF ) funded by Microsoft and carried out by Harvard Business School professor Alan MacCormack aims to determine what kind of features and protections developers want in version 3 of the widely - used General Public License ( GPL 3 ) .
The study , which uses extremely questionable methodology , concludes that open - source software developers do n't want the GPL 3 to impose extensive patent licensing requirements or prevent agreements like the controversial cross-licensing deal between Novell and Microsoft .
MacCormack claims that the ongoing debate about what the GPL 3 should attempt to cover has primarily revolved around major companies and project leaders and that individual open - source software developers have been " significantly under - represented in the discussion . "
A brief glance at the methodology behind the study reveals beyond doubt that it is little more than propaganda bought and paid for by Microsoft .
MacCormack describes the study as a survey of " key contributors " from major open - source projects .
Although 332 emails were sent to various developers , only 34 agreed to participate in the survey — an 11 percent response rate .
Of the 34 developers who responded , many of them are associated with projects like Apache and PostgreSQL that do n't even use the GPL .
Although MacCormack thinks that " 34 interviews were more than sufficient to conduct exploratory research to identify the predominant developer opinions on the most critical issues , " I 'm certainly not buying it .
I also question MacCormack 's claim that independent open - source software developers have been " under - represented " in the GPL 3 debate .
Far more than 34 people have actively participated in the GPL 3 draft editing and review process .
For the draft editing and review process , the Free Software Foundation assembled four separate committees that consist of major open - source developers , contributors , and stakeholders associated with a large number of projects and companies .
The FSF has also broadly encouraged members of the general public to comment and respond to various drafts .
The draft process is highly transparent and inclusive to an extent that makes MacCormack 's claims of under - representation seem difficult to accept given the small sample size of the study and the number of respondents who contribute to non-GPL projects .
[ erlang - questions ]
How do you define a function using the shell ?
It 's not possible - but it * should be possible *
When I was writing the Erlang book Dave Thomas asked be precisely this question " why ca n't you just type the module code into the shell " I gave my knee - jerk reaction - " because ... "
He countered , " but it must be easy - all you have to do is pipe all the shell output into a file and compile it .... "
He ( and Mike ) are right ( of course ) .
Module code and " what you can write in a shell " are different and it's been a pain in the arse explaining in the book , in the errata to the book and in this group * why * they are different .
Variable in the shell look pretty much like bound variables in parameterized modules .
It would n't be that difficult to let the shell and module code be interchangable .
There are some problems with this .
Supppose this was legal in the shell AND in a module > - module ( a ) . > X = foo:bar ( ... ) > foo( A , B ) -> > A+ B+X. > - end( module )
Then foo would have to be available when we compile bar and we would run into version nastyness .
A suitable compromise might be " everything you can type in a module can be typed into the shell " but NOT the other way around .
On the other hand , if we solved the version nastyness problem then doing shell like things in module would be great for writing efficient code AND we could throw away the parse transform stuff , doing it with regular functions .

Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Exhibit # 1 Why The Military Wants To Keep Our Boys Off YouTube :
From the front page of
today 's Washington Post ,
an article that illustrates the " tryanny of the political status quo " and the First Law of Legislative Thermodynamics : " Creating a government program is much , much easier than killing one . "
A Depression - era program to bring electricity to rural areas is using taxpayer money to provide billions of dollars in low - interest loans to build coal plants even as Congress seeks ways to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
The beneficiaries of the government 's largesse -- the nation 's rural electric cooperatives -- plan to spend $ 35 billion to build conventional coal plants over the next 10 years , enough to offset all state and federal efforts to reduce U.S .
greenhouse gas emissions over that time .
The money comes from the Agriculture Department 's Rural Utilities Service , an outgrowth of the Rural Electrification Administration created in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
to bring electricity to farms .
More than 70 years later , the goal of providing electricity to rural areas has long been accomplished , but the federal government is still making the subsidized loans .
But rather than declare the mission accomplished and disband the expensive subsidy program , Congress continued it and allowed it to become even more generous .
Although presidents over the years have tried to curtail the rural - electricity lending program , it has survived , proving one of the basic laws of legislative thermodynamics : Creating a government program is easier than killing one .
One possible solution :
All government programs like this one should have " sunset " clauses that end the program automatically after a fixed period of time .

Nurses to testify in post - Katrina deaths of four patients , sources say
• Two nurses , doctor charged with second - degree murder in case
• Doctor has not been involved with grand jury , attorney says
• New Orleans hospital staff accused of killing patients in chaos after storm

( CNN ) --
Two nurses accused in the post - Katrina deaths of four patients at New Orleans ' Memorial Medical Center have been offered immunity to testify before a special grand jury , sources close to the investigation tell CNN .
Sources also told CNN the grand jury has been told as many as nine patients may have died after being administered what Louisiana 's attorney general called a " lethal cocktail " of medications by hospital staff .
Family members said staffers used the drugs to kill patients so caregivers could flee appalling conditions inside the hospital after the storm .
Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Cheri Landry and Lori Budo were arrested in July 2006 after a 10 - month investigation .
Louisiana Attorney General Charles C. Foti charged them with second - degree murder .
Sources close to the investigation told CNN the two nurses are expected to testify before the grand jury in the next two weeks , which could signal a possible wrapping up of the case .
It could also signal the main target of the investigation is Pou , a physician who was under contract with Memorial Medical Center when Katrina struck .
Attorneys for Landry and Budo did not immediately return calls from CNN regarding their testimony .
Pou 's attorney , Rick Simmons , provided a statement saying Pou has had no role in the grand jury proceedings .
" We remain confident that once all the facts are known , all medical personnel will be exonerated of any criminal charges , " the statement continued .
" The fact that certain witnesses may or may not be talking to the grand jury does not change that fact . "
' Lethal cocktail ' administered
The investigation determined that the four patients -- ages 63 , 68 , 91 and 93 -- were given a " lethal cocktail " of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , both central nervous system depressants , Foti said .
None of the patients had been prescribed the drugs by their caregivers and none of the accused treated the four before the injections , Foti said .
" This was not euthanasia , " Foti said at a news conference last summer .
" This was homicide . "
Pou , Landry and Budo have denied the charges , and their attorneys have said they acted heroically , staying to treat patients rather than evacuating .
The case has languished since .
Foti said he turned his findings over to Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan , who by law must either file charges or reject the case .
Instead , Jordan impaneled a grand jury , and has vowed to let it decide what charges , if any , should be sought .
Jordan also directed New Orleans Coroner Frank Minyard to hire outside forensic experts to review the case .
But sources close to the investigation say the case has moved very slowly .
And one of the forensic experts in the case told CNN he has yet to testify .
Dr. Michael Baden , the former chief medical examiner for New York City , said Minyard hired him to review the deaths .
Baden said he has not been asked to appear before the the grand jury .
Minyard has testified in the case .
So have two investigators for the Louisiana attorney general 's office .
CNN has learned a third nurse , not charged in the investigation , has also testified , saying she accompanied Pou on the seventh floor of the hospital to make sure all the patients left behind were deceased .
Dalton Savwoir , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office , said the slow movement of the case is intentional .
" It 's definitely still in the investigatory phase , " Savwoir told CNN .
He would not confirm the witness list and refused to speculate on whether the two accused nurses have been offered immunity if they testify .
Allegations surface months after storm
CNN first reported the allegations of euthanasia months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast and flooded New Orleans .
Dr. Bryant King , a contract physician at the hospital , told CNN in 2005 , shortly after the hospital was evacuated , that he was approached by a doctor who told him a hospital administrator had suggested euthanizing patients to put them " out of their misery . "
King said he objected , but a third doctor agreed to do it .
King said he later saw Pou with a handful of syringes , but he did not witness any wrongdoing .
Sources have told CNN that the killings were allegedly carried out to hasten evacuation as medical equipment failed , temperatures soared , food dwindled and looters converged on nearby buildings .
Craig Nelson , a New Orleans lawyer who is convinced his mother was killed by a lethal dose of morphine , has taken steps to file a civil lawsuit .
Nelson had an autopsy performed on the body of his mother , Elaine Nelson .
The 90 - year - old Jefferson Parish resident died inside Memorial Medical Center during the aftermath of the hurricane .
Nelson said her death is not part of the murder investigation because his mother was elderly , frail and sick .
She was a patient of LifeCare , a long - term care facility run inside Memorial Medical Center 's seventh floor .
Nelson said his sister was helping to care for his mother during Katrina , but was asked to leave .
It was after his sister was evacuated that he was told his mother had died .
Test results conducted by a private lab hired by the lawyer indicate high levels of morphine in Elaine Nelson 's liver , muscle tissue and brain , Nelson said .
He said his mother should have had no morphine in her system , since none had been prescribed to her in the week and a half before she died .
Nelson said his mother was killed to hasten the medical staff 's evacuation of the flooded hospital .
He said he started taking the steps to file his own lawsuit with the " intent to find the murderer " of his mother .
LifeCare has repeatedly declined to be interviewed by CNN , citing the ongoing investigation .
But it issued a statement saying its employees acted heroically under difficult conditions .
LifeCare said it has cooperated with the investigation .
CNN 's Drew Griffin , Kathleen Johnston , Susan Roesgen , Belinda Hernandez and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report .

The Australians have also been patrolling northern Gulf waters
The incident took place before Iran successfully seized 15 British sailors and Marines in March .
The lessons from the earlier attempt do not appear to have been applied in time by British maritime patrols .
The 15 Britons were searching a cargo boat in the Gulf when they were captured over a boundary dispute .
' Having none of it '
When Iranian Revolutionary Guards captured the British sailors and Royal Marines in March , it was not exactly their first attempt .
It turns out that Iranian forces made an earlier concerted attempt to seize a boarding party from the Royal Australian Navy .
The Australians , though , to quote one military source , " were having none of it " .
The British personnel were eventually released
The BBC has been told the Australians re-boarded the vessel they had just searched , aimed their machine guns at the approaching Iranians and warned them to back off , using what was said to be " highly colourful language " .
The Iranians withdrew , and the Australians were reportedly lifted off the ship by one of their own helicopters .
The circumstances for the Britons in March were slightly different in that they were caught so much by surprise that , had they attempted to repel the Iranians with their limited firepower , they would doubtless have taken very heavy casualties .
But military sources say that what is of concern is that the Royal Navy did not appear to have taken sufficient account of the lessons of the Australian encounter .
In an oblique reference to the threat from Iran , Britain 's First Sea Lord , Admiral Sir Jonathon Band , has recently admitted there was a need for greater strategic awareness in the northern Gulf .
Business Lessons Learned
On the Golf Course
As what most people know , golf is a favorite hobby of many .
There are so many great things that one can accomplished on the golf course .
Not it is relatively tension free but there are also several lessons you can learn from it , especially for those businesspersons who [ … ]
Brian Fortinberry , who runs Front Range Barbecue in Colorado Springs , Colo. , is feeling the brunt of a spike in prices .
Beef costs about 10 percent more than it did in January , he says .
Fruit and lettuce are also pricier .
Gasoline has gone up , adding to costs when his restaurant does a catering job .
And Colorado voters just raised the minimum wage – pushing up his payroll tab .
" We have n't increased our prices , but we 're looking to do that , " Mr. Fortinberry says .
" Eventually you have to pass it along . "
The economy may be a bit cooler than it was a year ago , but inflation is still running hot .
It 's not like the runaway price train of the ' 70s , but it 's enough so that people notice at the grocery checkout , when they pay for day care , or when they buy college textbooks .
Some prices – namely for housing , food , and medical care – have been more noticeable than others of late , jumping at a 6 percent annual rate during the three - month period from December through February , the government reported Friday .
Retail gasoline prices rose 7 percent in just two weeks , according to a March 12 report by the US Energy Information Administration .
Of course , not everything is getting more expensive .
The core rate of inflation – prices of all goods and services minus volatile food and energy – has been edging up , not soaring , for the past three months .
Still , at a 2.6 percent annual rate , inflation is hotter than Federal Reserve officials would like .
Economists are divided over what happens next .
Some say inflation is bound to taper off – though maybe not for some months – as the ripple effects of a housing - market downturn cool the economy .
Others say that rising prices will persist and that the economy , instead of cooling off , will run close to its speed limit .
" You 're going to see continued [ inflationary ] pressure , " predicts Michael Darda , chief economist at MKM Partners , an investment firm in Greenwich , Conn .
" Firms will find the pricing power [ to pass along increased costs ] .
I think it is a broad - based issue . "
Doug Stoddard , who works at a computer job in Boston , does n't need government reports to tell him about rising prices .
He 's seen them in numerous bills over the past year .
" Rent went up .
Cable went up .
My gym membership went up , " he says .
His subway pass rose from $ 44 to $ 59 a month .
And he 's noticed higher prices for gasoline and groceries .
Mr. Stoddard figures that all this has outstripped the change in his income .
Higher health - insurance costs alone ate up most of his last raise , he says .
Wage gains of Fall 2006 dissipate
Millions Americans face a similar touch - and - go battle to keep up with rising prices .
In the past two months , average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms ( adjusted for inflation ) .
That marks a reversal from last fall when , thanks to a dip in energy prices , real incomes were enjoying sturdy gains .
Consumers are being buffeted from several directions .
The resurgence of inflation comes even as homeowners face a dip in property values and as the stock market has sagged from a recent peak .
All this dragged consumer confidence down a notch in an index released Friday by the University of Michigan .
Hopes dim for an interest - rate cut
These economic crosswinds also pose a challenge for Federal Reserve policymakers .
At a meeting Tuesday and Wednesday , they will weigh the risks to the economy – whether the threat of inflation is greater than the opposing forces that could cause an economic slowdown .
Many investors have been anticipating that the Fed will cut its short - term interest rate later this spring .
That would help ensure that the housing downturn does n't push the nation into a recession .
To pave the way for such a move , the Fed could first announce a " neutral " policy stance , rather than its current inflation - fighting bias toward raising interest rates .
But the latest news on consumer prices is dimming hopes for both the tonal shift and a subsequent interest - rate cut .
Not everyone has given up on the possibility of some easing by the Fed .
But it now looks less imminent .
" The Fed will be on hold for the balance of this year , " predicts Carl Tannenbaum , chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago .
He says surveys of wholesale and retail prices " are suggesting that inflation is not entirely under control . "
In fact , the Labor Department 's consumer price index on Friday showed price momentum in a wide range of goods .
Food , clothing , shelter , medical care , energy , and airline tickets all posted sizable gains in February .
Some of the recent price changes may represent one - time shocks .
Beef prices are reacting , in part , to a devastating storm that buried cattle country in snow .
The higher costs for fresh vegetables and fruits such as oranges can be attributed in part to bad weather .
Oil and gasoline prices have gone up and down based on forecasts for demand , production quotas set by OPEC nations , and glitches at refineries .
But if the Fed does n't need to worry about any one price , it does have the task of watching the overall price level .
A loose monetary policy can allow a broader cycle of price hikes in the economy , damaging consumer and investor confidence .
Such a spiral , once started , can be hard to stop .
The Fed wants " to maintain a healthy investment environment where investors are not seeing their ... returns eaten by rising prices , " says Mr. Tannenbaum .
That stability helps businesses create jobs and boost productivity , allowing workers ' real income to rise .
Some economists say a cooling economy will help to tame inflation .
Prices have been falling , in fact , for cars , computer equipment , and other categories that respond to cyclical swings by consumers .
Other analysts are skeptical that the economy is slowing down .
Mr. Darda expects both output and inflation to show surprising strength .
" I think we 're going to end the year with core inflation much closer to 3 than to 2.5 " percent , compared with 12 months before , Darda says .
The Fed may not act soon , but " the next move is probably a tightening . "
Carnegie Mellon researchers have launched a new service that will not only protect e-mail addresses on the web from spambots , but also help digitize a backlog of old books , magazines , and newspapers so that they can eventually be computer searchable .
The service , called reCAPTCHA , hopes to use the eyeballs of millions of Internet users to identify thousands of words for the Internet Archive .
The service repurposes technology from Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart ( CAPTCHA ) — a human - filtering method originally developed by Carnegie Mellon for Yahoo to prevent computers from registering bogus e-mail accounts .
It 's something we 're all familiar with : any given site ( such as Yahoo , Hotmail , PayPal , Joost , etc. ) may present you with a box containing an image of distorted letters or words .
You then have to type the letters accurately into a text box in order to proceed .
reCAPTCHA works the same way , except that it presents two words — one that the computer knows ( a CAPTCHA ) , and one that it does n't ( text that has stumped an optical character recognition — OCR — scanner for whatever reason ) .
By using two CAPTCHAs together , the system is able to identify first that the user is human , and gain greater confidence that what the user entered for the OCR word is correct .
If enough users solve the same OCR - generated word the same way , the system can then deduce that those people know what they 're talking about and digitize that word .
The Carnegie Mellon team , headed up by computer science professor Luis von Ahn , hopes to replace as many traditional CAPTCHAs with reCAPTCHAs as possible in order to harness the " work " already being done by the public on the Internet every day .
" It is estimated that 60 million or more CAPTCHAs are solved each day , with each test taking about 10 seconds , " director of the Internet Archive , Brewster Kahle , said in a statement .
" That 's more than 150,000 precious hours of human work that are lost each day , but that we can put to good use with reCAPTCHAs .
But the reCAPTCHA team wants to make sure that the public can get some use out of the digitization efforts too .
That 's why they 're offering the reCAPTCHA Mailhide , a service that hides a user 's full e-mail address on any web page until a CAPTCHA has been solved .
" Many sites display e-mails like bmaurer [ at ] foo [ dot ] com or use hacks with tables , javascript or encodings to get the same effect " wrote Ben Maurer , an undergraduate student on the project , on his personal blog .
" Spammers are getting smarter and figuring out these tricks . "
As a solution to stay ahead of spammers , a user can employ reCAPTCHA Mailhide to present an e-mail address like this : jac...@arstechnica.com .
Someone looking for my e-mail address would then have to click on the " ... " and enter a CAPTCHA to prove that he or she is human before getting the full address .
And of course , the user trying to access my address is actually entering two CAPTCHAs and helping digitize words for the Internet Archive in the process .
" This is an example of why having open collections in the public domain is important , " Kahle said .
" People are working together to build a good , open system . "
The reCAPTCHA project is being run by Carnegie Mellon with the help of server hardware donated by Intel and Suse Linux Enterprise Server support subscriptions donated by Novell .

Introduction
After a few scheming years , i had come to view objects as little more than poor - man closures .
Rolling a simple ( or not so simple ) object system in scheme is almost a textbook exercise .
Once you ’ve got statically scoped , first - order procedures , you do n’t need no built - in objects .
That said , it is not that object - oriented programming is not useful ; at least in my case , i find myself often implementing applications in terms of a collection of procedures acting on requisite data structures .
But , if we restrict ourselves to single - dispatch object oriented languages , i saw little reason to use any of them instead of my beloved Scheme .
Things started to change recently due to my discovering the pleasures of Smalltalk .
First and foremost , it offers a truly empowering integrated ambient to live and develop in .
Second , if you ’re going to use objects , using the simplest , cleanest syntax will not hurt .
Add to that some reading on the beautiful design principles underlying Smalltalk , and one begins to wonder if closures are n’t , in fact , poor - man objects–or at least i do , whenever i fall in an object - oriented mood ( i guess i’m yet not ready to reach satori ) .
But Scheme is not precisely an ugly or bad designed language , so i needed some other reason to switch language gears for my OO programming .
I knew there ’s more than encapsulation or subtype polymorphism in object - land from my readings on CLOS ( the Common Lisp Object System ) , or on Haskell ’s type classes ( and its built - in parametric polymorphism ) , but i was after something retaining Smalltalk ’s elegance .
And then i remembered that , when i was a regular lurker in the Tunes project ‘s mailing lists and IRC channel , a couple of smart guys were implementing an OO language whose syntax was smalltalkish .
That language ( which , if memory servers , started life with the fun name who me ? ) has evolved during the last few years into a quite usable programming environment named Slate , started by Lee Salzman and currently developed and maintained by Brian Rice .
I ’ve been reading about Slate during the last few days , and decided to learn it .
What motivated me was discovering how Slate goes beyond mainstream object - oriented programming by incorporating well - known ( but hardly used ) and really powerful paradigms .
In short , Slate improves Smalltalk ’s single - dispatch model by introducing and combining two apparently incompatible technologies : multiple dispatch and prototype - based programming .
To understand the whys and hows of Slate , there ’s hardly a better way than reading Lee Salzman ’s Prototypes with Multiple Dispatch .
The following discussion is , basically , an elaboration of Lee ’s explanation on the limitations of mainstream OO languages , and how to avoid them with the aid of PMD .
( Note : click on the diagrams to enlarge them , or , if you prefer , grab a PDF of the whole set . )
Fishes and sharks
Let ’s start by showing why on earth would you need anything beyond Smalltalk ’s object system ( or any of its modern copycats ) .
Consider a simple oceanographic ecosystem analyser , which deals with ( aquatic ) Animals , Fishes and Sharks .
These are excellent candidates for class definitions , related by inheritance .
Moreover , we are after modeling those beasts ’ behaviours and , in particular , their reactions when they encounter each other : each time a Shark meets a Fish of other species , the Shark will swallow the other Fish , while when a Shark meets
Shark they will fight .
As a result of such fighting , Sharks get unhealthy , which regrettably complicates matters : wound sharks wo n’t try to eat other fishes , and will swim away other sharks instead of fighting them .
The image on the left provides a sketchy representation of the code we need to model our zoo .
Waters are quickly getting muddled implementation - wise .
On the one hand , subtype polymorphism based just on the object receiving the encounter message : we need , in addition , to take into account the argument ’s concrete type to implement the desired behaviour .
This is a well - known issue in single - dispatch languages , whose cure is , of course , going to multiple dispatching ( see below ) .
In particular , we want to avoid the need to modify existing classes whenever our hierarchy is extended .
On the second hand , varying state ( exemplified here by the Shark ’s isHealthy instance variable complicates the implementation logic .
As we will see , prototype - based languages offer a way to factor out this additional complexity .
Beyond single - dispatch
The need to adjust behaviour on the basis of the type of both a message receiver and its arguments arises frequently in practice .
So frequently , that a standard way of dealing with it has been christened as the Visitor design pattern .
The technique , also known as double - dispatch , is well known : you can see , for instance , how it ’s applied to arithmetic expressions in Smalltalk , or read about a generic implementation of multimethods in Python ( which also includes a basically language - independent discussion on the issues at hand ) .
If you happen to be a C++ programmer , you may be tempted to think that global functions and overloading solve the problem in that language .
Well , think twice : a proper implementation of multiple dispatch in C++ needs of RTTI and templates , as shown in this article .
CLOS and Dylan are two examples of languages solving the issue from the onset by including support for multi-methods .
The idea is to separate methods from classes ( which only contain data slots ) .
As shown in the pseudo - code of the accompanying figure , methods are defined as independent functions with the same name , but differing in their arguments ’ types ( in CLOS , a set of such methods is called a generic function ) .
When a generic function is called , the system selects the actual method to be invoked using the types of all the arguments used in the invocation .
The encounter generic function in our running example provides a typical example , as shown in the figure on the right .
The benefits of having multi-methods at our disposal are apparent : the code is simpler and , notably , adding new behaviours and classes to the system does not need modifications of existing code .
For instance , we can introduce a Piranha , which eats unhealthy sharks instead of swimming away from them , by defining the requisite class and methods , without any modification whatsoever to the already defined ones .
On the downside , we have still to deal with the complications associated with internal state .
Enter the magic world of prototype - based systems .
The ultimate dynamic
If you like dynamic languages , chances are you ’ll find prototype - based system an almost perfect development environment .
Prototype - based languages emerged as an evolution of Smalltalk with the invention of Self by David Ungar and Randall B. Smith during the late eighties .
The key idea behind Self is noticing that , most of the time , class definitions needlessly coerce and complicate your object model .
A class definition becomes a contract to be satisfied by any instance , and it is all too easy to miss future or particular needs of your objects ( class - based inheritance is just a partial solution to this problem , as shown , for instance , by the so - called fragile base class problem ) .
But , if you look around you , objects change in internal behaviour and data content continously , and our attempts at distilling their Platonic nature are often in vain .
In prototype - based programming , instead of providing a plan for constructing objects , you simply clone existing instances and modify their behaviour by directly changing the new instance ’s slots ( which provide uniform access to methods and state ) .
New clones contain a pointer to their parent , from which they inherit non-modified slots : there is no way to access state other than via messages sent to instances , which simplifies tackling with state .
Class - based languages oblige you to keep two relationships in mind to characterize object instances : the “ is - a ” relationship of the object with its class , and the “ kind - of ” relationship of that class with its parent .
In self , inheritance ( or behaviour delegation ) is the only one needed .
As you can see , Self is all about making working with objects as simple as possible .
No wonder Ungar and Smith ’s seminal paper was titled Self : The Power of Simplicity .
Needless to say , a must read .
The figure on the left shows how our running example would look in selfish pseudo - code .
As promised , state is no longer surfacing in our method implementation ’s logic .
Unfortunately , we have lost the benefits of multi-methods in the process .
But fear not , for , as we will see , you can eat your cake and have it too .
Instead of pseudo - code , you can use Self itself , provided you are the happy owner of a Mac or a Sun workstation .
Or you can spend 20 fun minutes seeing the Self video , which features the graphical environment accompanying the system .
Like Smalltalk ,
Self provides you with a computing environment where objects are created , by cloning , and interact with you .
The system is as organic and incremental as one can possibly get .
Of course , you ’re not limited to Self .
For instance , Ken Dickey fleshed up Norman Adams ’ saying that objects are poor man closure ’s by offering a prototype - based object system in Scheme , and , more recently , Neil Van Dyke has released Protobj .
And you have probably already used a very popular language in the family : Javascript .
The list goes on , albeit , unfortunately , many of these languages lack either Self ’s nice integrated environment , or a portable , up - to - date implementation .
Slate to the rescue .
The best of both worlds
Prototyping and multiple dispatch are , at first sight , at odds .
After all , method dispatching based on arguments ’ type needs , well , a type for each argument , does n’t it ?
As it happens , Lee Salzman and Brian Rice have envisioned a way of combining the power of both paradigms into Slate .
In fact , proving how this is possible is the crux of Lee ’s article .
In addition , Slate aims at providing a complete development environment in the vein of Smalltalk or Self .
Too good to be true ?
In future installments of this blog category , we ’ll see how and why it ’s true , but , if you cannot wait , just run -not - walk to Slate ’s site .
You ’ll have a great time .

" Let me not get into any nominee , but Gonzales is an excellent human being , " Mr. Hatch said .
" He 's done an exceptional job as White House counsel .
He 's brought additional stability and peace to the Justice Department .
I know the president is interested in trying to find people of diversity -- he 's really bent over to do that as president . "
Mr. Gonzales is a longtime Bush aide and friend from Texas , and naming him could enhance the Republican Party 's standing among Hispanics , one of the president 's longtime political goals .
Some conservatives acknowledged that they had stated their opposition to him with some delicacy to avoid provoking the White House , given Mr. Gonzales 's friendship with the president .
But the swift and vociferous opposition to Mr. Gonzales reflected the intensity of concern on the right over just what kind of conservative Mr. Bush will choose , as he moves toward a decision that will go a long way toward settling any question about what kind of conservative he is , and how his presidency will be remembered .
Mr. Weyrich , while declining to disclose the specifics of a recent conversation with Ken Mehlman , the Republican Party chairman , said : " We have let the administration know through whatever channels we have that Gonzales would be an unwise appointment because of the opposition of some of the groups , " some of which he said would actively oppose Mr. Gonzales , while " others like the Southern Baptists and myself would simply not help . "
For many conservatives , who have seen Republican presidents nominate justices like Ms. O'Connor who then vote against them on pivotal issues , Mr. Gonzales epitomizes the fear of the unknown .
But in other ways , and to some Democrats , he is very well known , confirmed by a vote of 60 - to - 36 , along largely partisan lines , after unexpectedly contentious hearings and debate in which Democrats challenged his policies on the detention and treatment of prisoners in the administration 's campaign against terror .
In a 2002 legal memorandum , Mr. Gonzales characterized as " obsolete " the Geneva Conventions ' limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners , and he said provisions in the conventions like commissary privileges and athletic uniforms were " quaint . "
" He would face stiff opposition from liberal groups , " said Nan Aron , president of the liberal legal group Alliance for Justice .
" He would have to answer tough questions about his role in the administration 's war on terror . "
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York and a member of the Judiciary Committee , declined to say on Saturday how Senate Democrats might respond to a Gonzales nomination .
" It 's too early to tell -- we 're not talking about any specific judge , " Mr. Schumer said .
· Feeling good 'is cause , not effect , of achievement ' ·
Same principle applies to nations , academics claim
The recipe for success : get happy and you will get ahead in life
Happiness , rather than working hard , is the key to success , according to research published today .
Cheerful people are more likely to try new things and challenge themselves , which reinforces positive emotion and leads to success in work , good relationships and strong health , say psychologists .
The findings suggest that happiness is not a " feelgood " luxury , but is essential to people 's wellbeing .
What is more , happiness can also extend across an entire nation , with people in " happy " nations being more likely to have pro-democratic attitudes and a keenness to help others .
The link between happiness and success was investigated by a team from the University of California Riverside , led by Professor Sonja Lyubomirsky .
First , they analysed questionnaires that ask people about multiple aspects of their lives .
" For example , they show that happy people tend to earn higher incomes , " said Prof Lyubomirsky .
Having established the link , they wanted to discover the cause .
" Almost always it has been assumed that things that correlate with happiness are the causes of happiness , but it could be just the opposite - that those things tend to be caused by happiness , " said Professor Ed Diener from the University of Illinois , another author on the paper .
Other studies revealed that having a sunny outlook on life appeared to precede good fortune .
" There was strong evidence that happiness leads people to be more sociable and more generous , more productive at work , to make more money , and to have stronger immune systems , " said Prof Lyubomirsky .
Meanwhile , experimental studies showed that an instant injection of high - spirits could generate success .
" Inducing a happy effect leads people to make more money in a computer simulation . "
The research shows that while success can put a spring in someone 's step , people need happiness in the first place to achieve success .
According to the study , around four out of five people in modern industrialised nations are happy at any one time .
Success was not just about earning lots of money .
" We define success as obtaining the things that culture or society values , whether it be friends , close family , money and income , or longevity , " said Prof Diener .
However , sorrowful people are not condemned to a life of failure .
" Our work suggests that sad people should try to increase the frequency of positive emotions in their lives by doing things that make them feel happy , even temporarily , " said Prof Lyubomirsky , whose research is published in the Psychological Bulletin today .
But there is a caveat : your happiness boosters should not be dangerous , like driving fast , or counter - productive , like eating lots of chocolate .
If you can raise your spirits , the benefits can be manifold .
" Happy people are more likeable and more sociable .
They are also better able to cope with stress and likely to be healthier and live longer . "
Nor is happiness just an individual pursuit .
Happy nations , full of happy people , are more likely to be successful than unhappy nations .
" People in happy nations trust others more and want to cooperate with their neighbours , " said Prof Diener .
Governments could keep a smile on their citizens ' faces by ensuring safety and stability .
" Although nations cannot live people 's lives and force them to be happy , they can create conditions - for example , parks , reasonable weekly work hours , a health infrastructure , and good transportation - that influence people 's happiness , " he added .
For governments and individuals alike , it seems , happiness is more than just a hedonistic pleasure .

My friend Solveig Haugland ( aka OpenOffice blog goddess ) and I both did a stint in Sun 's course development group , and were looking for ways to raise the quality without pissing off the entire department .
So , with our manager 's blessing , we created The Checklist .
The Sun courseware already had elaborate " style guides " and strict technical requirements , but we did n't seem to be asking the simple questions that could make all the difference .
If the course was technically correct , properly formatted , grammatically correct , satified the localization police , and all the deliverables were in the proper file formats and directory structure -- then it was ready for beta .
The Checklist we made included all the other , less technical but equally ( or more ) important attributes like , " Does it manage cognitive overload ? "
" Do the exercises reinforce the key points ? "
" Does each chapter include a 'if you remember only one thing from this module ...' at the end ? "
" Does it include opportunities to learn from mistakes ? "
" Does it include redundancy to support memory ? "
" Does it include exercises to support the higher levels of Bloom 's Taxonomy ? " and on it went .
No big deal ... just making sure the bases were covered .
But when we presented it to some key players in course development , one of the upper managers said , nice idea , but we do n't need all of these .
We nearly fell out of our chairs to see that he crossed out the simple question :
Is it interesting ?
He said , " Whether the content is ' interesting ' is completely irrelevant .
If we get the topics right , and it 's technically accurate , the content will be inherently interesting to programmers . "
And the word " interesting " does n't even set the bar very high - - it 's the word we use when we can't think of anything complimentary to say .
" He is...well...interesting " or " Hmmm ... interesting perspective . "
The words we actually wanted to use in the checklist were compelling and engaging , but we thought interesting would be an easier sell .
But even if he'd left " Is it interesting ? " in , I now realize that many people would automatically check it off without really stopping to consider whether something really is interesting .
Or that people would assume that given a certain context , " interesting " is irrelevant .
Think about it .
Even if your actual product is interesting ( but still , stop and ask yourself if that is really true ) , do you have docs , FAQs , specs , articles , learning / support blogs , etc. that are NOT interesting ?
Should they be ?
Obviously my opinion is YES YES YES .
Because regardless of what the product is , whether it has passionate users may depend almost entirely on how quickly users can get past the Suck Threshold and the Passion Threshold .
You may have a product that does n't require a manual or support docs , but for most complex and sophisticated activities , docs or articles or books are needed as the user starts to explore more advanced uses .
And it 's those more advanced uses that lead to improving skills and knowledge and meeting challenges -- the whole " kick ass " thing that is a prereq for truly passionate users .
[ We believe that nobody is passionate about something they suck at . ]
Why does " interesting " matter in getting past the suck / passion thresholds ?
Is n't " technically accurate " or " high quality " enough ?
Well , how many technically accurate , high quality documents or training courses have you been exposed to that you dearly wished were a little better at holding your attention ?
The simple answer is :
The brain pays attention to -- and remembers -- that which it feels .
We 've talked about this before ... even if the reader / learner wants to pay attention and is interested in the topic , if the content itself is not offered in a reasonably interesting and engaging way , the brain keeps looking for something that will matter .
Taking the time and care to make something interesting is simply being brain - friendly .
Your users wo n't learn and get better at whatever it is they 're passionate about ( or that you 're hoping to help them become passionate about ) unless their brains pay attention .
And brains pay attention to what brains care about , not necessarily what the conscious mind cares about .
And to the brain , " interesting " is just the most basic prereq .
The entry fee .
So , how do you make things interesting ?
If you were a brain , and you 'd been evolving for a very , very long time ... what would you find interesting ?
* Surprise , novelty , the unexpected
* Beauty
* Stories
* Conversation
* Emotionally touching ( the whole kids and puppies thing )
* Counterintuitive failures or mistakes
* Fun , playfulness , humor
* Varying visuals
* Faces of people , especially with strong expressions
* Sounds , music
* Shock , creepy things
and of course ...
* Sexiness
One fairly straightforward way to make documentation / training / articles interesting is to crank up four sliders Conversation , Variety , Visuals , and Story .
I 've talked before about conversational writing , and visuals , so in a post very soon I 'll look at story and variety .
If you 're really interested in story , you might want to look at Robert McKee 's Story ( if you saw the movie Adaptation , you 'll recognize it ) .
And if you have n't read Dan Pink 's book , A Whole New Mind , there 's some good story stuff in there ( as well as a lot of other good things - - I loved this book ) .
And for variety , well , just do it in whatever way makes sense .
It 's a lot more powerful than many people believe , because it's what your brain is tuned for .
When the brain sees what it expects , it knows it can happily leave that thing behind and start hunting for something else to pay attention to .
So , when you 're making that checklist for your product , blog , article , book , documentation , training courseware , podcast -- do n't forget to include , " yes , it 's all these wonderful things , but is it interesting ? "
[ Yes of course there 's the big disclaimer that what is " interesting " to one is not interesting to another , but I assume we 're all factoring that in : ) ]

Yesterday I convinced a co-worker to pick up a copy of Eric and Beth 's Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML book .
He showed me the CSS book he was currently reading ; it was technically correct , properly formatted , and boring .
Thank goodness for The Checklist ! :)

Kathy , have you seen or heard of " Why 's ( poignant ) Guide to Ruby " ( at http://poignantguide.net/ruby/ ) ?
This is quite possibly the ultimate example of technical writing 's ability to be ' interesting ' .
And communicitave at the same time .
Sure , it 's not for everyone , but it 's quickly become a staple of the Ruby community , something we can point to and say " yeah , but does your language have THAT ? "

Thanks for the great post - i've referenced it in my blog ( http://tynerblain.wordpress.com/2005/12/14/getting-past-the-suck-threshold/).
In consumer apps , if you can't clear the suck - threshold quickly , you wo n't have a good viral marketing effect .
In enterprise applications , you wo n't get the user adoption needed to drive ROI .
Love your chart too !

with regards to the comment about " Why 's Poignant Guide To Ruby " ... yes its a fun read , but its also probably the most inefficient guide for learning a programming language i know of .
read it if you want to laugh , but do n't read it if you really want to learn Ruby .
try PLEAC instead .

its not often i think you havent gone far enough .
but surely the question - was it fun ?
is in some regards the most important .
my favourite compliment from a client at the end of an engagement is " that was fun " ...
invariably that means two things
1. I had fun too .
2. Repeat business

Mmmm .
This post was as tasty as the post lunch chocolate truffle .
Somewhat longer to chew through though .
I think I shall have to eat more truffles .
It seems to me that adding variety is particularly good as it increases the chance that a broader audience will find something interesting .
I 've been using visuals and easter eggs in docs , but I think I will add a slider for incorporating multiple levels of Blooms taxonomy in docs - should help my users move to the more advanced levels more quickly .

I used to work with Solveig in her pre-Sun days , and I 'm not the least surprised that she was in on something like The Checklist .
Your post reminded me of an episode from The Phil Silvers Show , in which Sgt. Bilco and crew were tapped by the brass to appear in a training film .
The script as given to them was like most other Army training films : dry as dust and boring as hell .
Of course , Bilco changed it into a music , comedy , and dance extravaganza .
When the officer in charge saw the results , he was incensed -- until he discovered that his wife loved it and actually learned something .
So the idea is at least as old as the Phil Silvers Show , and people STILL do n't get it .

A bit of googling revealed that it was episode 36 : Platoon In The Movies .
Oh , and it 's Bilko with a K , not Bilco with a C .

For different reasons you have paralleled and identified what makes everything in the end user universe suck .
Imagine creativity , user experience ( at all levels ) , real communication of ideas , and entertaining ?
If you are a customer ( user ) , that means anybody that interacts with or uses , the importants of the experience needs to really , really be understood .
If you venture into the realm of learning dynamics , you will find that presentation is everything in understanding , absorbing , and using content .
In business , its the quality of communication and the quantitative experience of the user makes or breaks any iniative or sale .
I hate technichal writing because in most cases it sits in the suck zone .
Yes I read , but it is not on my top 10,000 list of best loved books .
Thank you for lifting its head into the light .
This is a perception that businesses in general could use in customer management .

We 've built our product , MindManager , with exactly this view of the human mind ... in mind .
At its most fundamental , a MindManager " map " distills ideas , concepts and information to their essence so the user does n't have to slog through pages of text ( who has time for them , do we really remember anything after having read them ?.
We enable users to create very active , easily changed visual documents that delivers information in ways the brain likes to receive them : with chunked language and images and colors and spatial orientation .
People all around the world ( and we have more than 600,000 customers ) are starting to see the value of using nonlinear , visual documents like ours instead of the usual , plodding word documents and slide shows .
Why even Bill Gates commented on this kind of " mind mapping " in a column in Newsweek last week : “ … advanced software and Web services can help us trace , slice and dice thie information [ available to PC users ] in ways tha were impossible only a decade ago .
But while we ’ve gone a long way towards optimizing how we use information , we have n’t yet done the same for knowledge …
On another level , OneNote and a new generation of ‘ mind - mapping ’ software can also be used as a digital ‘ blank slate ’ to help connect and synthesize ideas and data — and ultimately create new knowledge . ”
And is n't that one of the biggest challenges these days : turning information into knowledge ?

Disadvantages
Only implemented in GHC - sorry to the poor Hugs users
Requires rank - 2 types , which means its not actually Haskell 98
Occassionally the rank - 2 - ness infects the code you write , with unfortunate error messages ( although this is not that common )
A data structure
Queries
Traversals
At the moment I 'm working on a boilerplate removal for Haskell , which is faster ( runtime ) , shorter ( code ) , more type safe and requires fewer extensions than Scrap Your Boilerplate ( SYB ) .
However , since I have n't finished and released a stable version , I can't really recommend people use that .
The reason I started working on this is because I was unaware of SYB when I started .
Last week I also introduced someone to SYB , who had done quite a bit of Haskell programming , but had not stumbled across SYB .
As a result , I think it needs a bit more attention - SYB is one of the strengths of Haskell !
Before saying how great SYB is , its important to point out the things that make it not so great :
Before showing some operations , I 'm going to first introduce a data structure on which we can imagine operations are performed .
I do n't like the example from the SYB benchmark - it feels like an XML file ( as is the stated intention ) , which means that the logic behind it is a bit disturbed .
So instead I 'll pick a data type like an imperative programming language : {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fglasgow - exts #- }import Data.Genericsdata Expr = Var String | Lit Int | Call String [ Expr ] deriving ( Data , Typeable ) data Stmt = While Expr [ Stmt ] | Assign String Expr | Sequence [ Stmt ] deriving ( Data , Typeable ) We define the data type as normal , adding deriving for Data and Typeable - the two key SYB types .
We also add an import and a flag , just to get the GHC machinery working for the derivings .
So lets imagine you have to get a list of all literals .
In SYB this is easy : extractLits :: Data a => a ->
[ Int ] extractLits = everything (++ ) ( [ ] `mkQ` f ) where f ( Lit x ) = [ x ] ; f _ = [ ]
Wow , easy !
This function will operate on anything which has a Data instance , so you can run it on an Expr , Stmt , [ Stmt ] , [ Either Stmt Expr ] - the choice is yours .
For the purposes of a short introduction , I 'd recommend treating all the bits except the " f " as just something you write - read the full SYB paper to get all the details of what everything can be used for .
Now lets negate all the literals , we have : negateLits :: Data a => a -> anegateLits = everywhere ( mkT f ) where f ( Lit x ) = Lit ( negate x ) ; f x = xAgain , its pretty easy .
And once again , consider all apart from the " f " as just something you write .
The gains in code reduction that can be made with SYB are quite substantial , and by removing the boilerplate you get code which can be reused more easily .
Boilerplate code is bad , and should be removed where necessary .
JERUSALEM , Jan. 26 - The Hamas landslide in Palestinian elections has stunned Israelis , but it may also have brought them a rare moment of clarity : with peace talks off the table , Israel will most likely pursue unilateral actions , drawing its own borders and separating itself from the Palestinians .
Ehud Olmert , the acting prime minister , made it clear after an emergency cabinet meeting that talks with Hamas , a Palestinian party sworn to Israel 's destruction , were out of the question , while experts said Israel was now freer to establish its future on its own .
They said Israel -- whose own elections in two months could be heavily influenced by the Palestinian results -- was likely to focus on speeding up construction of the separation barrier , which runs along and through parts of the West Bank .
After more than three years of building , it remains less than half finished , but Israeli officials say it has contributed enormously to the reduction of suicide bombings and other attacks .
Palestinians , on the other hand , say the barrier takes land they want for a future state .
" The differences between the sides are now much deeper , and the chances for negotiations are much more remote , " said Shlomo Avineri , a liberal political scientist at Hebrew University .
" The only realistic steps may be Israeli unilateral steps . "
Of course , there are important demographic differences between the two populations .
In 1937 , women represented 48 percent of residents in state mental hospitals .
In contrast , new prison admissions have consistently been 95 percent male .
Also , the mental health patients from the 1930s to the 1960s were older and whiter than prison inmates of the 1990s .
But the graph poses a number of troubling questions :
Why did we diagnose deviance in such radically different ways over the course of the 20th century ?
Do we need to be imprisoning at such high rates , or were we right , 50 years ago , to hospitalize instead ?
Why were so many women hospitalized ?
Why have they been replaced by young black men ?
Have both prisons and mental hospitals included large numbers of unnecessarily incarcerated individuals ?
Whatever the answers , the pendulum has swung too far — possibly off its hinges .
It would be naïve , today , to address any of these questions without also considering the impact of imprisonment on crime .
One of the most reliable studies estimates that the increased prison population over the 1990s accounted for about a third of the overall drop in crime that decade .
However , prisons are not the only institutions that seem to have this effect .
In a recent study , I demonstrated that the rate of institutionalization — including mental hospitals — was a far better predictor of serious violent crime from 1926 to 2000 than just prison populations .
The data reveal a robust negative relationship between overall institutionalization ( prisons and asylums ) and homicide .
Preliminary findings based on state - level panel data confirm these results .
The effect on crime may not depend on whether the institution is a mental hospital or a prison .
Even from a crime - fighting perspective , then , it is time to rethink our prison and mental health policies .
A lot more work must be done before proposing answers to those troubling questions .
But the first step is to realize that we have been wildly erratic in our approach to deviance , mental health and the prison .
In Part 1 I focused on the Lexer that tokenizes the character stream and produces a stream of tokens that our parser can operate on .
In this post I ’ll focus instead on building the parser that actually parses the language .
When using Antlr , the parser is defined similarly to the lexer and is often included in the same file .
Often , you ’ll see the parser defined first and the lexer defined last .
I prefer to do it the opposite way as the file then builds on already built constructs .
The parser definition consists of a set of rules .
Each rule specifies a non-terminal ( which must start with a lowercase letter ) and a set of tokens or other non-terminals that can replace the specified non-terminal symbol .
Each rule will be translated by Antlr into a method in the generated code .
Here ’s the most basic translation of the grammar described in Part 1 .
class ScriptParser extends Parser ; options { k=2 ; //
Need lookahead of two for // props without keys ( to check for the = ) buildAST=true ; //
Automatically build the AST while parsing } script : ( block ) * EOF ; block : ( STRING LBRACE ( command ) * RBRACE ) ; command : ( STRING ( property ) * SEMI ) ; property : ( ( STRING EQUALS ) ?
STRING ) ;
Similar to the Lexer , there is an options block .
In the lexer , a lookahead of one character was sufficient .
Here , k refers to the number of tokens used in the lookahead instead and we must use a lookahead of 2 because of the two kinds of properties .
Specifically , when we see the first string in the property rule , we need to look ahead an extra token to know whether we are seeing a=b or just a .
Let ’s generate the parser .
Once again we run java antlr .
Tool parser .g.
Because we have our lexer and parser both defined in the same file , we ’ll see the Lexer get regenerated and a new file ScriptParser .
java will be generated as well .
We can then write a dumb little test class to run the parser on a grammar file :
import java.io.BufferedReader ; import java.io.
FileReader ; import java.io.
Reader ; import antlr .CommonAST ; import antlr .
DumpASTVisitor ; public class TestParser { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws Exception { System.out.
println ( " Parsing : " + args [ 0 ] ) ; Reader reader = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( args [ 0 ] ) ) ; ScriptLexer lexer = new ScriptLexer ( reader ) ; ScriptParser parser = new ScriptParser ( lexer ) ; parser.script( ) ; CommonAST ast = ( CommonAST ) parser.getAST ( ) ; DumpASTVisitor visitor = new DumpASTVisitor ( ) ; visitor.visit( ast ) ; } }
I used the provided helper class DumpASTVisitor to dump the AST to the screen .
Notice that to do the parsing we call parser.script ( ) .
This indicates that the parser should begin executing the rules of the parser ( using the lexer provided in the constructor ) starting with the the script rule , which is our start rule .
Antlr considers a rule that does not get called by any other rule to be a start rule .
Let ’s run this test class on our test .
script file :
Parsing : src/test.script morning [ 4 ] { [ 7 ] wake_up [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] eat [ 4 ] bacon [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] wash [ 4 ] hair [ 4 ] = [ 9 ] true [ 4 ] minutes [ 4 ] = [ 9 ] 10 [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] } [ 8 ] evening [ 4 ] { [ 7 ] read [ 4 ] book [ 4 ] = [ 9 ]
" How To Be a Ninja " [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] sleep [ 4 ] hours [ 4 ] = [ 9 ] 8 [ 4 ] ; [ 10 ] } [ 8 ]
What we see here is an AST that is just a flat list of tokens .
So , while Antlr built the tree for us , it did n’t provide any useful structure .
To me , it seems like it would be useful for the default AST to insert a node as each rule is processed so the AST you got for free would mirror your grammar .
But , that is n’t the case .
So , on we go …
Antlr provides two built - in operators that allow you to indicate how the AST should be built within your parser .
The !
symbol indicates that the token being matched should not be included in the AST at all .
This is commonly used with punctuation tokens .
The ^ symbol indicates that in the current rule , the specified token should be used as a root with all other tokens beneath it .
This is very commonly used when parsing expression trees ( arithmetic with +,-,/ , * or logic with AND / OR , etc ) where we want to make the arithmetic operator the root .
Let ’s start by adding the !
marker to leave out our punctuation .
We ’ll change just these lines by adding ! to punctuation tokens :
script : ( block ) * EOF ! ; block : ( STRING LBRACE ! ( command ) * RBRACE ! ) ; command : ( STRING ( property ) * SEMI ! ) ; property : ( ( STRING EQUALS ! ) ?
STRING ) ;
Then we can regenerate our parser and re-run our test :
Parsing : src/test.script morning [ 4 ] wake_up [ 4 ] eat [ 4 ] bacon [ 4 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] wash [ 4 ] hair [ 4 ] true [ 4 ] minutes [ 4 ] 10 [ 4 ] evening [ 4 ] read [ 4 ] book [ 4 ]
" How To Be a Ninja " [ 4 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] sleep [ 4 ] hours [ 4 ] 8 [ 4 ]
Now we ’ve lost all the punctuation tokens !
Next up is to create a more tree - like structure .
What we really want is to create a tree where the root is the script itself and an internal node exists for each block , command , and property .
The ^ operator is useful when the token you want as a node in the tree actually exists in your parser rule .
But when it does n’t , you need to create an “ imaginary token ” and insert that as a root for your rule .
This is a common idiom in Antlr and involves some black magic that is explained a bit here .
Here is the modified parser with the additional code :
class ScriptParser extends Parser ; options { k=2 ; //
Need lookahead of two for props without keys ( to check for the = ) buildAST=true ; //
Automatically build the AST while parsing } tokens { SCRIPT ; // Imaginary token inserted at the root of the script BLOCK ; // Imaginary token inserted at the root of a block COMMAND ; // Imaginary token inserted at the root of a command PROPERTY ; // Imaginary token inserted at the root of a property } script : ( block ) * EOF !
{#script = #([ SCRIPT , " SCRIPT " ] , # script ) ; } ; block : ( STRING LBRACE ! ( command ) * RBRACE ! ) {#block = #([ BLOCK , " BLOCK " ] , # block ) ; } ; command : ( STRING ( property ) * SEMI ! ) {#command = #([ COMMAND , " COMMAND " ] , # command ) ; } ; property : ( ( STRING EQUALS ! ) ?
STRING ) {#property = #([ PROPERTY , " PROPERTY " ] , # property ) ; } ;
First , you ’ll see a new TOKENS block .
This block is usually used to declare string literal tokens as a shortcut in the parser .
In this case we declare the token without declaring a string for it ; this creates an imaginary token ( one that has no representation in the token stream coming from the lexer ) .
Then you ’ll see that each rule has a new block of magic code underneath it .
From what I gather , the #property ( in the last rule ) specifies the AST produced by the property rule we ’re in .
We are then redefining that rule with a new AST , specified using the # ( A , B , … ) notation which indicates that we should a node A with children B , … In this case , we construct a new node of type PROPERTY ( our imaginary token ) and add as children all of the tokens that were collected into #property .
So , we then re-generate the parser and re-run our TestParser test to get the following hierarchical output :
Parsing : src/test.script SCRIPT [ 11 ] BLOCK [ 12 ] morning [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] wake_up [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] eat [ 4 ]
PROPERTY [ 14 ] bacon [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] wash [ 4 ]
PROPERTY [ 14 ] hair [ 4 ] true [ 4 ]
PROPERTY [ 14 ] minutes [ 4 ] 10 [ 4 ] BLOCK [ 12 ] evening [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] read [ 4 ]
PROPERTY [ 14 ] book [ 4 ]
" How To Be a Ninja " [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] brush_teeth [ 4 ] COMMAND [ 13 ] sleep [ 4 ]
PROPERTY [ 14 ] hours [ 4 ] 8 [ 4 ]
So ( you may be asking ) , what good is an AST when I ’m writing my program ?
Good freaking question .
The AST is an object model that you can use to drive an interpreter , collect information or do many useful things with .
However , writing code to walk through an AST is boring ( and error prone and just gross ) .
Some better options are :
Write an AST visitor – Antlr has a visitor framework built in to support this Construct and return your own object structure within the parser – we have n’t used this capability but it is possible to pass objects into the parser rules and return objects from the parser rules .
This allows you to collect information during the parse itself and return your own objects from the parser .
Write a tree grammar – another option is to write what Antlr calls a tree grammar that specifies how to walk the AST and perform operations or construct objects .
I ’ve done both 2 and 3 in different situations .
# 2 is attractive as it builds your objects write into the parser and you can effectively build a custom AST with your own objects ( and your own behavior ) .
I find this approach maps pretty well .
But I have to say that # 3 seems like a better approach because it decouples the AST building from how an AST is used .
If you focus on just building a valid AST in your parser , you can then decouple any logic from the parser and move it into a tree grammar .
That gives you the freedom to write multiple tree grammars for different purposes ( one for printing , one for interpreting , one for stats generation , etc ) .
If you have multiple actions to take against your AST , this feels like the right choice to me .
So , we ’ll pause again at this point and save the tree grammar for Part 3 .

Hard Truths About the Culture War
Robert Bork
Moral liberalism and the decadence of culture .
What began to concern me more and more were the clear signs of rot and decadence germinating within American society - a rot and decadence that was no longer the consequence of liberalism but was the actual agenda of contemporary liberalism .
. . .
Sector after sector of American life has been ruthlessly corrupted by the liberal ethos .
It is an ethos that aims simultaneously at political and social collectivism on the one hand , and moral anarchy on the other .
- Irving Kristol , " My Cold War "
Equivocation has never been Irving Kristol 's long suit .
About the fact of rot and decadence there can be no dispute , except from those who deny that such terms have meaning , and who are , for that reason , major contributors to rot and decadence .
We are accustomed to lamentations about American crime rates , the devastation wrought by drugs , rising illegitimacy , the decline of civility , and the increasing vulgarity of popular entertainment .
But the manifestations of American cultural decline are even more widespread , ranging across virtually the entire society , from the violent underclass of the inner cities to our cultural and political elites , from rap music to literary studies , from pornography to law , from journalism to scholarship , from union halls to universities .
Wherever one looks , the traditional virtues of this culture are being lost , its vices multiplied , its values degraded - in short , the culture itself is unraveling .
These can hardly be random or isolated developments .
A degeneration so universal , afflicting so many seemingly disparate areas , must proceed from common causes .
That supposition is strengthened by the observation that similar trends seem to be occurring in nearly all Western industrialized democracies .
The main features of these trends are vulgarity and a persistent left - wing bias , the latter being particularly evident among the semi-skilled intellectuals - academics , bureaucrats , and the like - that Kristol calls the New Class .
But why should this be happening ?
The short answer is the one Kristol gives : the rise of modern liberalism .
( The extent to which he would agree with the following argument about the sources and future of modern liberalism , I do not know . )
Modern liberalism grew out of classical liberalism by expanding its central ideals - liberty and equality - while progressively jettisoning the restraints of religion , morality , and law even as technology lowered the constraint of hard work imposed by economic necessity .
Those ideals , along with the right to pursue happiness , are what we said we were about at the beginning , in the Declaration of Independence .
Stirring as rallying cries for rebellion , less useful , because indeterminate , for the purpose of arranging political and cultural matters , they become positively dangerous when taken , without very serious qualifications , as social ideals .
The qualifications assumed by the founders ' generation , but unexpressed in the Declaration ( it would rather have spoiled the rhetoric to have added " up to a point " ) , have gradually been peeled away so that today liberalism has reached an extreme , though not one fears its ultimate , stage .
" Equality " has become radical egalitarianism ( the equality of outcomes rather than of opportunities ) , and " liberty " takes the form of radical individualism ( a refusal to admit limits to the gratifications of the self ) .
In these extreme forms , they are partly produced by , and partly produce , the shattering of fraternity ( or community ) that modern liberals simultaneously long for and destroy .
Individualism and egalitarianism may seem an odd pair , since liberty in any degree produces inequality , while equality of outcomes requires coercion that destroys liberty .
If they are to operate simultaneously , radical egalitarianism and radical individualism , where they do not complement one another , must operate in different areas of life , and that is precisely what we see in today 's culture .
Radical egalitarianism advances , on the one hand , in areas of life and society where superior achievement is possible and would be rewarded but for coerced equality : quotas , affirmative action , income redistribution through progressive taxation for some , entitlement programs for others , and the tyranny of political correctness spreading through universities , primary and secondary schools , government , and even the private sector .
Radical individualism , on the other hand , is demanded when there is no danger that achievement will produce inequality and people wish to be unhindered in the pursuit of pleasure .
This finds expression particularly in the areas of sexuality and violence , and their vicarious enjoyment in popular entertainment .
Individualism and egalitarianism do not always divide the labor of producing cultural decay .
Often enough they collaborate .
When egalitarianism reinforces individualism , denying the possibility that one culture or moral view can be superior to another , the result is cultural and moral relativism , whose end products include multiculturalism , sexual license , obscenity in the popular arts , an unwillingness to punish crime adequately and , sometimes , even to convict the obviously guilty .
Both the individualist and the egalitarian ( usually in the same skin ) are antagonistic to society 's traditional hierarchies or lines of authority - the one because his pleasures can be maximized only by freedom from authority , the other because he resents any distinction among people or forms of behavior that suggests superiority in one or the other .
The universality of these forces is indicated by the fact that they are prominent features of two institutions at opposite ends of the cultural spectrum : the Supreme Court of the United States and rock music .
The Court reflects modern cultural trends most obviously when it invents new rights of the individual against the decisions of the political community , but it also does so in the expansion of rights expressed in the Constitution beyond anything the drafters and ratifiers could have intended .
Radical individualism surfaced when the Court created a right of privacy , supposedly about the sanctity of the marital bedchamber , which soon explicitly became a right of individual autonomy unconnected to privacy .
Four justices subsequently pronounced it a " moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole " - a " fact " which means that a person has no obligations outside his own skin .
The same tendency is seen in the Court 's drive to privatize religion , as when a girl is held to have a First Amendment right not to have to sit at graduation through a short prayer because it might offend her sensibilities .
The list could be extended almost indefinitely .
The autonomy the Court requires , of course , is necessarily selective , almost invariably consisting of the freedoms preferred by modern liberalism .
The Court 's commitment to egalitarianism is so strong that it overrode the explicit language and legislative history of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act to allow preferences for blacks and women .
The Court usually argued that the preferences were for prior discrimination , discrimination not against the individuals now benefited but against other members of their race or sex in the past .
Even that requirement was dropped when the Court allowed preferences for minorities in the grant of station licenses by the Federal Communications Commission , despite the lack of any evidence that such grants had ever been tainted by discrimination .
In these ways the Court reflects , and hence illegitimately legitimates , the thrusts of modern liberal culture .
To point the parallel : in a book appropriately titled The Triumph of Vulgarity , Robert Pattison points out that rock music celebrates the unconstrained self : " The extrovert , the madman , the criminal , the suicide , or the exhibitionist can rise to heroic stature in rock for the same reasons that Byron or Raskolnikov became romantic heroes - profligacy and murder are expressions of an emotional intensity that defies the limits imposed by nature and society . "
Rock culture teaches egalitarianism as well , not only in its frequent advocacy of revolution , but in its refusal to make distinctions about morality or aesthetics based upon any transcendent principle .
There is no such principle , only sensation , energy , the pleasure of the moment , and the expansion of the self .
Vulgarity and obscenity are , of course , rife in popular culture .
Rock is followed by rap ; television situation comedies and magazine advertising increasingly rely on explicit sex ; such cultural icons as Roseanne Barr and Michael Jackson can be seen on family - oriented television clutching their crotches .
The prospect is for more and worse .
Companies are now doing billions of dollars ' worth of business in pornographic videos , and volume is increasing rapidly .
They are acquiring inventories of the videos for cable television ; and a nationwide chain of pornographic video and retail stores is in the works .
One pay - per - view network operator says , " This thing is a freight train . "
It is likely to become a rocket ship soon if , as George Gilder predicts , computers replace television , allowing viewers to call up digital films and files of news , art , and multimedia from around the world .
He dismisses conservatives ' fears that " the boob tube will give way to what H. L. Mencken might have termed a new Boobissimus , as the liberated children rush away from the network nurse , chasing Pied Piper pederasts , snuff - film sadists , and other trolls of cyberspace . "
Gilder concedes , " Under the sway of television , democratic capitalism enshrines a Gresham 's law ; bad culture drives out good , and ultimately porn and prurience , violence and blasphemy prevail everywhere from the dimwitted ' news ' shows to the lugubrious movies . "
But he blames that on the nature of broadcast technology , which requires central control and reduces the audience to its lowest common denominator of tastes and responses .
But the computer will give everyone his own channel : " The creator of a program on a specialized subject - from Canaletto's art to chaos theory , from GM car transmission repair to cowboy poetry , from Szechuan restaurant finance to C++ computer codes - will be able to reach everyone in the industrialized world who shares the interest . "
Perhaps .
But there seems little reason to think there will not also be an enormous increase in obscene and violent programs .
Many places already have fifty or more cable channels , including some very good educational channels , but there are still MTV 's music videos , and the porn channels are coming on line .
The more private viewing becomes , the more likely that salacious and perverted tastes will be indulged .
That is suggested by the explosion of pornographic film titles and profits when videocassettes enabled customers to avoid going to " adult " theaters .
Another boom should occur when those customers do n't even have to ask for the cassettes in a store .
The new technology , while it may bring the wonders Gilder predicts , will almost certainly make our culture more vulgar and violent .
The leader of the revolution in pornographic video , referred to admiringly by a competitor as the Ted Turner of the business , offers the usual defenses of decadence : " Adults have a right to see [ pornography ] if they want to .
If it offends you , do n't buy it . "
Modern liberalism employs the rhetoric of " rights " incessantly to delegitimize restraints on individuals by communities .
It is a pernicious rhetoric because it asserts a right without giving reasons .
If there is to be anything that can be called a community , the case for previously unrecognized individual freedoms must be thought through , and " rights " cannot win every time .
The second notion - " If it offends you , do n't buy it " - is both lulling and destructive .
Whether you buy it or not , you will be greatly affected by those who do .
The aesthetic and moral environment in which you and your family live will be coarsened and brutalized .
There are economists who confuse the idea that markets should be free with the idea that everything should be on the market .
The first idea rests on the efficiency of the free market in satisfying wants ; the second raises the question of which wants it is moral to satisfy .
The latter question brings up the topic of externalities : you are free not to make steel , but you will be affected by the air pollution of those who do make it .
To complaints about pornography and violence on television , libertarians reply , " All you have to do is hit the remote control and change channels . "
But , like the person who chooses not to make steel , you and your family will be affected by the people who do not change the channel .
As Michael Medved puts it , " To say that if you do n't like the popular culture then turn it off , is like saying , if you do n't like the smog , stop breathing .
. . .
There are Amish kids in Pennsylvania who know about Madonna . "
And their parents can do nothing about that .
Can there be any doubt that as pornography and violence become increasingly popular and accessible entertainment , attitudes about marriage , fidelity , divorce , obligations to children , the use of force , and permissible public behavior and language will change , and with the change of attitudes will come changes in conduct , both public and private ?
The contrary view must assume that people are unaffected by what they see and hear .
Advertisers bet billions the other way .
Advocates of liberal arts education assure us those studies improve character ; it is not very likely that only uplifting culture affects attitudes and behavior .
" Do n't buy it " and " Change the channel " are simply advice to accept a degenerating culture and its consequences .
Modern liberalism also presses our politics to the left because egalitarianism is hostile to the authorities and hierarchies - moral , religious , social , economic , and intellectual - that are characteristic of a bourgeois or traditional culture and a capitalist economy .
Yet modern liberalism is not hostile to hierarchy as such .
Egalitarianism requires hierarchy because equality of condition cannot be achieved or approximated without coercion .
The coercers will be bureaucrats and politicians who will , and already do , form a new elite class .
Political and governmental authority replace the authorities of family , church , profession , and business .
The project is to sap the strength of these latter institutions so that individuals stand bare before the state , which , liberals assume with considerable justification , they will administer .
We will be coerced into virtue , as modern liberals define virtue : a ruthlessly egalitarian society .
This agenda is , of course , already well advanced .
Both diminished performance and personal injustice are accomplished through radically egalitarian measures .
Quotas and affirmative action , for example , are common and increasing not only in the workplace but in university admissions , faculty hiring , and promotion .
The excuse is past discrimination , but the result is that individuals who have never been discriminated against are preferred to individuals who have never discriminated , regardless of their respective achievements .
Predictably , the result is anger on both sides and an increasingly polarized society .
After years of struggle to emplace the principle of reward according to achievement , the achievement principle is being jettisoned for one of reward according to birth once more .
Remarkably little thought attends this process .
The demand is always for more equality , but no egalitarian ever specifies how much equality will be enough .
And so the leveling process grinds insensately on .
The Wall Street Journal recently reprinted a Kurt Vonnegut story , which the paper retitled " It Seemed Like Fiction " because it was written " in 1961 , before the passage of the Equal Pay Act ( 1963 ) , the Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) , the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( 1967 ) , the Equal Employment Opportunity Act ( 1972 ) , the Rehabilitation Act ( 1973 ) , the Americans with Disabilities Act ( 1990 ) , the Older Workers ' Benefit Protection Act ( 1990 ) , and the Civil Rights Act ( 1991 ) . "
At the time of reprinting , Congress was preparing hearings on " The Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1994 " and was considering additional amendments to the Civil Rights Act .
Even before all this , Vonnegut saw the trend and envisioned the day when Americans would achieve perfect equality : persons of superior intelligence required to wear mental handicap radios that emit a sharp noise every twenty seconds to keep them from taking unfair advantage of their brains , persons of superior strength or grace burdened with weights , those of uncommon beauty forced to wear masks .
Why not ?
Modern liberalism is most particularly a disease of our cultural elites , the people who control the institutions that manufacture or disseminate ideas , attitudes , and symbols - universities , some churches , Hollywood , the national press ( print and electronic ) , much of the congressional Democratic party and some of the congressional Republicans as well , large sections of the judiciary , foundation staffs , and almost all the " public interest " organizations that exercise a profound if largely unseen effect on public policy .
So pervasive is the influence of those who occupy the commanding heights of our culture that it is not entirely accurate to call the United States a majoritarian democracy .
The elites of modern liberalism do not win all the battles , but despite their relatively small numbers , they win more than their share and move the culture always in one direction .
This is not a conspiracy but a syndrome .
These are people who view the world from a common perspective , a perspective to the left of the attitudes of the general public .
Two explanations for this phenomenon have been advanced .
Both seem accurate .
One is a heretical version of Marxism , a theory of class warfare ; the other might be called a heretical version of religion , a theory of the hunger for spirituality , for a meaning to life .
Joseph Schumpeter first articulated the idea that capitalism requires and hence produces a large intellectual class .
The members of that class are not necessarily very good at intellectual work ; they are merely people who work with or transmit ideas at wholesale or retail , the folks collectively referred to above as the New Class ( also known as the " knowledge class , " the " class of semiskilled intellectuals , " or the " chattering class " ) .
Why should the New Class be hostile to traditional or bourgeois society ?
The answer , according to the class warfare theory , is that capitalism bestows its favors , money , and prestige on the business class .
The New Class , filled with resentment and envy , seeks to enhance its own power and prestige by attacking capitalism , its institutions , and its morality .
It is necessary to attack from the left because America has never had an aristocratic ethos and because the weapons at hand are by their nature suited to the left .
The ideas are held not for their merit but because they are weapons .
There is probably a good deal to this , but it seems not quite sufficient .
For one thing , it does not account for the Hollywood left .
These are folks with no need whatever to envy the CEO of General Motors his prestige or financial rewards .
And no one , to my knowledge , has ever classified Barbra Streisand , Jane Fonda , Ed Asner , and Norman Lear as intellectuals .
There is , however , an additional theory .
Max
Weber noted the predicament of intellectuals in a world from which " ultimate and sublime values " have been withdrawn :
" The salvation sought by an intellectual is always based on inner need .
. . .
The intellectual seeks in various ways , the casuistry of which extends to infinity , to endow his life with a pervasive meaning . "
The subsidence of religion leaves a void that must be filled .
Richard Grenier observes that among those intellectuals " most subject to longings for meaning , Max Weber listed , prophetically : university professors , clergymen , government officials . . . ' coupon clippers ' . . . journalists , school teachers , ' wandering poets . ' "
By " coupon clippers , " I take it , Weber meant the generations that inherit the wealth of the men who made it , which would explain why so many foundations created by wealthy conservatives become liberal when the children or grandchildren take over .
And for " wandering poets , " read the likes of Robert Redford and Warren Beatty .
The epitome of Weber 's university professors is John Rawls , whose egalitarian theory of justice swept the academy .
Among other odd notions , Rawls laid it down that no inequalities are just unless they benefit the most disadvantaged members of society .
There is , of course , no good reason for such a rule , and it is a prescription for permanent hostility to actual societies , and most particularly that of the United States , which can never operate in that fashion .
No vital society could .
What we are seeing in modern liberalism is the ultimate triumph of the New Left of the 1960s - the New Left that collapsed as a unified political movement and splintered into a multitude of intense , single - issue groups .
We now have , to name but a few , radical feminists , black extremists , animal rights groups , radical environmentalists , activist homosexual groups , multiculturalists , People for the American Way , Planned Parenthood , the American Civil Liberties Union , and many more .
In a real sense , however , the New Left did not collapse .
Each of its splinters pursues a leftist agenda , but there is no publicly announced overarching philosophy that enables people to see easily that the separate groups and causes add up to a general radical left philosophy .
The groups support one another and come together easily on many issues .
In that sense , the splintering of the New Left made it less visible and therefore more powerful , its goals more attainable , than ever before .
In their final stages , radical egalitarianism becomes tyranny and radical individualism descends into hedonism .
These translate as bread and circuses .
Government grows larger and more intrusive in order to direct the distribution of goods and services in an ever more equal fashion , while people are diverted , led to believe that their freedoms are increasing , by a great variety of entertainments featuring violence and sex .
David Frum argues that the root of our trouble is big government , but the root of big government is the egalitarian passion , which intimidates even many conservatives .
So long as that passion persists , government is likely only to get bigger and more intrusive .
We sometimes console ourselves with the thought that our current moral anarchy and statism are merely one phase of a pendulum 's swing , that in time the pendulum will swing the other way .
No doubt such movements and countermovements are often observable , but it is entirely possible that they are merely ephiphenomena that do not affect the larger movement of the culture .
After each swing the bottom of the pendulum 's arc is always further to the cultural and political left .
Certainly , in the United States , we have never experienced a period of cultural depravity and governmental intrusiveness to rival today 's condition .
The prospects look bleak , moreover , if we reflect on the sources of modern liberalism 's components .
The root of egalitarianism lies in envy and insecurity , which are in turn products of self - pity , arguably the most pervasive and powerful emotion known to mankind .
The root of individualism lies in self - interest , not always expressed as a desire for money but also for power , celebrity , pleasures , and titillations of all varieties .
Western civilization , of course , has been uniquely individualistic .
Envy and self - interest often have socially beneficial results , but when fully unleashed , freed of constraints , their consequences are rot , decadence , and statism .
Because they arise out of fundamental human emotions , it is obvious that individualism and egalitarianism were not invented in the 1960s .
They have been working inexorably through Western civilization for centuries , perhaps for millennia , but they have only recently overcome almost all obstacles to their full realization .
These forces were beneficent for most of their careers ; they produced the glories of our civilization and , freed of the restraints of the past , became malignant only in this century .
We are delighted that the restraints that afflicted men in the classical world , in the Middle Ages , even in the last century and much of this have been weakened or removed .
Our names for particular events and eras celebrate that movement : the Renaissance , the Reformation , the Enlightenment , our own Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights , the Civil Rights Movement .
Though they had other complex effects , all involved the loosening of restraints : religious , legal , and moral .
But any progression can at last go too far .
The constraints that made individualism and egalitarianism beneficial included economic necessity , which channeled individualism into productive work , and religion ( with its corollaries of morality and law ) , which tempered self - interest and envy .
It is only in this century , and particularly in the years since World War II , that Americans have known an affluence that frees many of us from absorption with making a living , and it is in that same period that the decline in religion , which began centuries ago , reached its low point .
Religious belief remains strong but seems to have a diminishing effect on behavior .
And only lately have we developed the technologies that not only make work easier but also make the opportunities for sensation almost boundless .
We have always known that unfettered human nature does not present an attractive face , but it is that face that is coming into view as modern liberalism progresses .
It is difficult to imagine the constraints that could now be put in place to do the work that economic necessity and religion once did .
If the drive of modern liberalism cannot be blunted and then reversed , we are also likely to see an increasingly inefficient economy .
The hedonism of radical individualism is not consistent with the habits of work and saving that are essential to a vigorous economy .
The quotas and affirmative action that are growing in our educational institutions and in our corporations , the dilution of the achievement principle , coupled with the government 's determination to intervene in the economy through manifold regulations , mandates , and taxes , will place additional burdens on productivity .
Despite all we have learned from watching other economies , perhaps we are fated to repeat the socialist mistakes and suffer the inevitable consequences .
This is a picture of a bleak landscape , and there are many who disagree .
Optimists point out , for example , that American culture is complex and resilient , that it contains much that is good and healthy , that many families continue to raise children with strong moral values .
All that is true .
I have been describing trends , not the overall condition of the culture , but the trends have been running the wrong way , dramatically so in the past thirty years .
It would be difficult to contend that , the end of racial segregation aside , American culture today is superior to , or even on a par with , the culture of the 1950s .
Others might argue that the elections of 1994 are an indication that a cultural swing is taking place , that Americans have rejected huge , regulation - happy government .
That may be so , but I remember thinking the same thing in November 1980 when the electorate chose Ronald Reagan and defeated a clutch of the most liberal Senators .
But little long - term improvement occurred .
Government now regulates more than it did then .
It was fifteen years between Reagan 's first inauguration and the Republican domination of Congress .
We will know that a sea change has happened if , fifteen years from now , government is smaller , less expensive , and less intrusive .
Modern liberalism , moreover , maintains its hold on the institutions that shape values and manipulate symbols .
Hollywood and the network evening news will not change their ways because of Republican majorities .
Political correctness and multiculturalism will not be ejected from the universities by Newt Gingrich .
If the reaction of the left to Reagan 's elections is any guide , modern liberalism will become more aggressive and intolerant .
In any event , even a persistently conservative government can do little to deal with social deterioration other than stop subsidizing it through welfare , and it remains to be seen whether Republicans have the will to overcome the constituencies that want welfare .
Moral decay is evident , moreover , among people who are not on welfare and never will be .
No one can be certain of the future , of course .
Cultures in decline have , unpredictably , turned themselves around before .
Perhaps ours will too .
Perhaps , ultimately , we will become so sick of the moral and aesthetic environment that is growing in America that stricter standards will be imposed democratically or by moral disapproval .
Perhaps we will reject a government that is controlling more and more of our lives .
A hopeful sign is the degree to which modern liberalism and its works - political correctness , affirmative action , multiculturalism , and the like - is coming under intellectual attack , not merely from conservative but also from liberal intellectuals .
If its intellectual and moral bankruptcy is repeatedly exposed , perhaps modern liberalism will die of shame .
But then again , perhaps not .
Country singer and social philosopher Merle Haggard , whose perspective is like Irving Kristol 's , says that the decade of the 1960s " was just the evening of it all .
I think we 're into the dead of night now . "
Chances are , that is too optimistic and the dead of night still lies ahead .
For the immediate future , in any event , what we probably face is an increasingly vulgar , violent , chaotic , and politicized culture and , unless the conservative resurgence of 1994 is both long - lasting and effective , an increasingly incompetent , bureaucratic , and despotic government .
Kristol refers to himself as a cheerful pessimist .
If the argument here is even close to the mark , and if the counterattack falls short , we had all better start working on the cheerful part .

This week a new study will reveal how much ignorance surrounds contraception in Britain .
Here Lucy Fairford tells how , after suffering years of mood swings , she found the pill might be to blame
It was labelled ' Blue Monday ' - the most miserable day of the year , according to psychologists - when bad weather , Christmas debt and broken resolutions combine to spread a collective despair .
Yet on 22 January I was feeling unusually happy .
My ' high ' had lasted two weeks and was affecting every part of my life .
I was having more fun with friends , loving work and my relationship with Amit was stronger than ever .
Weirdly , my change in mood came the day I stopped taking the contraceptive pill .
Could it be that for more than two years I had been taking a tablet day after day that had left me subdued , out of sorts and feeling odd without me even noticing it ?
Or was it all in my head ?
I asked my boyfriend whether he thought the two might be linked but he was not convinced .
He pointed out that I had not appeared unhappy for the past two years and the way I was feeling now was probably temporary .
If this pill that I had been taking had any side - effects , he added , they were tiny compared with my last experience .
That was certainly true .
I first started taking a combined oral contraceptive , which contains oestrogen and a progestin , three years ago when I was prescribed an older style of pill , known as ' second generation ' .
Although lots of my friends took the same brand and felt fine , I felt as if I was going crazy .
I went from being a fairly rational person to someone whose emotions spiralled out of control .
Anything could set me off .
I cried at TV adverts , talk shows and soap operas .
I broke down in front of friends .
I got moody , lost my temper quickly and started screaming rows with Amit .
In the end , my unpredictable moods contributed to the breakdown of our relationship .
However , when I came off it I felt like a mist had lifted .
Amit and I got back together , I started a newer ' third generation ' brand two years ago , and noticed nothing more until last month .
Now I am asking again , did the pill play with my emotions ?
It is a difficult question .
Despite the fact that it is one of the most researched drugs in the world , it is extremely hard to carry out robust studies around how the pill affects mood .
Anne Szarewski , a specialist in family planning at the Margaret Pyke Centre in London , said there was evidence the wrong type of pill could have a terrible effect :
' On the worst level someone who was reasonably happy suddenly has acne or gets depressed .
It can affect everything you do , you can lose confidence in work or in a relationship and that has a piling - up effect . '
But ' very few ' women who tried hard enough , sometimes trying four or five different types of pill , would not find one to suit them .
Maybe I had simply not tried hard enough .
What is clear is that many women , including myself , make far too little effort to educate themselves .
When I decided to write this article I called experts and was amazed by how ill - informed I was .
I knew barely anything about most of the 30 brands of pill on offer and I was dismally unaware of other long - lasting methods of contraception .
Tomorrow new research will be released to show that I am far from alone .
A study by the Family Planning Association will expose the extent of misunderstanding around sex and reproduction .
That report , carried out to launch Contraceptive Awareness
Week , will show how little women know about alternatives to the pill and how little they research them .
Toni Belfield , director of information at the FPA , said women would spend days choosing a new outfit , but not picking contraception .
I have to admit I spent longer last week researching which food processor I was going to buy than I have ever spent finding out about the pill .
The reason I came off it last month had nothing to do with my emotions but because my sex drive had fallen .
It was only afterwards that I noticed my mood had lifted .
I emailed my friend Catherine , who had been taking the same brand , and was shocked by her response .
She wrote : ' I lost my sex drive and after looking on the internet wondered if it could be the pill .
I stopped taking it last month too , and I 've been so much happier .
I 've been trying to decide whether it 's just that I have been getting on better with my boyfriend , or if it could be the pill . '
There are many other reasons why Catherine could be feeling better .
Last year she faced the stressful job of moving abroad and settling into a new city .
But , like me , she has a gut feeling that coming off the pill made her feel better .
One night I mentioned it to a friend , Seema .
' The first time I went on the pill I felt like I had PMT all the time , ' she said .
' I was not in control of my emotions , I was really irrational . '
She came off it and immediately returned to ' normal ' .
A year later she went back to her doctor to try again , explaining what happened the first time .
' He laughed and told me his girlfriend had taken the same brand and turned into a monster , ' she said .
He prescribed something new and she has felt fine ever since .
Seema had switched from a ' second - generation ' to a ' third - generation ' pill .
Szarewski said she was completely convinced that these newer pills carried fewer side - effects than older ones but added that doctors were under pressure to go for cheaper , older options .
Martyn Walling , a GP in Boston , Lincolnshire , with a special interest in contraception , said it was common with some brands to hear women say they did n't realise until they came off the pill just how bad they felt .
One third of women who start the pill will stop within a year , he said , often blaming side - effects such as mood swings or acne .
What about other options ?
I believed that what I termed the ' coil ' was not for me as I had not had children .
Yet , the intrauterine device and intrauterine system are both options I could have gone for .
So were the implant and the patch .
There is no evidence that any of these methods carry the risk of mood swings yet I knew nothing about them .
Research by the FPA has shown that 76 per cent of women had never heard of the intrauterine system , 24 per cent of the implant and 12 per cent of the injection , all long - acting methods of contraception .
Meanwhile , only 32 per cent of callers to their helpline said their doctor or nurse had talked about these methods .
Of course , condoms are also an option but as I am in a long - term relationship and we have both had tests for sexually transmitted diseases we would prefer to find another option .
Finding the right pill has its advantages too .
I am already dreading the fact that I have no idea when my period is due or whether it will be as painful or heavy as it was before the pill .
My skin has also deteriorated as my mood has improved .
' What all this illustrates is that we as women have individual and very different tendencies to different things in life , ' said Belfield from the FPA .
' When you take a hormone you need to think about not exacerbating something that there is already a tendency towards . '
But for the majority , Belfield added , the pill did not carry such side - effects .
' Three and a half million women in the UK are using the pill .
Women do vote with their feet . '
The risk of an unwanted pregnancy , she added , could be much worse .
One friend , Gemma , came off the pill last January and two weeks later fell pregnant after a one - night stand when she was not using a condom .
The result was devastating .
' When I found out , I was five weeks pregnant with twins , ' she said .
' I am an assertive , confident woman and know my rights but the experience was atrocious .
I was passed from pillar to post by doctors who were all " nice " but failed to help .
I felt it took away from the main issue : did I want to keep the child ? '
Gemma had an abortion when she was 10 weeks pregnant .
' I had been an absolute mess when I was making the decision .
A few hours after it happened I was sobbing and could not move .
It was the most incredible sadness I had ever felt . '
By the end of last year Gemma 's depression was so bad she was unable to leave her flat except for work and last week she started counselling .
' I now see the consequences of unsafe sex , ' she said .
Despite admitting he would be reluctant to take the ' male pill ' that could be on the market within eight years , my boyfriend thinks I blame the pill too much .
I think there is an element of truth to that .
When I put weight on a few years ago , it was probably the fact that I was eating too much and doing no exercise but I blamed the pill .
When I lost my sex drive it may have been because I was feeling stressed and tired but , again , I blamed the pill .
However , there are other times when I really do believe the pill affected my emotions .
If it did not create the tension in my relationship , it certainly whipped it up and left me less able to cope with what was happening .
Many of my friends are young , professional women who are sexually active in long - term relationships .
Finding contraception that suits them is crucial .
I do n't want to put women off the pill , I simply want to highlight that people like myself , Seema and Catherine are not alone .
Feeling as though your emotions are in turmoil can be scary and it is awful to look back and see just how irrationally you behaved .
Equally , I know I will be able to find an option that works for me .
After all , taking a risk is not an option .
A popular revolution
The pill was developed by American biologist Dr Gregory Pincus .
Tested in the 1950s on Puerto Rican and Haitian women , it came to the UK in 1961 for married women only .
· Ovulation is suppressed , so there is no egg for fertilisation by sperm , by the actions of the hormones ( oestrogen , or a mix of oestrogen and progestin ) in the pill .
· Health fears centred on hormone levels in the pill ; many have now been lowered .
Originally the pill had about 50 micrograms of oestrogen and it now contains around 30 .
Progestin levels have been cut to a tenth of their original level .
· Today 3.5 million women in the UK , around one in four of those aged 16 to 49 , take the pill .
· The last UK scare was in 1995 when ' third generation ' pills were linked to thrombosis .
Many gave up the pill , abortions and pregnancies rose .
The Family Planning Association called it a ' blip ' .
· In 1999 , in her book The Whole Woman , Germaine Greer , left , wrote that ' contraception is abortion ' .
Newer pills did not stop a woman conceiving , she argued , and it was a ' cynical deception of millions of women ' to sell them as contraceptives rather than abortifacients .
' What women do n't know does hurt them , ' she said .
I was playing a round of Gears of War , trying to redo a level on " insane " mode , and the walls were painted with guts .
I slaughtered my way to the boss , revved up my chainsaw , and sliced into his chest – releasing a fractal fountain of gore .
Woo !
At that instant , I heard the front door to my apartment open , and in walked my nanny ... with my 15 - month - old son , his eyes agog .
Daddy , I could see him thinking , what are you doing ?
Oh , nothing , son .
Just kicking back with a mass - murder simulator .
That 's all !
So I hastily clicked off my Xbox 360 , and avoided the nanny 's eyes .
But it got me thinking : Eventually he 's going to want to play video games .
And then I 'll have to face the traditional child - rearing quandaries that games present .
When will I hand him his first controller ?
Will I let him play the gory combat games I love so much – and , if so , when ?
Gamers like me have spent years railing against ill - informed parents and politicians who 've blamed games for making kids violent , unimaginative , fat or worse .
But now we 're in a weird position :
We 're the first generation that is young enough to have grown up playing games , but old enough to have kids .
So it turns out that , whoops , now we 've got to make sober calls about what sort of entertainment is good or bad for our children .
And what , precisely , are we deciding ?
I started making calls to my gamer posse find out .
As you 'd expect , I found that joystick - wielding parents are much better than Hillary Clinton at parsing the nuances in various types of combat games .
Brian Crecente , the editor of game blog Kotaku , takes an approach that most gamer parents described to me :
They treat games as they would movies .
If they 're too adult in content for his 5 - year - old son , he wo n't let his child even watch them being played .
" Everybody knows , as an adult , that the world is not always a nice place , " Crecente told me .
" But I do n't want him to know that yet .
I want him to have a childhood . "
So he disallows games with " realistic " combat , like World War II titles , or Resistance : Fall of Man , but permits highly cartoony shooting , like Starfox on the Nintendo DS – since he regards it as essentially as abstract as playing cops and robbers with your fingers as guns .
Chris Anderson , my uber - boss – the editor in chief of Wired magazine and lead editor on Geekdad – suggested a even more intriguing strategy : the " Lego Rule . "
The Lego Company , it seems , has a policy of not producing toys that replicate 20th century weapons .
" You can have swords , and you can have laser guns in space , but no actual 20th century guns , " Anderson says .
So his four children can play games like Halo , since it contains only futuristic , fantasy war , where you 're killing only green - or blue - blooded aliens .
The same goes for Roman swordplay titles .
" But it clearly walls off Grand Theft Auto . "
( I e-mailed Lego 's spokesman Michael McNally , and he confirmed the company 's Solomonic logic .
Lego , he wrote , agrees that good - versus - evil combat " is at the root of children 's play scenarios , and we believe is an important part of a child 's exploration of the world . "
But they do n't want it infecting the children 's perception of the real world around them , so the solution is to place it decisively in the realm of fantasy . )
Personally , I love that idea , and will probably try to remix it with Crecente 's guidelines .
But the truth is that violence in games is , paradoxically , one of easier issues to deal with , because you actually can make distinctions from game to game .
( And as scientific research is finding , games are unlikely to make your kid a killer ; recent studies show that violent games only increase your kids ' aggression if they already have pre-existing behavioral problems . )
The bigger dilemma is inherent in the nature of video games as games .
Are they simply too addictive for kids ?
After all , they 're play systems .
They 're designed to tease us with situations that are almost , but not entirely , under our control .
That 's catnip to our order - seeking prefrontal cortices .
I still grapple with the narcotic effect of games ; my wife and I once sat down to play a few minutes of Bookworm – then remained in a wall - eyed trance for five solid hours , skipping dinner .
" When you go to bed after playing something even like Tetris , those shapes are dancing in front of your eyes .
And that does n't happen if you spend the afternoon looking at , you know , paintings , " says Bret Dawson , a friend of mine who reviews games for The Toronto Star , and who plays casual games like Wii Sports with his 5 - year - old daughter .
The obvious solution is to strictly limit game - time , and simply endure the whining for more .
Most gamer parents told me they do n't allow more than an hour a day , and some only allow gaming only on weekends .
Personally , I 'm hoping I can parlay my own game addictions into the smokey , wisened authority of a former heroin addict , as I warn my son about the college - degree - wrecking appeal of World of Warcraft .
Trust me , kid .
I know what the streets can do to you .
Though who knows ?
Probably I 'll just seem like your average , nauseating ex-hippie boomer parent – sternly lecturing about the evils of marijuana while keeping a stash of Columbian Gold in my desk drawer at work .
Mind you , I 'm still willing to navigate this minefield , and find some way to let my son play appropriate games .
I 'm convinced it 's a net good for children 's psyches .
Video games let them explore complex systems ; they learn how to spot invisible and unspoken rules .
That 's useful not only as a life skill , but as an aesthetic experience .
Then again , it 's easy for me to say now .
I 've got six months before he 'll figure what the Xbox is for .

South Florida Everglades Bass Fishing with Steve McDonald , , a Florida Native !
Bass fishing in the Florida everglades is a once in a lifetime experience .
Here you will experience first hand the true habitat of the South Florida Everglades largemouth bass .
You will see lots of alligators , exotic birds like the great blue heron , and best of all are the trophy sized largemouth bass !
By about 1932 marine biologists as well as anglers had realized that largemouth bass in peninsular Florida grew to a larger size and had different coloration than their northern counterparts .
These differences along with some other physical characteristics were used to classify Florida the largemouth bass as a distinct subspecies in 1949 .
Florida strain largemouth bass have been widely introduced throughout the nation because of their potential for producing trophy - size fish .
However , native populations of this subspecies are unique only to the central and southern portions of the Florida peninsula .
This includes Lake Okeechobee and the Florida everglades specifically .
As a result the Florida largemouth bass represents a natural resource that is both biologically unique and economically valuable .
Here in sunny South Florida , we enjoy world class largemouth bass fishing year round .
Whether it is up on Lake Okeechobee or in the canals of the Florida Everglades , there is always a bass fishing adventure ready for you here in our region .
The state record currently for a largemouth bass is 17.27 pounds .
The fish was caught in an unnamed lake in Polk County , Florida back in 1986 .
We see lots of bass over 10 pounds come from the big " O " and 30 pound 5 fish stringers are caught every day in the canals of the Florida Everglades .
Our fishery is alive and well and will be here for years to come .
Get in on the action and give us a call for awesome largemouth bass fishing in South Florida !

National debt load is a fiscal time bomb
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson speaks at an Economic Club of Washington luncheon in Washington March 1 , 2007 .
Paulson said on Thursday the economy was successfully slowing toward moderate and sustained growth , but warned it could be derailed if trade barriers are raised .

Let 's say someone is spending about 11 percent of his or her paycheck to cover interest on outstanding debt .
Erica Sandberg , a spokeswoman for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco , says she 'd immediately advise that person to seek help .
" This is a huge amount of a person 's paycheck just to make ends meet , " Sandberg said .
" That 's never smart .
If you 're borrowing that much , you might feel good for the short term .
But over the long haul , you 're going to be in real trouble . "
Unfortunately , the person she 's talking about is you -- and everybody you know .
As the national debt approaches a staggering $ 9 trillion , roughly $ 240 billion will be spent this year paying interest on the half that 's held by public creditors ( of which Japan and China are the largest ) .
That translates to about 11 percent of projected tax revenue .
In other words , we 're spending more on interest for our national credit card bill than was spent last year in discretionary funds for the Education , Veterans Affairs and Justice departments combined .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
And at the rate we 're borrowing , experts say , the amount of annual interest payments could double within 10 years .
" The danger is not the current level , " said Brian Riedl , senior budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
" The danger is that future trends are very bad .
Within the next 10 or 20 years , our debt will spiral out of control .
" That scares the hell out of me , " he said .
This is one of those issues that 's difficult for many people to get their minds around .
Figures in the trillions of dollars , time frames that look decades down the road -- this is n't the way most of us think .
But the plain fact is that , as with the debt that so many people owe on their plastic , the consequences of financially reckless behavior can be severe .
If nothing is done to rein in the national debt , all Americans face the prospect of significantly higher taxes to continue meeting our financial obligations .
We also face the prospect of rising interest rates as our profligate ways represent an increasingly greater risk to creditors .
Rising rates , in turn , would drive up our annual interest payments , which would require even higher taxes or , more likely , increased borrowing .
And before you know it , rock star Bono will be making the rounds of other countries asking if they 'll offer us some debt relief .
" By 2045 , if we stay on our current path , all federal revenue will be used to pay interest on the debt , " said Josh Gordon , senior policy analyst at the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan budget watchdog group in Washington .
" It 's insane , " he said .
Last week , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said during a TV interview that he's " feeling good about the U.S. economy " and is n't particularly worried about the growing amount of IOUs in the hands of other countries .
" As I look at the demand for ... U.S. Treasurys , I 'm very pleased to see demand from all around the world -- from governments , from individuals -- it 's a positive that foreign investors want to own our Treasurys , " he said .
International investors , including central banks , held 51 percent of the $ 4.3 trillion in publicly offered Treasurys as of December , up from 34 percent of the almost $ 3 trillion total when President Bush took office in January 2001 .
Japan , with $ 644 billion in American IOUs , is our biggest foreign creditor .
China ( $ 350 billion ) is second , followed by Britain ( $ 239 billion ) and oil - exporting countries ( $ 100 billion ) .
Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton , who wants to be president , told CNBC last week that recent volatility in the U.S. stock market , which began with a sell - off of Chinese stocks , " should be a real wake - up call for our country . "
" Obviously , the level of our debt that is now held by central banks and foreign governments is a problem , " she said .
" And I do n't want the administration to ignore this wake - up call and just hit the snooze button again . "
Critics say Clinton is exaggerating the problem , particularly the danger of so much debt being held by overseas creditors .
But the bottom line is that no matter who holds our debt , the amount we owe as a nation is soaring .
And there 's no end in sight to our need to borrow .
The national debt now represents about 66 percent of nearly $ 14 trillion in gross domestic product .
It 's been worse -- more than 100 percent of GDP during World War II .
But that was a time when Americans willingly sacrificed to rid the globe of tyranny .
Today 's rising ratio of debt to GDP reflects nothing more noble than a political leadership that 's unwilling to tackle an immensely difficult issue .
" Congress has no interest in dealing with long - term debt , " said Riedl at the Heritage Foundation .
" It does n't want to make the hard decisions and risk unpopularity . "
Remedies will only become more costly in coming years as millions of Baby Boomers place unprecedented strain on government coffers , forcing lawmakers to scramble for billions of dollars in additional funds if they hope to avoid drastic benefit cuts .
What will they do ?
The experts say they could jack up taxes .
More likely , though , they 'll just pass the hat again among international lenders .
" By 2040 , we could be looking at debt held by the public being 300 percent of GDP , " said Gordon at the Concord Coalition .
" We wo n't be much of a superpower if that happens . "
At the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco , Sandberg , who has been a credit counselor for 10 years , said the best plan is always to act right away if your debt is getting out of control .
" If you keep borrowing , " she said , " all you 're going to do is dig yourself deeper into the hole . "

( Claire , England ) A : Some spiders can swim .
The half - inch water spider , in fact , actually lives underwater ( the only spider who does ) , and swims so well he can catch fish ( although he does n't usually ) and more standard water fare including midge larvae , water mites and mayfly nymphs .
This innovative spider makes his own undersea haven — a diving bell .
Here 's an image of one .
He spins the underwater bell - shaped nest , descends with bubbles of air on his legs and under his belly and places the bubbles under the platform .
Slowly , bubble by bubble , he builds an air reserve .
Once the air pocket is in place , it lasts indefinitely .
" Oxygen diffuses from the surrounding water " into the pocket , and waste carbon dioxide diffuses out , says Beth Coleman of the Canterbury Environmental Education Centre .
The spider leaves the shelter to hunt and brings back his kill inside the bell .
The male builds his diving bell next to the female , and tunnels over to mate .
The female lays eggs in a partitioned - off upper part of her bell , but young spiders hatch out into the water .
These spiders live in ponds and rivers in Europe , northern Asia and north of the Sahara Desert in Africa .
Most spiders , though , do n't swim as a routine part of life , but some can to survive .
" Tarantulas do n't take kindly to large bodies of water , " reports zoologist Jason Dunlop of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin .
They are " clearly able to detect its presence " , probably with humidity sensors on their legs , and actively try to avoid the water .
But if , for example , a tarantula falls in the water when scampering along an overhanging tree limb , she 's likely to float on the water 's surface film , buoyed by air trapped in her hairy legs , and then , with a rapid flurry of legs , row to shore .
A few merely remain motionless until they sink .

Like charges repel , differing charges attract .
So when a photon from an electron approaches another electron , how does it " know " whether to repel or attract , if it is the same kind of photon that would come from a proton ?
( Someone , World ) A : It 's a puzzle all right .
Photons have no charge so how does a photon know about charges and pass the information on to the charged particles ?
Let 's work our way to the answer using negatively - charged electrons and positively - charged protons as our example .
Our results will hold , however , for all charged particles from quarks to omegas .
Photons are the carrier particles for electromagnetic interactions .
That means charged particles ( for example , electrons and protons ) interact by exchanging photons .
One electron ( for instance ) radiates a photon ; another absorbs the photon .
The absorbing electron necessarily absorbs the photon 's energy , spin and momentum .
That 's the tip - off .
The photon carries the information in its spin and momentum .
We get a clue how this takes place through the calculations of quantum mechanics : the sign of the momentum transferred is determined by the product of the charges .
In this case both particles are electrons , so their charges are negative .
The product of the charges is a plus , which means they repel each other .
Similarly , if the two particles have unlike charges , for example , an electron and a proton , then the product of the charges is a minus , which means they attract .
The carrier photon carries information about the interaction in its spin and momentum .
The momentum is either positive or negative ( we do n't know why ) , depending on the charges of the interacting particles .
About the momentum sign ( positive or negative ) : " You might be interested to know that I 've talked with the smartest experimentalist I know and the smartest theorist I know ( crushingly intelligent people ) and they cannot deliver an explanation for the dual nature of electromagnetism ( attraction and repulsion ) beyond the empirical observation of Ben Franklin that there are two different charges of electricity : positive and negative , " physicist Erik Ramberg of Fermilab says .
Like charges repel , unlike charges attract .
What 's more : the carrier photon is not a " real " photon , but rather a virtual one that winks into and out of existence solely to do the job of carrying interaction information .
" What does this mean ? " Ramberg mulls .
It means the interaction takes place in an interval of space and time that " violates " the conservation laws of momentum and spin .
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says such a violation is okay if the charged particles emit and absorb the virtual photon in an " undetected " state .
It 's a stealth photon that operates in a smaller time interval than we can imagine .
" I hope your brain is hurting , because that 's what quantum mechanics does to us all ! "
I smiled as I read Ramberg 's e-mailed comment .
" In some sense , this is almost a key fact of our existence .
Every atom of every cell has electromagnetic interactions with its neighbors .
That is what makes our world seem ' solid . '
And it 's all because of clouds of virtual photons that pop into and out of existence in unfathomably microscopic periods of space and time . "

Stephen Colbert : ' Obama 's a liar .
Pass it on .'
David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
On his show Tuesday , Stephen Colbert " exposed " 2008 presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) as a " liar . "
Colbert calls into question a statement Obama made about a Life magazine article he said he read when he was living in Indonesia as a child that " awakened him to the issue of racism . "
" But the Chicago Tribune , " says Colbert , " and other papers say the story can't be true because , quote , ' The Life article and photographs do n't exist . '
Pants on fire ! "
Obama , continues Colbert , said later that it might actually have been an article in Ebony .
" Which is , Obama ?
Life magazine or Ebony ? " he badgers .
" Which issue of which magazine that came out at least 37 years ago are we talking about ? "
After revealing that it was likely a 1968 Esquire article , Colbert presses the issue , " Why could n't you remember , Obama ?
If we can't trust you to remember which magazine you read in Indonesia when you were nine , how we can possibly ever trust you to protect our country ? "
The following video is from the May 22 edition of Colbert Report .

" Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it . " ~ George Santayana
On May 9 , 2007 , with little attention from the snoozing media , George W. Bush issued a " presidential directive " that allows him to assume control of the federal government following a " catastrophic emergency . "
Although the directive does n’t specifically identify the types of emergencies that would qualify as " catastrophic , " it is vague enough to encompass " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government function . "
As Matthew Rothschild of The Progressive noted , it could include " another 9/11 , or another Katrina , or a major earthquake in California . "
In fact , the language is so broad that it could include almost anything the public is led to believe might have a major impact on the country .
Not surprisingly , the president ’s order comes neatly packaged within the trappings of national security and safety .
This directive followed on the heels of a bill , which I have previously written about , that was pushed through Congress and which gave the president the power to declare martial law and establish a dictatorship .
Under these provisions , the president can now use the military as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster , disease outbreak , terrorist attack or any " other condition . "
In other words , the groundwork has been laid for the president of the United States to do away with our democracy , such as it is , and establish a dictatorship .
The president , in effect , has become a power unto himself .
Having said that , I ’m aware that I have opened myself up to accusations of paranoia and alarmist sentiment .
However , if it is paranoid or alarmist to recognize the potential for abuse and urge Americans to guard against it , then so be it .
It ’s time to sound the alarm .
If we continue down this road , there can be no surprise about what awaits us at the end .
After all , it is a tale that has been told time and again throughout history .
For example , over 70 years ago , the citizens of another democratic world power elected a leader who promised to protect them from all dangers .
In return for this protection , and under the auspice of fighting terrorism , he was given absolute power .
This leader went to great lengths to make his rise to power appear both legal and necessary , masterfully manipulating much of the citizenry and their government leaders .
Unnerved by threats of domestic terrorism and foreign invaders , the people had little idea that the domestic turmoil of the times  such as street rioting and the fear of Communism taking over the country  was staged by the leader in an effort to create fear and later capitalize on it .
In the ensuing months , this charismatic leader ushered in a series of legislative measures that suspended civil liberties and habeas corpus rights and empowered him as a dictator .
On March 23 , 1933 , the nation ’s legislative body passed the Enabling Act , formally referred to as the " Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Nation , " which appeared benign and allowed the leader to pass laws by decree in times of emergency .
What it succeeded in doing , however , was ensuring that the leader became a law unto himself .
The leader ’s name was Adolf Hitler .
And the rest , as they say , is history .
Yet history has a way of repeating itself .
Hitler ’s rise to power should serve as a stark lesson to always be leery of granting any government leader sweeping powers .
But we are clearly not heeding that lesson .
Americans are being lulled to sleep by the government ’s constant warning that terror and destruction lurk around the corner .
Color - coded terrorism threat levels and reports of alleged terrorism plots are constantly paraded before us .
Indeed , since 9/11 , the American people have been kept in a state of constant fear and expectation of yet another terrorist attack or , more subtly , another Katrina .
Thus , while the recent spate of directives giving the U.S. president broad powers to supposedly ensure America ’s safety and security from terrorism and natural disaster should serve as a warning , they have caused barely a ripple among the media or the masses .
President Bush has assured us that he will do whatever it takes to keep America safe , and Americans have blindly trusted him .
How did he reward that trust ?
First , he claimed the authority to permanently imprison American citizens alleged to be so - called " enemy combatants . "
Then he asserted his right to order government intelligence agencies to not only spy on America ’s enemies but also on Americans .
Now he has quietly and unobtrusively granted himself the power to take control of the government in the event of a vaguely defined national emergency .
James Madison , the father of our Constitution , said that Americans should take alarm at the first experiment upon their liberties .
But this latest " presidential directive " is not the first attack on our liberties , and I dare say it will not be the last .
We ’d better open our eyes soon , lest we wake up one morning and find that we live under a new regime .
Only , this time , it will be one of our own making .

My trusty Handbook
A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature is the most clicked book I ’ve featured in my sidebar .
These readers have good instincts as I ’m finding it to be very beneficial .
Its virtue for me so far is in the authors ’ systematic , informed and extensive exploration of topics to which I was introduced in a more limited form in sixth form .
My teacher touched a bit on textual criticism in our classes on Shakespeare , and we did a bit of abab stuff on Blake but textual scholarship and metrical feet were never a topic on to themselves .
I had an excellent English record but before now I would stutter self - consciously if anyone were to ask me to clearly say what was iambic pentameter .
( Umm…five !
Something about five !
Five syllables ?
Five …rhythmic…syllable … things in a line ?
I know Shakespeare wrote in blank verse !
What ’s blank verse ?
Uhhhh … Marlowe was a papist ! )
I was thrilled , foolishly grinning into space as I mumbled “ daDUM daDUM ” and memorised what was a sicilian tercet .
It also clarified what theories were behind the critical tactics I learnt .
How formalists preferred to examine imagery and metaphor , and why some critics ballyhooed the “ historical and biographical ” approach .
I was most attracted to close readings ; analysing works in their historical context was also quite helpful but I found the biographical stuff the least informative of all .
The primary texts used in the book for study were Marvell ’s “ To His Coy Mistress ” ; Nathaniel Hawthorne ’s short story “ Young Goodman Brown ” and Alice Walker ’s “ Everyday Use ” ; for novels it was Huckleberry Finn and Frankenstein ; and Shakespeare ’s Hamlet .
( I ’ve already read the Marvell , Shelley and Shakespeare , and I borrowed the Hawthorne and Walker .
I ’m completely uninterested in the Twain . )
From the selection only Hawthorne ’s life offered any significant insight to his texts .
The rest offered a nice contrast or background to the authors ’ works , I guess , but ignorance of their life would n’t have dulled the reading experience .
Anyway these categorisation of approaches and brief histories of their development really … illuminated , in some sense , why I read fiction the way that I do .
In trying to figure out why I found any of this interesting , beyond the more fruitful reading experiences I expected to have in the future , I concluded that I want to know these things because my reading style and tastes were significantly developed in the classroom .
I was drawn to classics , the idea of them , before I ever read my first one in class and I enjoyed the kind of work we were asked to do on them .
To varying extents I ’ve retained what I learnt and applied it to my readings that are now all done for pleasure .
And , being out of the English classroom , I dreaded the possibility of devolving back into a simpler mode , where the best thing I could say about a novel was that it was really good and I related to the characters .
I am also really curious about the theories behind reading practices that are anathema to me .
The ones where novels are nothing but ciphers for culture , or politics or morals .
Or even learning why certain camps were so extreme and insisted this is way , the only way , to truly read literature .
I ’m also hoping to find at least one critical theory that makes absolutely no sense , you know , the ones that only a stereotypical , doped out professor , sickly white from lack of sun , tenured ( of course ! ) and addle - brained could think of .
If I do n’t get at least one of those I will be severely disappointed .
I do not doubt that there are readers out there who do not need such knowledge to be excellent , engaged , readers with fresh or at least elegantly conveyed opinions .
But I do n’t think I ’m one of them , or rather , I do n’t want to find out if I am one of them because I am having too much fun doing it my way .
The UK is an unrivalled world - leading exporter of ideas and specialist knowledge across a range of different industries , according to a new report .
But investment - in higher education ( HE ) particularly - is essential to keep the UK doing well in knowledge - based exports and able to exploit its science , technology and HE to best effect , the report warns .
According to the report by Work Foundation , an economic performance thinktank , the UK sells more knowledge services - which includes the money foreign students spend on British universities - as a proportion of total exports than any other major economy .
Key areas of exported British brainpower are in financial services , advertising , newspapers and brands , pop music , management consultancy , and the expertise of lawyers , accountants , engineers and publishers .
" Overall , the UK 's export performance is comparable to many other nations - unexceptional , in other words , " says the foundation .
But , according to official government statistics , " our export performance in knowledge services ... is truly outstanding .
In 2005 , the UK exported about £ 75bn of knowledge services - 170 % up on a decade earlier ( £ 28 bn ) .
This accounts today for about a quarter of all UK exports . "
Spending by foreign students and visitors ( those staying less than 12 months ) provided earnings of £ 3bn in 2005 , almost all of which went on education services .
The UK has gained an edge on competitors by exploiting the UK education , science and technology base for global markets through increased earning from research and development services , royalties and fees and from foreigners buying HE services .
But the export growth of knowledge - based services has slowed in recent years , the report , published yesterday warns .
Between 1995 and 2002 it increased from 3.9 % to 6.5 % as a share of GDP but it has grown roughly in line with GDP ever since .
Exports in 2005 were worth about 6.3 % of GDP .
This is partly down to the growth in computer and information services coming to an abrupt end in 2005 , the report suggests .
" This is an area we will need to monitor carefully for signs that UK competitiveness might be falling compared with service providers in the rest of the EU , " it says .
" UK HE establishments are an international success story .
However , knowledge industries do not depend just on graduate level skills , and the strengthening of non-graduate skills development is also important , " the report warns .
The vice - chancellors ' group , Universities UK , reported last year that universities were worth £ 45 bn to the UK economy .
It ’s days like today that I ’m glad the UN has very little real power .
WHO urges smoking ban in public places
The U.N. health agency on Tuesday issued its strongest policy recommendations yet for controlling tobacco use , urging all countries to ban smoking at indoor workplaces and in public buildings .
“ The evidence is clear .
There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke , ” said Dr. Margaret Chan , director - general of the World Health Organization .
There ’s no level of safe exposure to the UN , either .
Every chance they get , they ’re scrambling for more and more power over my life .
I can choose whether or not to patronize a smoky establishment .
Sometimes that might be a dangerous choice .
I can also choose to ignore the government ’s edicts .
That may be another dangerous choice , as they ’re more than willing to use jail cells and firearms to make sure I follow their rules .
At least with smoking , I can choose to exclude cigarettes from my life .

Reynold ’s does n’t have policemen to come after me if I do n’t buy their product .
“ This is not about shaming the smoker .
This is not even about banning smoking , ” said Dr. Armando Peruga , who heads WHO ’s anti-tobacco campaign .
“ This is about society taking decisions about where to smoke and where not to smoke . ”
He cited Ireland and Uruguay as governments that have successfully tackled smoking by creating and enforcing smoke - free environments .
Legislation of the kind has proved popular among both smokers and nonsmokers , according to WHO , whose policy recommendations set broad goals for its 193 member states but are not legally binding .
This is about society democratically trampling the private property rights of individuals .
It may be popular , but that does n’t necessarily make it legitimate .
It ’s not “ society ’s ” role to make these decisions , it is the private property owner ’s role to determine what is allowed on his land .
There is a threat in giving the UN power .
They want to be a world government .
But when a world government is wrong , we all suffer and there is no escape .
Given the tendency for government of any kind to be wrong , and the further tendency for the UN to be flagrantly wrong , I really do n’t want to see that day come .
These recommendations are n’t legally binding , but believe me when I say that they hope to have that power one day .

According to Kuo , Karl Rove 's office referred to evangelical leaders as ' the nuts . '
Tonight on Countdown -- David Kuo , who was the number two guy at the Office of Faith Based initiatives in the White House writes a scathing account of how the administration used Christians to grab and maintain power .
This story validates Tucker Carlson 's admission that : " The deep truth is that the elites in the Republican Party have pure contempt for the evangelicals who put their party in power . "

When President Bush touched on Iraq at his news conference this morning , he may have been revealing more than he knew .
[ video ]
BUSH :
The stakes could n't be any higher , as I said earlier , in the world in which we live .
There are extreme elements that use religion to achieve objectives .
He was talking about religious extremists in Iraq .
But an hour later , Mr. Bush posed with officials from the Southern Baptist Convention .
It is described as the largest , most influential evangelical denomination in a new book by the former number - two man in Bush 's Office of Faith - Based Initiatives .
The book , " Tempting Faith , " not out until Monday , but in our third story tonight , a Countdown exclusive we 've obtained a copy and it is devastating work .
Author David Kuo's conservative Christian credentials are impeccable ; his resume sprinkled with names like Bennett and Ashcroft .
Now , as the Foley cover - up has many evangelical Christians wondering whether the G.O.P. is really in sync with their values , " Tempting Faith " provides the answer :
No way .
Kuo , citing one example after another of a White House that repeatedly uses evangelical Christians for their votes -- while consistently giving them nothing in return ;
A White House which routinely speaks of the nation 's most famous evangelical leaders behind their backs , with contempt and derision .
Furthermore , Faith - Based Initiatives were not only stiffed on one public promise after another by Mr. Bush -- the office itself was eventually forced to answer a higher calling : Electing Republican politicians .
Kuo 's bottom line : the Bush White House is playing millions of American Christians for suckers .
According to Kuo , Karl Rove 's office referred to evangelical leaders as ' the nuts . '
Kuo says , ' National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as ' ridiculous , ' ' out of control , ' and just plain ' goofy . ' "
So how does the Bush White House keep ' the nuts ' turning out at the polls ?
One way , regular conference calls with groups led by Pat Robertson , James Dobson , Ted Haggard , and radio hosts like Michael Reagan .
Kuo says , " Participants were asked to talk to their people about whatever issue was pending .
Advice was solicited [ but ] that advice rarely went much further than the conference call .
[ T ]he true purpose of these calls was to keep prominent social conservatives and their groups or audiences happy . "
They do get some things from the Bush White House , like the National Day of Prayer , “ another one of the eye - rolling Christian events , ” Kuo says .
And “ passes to be in the crowd greeting the president when he arrived on Air Force One or tickets for a speech he was giving in their hometown .
Little trinkets like cufflinks or pens or pads of paper were passed out like business cards .
Christian leaders could give them to their congregations or donors or friends to show just how influential they were .
Making politically active Christians personally happy meant having to worry far less about the Christian political agenda . ”
When cufflinks were n't enough , the White House played the Jesus card , reminding Christian leaders that , quote , “ they knew the president 's faith ” and begging for patience .
And the Office of Faith - Based Initiatives ?
According to Kuo , “ White House staff did n't want to have anything to do with the Faith - Based Initiative because they did n't understand it any more than did congressional Republicans .
They did n't lie awake at night trying to kill it .
They simply didn 't care . "
Kuo relates one faith - based promise after another -- billions of dollars in funding and tax credits -- that goes unfulfilled year after promise after year .
He recounts one specific funding exchange with Mr. Bush :
Bush : " Eight billion in new dollars ? "
Kuo : " No sir .
Eight billion in existing dollars for which groups will find it technically easier to apply .
But faith - based groups have been getting that money for years . "
Bush : " Eight billion .
That 's what we 'll tell them .
Eight billion in new funds for faith - based groups . "
Why bother lying ?
Kuo says , " The faith - based initiative had the potential to successfully evangelize more voters than any other . "
According to Kuo , the Office spent much of its time on two missions :
One — Trying -- and failing -- to prove Mr. Bush 's claim of regulatory bias against religious charities hiring who they wanted .
Quote : " Finding these examples became a huge priority .
...[ but ] religious groups had encountered very few instances of actual problems with their hiring practices . "
" It really was n't that bad at all . "
Another mission : lobbying the President to make good on his own promises .
How ?
Kuo says they tried to prove their political value by turning the once - bipartisan faith - based initiatives into a political operation .
It was n't just discrimination against non-Christian charities .
( One official who rated grant applications told Kuo , " when I saw one of those non-Christian groups in the set I was reviewing , I just stopped looking at them and gave them a zero ... a lot of us did . " )
The Office was also , literally , a taxpayer - funded part of the Republican campaign machinery .
In 2002 , Kuo says the office decided to " hold roundtable events for threatened incumbents with faith and community leaders ... using the aura of our White House power to get a diverse group of faith and community leaders to a ' nonpartisan ' event discussing how best to help poor people in their area . "
White House Political Affairs director Ken Mehlman " loved the idea and gave us our marching orders .
There were twenty targets . "
Including Saxby Chambliss in Georgia and John Shimkus in Illinois .
Mehlman devised a cover - up for the operation .
He told Kuo , " It ca n't come from the campaigns .
That would make it look too political .
It needs to come from the congressional offices .
We 'll take care of that by having our guys call the office to request the visit . "
Kuo explains , " this approach inoculated us against accusations that we were using religion and religious leaders to promote specific candidates . "
Those roundtables were a hit .
Republicans won 19 of those 20 races .
76 percent of religious conservatives voted for Chambliss over decorated war hero Max Cleland .
And Bush 's 2004 victory in Ohio ?
That " was at least partially tied to the conferences [ they ] had launched [ there ] two years before . "
By that time , Kuo had left the White House , concluding that " it was mocking the millions of faithful Christians who had put their trust and hope in the President and his administration .
Bush knew his so - called compassion agenda was languishing and had no problem with that . "
If you would question Mr. Kuo 's credibility , you should know his former boss also quit the White House complaining in his one public interview that politics drove absolutely everything in the Bush administration .
There is more , much more revealed in Tempting Faith ... how Jack Kemp was tricked into sounding like a religious conservative without even knowing it ; Jerry Falwell 's astonishing behavior at the 9/11 Day of Remembrance and considerably more as our Countdown exclusive of Tempting Faith continues here tomorrow night .
White House refuses to turn over documents in probe of federal prosecutors Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email This The White House , under attack from Congress for allegedly firing federal prosecutors based on political affiliation , asserted executive privilege Thursday and said they could not turn over documents that could shed light on the prosecutors ' firings .
A top Senate Democrat who is leading the investigation accused the White House of ' Nixonian stonewalling , ' and his counterpart in the House of Representatives warned that he would seek to enforce the rule of law .
Without formally responding to the subpoenas , White House spokesman Tony Snow called them " an outrageous request " that was intended simply " to make life difficult for the White House . "
" It also explains why this is the least popular Congress in decades , " Snow added .
In a letter to the chairmen of the the House and Senate Judiciary Committees , President George W. Bush 's attorney asserted that White House would not turn over subpoenaed documents for former presidential counsel Harriet Miers and former political director Sara Taylor .
" With respect , it is with much regret that we are forced down this unfortunate path which we sought to avoid by finding grounds for mutual accommodation , " White House counsel Fred Fielding wrote .
" We had hoped this matter could conclude with your committees receiving information in lieu of having to invoke executive privilege .
Instead , we are at this conclusion . "
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) slammed President Bush 's move .
" This is a further shift by the Bush Administration into Nixonian stonewalling and more evidence of their disdain for our system of checks and balances , " he said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" This White House can not have it both ways .
They cannot stonewall congressional investigations by refusing to provide documents and witnesses , while claiming nothing improper occurred ....
Increasingly , the President and Vice President feel they are above the law - in America no one is above law . "
Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , threatened to take legal action against the White House .
" " The President 's response to our subpoena shows an appalling disregard for the right of the people to know what is going on in their government .
The executive privilege assertion is unprecedented in its breadth and scope , and even includes documents that the Adminstration previously offered to provide as part of their ' take it or leave it ' proposal , " the Michigan Democrat said in a statement .
" This response indicates the reckless disrepect this Administration has for the rule of law .
The charges alleged in this investigation are serious - including obstruction of justice and misleading Congress - and the White House should be as committed to this investigation as the Congress .
At this point , I see only one choice in moving forward , and that is to enforce the rule of law set forth in these subpoenas . "
His counterpart , Rep. Linda Sánchez ( D - CA ) , added that the White House 's offer of a ' deal ' was not credible .
" It 's tough to get lectured on the Constitution from the same Administration that said the Vice President is his own branch of government , " said the Chairwoman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law , which authorized the subpoenas issued by Conyers for former White House Counsel Harriet Miers .
" Mr. Fielding should understand two things : that nobody in their right mind would accept a White House offer that would condone perjury , and that saying ' take - it - or - leave - it ' for months is not actually negotiation . "
Thursday was the deadline for surrendering the documents which had been subpoenaed by Congress June 13 .
The White House also asserted that Miers and Taylor would not testify next month , as directed .
If neither side will budge , " the stalemate could end up with House and Senate contempt citations and a battle in federal court over separation of powers , " according to the Associated Press .
Bush " attempted to chart a course of cooperation " by releasing more than 8,500 pages of documents and sending Gonzales and other senior officials to testify before Congress , Fielding said in his letter , according to AP .
He noted that the Administration had offered a compromise where Miers , Taylor , Karl Rove and their deputies would be interviewed by Judiciary Committee aides behind closed door -- without transcripts .
Democrats refused .
In related news , Democratic staff told RAW STORY that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform cancelled a business meeting today during which Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) had threatened to issue subpoenas related to White House security breaches .
AP released the full text of Fielding 's letter to the Congressional committees , which is presented below .
# Dear Chairman Leahy and Chairman Conyers : On June 13 , 2007 , the White House received two subpoenas from your Committees requesting documents relating to the replacement of United States Attorneys , calling for the documents to be produced by June 28 , 2007 .
I write at the direction of the President to advise and inform you that the President has decided to assert Executive Privilege and therefore the White House will not be making any production in response to these subpoenas for documents .
In addition , Chairman Leahy subpoenaed documents from former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Political Affairs Sara M. Taylor , with the same return date of June 28 , 2007 .
Chairman Conyers has subpoenaed documents from former Counsel to the President Harriet E. Miers , with a return date of July 12 , 2007 .
Counsel for Ms. Taylor and Ms. Miers have been informed of the President 's decision to assert Executive Privilege and have been asked to relay to Ms. Taylor and Ms. Miers a direction from the President not to produce any documents .
With respect , it is with much regret that we are forced down this unfortunate path which we sought to avoid by finding grounds for mutual accommodation .
We had hoped this matter could conclude with your Committees receiving information in lieu of having to invoke Executive Privilege .
Instead , we are at this conclusion .
At the outset of this controversy , the President attempted to chart a course of cooperation .
It was his intent that Congress receives information in a manner that accommodated Presidential prerogatives .
The Department of Justice , for its part , has produced or made available for review more than 8,500 pages of documents , including scores of documents containing communications with White House personnel .
In addition , the Attorney General , Deputy Attorney General , Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General , Attorney General 's former Chief of Staff , former White House Liaison , and other senior Department officials have testified in public hearings and , in some instances , submitted to interviews with Committee staff .
As a result , your Committees have received an extraordinary amount of information regarding the U.S. Attorney replacement issue by way of accommodation .
In keeping with the established tradition of Congress and the Executive Branch working together to accommodate each others ' interests , the President was willing to go even further in response to your inquiries .
At his direction , we proposed and offered to provide you with documents containing communications between the White House and Department of Justice regarding the request for the resignation of the U.S. Attorneys in question , as well as documents containing communications on the same subject between the White House staff and third parties , including Congress .
We also offered to make available for interviews the President 's former Counsel ; current Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor ; Deputy Counsel ; former Director of Political Affairs ; and a Special Assistant to the President in the Office of Political Affairs .
The President 's offer reflected his desire to cooperate and accommodate .
It was designed to provide your Committees with additional documents , and the rare opportunity to participate in interviews and question close advisors to the President about the matters under inquiry .
With the benefit not only of the enormous amount of information you received from the Department of Justice , but also additional White House documents , you would have been able to further inquire about these matters .
To be sure , the President 's offer also took care to protect fundamental interests of the Presidency and the constitutional principle of separation of powers .
Specifically , the President was not willing to provide your Committees with documents revealing internal White House communications or to accede to your desire for senior advisors to testify at public hearings .
The reason for these distinctions rests upon a bedrock Presidential prerogative : for the President to perform his constitutional duties , it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice and that free and open discussions and deliberations occur among his advisors and between those advisors and others within and outside the Executive Branch .
Presidents would not be able to fulfill their responsibilities if their advisors on fear of being commanded to Capitol Hill to testify or having their documents produced to Congress were reluctant to communicate openly and honestly in the course of rendering advice and reaching decisions .
These confidentiality interests are especially strong in situations like the present controversy , where the inquiry seeks information relating to the President 's powers to appoint and remove U.S. Attorneys  authority granted exclusively to the President by the Constitution .
The principles at stake here are of the utmost importance and find meaningful parallels in any number of other settings .
For example , Messrs .
Chairmen , I am sure you would wish to protect the confidentiality of deliberations between Members of Congress and their staff .
So , too , do I believe that most judges would be quick to stress the importance to their decision - making processes of maintaining the confidentiality of their deliberations with their colleagues and law clerks .
So , too , here : for the Presidency to operate consistent with the Constitution 's design , Presidents must be able to depend upon their advisors and other Executive Branch officials speaking candidly and without inhibition while deliberating and working to advise the President .
The doctrine of Executive Privilege exists , at least in part , to protect such communications from compelled disclosure to Congress , especially where , as here , the President 's interests in maintaining confidentiality far outweigh Congress 's interests in obtaining deliberative White House communications .
I refer you to the attached opinion from the Acting Attorney General to the President , discussing this in further detail as well as informing him as to the appropriateness of an assertion of Executive Privilege in these circumstances .
Further , it remains unclear precisely how and why your Committees are unable to fulfill your legislative and oversight interests without the unfettered requests you have made in your subpoenas .
Put differently , there is no demonstration that the documents and information you seek by subpoena are critically important to any legislative initiatives that you may be pursuing or intending to pursue .
By contrast , the President has frequently , plainly , and completely explained that his position , and now his decision , is rooted in a need to protect the institution of the Presidency .
The President 's assertion of Executive Privilege is not designed to shield information in a particular situation , but to help protect the ability of Presidents to ensure that decisions reflect and benefit from the exchange of informed and diverse viewpoints and open and frank deliberations .
Issuing subpoenas and seeking to compel the disclosure of information in lieu of accepting the President 's reasonable offer of accommodation has led to confrontation .
Consistent with the analysis of the Acting Attorney General , the President is satisfied that the testimony sought from Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers is subject to a valid claim of Executive Privilege and is prepared to assert the Privilege with respect to that testimony if the matter cannot be resolved .
However , the President has further instructed me to confirm that while unwilling to submit to subpoenas compelling the production of documents and testimony , in the absence of any subpoenas he continues to be willing to provide you with information as previously offered .
In short , the President requests that your inquiry proceed in a balanced manner , respectful of important constitutional principles of both institutions , rather than through confrontation .
It is hoped you will reconsider your present position , accept the President 's offer , and bring closure to this controversy so we may all return to more productive activity on behalf of the Nation .
Respectfully yours , Fred F. Fielding

For practically all my life I ’ve had trouble going to sleep .
I ’m not an insomniac … I just think a lot .
I ’ll lie in bed thinking about what I want to do tomorrow or what I should have done today or how much I love eating cold pizza or how absurdly messy my desk is …. you get the idea .
And when I say I have trouble going to sleep … I ’m not talking 20 or 30 minutes … I ’m talking 2 or 3 hours .
Because what will happen is after about 45 minutes to an hour of trying to go to sleep , I start thinking about how I ’m not asleep but I should be …and thus the cycle begins .
Now , I may be a bit of an extreme case here , but I know for a fact that there are others out there who have trouble going to sleep .
So , I ’ve pieced together various bits of advice I ’ve received over the past few months that have not only helps me get to sleep faster , but helps me get a better nights sleep .
Do n’t watch TV or even so much as look at a computer screen atleast 30 minutes before you lie down .
The light from both a television as well as a computer monitor mimic the same intensity of light as sunlight .
This fools your body and brain into thinking it ’s nowhere near time for sleep .
Drink milk .
Milk has an amino acid in it called Tryptophan that increase the levels of serotonin and / or melatonin in the brain which slow down brain activity .
It ’s science folks .
Go to bed when you are tired .
Different strokes for different folks here .
Just because your wife goes to bed at 9 PM does n’t mean you are ready .
You might only require seven and half hours of sleep while she might require ten .
If you are n’t tired , do something low - key until you are , like read a book , play solitaire ( NOT on your computer ) , or play with some legos .
Reserve the bed for bed things ( ie sleep and sex ) .
I for one do n’t strictly follow this rule as I ’ll read some before I go to sleep , but for some people this is a must .
Meditate .
No , do n’t cross your legs and hum , but focus on relaxing … if that makes sense .
Take deep , long breaths .
Tense each muscle one at a time from head to toe .
Focusing on doing this takes your mind off of other things and you ’ll be in lala land in no time .
Excercise during the day .
I emphasize during the day .
Excercising at night just gets everything going instead of shutting down for sleep .
But excercising during the day tires the muscles out and makes for a solid nights sleep .
These are the majority of the things I have either tried or actually do routinely .
What are some things that have worked for you ?
